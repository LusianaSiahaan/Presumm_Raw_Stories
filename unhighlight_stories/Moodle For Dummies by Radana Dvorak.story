Radana has been involved in eLearning since 1989, when her research in  human computer interaction focused on computer-based training  CBT .  She has been a researcher and a university instructor who taught in the  United Kingdom, Cayman Islands, and the United States. She has also spent  some time in the software industry. Currently, she is an adjunct professor  at Portland State University and owner of eLT Solutions LLC. Her focus is to  help organizations with the development of learning courses using learning  content management systems and integrating Web 2.0 technology to meet  the changing needs of educators, trainers, and learners.   Dedication  To my children, James and Anna, and my parents for their ongoing encour- agement and support.  Author’s Acknowledgments  I want to go back a number of years and thank three professors: Professor  Mike Sharples who supervised my master’s degree at the University of Sussex  and was instrumental in introducing me to the area of eLearning  dubbed CBT  in 1989 . His vision and dedication inspired and excited me about the possibili- ties in education. Mike Sharples is currently Professor of Learning Sciences  and Director of the Learning Sciences Research Institute at the University of  Nottingham. I want to thank Professor Peter Johnson for accepting me to the  computer science PhD program at Queen Mary, University of London, and  Professor Stephen Summerville, who was instrumental in my research interests  and supervised my Ph.D. His vision, enthusiasm, and dedication to his students  are admirable. Our discussions about AI, communicative structures transfer- ring to online communication, the future of online books and education, all pre- Web, were vital in my research and love for the fi eld.  I want to thank my Portland State University graduate students; it has  been an absolute pleasure and privilege to teach them. They are the most  dedicated and hardworking bunch of students I have ever taught. Martin  Dougiamas, the original developer of Moodle, believes that in a true collabor- ative online teaching environment, everyone is both a teacher and a learner —  this has proved to be true with my students.  That brings me to thank Martin Dougiamas for developing Moodle and the  wonderful Moodle community around the world. The developers, the dedi- cated forum helpers, and the teachers, many of whom wear all three hats, are  integral to Moodle’s success.  This book owes a great deal to the fabulous Indianapolis Dummies Tech  group at Wiley Publishing. Thank you, Kyle Looper, for believing in Moodle  and giving me the opportunity to write this book; Leah Cameron for initial  feedback and editing instructions; and Nicole Sholly, the project editor, who  spent hours ensuring this book is crafted in the For Dummies style. This  group of people is professional, nice, and a sheer joy to work with.  Finally, I am grateful for my wonderful children, Anna and James, and  indebted to them for putting up with my nocturnal working existence, blurry  eyes, and disconnected nature while trying to meet deadlines.

you’ve been thinking about putting your class online, this book takes   you from thinking to doing. Moodle  Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic  Learning Environment  is an open source eLearning software platform that  was originally developed by Martin Dougiamas. Moodle enables educators  to create online courses supporting rich interactions between educators and  their learners. Moodle enables instructors to add content and combine activi- ties into sequences that guide learners through structured learning paths.  Moodle also has also another meaning besides Modular Object-Oriented  Dynamic Learning Environment. The second meaning is more interesting: It  means a slow-paced process of enjoyable tinkering, fiddling, and experiment- ing that can lead to insight, creativity, and innovation.  Moodle continues to evolve and improve because the developers, instruc- tors, and learners find creative and novel ways to use it. Moodle is freely dis- tributed under the terms of the GPL. You can redistribute it and or modify it  under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free  Software Foundation. See http:  docs.moodle.org en License. Join  the 39.5 million Moodle users; you’ll have fun.  About Moodle For Dummies  This book is useful for instructors and trainers working in educational organi- zations or the business world who want to put their teaching content online. I  provide step-by-step processes starting with the most useful tools and activi- ties in Moodle. I use screen shots to illustrate steps, including creative and  helpful hints how various activities have been used in the eLearning environ- ment. By the end of this book, you’ll have gained the skills and confidence  to design complete interactive courses to deliver completely online or to  supplement your face-to-face classes.  Here are just some of the things that you — as an instructor or trainer — can  do with this book:   2  Moodle For Dummies                                    ✓ Find out what eLearning is all about and how to design and develop   great Moodle courses.  ✓ Discover all the things Moodle allows you to do, such as linking and   embedding Web pages as well as uploading your files in most industry- standard formats.  You can upload the create class notes, for instance.   ✓ Add collaborative tools, such as wikis, forums, glossaries, RSS feeds,   chat sessions, lessons, and multimedia content to create a rich learning  environment.  ✓ Quickly create assignments and quizzes to evaluate learners’ progress  and use the powerful Quiz module to take grading off your hands and  push results to the grade book.  ✓ Discover online grading and the grade book to simplify your classroom   life.  ✓ Discover the Moodle community to share ideas, tools, and expertise to   help you succeed — all for free!  IT staff and troubleshooters will also find this book useful because it can  ✓ Help you set up Moodle training sessions  in plain English  for personnel. ✓ Help you understand what teachers are up against. If you’re a system  administrator, knowing what teachers need can help you better serve  those needs.  ✓ Assist you with the installation and administrative tasks to get Moodle   going.  Students of all education levels use Moodle, and because this book covers  tools and features that students use in Moodle — such as blogs, profiles,  wikis, glossaries, databases, and forums — this book is also helpful to them.  Foolish Assumptions  For starters, I assume you’ve heard how online education, or eLearning, is  changing education. You’ve heard about Web academies, credit recovery,  and completing college and university courses to gain diplomas, certificates,  and degrees online. You may have possibly taken a class online. Right now,  you may be thinking, “Yes, this must be something important, and I better get  involved.” Here are some other assumptions I make:  ✓ You’re somehow involved in education and or training but don’t have   any previous experience with Moodle or other similar software.  ✓ You have an inquisitive nature and aren’t afraid of trying new tech-  nologies. You have an appetite to learn and share your knowledge.    Introduction  3  ✓ You have a computer and an Internet connection and possess the  basic skills to use them. These skills include  but are not limited to    Sending receiving e-mail messages and attaching documents to   and downloading them from e-mail messages     Manipulating word processing documents, such as Word, PDF, and   Open Docs files.    Navigating your computer hard drive or USB drive to find files   Organizing files and folders, creating new files, and saving files in   correct places on your computer  ✓ You have access to Moodle or can download it. Moodle is free, but you   may need a Moodle partner or Internet service provider  ISP  to host  your Moodle site.  ✓ You  or your system administrator  are willing to read parts of this   book to get your Moodle course up and running. Doing so doesn’t  really take too long, and you don’t need much experience with learning  content management systems to work with Moodle.  Conventions Used in This Book  To help you navigate this book efficiently, I use a few style conventions:  ✓ Terms or words that I want to emphasize or define are italicized. ✓ Web site addresses, or URLs, are shown in a special monofont typeface,   like this.  ✓ When I refer to a Moodle site, I mean the LCMS that contains all the   courses. A site can have many courses, and a site is managed by  the system administrator, or in Moodle terms, the person in the  Administrator role.  When I refer to a course that means one course, or class, contained on  the Moodle site.  ✓ When I refer to learners, I mean students and trainees. Although we are  all students when we’re learning, often this concept is misinterpreted to  refer to students in an educational organization only. Training programs  in businesses prefer to use different terms. Trainee, test exam taker, and  team participant are examples of a few terms frequently used.  Moodle user accounts have a Student role, and I use this term when I  explain a process or procedure involving the Student user account.  ✓ Numbered steps that you need to follow and characters you need to   type are set in bold.                                            4  Moodle For Dummies   What You Don’t Have to Read  The rule of thumb for this book is that you don’t need to read what isn’t rel- evant to your task at hand. Whether you have experience with Moodle or are  absolutely clueless, it doesn’t matter. Browse this book, and you’ll find just  the right starting point. Isn’t that what the For Dummies books are all about?  This book is structured modularly, so you don’t have to read the Technical  Stuff icons. If you work for an organization that has a system administrator  looking after Moodle, you don’t need to worry about the technical stuff or  anything that says Administrating Moodle. If you’re an IT guru, you can avoid  the sections on how to develop the eLearning course and how to structure  great online courses.  How This Book Is Organized  Moodle For Dummies is split into five parts and has a companion Web site.  You don’t have to read the book sequentially, and you don’t even have to  read all the sections in any particular chapter. You can use the Table of  Contents and the index to find the information you need and quickly get your  answer. In this section, I briefly describe what you find in each part.  Part I: Getting Started with Moodle  This part is a great place to find out everything there is to know about  Moodle. Here you get a bird’s-eye view that helps you understand the Moodle  world and explain what’s what to get started. You find many things you can  do with Moodle, understand what it takes to design a great online course,  and get clued in on terms like Digital Native, Generation X, and Generation Z.  This part also gets you ready to begin building your very first Moodle front  page, the first step in creating your online course. When you’re through with  this section, you can impress your friends and colleagues with your eLearn- ing skills and Moodle knowledge.  The first and most important part of creating your online class is to not get  carried away. Don’t let the cool modules  such as RSS, embedded videos, and  links to outside resources  compromise your teaching methods by trying to  impress learners and colleagues. Identify your objectives and use Moodle to  enhance your teaching methods, not alter or worse, hinder them.    Introduction  5  Part II: Creating and Managing  Course Content  I know you want to start putting your content, your know-how, and your  expertise online ASAP. This part shows you how. You’ll have something  up in no time. You find out how to add resources, such as uploading your  files to your course, creating Web pages, and linking to resources on the  Internet. I also shed light on adding video and sound files to create a multi- media-rich teaching environment, and show you how to embed YouTube or  TeacherTube videos in your Moodle Web pages. You also figure out how to  use the grade book and assessment tools to evaluate your learners’ progress  and knowledge.  Part III: Adding Activities  to Your Moodle Course  Here’s where the fun begins. You read how to use forums, chats, messages,  and blogs to engage your learners in communicating and expressing them- selves in Moodle. Moodlers believe that in a true collaborative environment,  everyone is a learner and teacher. This is where you can set up activities  and let your learners create projects, share them, and learn from each other.  Wikis, glossaries, and database tools are ideal for creating and sharing  knowledge. I also introduce you to the powerful Quiz module, which enables  instructors to create any type of quiz, worksheet, or test using multiple  choice, true false, matching, short answer, and essay questions. You can add  comments, and then Moodle automatically grades the questions and adds  the score to the grade book. You also find out how to create assignments that  learners can upload to Moodle for you to grade and record.  This section also shows you how to set up news feeds to push Web content  to your Moodle class. For example, you can bring up top stories on any topic  from the BBC or CNN, or you can push any journal or e-zine publications  right to your course front page, wiki, glossary, or database. Only your imagi- nation can stop the possibilities.  Part IV: Moodle Management  This part is all about managing your content, optimizing your files for smooth  running, and backing up your data. The chapters show you how to replicate  your course, rename it, and use it again. Put in the work once and replicate    6  Moodle For Dummies   from then on. I know how important it is to collect user reports to keep on  top of your learners or show impressive statistics to your department head,  so I reveal all this knowledge. This part also covers all the techie administra- tive aspects of Moodle and how to keep it running smoothly. Not for the faint  hearted, but with fabulous hand-holding explanations and direct references  to Moodle online documentation and links to wealth of information in Moodle  forums, you find your way even if you don’t have a technical background.  Part V: The Part of Tens  People love For Dummies books for all the extra tips, hints, and advice the  authors share. This part gives you things to think about before you jump into  building your first Moodle course, and it gives you useful, creative ways to  keep your learners involved in your Moodle course.  The companion Web site  Although I get very excited about the companion Web site  located at www. dummies.com go moodlefd , you aren’t required to visit it to be able to  create a Moodle course — everything you need is contained in this lovely  book. On the site, however, I include a few extras that you may find useful.  So, if you’re feeling adventurous, you can browse for templates, an online  course checklist, good practice and Moodle chat, forum, and blog etiquette  tips, and more.  I encourage you to visit the companion site and to contact me  radana@ eltsolutions.com  if I need to add anything else to make your life just a  bit easier. Of course, if you think it is absolutely brilliant just as it is, let me  know that, too. I will pass on credit where it’s due.  The Moodle For Dummies Cheat Sheet  The For Dummies Cheat Sheets live online at Dummies.com. To find this  book’s Cheat Sheet, go to www.dummies.com cheatsheet moodle.  The Cheat Sheet takes you on a tour of the Moodle interface, explaining mod- ules and tools along the way. You also find a list of resources  with links  that  can help get you started Moodling, provide you with support and community,  and deliver news to you about all things Moodle. Finally, I provide shortcut  keys particular to Moodle.    Introduction  7              Icons Used in This Book  What’s a For Dummies book without icons pointing you in the direction of  really great information that’s sure to help you along your way? In this sec- tion, I briefly describe each icon I use in this book.  This icon points out helpful information that’s likely to make your job easier.  This icon marks a general interesting and useful fact — something that you  may want to remember for later use.  This icon highlights lurking danger. Pay attention to this icon and proceed  with caution. But don’t worry, you really can’t destroy or mess up too much.  When you see this icon, you know that there’s techie stuff nearby. If you’re not  feeling very techie, you can skip this info.  Where to Go from Here  You picked up the book off the shelf or ordered it online, so don’t marvel at  the attractive black and gold cover, get started! If you’ve never used Moodle,  start with Chapter 1 and then read about creating successful eLearning  courses followed by creating your first front page.  If you’ve used learning content management systems similar to Moodle or  have experience with Moodle, browse the contents and then jump in where  you feel most comfortable. If you have Moodle available in your organization,  get on the phone or e-mail your system administrator and tell him you’re  ready — get him to set up a Teacher account so that you can name your  course and jump right in.    Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. There’s no such thing as a mistake when you  experiment and try something new because no matter what you do, you learn  from it. Moodle software is robust and backed up, so you can’t really corrupt  it. Now jump in and start Moodling.   8  Moodle For Dummies    Part I  Getting Started  with Moodle   In this part . . .  This part hopefully inspires and excites you so much   that you won’t be able to contain yourself and will   want to digest the whole book and start creating Moodle  courses immediately. The part begins with an overview of  Moodle and briefly explains its conventions, terminology,  and tools. After that, I discuss methods of online learning,  how to develop great Moodle courses, and how to use  Moodle to support your teaching goals. The last two chap- ters of this part contain nuts and bolts information that  gets you started building your course front page and cre- ating your first Moodle course.   Chapter 1  Discovering Moodle and   What You Can Do  In This Chapter ▶ Getting to know Moodle ▶ Finding your way around the Moodle course front page ▶ Checking out Moodle basic structure and organization ▶ Understanding resources, activities, and blocks ▶ Mastering Moodle terms and conventions  Using new software applications isn’t always easy and can even be   overwhelming if you focus on the ever-changing Internet and all the   new software and gadgets that keep appearing. When you want to use a new  software, you must think about the time  and possibly money  you need to  invest initially to set it up, and then there’s the pressure of learning the new  software. If the thought of using a new piece of software — such as Moodle —  makes you reflexively reach for a bottle of something, take a deep breath and  allow me to ease you into learning a few basics about Moodle. Before you  know it, your worries will be left behind.  I begin the chapter with a brief definition of Moodle and show you some num- bers of how many people and organizations use Moodle. Next I explain some  useful terminology and conventions to get you started and help you navigate  Moodle. Finally, I dive in to an explanation of software acronyms to allevi- ate any confusion about the space Moodle occupies in this eLearning  also  referred to as distance learning  market.  Meeting Moodle  Moodle is a large, Web-based software package that enables instructors,  trainers, and educators to create Internet-based courses. Moodle is an acro- nym for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment. Moodle    12 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   provides a robust system and an organized, easy-to-use interface for learning  over the Internet. One of the greatest advantages in sticking with Moodle is  that developers have kept the look and feel consistent over the years, and  they promise to continue to keep it consistent so that each upgrade doesn’t  feel like it’s a piece of new software.  Moodle enables educators and trainers to create online courses. Moodle’s  home page  Moodle also calls it the course front page  displays, in its basic  form a link to a list of participants  including the teacher and students , a  calendar with a course schedule and list of assignments, resources, activi- ties, updates, and news. This book explains all of Moodle features, including  online quizzes, forums, glossaries of terms, wikis, access to documents, and  links to other Web resources, and more.  Moodle is referred to as a course management system  CMS , learning man- agement system  LMS , virtual learning environment  VLE , or more recently  a learning content management system  LCMS . Near the end of this chapter,  I explain the differences among these terms and why I refer to Moodle as an  LCMS.  So why would your organization use Moodle, or why should you learn to use  Moodle? I can give you a number of reasons. Moodle is  ✓ Widely used, domestically and globally: As of January 2011, more than  39 million registered users are using Moodle. This list shows you a few  other stats  the numbers are from http:  moodle.org stats :    Registered courses: 4,303,011   Users: 40, 590, 582,899,203    Teachers: 1,190,743    Enrollments: 18,794,573   Largest site: 59,920 courses with 225,546 users   Site with most registered users: Open University 714,310  Moodle.  org has 1,030,779     Countries using Moodle: 213   Languages: 83  ✓ The largest community of users around the globe for a distance learn-  ing software: Moodle has an incredibly large and active community  spanning the globe. It has been vital to the success of Moodle, and I can  guarantee that if you post a question to the help forums, someone will  be awake, somewhere around the globe, and you will have a reply. It’s  like a 24 7 tech support group. See http:  moodle.org forums.  ✓ Based on a sound educational philosophy: Moodle is based on sound   pedagogical principals and educational philosophy, making it one of the  few LCMS that’s learning-centered instead of tool- and gadget-centered.                                             Chapter 1: Discovering Moodle and What You Can Do  13  ✓ Free: There’s no initial cost to purchase the software and no license   fees! Moodle is open source software, meaning it’s free and governed by  GNU Public License  www.gnu.org copyleft gpl.html . You may  think that nothing is free. Moodle is in that you don’t have to pay for  the software or the upgrades or license, installation, and training  what  the marketing and sales team try to get you to commit to when you pur- chase large software packages .  But in some respects, you are partially correct in thinking that everything  has a cost attached. If you add development time to build your course,  time to learn the software, and Web-hosting costs, Moodle is not free.  Understanding Moodle Basics  If you want to explore Moodle and perhaps are excited to start develop- ing your first Moodle course, you need to know a few details about Moodle  to navigate it and speak the language. The following sections help get you  started.  Creating a Moodle account and  logging in to your course  You need just a couple things to get started with Moodle:   ✓ An account with a username and password: Aren’t you glad to learn   that Moodle is secure? You need a Teacher, a Course Creator, or an  Administrator account in order to have editing privileges and create  courses.  You can contact your system administrator to set up an account for you.  If you will be responsible for looking after Moodle, refer to the discus- sion regarding roles and registration in Chapter 3 and also the discus- sion regarding Moodle system administrators in Chapter 13.  ✓ A URL: The URL depends on your organization or a third-party company   that will host your Moodle site.  If you have an account and a URL, open your Web browser  Moodle works  best with Internet Explorer and Firefox  and go to the URL. If this is your first  time accessing your Moodle site, you come to a page similar to Figure 1-1.  Next time you return to the course, either you see just the login box as  shown in Figure 1-2  or Figure 1-1  or you go straight to a list of courses on  your Moodle site with a login link in the top-right corner. You have a number  of options to log in, all quite straightforward and simple.   14 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 1-1:  The Login  page.    Figure 1-2:  Returning to  the Moodle  Login page               The Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera browsers do not show all capabilities   of the built-in HTML editor in Moodle, and there are a few issues with the Chat  module using Safari. To be safe, I recommend using Firefox or Internet Explorer.  Navigating the Moodle interface  Finding your way around the Moodle course front page is not difficult when  you understand some of the basic terminology and where things are located.  Before I begin to help you familiarize yourself with the Moodle interface, you  need to understand some terms that I continue to use throughout the book,  and the explanation in this chapter will make more sense. These terms are spe- cific to Moodle, so it’s a good idea to use them as your reference starting point.  ✓ Moodle site Moodle site front page: Refers to the Moodle software plat-  form that contains all of your organization’s courses and blocks with  utilities for managing the site. Figure 1-3 shows an example of a Moodle  site front page, which includes all the courses available on the site.  There is a login link in the top-right corner, a site calendar, site news,  and the Site Administration block. When a reference is made to a site,     Chapter 1: Discovering Moodle and What You Can Do  15        it’s available to all courses and all users in the site. Organizations usu- ally run only one Moodle site.  A Teacher or Student account would not be able to see the Site  Administration block located on the left in Figure 1-3. See Chapter 4 for  more information on user roles.    ✓ Moodle course: A Moodle course is much like a real-world course, but   online: It’s a collection of lessons, assignments, quizzes, documents,  projects, grade book, and class discussions. An instructor constructs  a syllabus, which is posted on the course front page, and students can  download instructions, upload completed assignments, and collaborate  through wikis, chats, and online forums.  ✓ Course front page: Refers to the course home page — it’s your work   space and where your learners come when they log in to your Moodle  course. On your course front page, you have more tools available to you  than your learners do. These additional tools enable you to build and  edit your course.  Click to toggle editing on off  Log in out status  Figure 1-3:  The Moodle  site front  page.       Courses available to everyone who can access this Moodle site  Site Administration block  Calendar block  Recent Activity block   16 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   A number of settings offer the instructor controls and tools to add content   called resources  and modules such as Wikis, Forums, and Quizzes  called  activities . The course front page is broken into course sections by week or  topic  there are other settings that enable you to set up the course to meet  your teaching requirements , and you can add resources and activities to  each section.  Chapter 3 goes into detail about each editing tool, icon, block, and menu.  Figure 1-4 shows what a teacher view of the course front page looks like with- out the editing features enabled. Figure 1-5 demonstrates the same page with  the editing features enabled and number of activities and resources listed  under the different sections  topics or units .  Figure 1-4:  The Teacher  view of the  course front  page.       The course front page includes blocks on the left and right sides with the  center column reserved for the course content. Blocks are tools — kind of  like containers for you and your learners. For example, you have blocks for  a calendar, search box, lists of activities and resources, participants, news- feeds, and so on. Many blocks can have links to various activities. By default,  each course front page has specific blocks, such as Participants, Latest News,  Upcoming Events, and Recent Activity. You can get more information on  blocks later in this chapter and in Chapter 3.  When you first access your course, familiarize yourself with the course  front page. Find the Turn Editing On button, located in the top-right corner,  and click it. You see your course front page come to life, displaying colorful     Chapter 1: Discovering Moodle and What You Can Do  17  editing icons, including the Activity and Resource drop-down lists appear- ing in each section. A new Block drop-down list also shows up on the right  side. Explore and familiarize yourself with what you have available.  Figure 1-5:  The editing  tools are  available.                If you don’t yet have access to your own Moodle course and want to explore  and try editing, go to the Moodle.org demo site at http:  demo.moodle. net. You can sign in as a teacher, a student, or an administrator, and you can  access courses and demos in many different languages. Don’t worry about  making any changes; the server is refreshed back to the original every 20  minutes.  Understanding Moodle terms  and conventions  Moodle uses a number of terms and specific conventions particular to the  software. In the following list, I mention and explain some of these terms and  conventions to help you ease into the book:  ✓ User: A specific participant who is allowed to enter a Moodle site. Each   user account has a specific role, which carries a set of permissions.  ✓ Roles: Roles are user accounts identifying the participants in the site   and course. Each role has a set of permissions with capabilities to inter- act with Moodle. When Moodle is installed, it automatically creates a set  of default roles — Administrator, Teacher, Non-Editing Teacher, Course  Creator, Student, and Guest — which I define in Chapter 4.                        Figure 1-6:  The Add  an Activity  drop-down  list.    18 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   ✓ Capability: Capabilities are Moodle features. Each activity has specific  capabilities and certain roles have the capabilities assigned to interact  in different capacities with the activities. For example, a Teacher role  can post discussions to the News forum, but a Student role can only  read a news forum and not post to or reply to it. Capabilities are further  discussed in Chapters 4 and 13.  ✓ Permission: Permissions are specific settings for capabilities. You have  four options: Not Set Inherit, Allow, Prevent, or Prohibit. See Chapter 13  for more details.  ✓ Activities: You can add separate, interactive learning activity modules   to your course. They are robust, and each one can be set up to work  with individual students, groups, or everyone in the course. The Add  an Activity functionality is enabled when you click the Turn Editing On  button.  See Figure 1-5.  The drop-down list appears in each section week  of your course. Many of the activities can be graded and push information  to a course grade book. The activities available are shown in Figure 1-6.  ✓ Resources: Moodle resources are types of tools that enable you to   include almost any kind of file, including multimedia files and links to  resources on the Internet. Resources include simple text pages, Web  pages including a WYSIWYG editor, IMS packages, and more. Like activi- ties, you add resources by using a drop-down list when editing is turned  on. Figure 1-7 shows the drop-down list of various resources.  Chapter 3 goes into detail about the various modules and how to use  each one.  ✓ Blocks: Blocks are container-like tools that provide specific information  or functionality. There are more than 16 types of blocks, many of which  are flexible so that you can use them for a variety of functions. For  instance, the HTML block can display a short video on the course front  page. The Blocks block appears bottom of the right column when you  turn on editing.  See Figure 1-8.     Chapter 1: Discovering Moodle and What You Can Do  19  Figure 1-7:  The Add a  Resource  drop-down  list.    Figure 1-8:  The Blocks  drop-down  list.                Clarifying Moodle and CMS,  LMS, VLE, and LCMS  Moodle continues to be referred to by a number of acronyms that may  cause confusion. You’ve probably heard of few  if not all  of these terms and  may be wondering about the differences among them. In the following list, I  describe each and highlight the similarities and differences:  ✓ VLE: A virtual learning environment is a software system designed to  support teaching and learning in a form distinct from a managed learn- ing environment  MLE , which focuses on management. A VLE usually  uses Internet browsers to deliver instructions and assessment tools,  such as quizzes. More recent VLEs include wikis, blogs, and RSS.  ✓ LMS: A learning management system  LMS  is a software system that   enables the management and delivery of online and instructor-led train- ing content to learners. Most LMSs are Web-based to facilitate anytime,  anyplace, and any pace access to learning content and administration.  You will see LMS and VLE used interchangeably.   20 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle            ✓ CMS: A content management system  CMS  is a repository for data,   where data can be defined as any type of file, such as documents,  movies, sound, pictures, and so forth. CMSs are frequently used for stor- ing, controlling, revising, collaboratively sharing, and publishing docu- mentation. Usually a CMS serves as a central repository. This is most  likely the oldest term used to refer to software like Moodle.  ✓ LCMS: A learning content management systems  LCMS  combines the  powers of CMS and LMS. An LCMS is defined as a system that creates,  stores, assembles, and delivers eLearning content that can be personal- ized. It delivers the content in the form of learning objects. Though an  LMS manages and administers all forms of learning within an organiza- tion, an LCMS concentrates on online learning content, usually in the  form of learning objects.  Because of Moodle’s extensibility and its separate modules that can be  used with individual learners, saved, and reused  wiki, database, blogs,  and so on , I refer to Moodle as a LCMS throughout the book.  An LCMS such as Moodle gives instructors, course authors, and designers  the ability to create eLearning content more efficiently. The goal of an LCMS  is to create small chunks of content to meet the needs of individual students  or groups of learners and to offer capabilities to update and change the  content as and when needed with ease. For example, traditionally, an entire  course would be developed and then adapted to multiple audiences. With  a LCMS, instructional designers are able to create content chunks that are  reusable.  The LCMS can also provide certification and tracking for individual learners  who need specific knowledge. LCMS can deliver degree courses or training  to certify for regulatory needs, professional licensure, or quality control. For  instance, a construction company using a new piece of heavy equipment can  use an LCMS to ensure that all workers are fully trained on the processes and  health and safety. The training includes certification tests employees need to  pass in order for a company to receive insurance certification. These tests,  set up as separate modules, can be easily updated or changed to support  employees’ needs  second language, learning disabilities, and so on  and  or changes made by the regulatory organizations. LCMSs are used in high  schools, Web academies, colleges, universities, and companies.  Keeping Moodle Versions Straight  I wrote this book using version 1.9.9, and it covers Moodle versions up to ver- sion 2.0  which was recently released . I have confidence that this book will  help you set up courses and teach you all you need to know for versions 1.8  through 2.0.    Chapter 1: Discovering Moodle and What You Can Do  21  The main changes in the new release are designed to give third-party devel- opers more flexibility and scalability and to integrate Web 2.0 technology.  Moodle 2.0 is still viewed as beta at the time of writing this book, which  means the changes are essentially transparent to you as the end user.  Again,  though, the material covered in the book is applicable to get you going if  want to upgrade to Moodle 2.0.     Moodle docs, which are referenced throughout the book, are for versions pre-  2.0 with notes where upgrades have taken place. Unless you’re a developer  or actively want to test the software for bugs and intend to contribute to the  development of 2.0+, I strongly recommend that you use the latest version,  1.9  which to date of publication is 1.9.10 , because as the Moodle.org site  reports, minor upgrades to Moodle 2.0 are found weekly, and patches will be  released regularly. Hence why you see versions 2.0; a month later you see 2.1;  and then 2.1.1  Moodle has been consistent with every new release, leaving the front page,  navigation, and setup pages for teachers and learners the same. For most  instructors and teachers, the main difference they will see is changes in how  files are handled in the new versions. As with any new releases, there are  bugs and minor issues, and the Moodle forums are quite hot with activities  around these issues. No doubt all minor issues will be resolved over time.    Please see the Moodle 2.0 release notes at http:  docs.moodle.org. Many  forum discussions still say there are improvements to be made and changes in  the wind. I know I will be sticking with 1.9+ versions for my teaching courses  for some time yet, though I’m excited about the future possibilities, especially  the potential for integrating third-party modules and mobile apps.  Determining Where to Host Moodle   If your organization doesn’t support a Moodle site and you cannot con- vince your System Administrator to download it for you to the organiza- tion’s server  even after you’ve tried bribery , you will have to look at other  options. In a crunch, your three options are on your computer, on your  server, or through third-party hosting. The following list highlights a few pros  and cons to help you to decide the best option for you:     ✓ Running Moodle on your computer: Running Moodle on your home   computer is not really a difficult process, setting it up doesn’t take too  long, however getting your Moodle site online is more cumbersome. If  you want learners to access your course, it’s a complex process involv- ing a Web server, and you may as well use a third party to host it.  However, if all you want to do is learn how to build a course and play,    22 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle                  then it’s a good way to start. Make sure you read the system require- ments before you download it.  To download Moodle on your own computer, go to http:  moodle. org downloads and scroll down to Moodle for Windows or Moodle for  Macs OS X and follow the instructions.  ✓ Run on your own server: If you have your own Web server, I assume  you have the skills needed to set up Moodle. Go to http:  moodle. org downloads and click the Standard Moodle Packages link.  ✓ Third-party hosting: There are few options for third-party hosting. You  may find non-profit organizations that offer free hosting for educational  organizations. For example, Key-to-School http:  www.keytoschool. com or similar organizations such as ORVSD  Oregon Virtual School  District , a free resource for online teaching learning, offers free hosting  to Oregon educators. Check with your district education office for infor- mation on similar government- and grant-funded programs.  Many ISPs support open source software and enable you to download  Moodle. You have to make sure you have Linux hosting and the ISP sup- ports MySQL. This is a good option if you have few technical skills. Most  ISPs will not provide technical support for third-party software.  If you need technical support with the third-party hosting option, I rec- ommend that you contact a local Moodle.org partner. These partners  will host, maintain, and provide a secure environment for your Moodle  site. Moodle partners are located in many different countries. Go to  http:  moodle.com hosting for a list of companies that have part- nered with Moodle.org.   Chapter 2  Designing Great Moodle Courses  In This Chapter ▶ Discovering Moodle’s origins and the teaching methods behind it ▶ Understanding diversity of your learners ▶ Choosing your instructional design philosophy and methodology ▶ Becoming an online instructor  Iknow you’re itching to start building your Moodle course. However,   before you dive in to the next chapter and start building your course front   page, I recommend taking a few minutes to learn about how Moodle origi- nated and the underlying pedagogical theory that brought instructors, teach- ers, and developers around the world to embrace it and develop Moodle  to the point where it is today. With this information, you can impress your  friends, family, and colleagues when they ask what Moodle and Moodling are  and what exactly it all means.  If you take one thing from this chapter, it should be that no matter what  technology you use to create and enhance your course, it should be based on  sound instructional design principles. Don’t fall into the trap of selecting your  media before you identify your course objectives. The medium and media  should not compromise your teaching methods to fit the technology; instead,  use the technology to enhance your teaching so you can reach and support  the learning strategies your learners have developed.  The Philosophy and Evolution of Moodle  Like with anything new you undertake in your profession that may require a  new way of working and or thinking, having knowledge about that new thing  can ease your anxiety. To help you understand how to use Moodle success- fully, I encourage you to understand its origins and the principles on which    24 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   it was built. In addition, you can benefit from becoming familiar with the new  terminology, eLearning methodologies, and the role in education that Moodle  occupies.  eLearning defined  Before shedding a light on the educational philosophy of Moodle, I need to  briefly define eLearning in case you’re new to the concept. eLearning is a  vast area in education and training that has gained much attention in the last  ten years. eLearning is an umbrella term representing learning and training  carried out using computers connected to the Internet, interacting with Web- based software. The basic tenet is to be able to learn anytime and anywhere.  In this book, you may find I use the terms eLearning, online learning, and  distance learning interchangeably. Other terms you may have heard or be  familiar with include                 ✓ Distance learning and distance education ✓ eTraining, computer-based training, and technology-based training ✓ Online learning and online education ✓ Web-based training ✓ Technology-enhanced learning  The birth of Moodle  The brain child behind Moodle is Martin Dougiamas. In his past, Martin had to  use CMS  content management system  in education, and he found it difficult  to use and not at all intuitive or supportive to meet his teaching objectives  and students’ learning needs. As a result, he decided to complete his graduate  degrees in Computer Science and Education and create something better —  he must have had a eureka! moment somewhere along the way. Combining  his degrees in education with his computer science degree, Martin developed  an online learning environment that is based on pedagogical principles and is  learning-centered rather than tool-centered. Martin’s interests in social con- structionism, which bases learning on collaboration and social activities to  create new knowledge for others to see and use, drive Moodle.   Martin and the current development teams continue to evolve Moodle by  adding new technologies and enhancing older tools and modules. One of the  strongholds close to all Moodle users’ hearts is that when enhancements  and changes are made, the look and feel stay the same for users. The simple,  familiar, and reliable user interface is transferable from older versions of  Moodle, and the familiarity of standard editing tools has made Moodle a  favorite LCMS  learning content management system  around the world.    Chapter 2: Designing Great Moodle Courses  25  Note: LCMS, LMS  learning management system , and CMS  content manage- ment system  are used interchangeably in the distance learning community. I  define their differences in Chapter 1.  From Martin’s initial work on Moodle, the following principles underpin  Moodle’s ongoing development:  ✓ Everyone is a potential learner as well as a teacher, and in a true collab-  orative environment, everyone is both.  ✓ People learn by creating, developing, and expressing something for   others to use and see.  ✓ People can learn by just curiously observing the activity of their peers. ✓ A learner-centered environment needs to be flexible and easily adapt-  able, capable of quickly responding to the needs of all participants  within it.  ✓ From the constructionism theory mentioned earlier, if you can under-  stand the essence of what others are trying to convey, you can teach in  a more transformational way.  Choosing an eLearning method  There are a number of ways instructors use eLearning to teach, enhance, and  support their course goals. You can use Moodle for any type of eLearning  you may be involved in. Generally, current eLearning courses use one of the  following three models:  ✓ Distance learning is simply defined as “structured learning without the   physical presents of the instructor.” This definition evolved from the  first Annual Conference on Distance Learning in 1989 and is still used  today.1  ✓ Blended learning is learning in a traditional classroom where instruc- tors use eLearning systems to enhance their teaching. It’s defined as  “combining online delivery of educational content with the best features  of classroom interaction and live instruction to personalize learning,  allow thoughtful reflection, and differentiate instruction from student-to- student across a diverse group of learners.” This definition evloved from  the International Association for K-12 Online Learning.2  ✓ Hybrid learning is a type of learning that’s a combination of in-class and   online teaching. In-class work is not replicated online. Hybrid learning  is often used when practicum, labs, or demonstrations are required. It’s  almost the best of both worlds and is still one of my favorite ways of  teaching.                           26 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Discovering How Moodle Can Support  Instructional Design Strategies  Learning appears to be most effective when learners are involved in creat- ing something for other learners to see or use. This is one of the strengths  of Moodle. Table 2-1 lists a number of eLearning strategies and highlights  how you can use Moodle to support them. There are many learning strate- gies, and by no means is this list exhaustive. Discussion about learning  theories and pedagogy for online instruction is not for this book to tackle   unfortunately , and because you’ve picked up this book, you may have  some background understanding and or experience and expertise in this  area. See the companion Web site for resources if you want more informa- tion about instructional design.  eLearning Instructional Strategies  Pedagogy  Description  Table 2-1  Instructional  Strategy  Lecture, pre- sentation, and  instruction  Information  transfer  Moodle Features  That Can Support  the Strategy  Lecture notes,  video lectures   upload files ,  chat, and forum  discussions  Quizzes, lessons,  assignment, and  glossaries  Lessons,  wikis, forum  discussions,  databases, and  resources  Transfer knowl- edge to learners  through interaction,  reinforcement,  questioning, discus- sions, immediate  feedback.

Guided  discussion  Illustration  Case study  Role play  Imagery   28 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Understanding Our Learners and  Generational Differences  Learners are unique: They have numerous learning styles and different ways  information is viewed and assimilated. Educational theorists have identified  many different types of learning styles that reflect how the information may  be perceived, organized, and processed.3 Learners assimilate in different  ways  visually, aurally, or kinesthetically , and some forms may work better  than others for individual learners. The neat aspect of using Moodle is that  you, as an instructor, can learn about your learners and present information  to support them using the medium in various modalities — other than kines- thetic, of course, because you would need virtual reality for that.  Perhaps  in the near future the brilliant Moodle developers will design virtual Moodle  classrooms that will support a kinesthetic preference.      If you’re new to the area of eLearning, keep in mind that your knowledge,  content expertise, and experience are the valued commodities, not the soft- ware. Do not compromise your teaching methods and let the medium drive  the content.  Moodle has provided instructors with tools and flexibility to enhance the  teaching and learning experiences, not hinder them. For example, just  because you can use newsfeeds  RSS; see Chapter 14  with Moodle, don’t feel  you need to integrate newsfeeds because other instructors are using them  or because students think they’re cool. Use newsfeeds only if they play part  in your learning objectives. Moodle is not prescriptive — it’s extensive. You  determine how you will use it with your learners. There are no limits, so put  your creativity to work, and you may find new uses for it. Moodle is where  it’s at today because of educators finding new needs and developers working  to provide new features to meet those needs.  Moodle is capable of supporting different learning types. However, instruc- tors can be trapped in designing and compromising eLearning courses by  preconceived and misunderstood ideas bandied about in the media  or from  software vendors  about generational diversity and technology uses. The  media is saturated with terms such as “generations X, Y, Z,” “digital natives,”  and “digital immigrants”  or “migrants” . Although it’s important to under- stand how the different groups may use technology and the type of strategies  they use to interact with the medium, it’s more important for you to under- stand that you don’t compromise your teaching methods and choose media  based on these generalized views.  When you’re developing a Moodle course, remember that just because a  learner may be familiar with technology and can scan, read, or send back  text at what seems like the speed of light, it doesn’t mean that the learner will  have sophisticated learning skills in a system such as Moodle.    Chapter 2: Designing Great Moodle Courses  29  Throughout the rest of this section, I define digital natives and digital immi- grates and outline some of the general patterns the diverse groups demon- strate when it comes to using and interacting with technology. Note: I include  references at the end of this chapter that can claim some of the original  research and publication in this area. This list is by all means not exhaustive,  but the list is enough to get you going if you want to research the space. The  Internet is saturated with information, including blogs, ezines, and tweets.  Digital natives  The term digital natives usually refers to learners born after 1985 to date  because they have grown up connected to some media. Although the general- ized characteristics appear somewhat accurate across the board, the group  covers far too many years when you think about the way technology has  evolved and is being used. Researchers have subdivided this group, further  demonstrating technological diversity among the generations. Here are the  main distinctions to keep in mind when designing your Moodle course:  ✓ Generation Y  born 1977–1994 : This group is technologically sophisti- cated and has learned to rely on technology, though you need to watch  these group members and not assume that they have capabilities when  it comes to Web 2.0 and eLearning.  ✓ Generation Z  born 1995–2012 : This generation still holds a lot of   unknown factors, and technology companies are having a difficult time  keeping up with its demands. This generation has also been referred to  as the i, net, quiet, and palm generation — members of this generation  are less verbal because most of their communication is through elec- tronic devices. The learners of this generation are impatient, seem to  expect immediate results, and multitask with tech devices at exceptional  speeds. They don’t like to read instructions — most jump in and get on  with it. Their expectations of technology are demanding.  This generation will take to eLearning and will push boundaries.  Generation Z doesn’t seem to understand the concept of plagiarism — if  you don’t believe this, ask any secondary school teacher about this issue!  The following list gives a summary of the distinguishing characteristics for  digital natives  born 1985 to date :  ✓ Look at graphics first, access text-based media last ✓ Are play-oriented ✓ Are always connected  ✓ Multi-task connected to at least one e-vice  electronic device                         30 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle                                       ✓ Process things at twitch speed   Twitch speed thinking  coined by Mark Prensky  is the speed of thinking  processing that is required during video games, action films, and music  videos, where viewers are exposed to “more than 100 images a minute.”    ✓ Expect immediate results  ✓ Expect information to come to them or accessible at one click ✓ Do not read instructions, especially step-by-step outlines, but jump   ✓ Do not process as linearly as previous generations ✓ Are impatient if technology is not quick enough — find something else   straight in  to do  ✓ Do not stay with tasks as long ✓ Trust the medium  ✓ Do not expect things to go wrong  Digital immigrants  The term digital immigrants describes learners and instructors born before  1985. This group has also been more affected with wars, recessions, and  changes in the workplace than digital natives. The following list briefly sum- marizes the subgroups and the impact technology had on them:  ✓ Post-war cohorts  born 1930–1945 : This group uses and likes “tradi-  tional” forms of reading and learning and tends not to like social media.  These learners require and read procedural instructions. They like  information written down on paper so they can make sense of it. This is  a group that needs encouragement, help, patience, and time. As much  as many of these learners resent the new eLearning medium, many can  absorb it when challenged to do so.  ✓ Baby Boomers I  born 1946–1954 : Born in good economic conditions,   this group embraces technology by spending money on new IT con- sumer products. The learning methods of this group are traditional as  for post-war cohorts, and the group is often resentful toward having to  change its teaching learning methods later in life.  ✓ Baby Boomers II  born 1955–1965 : This group has taken to technology  quicker than expected. Members of this group generally love technology  and have surprised the consumer market by taking to social network- ing much more readily than expected. They blog, read e-zines, and use     Chapter 2: Designing Great Moodle Courses  31  social networks; however, when asked, they still much prefer to work in  paper. Their learning methods are traditional, as with Baby Boomers I,  but they see the benefits and needs of eLearning. They aren’t as resent- ful to the changes. This group makes up many teachers, instructors,  and academics in the work force today. They’ve been the driving force  behind the development and use of information technology and spend  more money on technology than any other group.  ✓ Generation X  born 1966–1976 : Seen by researchers as probably the   best-educated group, it’s also the most skeptical group. Members of this  group are pragmatic and practical, embrace social networks, and take  to technology quicker than the preceding generations in this category.  This group’s members are not resentful to change, but instead, expect  constant change — this is what they have witnessed and experienced.  They’ve seen most change in the gaming and PC markets. Don’t assume  that learners in this group have sophisticated eLearning skill — they  don’t. They have good IT skills, and most likely have some knowledge of  eLearning.  In this list, I provide a summary of distinguishing characteristics for digital  immigrants  born before 1985 :  ✓ Process information in a linear fashion ✓ Work at conventional speeds ✓ Like step-by-step instructions ✓ Read text first and like procedural instructions ✓ Are work oriented and don’t multitask with electronic devices ✓ Are use to  and like  standalone problems and concepts ✓ Generally do not take to technology as quickly as digital natives ✓ Do not expect information to be brought to them but like looking for   information  ✓ Do not trust online environments as much and question information   more than the digital natives do  ✓ Expect things to go wrong ✓ Expect constant change ✓ In the case of the older portion of the group, do not embrace social   media  and encouragement  ✓ Also regarding the older portion of the group, need more hand-holding                                              32 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Course-Building Checklist  I spent some time in the first part of this chapter discussing how important it  is to not compromise your learning strategies, expertise, and experience to  fit into the new medium of Moodle. A better approach is to use the Moodle  modules to enhance your teaching. Moodle is built on pedagogical principles,  and the freedom it gives you should not hinder in any way what you and your  learners are trying to achieve — it should help support your goals. I outline  a number of techniques and strategies for you to consider when you start  building your Moodle course.  Some of the methods and strategies in this checklist are very basic and no  doubt are part of your syllabus. Your syllabus is a good starting point — use  it to think about how you can add to the units weeks by using the various  modules  such as forum discussions, wikis, quizzes, linking to resources, and  so on  to enhance and support what you’re trying to achieve.  One cool thing about Moodle is that you can quickly make changes and  alterations based on your learners’ needs. If you have a group that is more  advanced, or has come to your course with skills you were not aware of, you  can quickly alter your strategy to make your course more challenging. If the  group needs more hand-holding and explanations, you can link to supplemen- tary exercises, upload extra work, and rework the online syllabus in few short  steps.  Here are a number of techniques and strategies to consider before you start  building your course:  Course Starting Point — The Introduction  ✓ Has an e-mail been prepared sent to your learners informing them about   how to gain access your course?  ✓ How will learners contact you? Instruct them to use e-mail and or use   messaging in Moodle.  ✓ If this is a large Moodle site that’s part of your organization, is there   technical support? Provide learners with technical support contact —  you’ll save time if someone else can troubleshoot.  ✓ If learners need to use a different language for the browser, how will you   get the information to them?  ✓ Will you be using the news forum from day one? How will you inform   your learners to begin? READ FIRST PLEASE documents are useful,  though the younger generations may skip them altogether if they have  login info and can jump straight in.                   Chapter 2: Designing Great Moodle Courses  33                                         Course Organization and Design  ✓ Are font styles, content layout, and organization consistent throughout  the course? Do you need to follow departmental or organization proto- col and design?  ✓ Will you be using an introduction session with a syllabus and course   schedule to teach learners how to navigate your course?   ✓ Will you give any type of training and or introduction on how to use   Moodle?     ✓ Are course goals and objectives identified in your syllabus and in your   introduction unit?   Make sure that the goals and objectives in your syllabus also appear in  your introduction unit. Even the slightest omission or rewording can  cause confusion. I tend to copy pages or upload the whole syllabus just  to make sure!  ✓ Are activities and resources organized in a logical and consistent   manner as you progress through the duration of the training session or  course?   ✓ Do you use your organization’s academic calendar if you’re teaching   by term semester? Doing so avoids a great deal of confusion. If you use  topic unit organization, you can use the calendar tool and cross refer- ence it.  ✓ Have you posted dates and times for assignments to be submitted and   due dates for forum discussions?  ✓ Are objectives measureable and linked to assessments? How will you   inform your learners about how you intend to assess them? Setting up a  rubric can be useful.  ✓ Does each unit week include materials as outlined in your syllabus?   What method will you be using? Will the method be the same for each  module, or will it change from unit week to unit week? Either way is fine  as long as you inform learners when you divert from your syllabus.  ✓ Do learners know what they need to do to access the first activity and   complete it? Have you included this as part of the training discussed  earlier?  ✓ Are all assignments and quiz instructions clear? Where can learners   access instructions and guidance? Are instructions available per activity  in the intro or somewhere else? Be consistent.  ✓ Do learners know how the Assignment module works so that they can   submit assignments online?  ✓ Do learners know how to access the forum and chat? Can they learn how  to access them as part of training or instructions given when the activity  is introduced?   34 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle                                                ✓ Is the content interactive? ✓ If students are asked to respond to other students’ discussion forum   postings, are deadlines set to enable this? For example, they need to post  responses by a certain time and date in order to allow time for comments  by you and other students before the discussion forum closes.  ✓ Are learners involved in creating real-world artifacts and or involved in   real-world experiences in the online course?  ✓ What is the mixture of instructional strategies you’re providing? Do they   support learning goals?  ✓ Are you using multimedia  such as videos, audios, and podcasts ? ✓ Are students reflecting on course readings, from textbooks, journal   articles, and so on?  Involving your learners in collaborative activities  ✓ How will you engage your learners in the course? How will they collabo-  rate with other learners?   ✓ How will learners interact with the content in the course to meet learn- ing objectives? Do your learners have all the software they need?  For  example, if you upload PowerPoint files to Moodle, how will you make  sure they all have PowerPoint?  Plan for alternatives.  ✓ How will learners be encouraged to be identified and heard in the   course? Encourage the use of profiles to build their Moodle persona and  communicate with other Moodlers.  ✓ Which activity will require for your learners to collaborate or interact   with their peers? How will this be achieved?  ✓ Will learners be meeting online only? Or will they meet both online and   offline?  Course Communication  ✓ How will learners be introduced to you and each other?  ✓ Will you make available an area where learners can interact with each   other? Will it be an open, free-form area? Creating a general learner  forum is one option.  ✓ How will you set up group work or group projects to support communi-  cation? Consider using forums, chat, FAQs, and messaging.  ✓ Will learners be given the opportunity to give feedback on the   course? How?    Chapter 2: Designing Great Moodle Courses  35                             Assessment and Evaluation  ✓ Are your instructional and assessment strategies aligned with your   objectives?  ✓ Are you using a variety of assessment strategies in the course? ✓ Will you give learners access to their grades? Will you use the grade   book? Will learners be able to compare their assessment to the course  average?  Instructor Feedback  Miscellaneous  ✓ Are students provided with feedback for each activity?  ✓ When will you give feedback? How will the learners be informed that you   have given them feedback throughout the duration of the course?  ✓ Did you check about copyrights? Your course should not contain any- thing that is under copyright protection. You need written permission  to use content by the author or publisher  including scanned articles  and book chapters . You can directly link to Web resources and data- bases to which you have access. For more information on copyrights,  visit these sites:    The Digital Millennium Copyrights Act  DMCA  at www.copy  right.gov legislation dmca.pdf    Regarding international copyright, a copyright act that covers all  countries does not exist. Refer to www.whatiscopyright.org,  which provides information for educational purposes.  ✓ Will anyone other than you have access to your course? Do you need to   grand access to assistants, student teachers, guests, mentors, or par- ents? How will you protect learner information?  Busting Moodle Myths  If you’ve undertaken the task of searching the Internet for information on  learning content management systems and software to develop online learn- ing, you probably found fantastic reviews on many products  promoted  by vendors  or a lot of negative rhetoric about the whole area of distance  learning, the software, and so on. Many people, mostly those from the digital  migrant groups, have had to deal with adapting to continual changes in the    36 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   workplace due to technological changes. I believe that teaching and training  continue to be affected, more so than any other industry, and I sympathize  with the ambivalence and often the cynical stands that instructors take.  The following set of myths has been compiled thanks to help from the mil- lions of users spanning the globe.  More than 200 countries use Moodle.   No doubt you’re familiar with some of these statements and have thought  about some  if not all  of the issues presented here. You can find more myth  busting at the Moodle.org site: http:  docs.moodle.org en Top_10_ Moodle_Myths.  Myth 1: I have to be terribly tech savvy to use Moodle.  If you know how to attach a document to your e-mail, set up a Facebook or  LinkedIn account, and open a variety of files, you can start using Moodle.  Start slow, use resources to upload documents for your students to access,  and create links to Web sites. When you and your learners are comfort- able with Moodle, you can start exploring the cool tools such as discussion  forums, wikis, chat, glossary, quizzes, grade book, RSS, and so on.  Myth 2: Using Moodle effectively means being on the computer 24 7.  Not at all!! When you start using new software that’s very different from  what you are use to, and if it has many different tools, it takes a bit of time to  learn. Moodle is an online learning management system that you can learn in  stages. You don’t have to understand everything about it before you begin  using it. Start slowly and build as you become more comfortable. If you’ve  used other content management systems, the skills you developed are trans- ferable, and Moodle will be easy to use!   Realistically, you and your students need to spend time in front of a com- puter because the more you use Moodle, the less time it will take to add an  activity or a resource. Thanks to the consistent interface, adding content will  become second nature after you’ve set up a course and used the modules  regularly. Your Moodle comfort level just depends on what you use it for and  how much you want to develop a course that will ease up your time in the  long run.  For example, developing quizzes takes time, but once completed,  Moodle marks them and places results into a student grade book.   Myth 3: Moodle is not designed for my group of learners or customers.  Moodle is being used successfully in primary, secondary, and tertiary educa- tion, including in a variety of subject areas such as languages, science, math- ematics, drama, art humanities, and ESL  English as second language . It has  also demonstrated success in a wide variety of educational training programs  as well as corporate and government training settings.    Chapter 2: Designing Great Moodle Courses  37  Myth 4: Students will love Moodle because it is online.  It is important not to make this assumption. Just because you put your  courses online doesn’t mean that your students will find it more interesting,  love it more, and spend more time with the content to get better grades. As  with traditional classroom settings, you need to find ways to get students  interested in the learning activity and get them to ask good questions; when  you do so, they will become more interested in the online content. Moodle  and other LCMSs enable you to select tools to enhance your teaching methods  and your learning goals. Even digital natives, those who are so independent  when it comes to technology, will still look to you and enjoy your involvement  and feedback, benefitting from your knowledge, experiences, expertise, and  guidance. All students desire and value feedback. Making learning a valuable  experience is what drives Moodle, not trying to make it fun.    No matter how technically comfortable you are using a new LCMS like Moodle,  nothing can replace good teaching methods. You must always design courses  based on sound pedagogical principles, strive to build relationships with your  learners, and encourage your learners to build relationships with each other.  These factors remain the essence to successful uses of Moodle.  Myth 5: Moodle is just one more thing in our busy schedules that we have  to learn.  This myth is often coupled with the thought that, once your organization  gets a new head of IT  again , that person will convince the powers-that-be to  switch to some other, new Web-based educational software in a year or two.  So you’re thinking, why should I bother learning about it now?  This is a realistic concern that all instructors and supporting staff have when  any new software is introduced. However, there is a number of strong argu- ments why Moodle is a smart educational and business decision for organiza- tions. Keep reading: This info may put your mind at ease.  ✓ Moodle has been around for many years and is used in more than 200  countries. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia are in  the top ten.  The United States has the most users, and other top coun- tries include Spain, Brazil, Germany Mexico, Portugal, Colombia, Italy,  and China.   ✓ Moodle is open source software, which means it’s free to all profit and  non-profit organizations. Managers don’t have to worry about license  fees, and they face no requirements to employ someone from a com- pany to do the upgrading, fixing, training, and so on. Difficult economic  conditions have forced many companies to terminate license products,  but that has not been a problem for open source software. Well-rooted  open source software is a good business decision. Once used, there’s no  reason to switch.         38 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle                  ✓ Moodle has many features in common with other LCMS LMSs, and stu- dents will be using LCMSs in tertiary education; skills are transferable.  By offering good-quality courses and instructing learners how to use  Moodle, you are preparing them for college and helping them develop  skills if they’re already in college.  Moodle tools are so diverse that by learning how to use them effectively  in an LMS environment, you will develop skills that you can take to your  next employer. These skills will be useful if you continue in education or  need to take continuing education credits. You can continue to develop  Web 2.0 skills by experimenting and making use of the tools Moodle  makes available for instructors.  Just think how impressed your learners  will be if instead of asking them to link to specific Web sites for articles  or latest news, you set up newsfeeds so that the information will come  to them!

The second step is becoming as comfortable with it as when you stand  up in front of your learners in a traditional classroom setting and use slide  presentations, a white board, overhead projectors, and  if you’re truly old  school  a chalkboard and chalk.  I can just see the glazed look of a youngster  reading this.  This chapter gives you the knowledge and skills required to  start adding and editing content in your Moodle course.  I start by going over each functionality of your course front page and then  define and explain standard features used throughout Moodle. After that, I  shed some light on quirky conventions and how to reuse what you develop.  “Do it once and never do it again” is my Moodle motto, so in keeping with  that, after you learn how you will design and develop your Moodle course,  you can jump to Chapter 14 and find out how to clone it.    This book’s Cheat Sheet at Dummies.com lists all the functions summarized  in the tables that appear later in this chapter.  For more about accessing the  Cheat Sheet, see the inside front cover.  You will benefit from printing the  Cheat Sheet and keeping it handy when you start playing with Moodle. This  is the only thing I ask you to print, I promise. I, too, am aiming to live a green  lifestyle.   42 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Understanding Front Page Basics  This chapter assumes you have a Moodle site and a teacher, a course builder,  or an administrator account. When you or your IT administrator first set up  your Moodle course, it appears on the site front page. Chapter 4 explains the  basic course setup, course setting, and Moodle site basics. I know that this  seems out of order, but you really can start building your front page before  you do those other tasks. It’s only when you want to start getting learners in  your course that you need the deeper understanding outlined in Chapter 4. In  this chapter, I explain tool functionality and how to put tools to use in detail.  This section is here to help you get comfortable with Moodle so you can start  building your course with confidence.  Depending on how your administrator set up the site front page and your  course s , when you access it using a standard Web address  the URL , you  see a page similar to Figure 3-1. The site has a Calendar block and a News  block on the right and a list of courses in the center. If you’re logged in as I  am in the figure, you can see your username in the top-right corner as well as  a Logout link.  Figure 3-1:  A site front  page.         Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  43  If you aren’t logged in, the top-right corner displays the same link, but the  link states You Are Not Logged In  Login . Click the Login link and then enter  the username and password given to you by your Moodle administrator in  the new login window, as shown in Figure 3-2. If you’re running Moodle on  your server or using an ISP to host your Moodle site, see Chapter 13 for an  explanation on how to set up your site, course, and user accounts.  Figure 3-2:  Log in to  go to your  course front  page.       If this is your first visit to your organization’s Moodle site, you will soon real- ize the site front page layout is different from your course front page. The site  front page provides general information that’s useful to all instructors and  courses, and it may contain blocks displaying specific news items, updates,  and so on. The main area is used for listing the courses available on the site.  You may see a key icon under a course title, which means that the course  is locked and anyone wishing to access it needs the password. The courses  may also include short descriptions and the name of instructor. You can  make these changes by using the course Administration block in the Settings  subsection, explained later in this chapter, in the section “Default blocks.”  To access your course, you can either click its title or click the Login link as  discussed in the previous paragraph. Either one of these actions takes you to  the login screen shown in Figure 3-2. Entering your username and password  takes you to your course front page.  When your course is first set up and you log in, the first page that you come  to is the front page, and the basic layout looks similar to what’s shown in  Figure 3-3 although the design  the theme in Moodle-speak  may look dif- ferent. Themes are fun but not the most important aspect of your course.   Chapter 13 covers themes.  It’s up to you how you lay out and use the front  page for your learners.   44 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 3-3:  What you  see when  you first log  in to your  Moodle  course.                   In Figure 3-1, in the upper-right corner  under the course title  are a few items  that will become your best friends:    ✓ Moodle help icon: Clicking the question mark in the yellow circle takes  you to help files. This icon appears throughout all the Moodle screens,  and I discuss it further later in the chapter.  ✓ Switch Role To drop-down list: This drop-down list enables you to select  a different role to view your course as you’re developing it. Different roles  come with different functionality, as explained in Chapter 1. As a teacher,  your options are Teacher, Non-Editing Teacher, and Student.  I highly recommend that when you make any additions and changes to  your course, you view it as a student and test it by opening files, linking  to resources, and so on to make sure your learners see what you want  them to see and access. Use the same drop-down list to return to your  role as Teacher.  ✓ Turn Editing On button: Clicking this button instructs Moodle to dis-  play all editing icons so that you can make changes to your blocks and  layout and so that you can add activities and resources to your course.  Figure 3-4 shows the same front page with editing on. To turn off editing,  click the same button.    Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  45  Figure 3-4:  When  editing is  turned on,  your front  page looks  similar to  this image.          Editing Fundamentals  Moodle gives you resources to set up, edit, and maneuver almost every  aspect of your course. The editing tool icons are structured into four groups:  general, middle column  the main course section , blocks, and activities  resources. I describe each group here and show you what the icons look like.  General icons    Two general icons — the help icon and the main editing icon  both shown   here  — are used across all Moodle tools. Some of the icons will also be avail- able to your learners in activities they have permission to develop and edit,  such as wikis, glossaries, and databases.  Middle column  The middle column is the main course section. After you’ve chosen a format  for your course  weeks or topics are most frequently used , Moodle provides  you with specific tools to add, alter, and customize the main section used by  your learners. You can add a summary to the sections by selecting the stand- alone edit icon. You move sections, resources, and activities up or down to    46 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   change the order in which the course is displayed. You can hide whole sec- tions from learners or make them visible. If you set up your course by topics,  you have an extra icon allowing you to set it as the current topic. You can  also compress and display only the current topic  kind of an accordion func- tionality . Table 3-1 lists the icons used in the middle column.  Table 3-1  Icon  Editing in the Front Page’s Middle Column  What It Does Moodle opens a help window with a brief  explanation.  The edit icon, located in the upper left of each  section, is specific to adding a summary to the  particular section. Item is visible to students. If you click this icon, the  item will not be visible, and the eye will close.  Open show item  Item not visible to students. If you click this icon,  the item will be visible, and the eye will open.  You see this lightbulb icon only if the course is set  in topic format. This icon allows you to make the  particular unit the most current one. Click the up arrow icon to move your resource  activities up within the section  if you have number  of listings  or to new sections. Similar to the preceding icon, this icon moves  objects down.  These icons are available at all times, no need to  turn on editing. By clicking one square, Moodle  collapses all sections, leaving only the top one and  the one you selected to view. This is a useful func- tionality if you have many weeks or units because  it saves you from scrolling. This is available for  students also. Clicking the stacked rectangle expands all the  sections.  You can think of this rectangle as an  accordion.   Icon Name Help  Edit item  Close hide item  Make current  Move  up   Move  down   See one week  topic  See all week  topic       In the main course section, when you turn on editing, the standalone edit   icon for the summary is displayed at the top of each section, located above  the News forum and below the date or unit titles.  Refer to Figure 3-4.  The     Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  47  editing icon for the summary allows you to place content right at the top of  each section. Instructors use this space for titles with images, short instruc- tions, summaries of weekly or unit events, or highlights about any other  learning goal–related activity to draw learners’ attention.  When you click the edit icon for the summary, Moodle opens a summary  page with a Web-based editing text box, enabling you to use the space cre- atively. Don’t forget to click the Save changes button when you finish adding  content to the summary. See Figure 3-5 for a neat example of how the sum- mary is used with a history course.  Figure 3-5:  Using the  summary  creatively.       Blocks  Blocks are tools that add information or functionality. Blocks are loaded to  the left or right of the middle area of the course’s front page  refer to Figure  3-3 ; some appear by default, and others you must add. Each block has its  own functionality and is related to the course or a specific learning objective.  People, Activities, Search Forums, Administration, Latest News, Upcoming  Events, and Recent Activity are just some examples of blocks you can use in  your course. I discuss individual block functionality in detail in the “Course  Blocks” section, later in this chapter. Editing features allow you to relocate,  hide, or remove blocks. A block’s editing icons, shown in Table 3-2, appear on  each block and are particular to only that block.   48 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Table 3-2  Icon  Icon Name Assign roles  Icons Used with Blocks What It Does In specific blocks, you can add permission to user  roles.  Block is seen by your learners. Click the icon to  hide the block from your learners.  Block is not seen by your learners. Click the icon  to make the block visible to your learners.  When you click this icon, the block is removed  from the course. You can activate it again by  adding it by using the general Blocks utility that’s  available when editing is turned on. See the  “Course Blocks” section later in this chapter. Moves a block up.  If located on the left side of the main viewing area,  moves the whole block right.  If located on the right side of the main viewing  area, moves the whole block left.  Hide  Show   Delete remove  Move up  Move right  Move left  Move down  Moves a block down.  Activities and resources  Resources allow you to add content to the course, and activities are collab- orative and or interactive modules you add to the course. Both make up the  bulk of your online learning environment. You can add these modules from  drop-down lists when editing is turned on. Editing icons appear next to every  activity and resource  refer to Figure 3-4 , which allows you to make changes  by selecting the appropriate icon. Table 3-3 shows the editing icons for activi- ties and resources.    Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  49  Table 3-3  Icon  Icons Used with Resources and Activities  Icon Name Update  Hide  Show  Move right  Move up down  Move [resource  activity] to this  location  Delete  What It Does Clicking this icon takes you to the settings  or update page for the activity or resource,  allowing you to alter any aspects of it. The resource or activity is visible to learn- ers. Clicking the icon hides it.  The resource or activity is hidden from  learners. Clicking the icon reveals it.  Clicking this icon indents the resource or  activity. Right left arrows appear on an  indented resource or activity so it can be  moved back.  Refer to Figure 3-5.  Enables you to reposition your resource  or activity within the section or to another  section. After you select the arrows,  open rectangles appear throughout the  page showing where you can move the  resource activity. Click where you want to  position it. Appears when you click the move up down  arrows. Find the place where you want to  move the particular item and then click this  icon — Moodle moves the item. Clicking this icon deletes the resource  or activity. Moodle prompts you, asking  whether you’re sure you want to delete it   as a safety net for folks who have speedy  fingers .  Viewing and Updating  Participants’ Profiles  Profiles are powerful and useful tools for you and your learners. Personal  profiles give everyone in the course a real identity, and when everyone is  engaged in collaborative activities, it makes the course more personal. If you    50 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   use Moodle as part of a traditional course or as blended learning initiative,  learners and instructors get to know each other. If you use Moodle for com- plete online teaching and or training, it’s much harder to develop rapport  with your learners, and it’s harder for learners to get to know each other and  build working and collaborative relationships.  You can access profiles by clicking the Participants link in the People block.  By default, Moodle places the People block in the top-left corner of your  front page.  Refer to Figure 3-3.  The top part of Figure 3-6 shows an empty  profile with the learner’s name; country; city; e-mail; user status  in this  case, student ; and if assigned to a group, the group. This info is all set up  when the learner is registered for the course. The bottom part of the figure  shows the same profile completed with a picture, a descriptive paragraph,  and the learner’s interests. The great thing about profiles is that they  make everyone involved in the course more real. Completing a profile is  one of the first activities I teach my students when they come to one of my  courses.  Figure 3-6:  An  incomplete  profile on  the left, with  completed  one on  the right.          Notice the tabs that appear above the information about the virtual student.  The Profile tab in Figure 3-6 shows the completed information about a par- ticular learner. The second tab from left — the Edit profile tab — is where  you go to edit the profile. The user profile, with basic information  includ- ing country, city town, name, e-mail address, courses, and roles , is set by  Moodle when the learner is enrolled in a course. The remaining tabs provide  other functionality that you can use to enrich your course and help you  meet some of your course learning objectives. Read on for an explanation of  these tabs.  Learners don’t see all the tabs shown in Figure 3-6 and described in the  following sections. A student account only has three tabs: Profile, Edit Profile,  and Blog.    Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  51  Edit Profile tab  All user accounts can edit their profiles, including changing their usernames  and passwords. The following list shows you how you can edit and update  your profile. I suggest you give your learners some basic instructions so they  can personalize their profiles.  Select the participant by clicking the Participants link in the People block.    You can access a profile from anywhere that a learner’s or teacher’s profile link  appears. Moodle takes you to the Participants page, as shown in Figure 3-7. For  example, when learners add to a forum discussion, their photo, name, and time  of the submission are included in the forum. The name of the learner is a direct  link to his or her profile.  Figure 3-7:  The Moodle  Participants  page.          Click the name of the participant you want to view, and Moodle takes you to  the student’s basic profile. When you first access your or a learner’s profile,  the basic information added to register the learner for your course is visible,  with the standard Moodle smiley instead of a picture.  ✓ General Information: Click the Edit Profile tab, and Moodle takes you   to a page where you and your learners can edit the General Information  provided when the learner enrolled in the course.  See Figure 3-8.  Note  the Description field; this is where you should add something about  yourself. Encourage your learners to use this space to tell everyone in  the course about themselves and upload a picture to replace the default,  Moodle Smiley. The profile page, earlier in Figure 3-6, shows how the  profile appears when saved.   52 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle          Your students can change their passwords from the General section on  the profile page.  ✓ Description: In the Description text box  shown in Figure 3-8 , every   user account can add anything about themselves. You can add several  paragraphs, and Moodle adds a scroll bar if a learner writes a complete  and unabridged biography. If you encourage your learners to add infor- mation about themselves, make sure you set a good example by com- pleting your own profile.  Figure 3-8:  Filling out  a student  profile.         Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  53           ✓ User Picture: Add a picture by using the browse button. Using the pic- ture description field, learners can add a caption. Often some learners  do not like to display a photo of themselves, but they will upload clip art  or an image somehow related to them with a caption. Encouraging them  to use pictures and captions helps learners get to know each other.  ✓ Interests: Personalizes you and your learners. In the field, add several   words or a sentence describing your interests and hobbies. For example,  you can enter reading, music, tennis, and camping with my family. ✓ Update Profile button: Don’t forget to save changes by clicking the   Update profile button. When selected, Moodle returns you to the  Participants page.  Forum posts tab  When you click this tab from the profile, Moodle shows you a list of all the  discussion topics created by the particular learner and any replies to forum  posts. It’s an excellent overview for you to check whether a particular learner  has been active in the forums because it summarizes that person’s forum  activity.  Forums, blogs, and notes are communication tools, which I discuss in  Chapter 8.  In Moodle, blogs are accessible only through learners’ profiles — that’s  where they’re created by the learner and can be read by all the people  enrolled in your course  if permission is set to be read by other course mem- bers . Blogs can also be accessible via blog tags. For information on blogs,  see Chapter 8.  Blog tab  Notes tab  This tab allows you to add notes related to the particular learner. These  notes are not available for learners to read; they are for you and other  instructors  if you make them available to other instructors .   54 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Activity Reports tab  The Activity Reports tab  shown in Figure 3-9  provides you with infor- mation on all activities of any particular learner in your course. When you  click the tab, you’re taken to the Outline Report  which is the leftmost link  under the tabs .  Figure 3-9:  Find  information  about your  learner’s  activities on  the Activity  Reports tab.                         The Activity Reports tab includes the following links to reports:  ✓ Outline Report: A general summary of the different areas of the course   the learner has viewed.  ✓ Complete Report: Lists every part of the course a learner has visited and   whether she has contributed to the activity, such as a forum discussion. ✓ Today’s Logs: A report of all activity for the last 24 hours. This report   includes a graphical representation and detailed listing of time of  accessing activity, IP address, and so on.  ✓ All Logs: Similar to Today’s Logs, a bar graph and a listing show you all   the activity of a particular learner from the day the course started.  ✓ Statistics: A graphical representation and a table listing monthly activi- ties of resources and activities viewed and posted. It’s a useful, quick  overview.  ✓ Grade: A summary of all the learner’s graded activities for all courses in   a Moodle site. Visit Chapter 7 for details on grades and the grade book  within Moodle.    Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  55  Roles tab  Moodle enables you to view a summary of the roles the participant has  within a course. You can override and or add permissions for the particular  learner. Find more about Moodle roles in Chapter 1.  Course Blocks  Blocks provide extra tools and features to your course. Moodle enables a  number of blocks by default  refer to Figure 3-2  when the course is created,  and these blocks appear in the left and right columns of the Moodle interface.  Moodle enables you to add more functionality to your front page from the  main blocks drop-down menu, which only appears when editing is turned  on.  Refer to Figure 3-5.  You can relocate blocks or close them so that they  aren’t accessible. Read on for explanations of the blocks and how your learn- ers can benefit from them.  Default blocks  The following blocks, by default, appear on the left:  ✓ Activities: Lists all activities and resources you set up for your stu-  dents. As soon as you set an activity, Moodle lists it in this block, and  it becomes an active link to a table displaying quick access to these  activities. The links include the generic titles such as quizzes, forums,  chats, lessons, wikis, and resources. This block is a handy overview  and a quick way to get to an activity. See the section “Resources and  Activities,” later in the chapter, for even more details.  ✓ Search Forums: A search text field enabling you and your learners to   search all the course forums for a word or phrase. This block supports  simple searching, such as typing words with spaces. For exact matching,  use a plus sign  + . For an exact phrase, use quotation marks around the  phrase “like this”. Click the Advanced Search link if you want to use a  more sophisticated search. This block is useful if you have many forums  and many learners using them. I tend to position the Search Forum block  below the Administration block on the left.  ✓ Administration: Soon to become your Moodle best friend! This block is  where you can find tools for managing your learners, enrollment, your  course setting, access your files, and more. The majority of the tools are  visible only to you, and your learners get to see just two tools: Grades  and Profile. Table 3-4 lists all the tools and icons and gives a short expla- nation for each.            56 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Table 3-4  Icon  Tool Turn Editing On  The Administration Block Tools  Functionality Functions the same as the button at the top-right  corner of the front page. Moodle adds it here for  easy access to minimize scrolling. Enables you to set up your course to make it  appear just as you want for your learners.  Roles are assigned in two contexts: site and  course. The strength for course roles is being able  to add or take away permissions for activities. See  Chapter 4 for a detailed explanation. All your learners have access to their grades. This  link takes you to the grader report and takes your  learners to their grades. There are two parts to  this: grades and grade book. Grades are the mark- ing you set for your activities. The grade book is  a container, an archive where all the grades and  feedback are stored. See Chapter 7 for details. Enables you to create groups of students within  your course. You can do this globally or per activ- ity. See Chapter 4 for more information. Enables you to back up your course or part of the  course. See Chapter 14 for more info.  Restores your backup. You can rename it and  copy it to another course in Moodle. Chapter 14  provides a thorough explanation. A tool for importing activities, reports, logs, and  statistics from other courses.  Enables you to remove all user data from a course  while retaining your activities and resources. See  Chapter 14 for details. Gives you access to all user data, reports, logs,  and the activities learners accessed. See Chapter  14 for more information. Takes you to your question pool, where you can  create quiz questions or add them to your existing  quizzes. Chapter 11 has more details.  Settings  Assign Roles  Grades  Groups  Backup  Restore  Import  Reset  Reports  Questions    Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  57  Icon  Tool Files  Unenroll Me  Profile  Functionality Takes you to your files folder, where you can  move, upload, delete, and modify files.  An option to unenroll students from a course.  Depending on how enrollment and permission are  set up, by default, students don’t have the option  to unenroll. One of the two tools accessible to student  accounts. See the earlier “Viewing and Updating  Participants’ Profiles” section for more details.  ✓ Course Categories  or Courses : The Courses block lists the categories   and or courses in the Moodle site. This block enables you to move  among the courses. It’s useful to your learners if they are enrolled in  more than one Moodle course because they can quickly navigate among  the courses.  The following blocks, by default, appear on the right:  ✓ Latest News: Posts made to the News Forum are highlighted in this   block, including a link to access the older news postings. Moodle is set  up to show three latest news item. You can change this to display more  or fewer new items: In the course Administration block on the left, click  the Settings link and then click the News Items to view the latest news  posted to the news forum.  ✓ Upcoming Events: When you post an event to the calendar  available as   an additional block; see the following section  and when you set dates  in activities such as assignments, the events are listed in the Upcoming  Events block. The listing is a link to the event as well as a useful  reminder for your learners. Moodle provides so many different modules  listing deadlines, your learners won’t be able to find an excuse.  ✓ Recent Activities: This block lists the activities you post as well as the   updates you make to the resources or assignments.  Additional blocks  When you turn on editing  by clicking the Turn Editing On button at the top- right corner , the Blocks drop-down list appears with several utilities you can  add  many of them very useful and which I use regularly . I describe each in  this list:               58 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle                                 ✓ Blog Tags and Blog Menu: See Chapter 8 for details on how the Blog   Tags and Blog Menu blocks are displayed.  ✓ Calendar: I always enable the Calendar block as soon as I set up a   course and move it up left or right side, so learners can easily see it.  As soon as you set up an activity or a resource, it gets listed in the cal- endar. An administrator can create calendars to be listed on the site  front page informing all users about events related to all courses. For  example, if the site administrator will be running maintenance on the  server and there will be a certain period of time when users won’t be  able to log in, the date s  and time s  can be listed in the site calendar.  Instructors  those with the Teacher role  can also enable one or more  calendars for their courses. Events can be exported into other calendars  or software programs.  After enabling the calendar, the following tricks can help enter listings:   Color coding: Notice the color-coded key used for events listed for   everyone in a course, for groups, and for users only.    Adding entries: To add an entry to a day  remember: due dates   on activities are automatically pushed to the calendar , click  the month. The month is a link that takes you to a full calendar  view page.    Adding events: When you click the New Event button, Moodle takes   you to a new window. Follow the instructions — the fields are  straight forward. Make sure you click the Save Changes button on  the last screen.  ✓ Global Search: The Global Search block provides user with a search   input box that searches the complete Moodle course. Advanced search  features are available.  ✓ HTML: Use this block to create your own unique block for the front  page. By using the HTML capabilities, you can add media  such as  images, video, and sound . You don’t have to give the block a name; you  can leave it totally blank and just add an image.  ✓ Loan Calculator: A basic calculator enabling your learners to calculate   interest rates.  ✓ Mentees: This block enables an instructor to set up mentor roles and  gives mentors quick access to their own profile pages. Mentors can be  anyone who has a relationship to your learner — for example, a parent,  industry supervisor, or really anyone working with a learner who may  want need access to the Moodle course. The block becomes activated  only when the mentor role is activated. This particular role must be  assigned viewing permission and then assigned to the student account  he or she will view. See Chapter 4 for more detailed explanation.                     Figure 3-10:  Including a  Quiz Results  block in  your course.     Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  59  ✓ Network Server: This is an admin functionality you may have permis-  sion to enable. It allows learners to access different Moodle sites to  enroll in a course.  ✓ Online Users: This block shows a list of all users logged in to your   course. The list is refreshed every 5 minutes. You can enable and delete  this block, though if don’t have administrative privileges, you can’t  change the time setting for refreshing the list.  If part of your assessment is looking at how long students are viewing  your course material, a good check is to look at log files and reports and  view the activities students have accessed. Just looking at whether they’re  logged in is not a conclusive measure of being an active participant.     ✓ Quiz Results: This block enables you to choose a quiz  there must be  a quiz in the course for this block to be enabled  and show the highest  and or lowest grades on the front page. After you bring up the block,  you need to select the Editing icon and configure the block. You can  select the quiz  if you have more than one in the course , how many  highest lowest grades to show, whether to show the grades anony- mously, and the format of the grades  percentages, fractions, or abso- lute numbers . Figure 3-10 shows the editing screen  on the left  and  how the block is displayed when configured.  ✓ Random Glossary Entry: You can use this block with your glossary to  randomly show various entries. You can also use this block editing text  box for other goals such as an image or a quote of the day. The block  entry changes every time the front page is refreshed. For more informa- tion about the glossary, see Chapter 9. Note that you need to configure  the tool by using the edit icon and completing a number of fields. ✓ Remote RSS Feeds: This tool enables you to add newsfeeds from  external resources, such as Web sites, to show up in your Moodle  course front page  or site . You can add news headlines, journal article  releases, recently added documents, and so on. When you enable this  block, you’re given a link telling you to configure it. Follow the Moodle  instructions.   60 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle         ✓ Section Links: This block enables you and your learners to quickly   access week or unit sections in your course. Whether you set up the  course by weeks or topics, the numbers that appear in this block act  as links to the particular sections. This block is useful if you have many  topics. I tend to use it over 10 weeks of units. If you make use of this  block, it works best to move it up, so it’s clearly visible. I tend to posi- tion it right under the People block.  ✓ Tags: Anything tagged in your course glossary or blog appears in this  block. It can be overwhelming and messy, and I recommend that if you  use tags, use them for blocks or glossary entries only.  Moodle has few other useful blocks you can download by visiting the  http:  moodle.org modules and plugins database. Some of the blocks  that have been added include: YouTube, Flickr, Side Bar, Progress Bar,  Unanswered Discussions, and Simple Clock.  Resources and Activities  Resources and Activities are two unique utilities, each providing you with  a different set of tools to help add content and interactive modules to your  course.  The Activities block, located on the left side of the course front page, lists  all the activities and resources you set in your course. When you add a new  activity or resource to your course, Moodle adds it to the list in the block.  The activity or resource is listed with the icon representing and name repre- senting the module. The name of the module is a direct link to the activity or  resource. When you first begin setting up your course, you see only the news  forum listed; as you add Resources and Activities, the list will grow.  When you want to add resource or activities to your course, turn on editing,  either from the Turn Editing On button at the top-right corner of your front  page or from your Administration block, Moodle enables all editing features  and opens the Resources and Activities drop-down lists — both shown in  Figure 3-11 — in each section week of your course.     ✓ Resources: When people in the Moodle community make a reference to   Moodle resources, they mean content that you can create within Moodle,  link to on the Internet, or upload files  such as PDFs, Word documents,  spreadsheets, PowerPoint files, video, and sound . Chapter 5 discusses  how to add resources to your course. All resources are depicted by the  icon shown in the margin and are listed in the Activities block. Figure 3-11  shows the resources you can add to your course through the Resources  drop-down list.    Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  61  Figure 3-11:  The  Resources  and  Activities  drop-down  lists, and the  Activities  block.             ✓ Activities: The drop-down list includes all the interactive and collabora-  tive modules that you can add to your course. When you first set up  your course, all you see are the default blocks and the News Forum. The  drop-down list lets you explore and add collaborative functionality that  makes your course stand out to the learners as more than just static  content. Making good use of these modules engages your learners and  enables you to meet your instruction goals using various modes of inter- activity. Activities are covered in depth in Part III.  Unlike the resources, which are all grouped and listed in the Activities  block under one icon, clicking the icon for an activity in the block  see  Figure 3-11  leads you to a list of the particular activity. The icons are  also used in the week or unit sections within your course. Familiarizing  yourself with them helps you maneuver through your course with ease.  Understanding and Implementing  Moodle Conventions  Moodle uses specific conventions, icons, and fill-in fields throughout all its  tools and features. The most common and oft-used of these conventions —  the Moodle Help system and the settings for resources and activities — are  ones that you may want to continue to reference, so I discuss those here.  When you become a regular Moodler, these will become second nature.  Developers of Moodle have kept to the same layouts for every version, which  makes you quickly fall in love with it, knowing that after you learn a way of  doing things, it won’t be changed — thank you, development team!  Moodle Help system       Wherever you see the help icon, you can click it to open a small help window   defining or briefly explaining the term or functionality.   62 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Resources and activities settings  Each of the setup pages for all activities and resources has several groups,  each containing any number of steps, always ordered in the same sequence.  The following sections summarize the settings and explain some of the con- ventions. You see these setup pages when you set up a resource, such as  linking to a file, or an activity like a forum discussion or a quiz.  General settings The General settings are shown in Figure 3-12. Each setup page requires you  to enter a name in the field, a summary  which I recommend because the  summary is listed in a table when learners access the activity or resource  from the activity block , and then content. Specific activities have other set- tings particular to the activity, such as setting dates  for instance, for a chat  or forum discussion  or linking to a Web site or file.  Figure 3-12:  The  standard  Moodle  general  settings for  resources  and  activities.       Window settings The Window settings, shown in Figure 3-13, enable you to set up your new  activity or resource in a new window or the same window. If the activity or  resource opens in the same window, select the check box to show course  blocks enabling learners to navigate back. Often when learners have finished  with the activity or resource, they close it by clicking the red X in the top- right corner. In Moodle, this action closes the Moodle session, and learners  have to log back in.    Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  63  Figure 3-13:  The  standard  Moodle  window  settings for  resources  and  activities.       Unless pop-up windows are blocked by your system administrators, I recom- mend opening the resource or activity in a new window. When you select  New Window from the drop-down list, Moodle lets you select a number of dif- ferent options. If you aren’t sure what to pick, leave the default settings; they  work well!     If your system administrator has blocked pop-up windows, try anything,  including bribery, to get him to enable them for your Moodle site. Take up  the issue with him. The pop-up windows will help you structure the course  and help your learners to use and navigate the course with ease. You have a  number of choices when you enable a new window and you can make your  selections depending on your needs.  Parameters The Parameters section, shown in Figure 3-14, contains advanced features  that you most likely won’t use. The parameters are useful when you want to  send data about your learners and course to another site. For example, you  may want to send information about your learners from your Moodle site to  another schools server, which will give learners access.  If the parameters aren’t displayed, click the Show Advanced button on the  right. Next select the options you require. Depending what the server is  requiring, you can choose it from the drop-down list. For example, you just  may need the learner’s e-mail address, or you may need a combination of  e-mail address and learner ID. Moodle provides you with every exception pos- sibly required, and you can use up to five. There are 30 parameter type entries  that you can use.  Table 5-1 lists the most widely used parameters. You can  see the remainder by opening the Choose Parameter drop-down list.    64 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 3-14:  The  standard  Moodle  Window  settings  for param- eters and  Common  Module  Settings.                         Common Module Settings Most resources and activities include these items  refer to Figure 3-13 :  ✓ Group Mode: If groups are set up at the course level, this option is avail-  able. Moodle by default enables activities by group setting if forced is  turned on and set to Yes. If set to No, group selection can be set to one  of three levels:     No Groups: Every setting is same for all groups  for example,   assignments are submitted in one area .    Separate Groups: Students carry out task or activities in separate,   designated groups.    Visible Groups: Students can choose to associate with a group or   see other group activities.  ✓ Visible drop-down list: Enables you to hide or show  eye closed   opened  and activity or resource. For example, you can set up many  activities and resources but choose not to make them visible to learn- ers until you’re ready for the information or activity to be presented —  planning ahead!  ✓ ID Number: ID setting is useful if you have many activities and   resources. It is easier to track in log files, grade book, or exporting  them to spreadsheet. If you decide to use ID numbers or combination of  numbers and characters, either use a standard system used within your  organization, or make up a logical system that’s easy to understand and  identify. If you’re using grade calculations, you’ll be required to set up  an ID. You can leave this field blank.    Chapter 3: Building Your Course Front Page  65  Common Module Settings are also used in resources and activities, but they  don’t include all the options for both. For instance, group settings are not  used in resources, and parameters are not used with activities.  Password settings Moodle developers understand that you have to deal with far too many pass- words, so wherever you may want to use a password, you see a check box.  When you select this check box, Moodle reveals the password you set. This  must be one of my most-loved setup functions because I have no need to  keep a spreadsheet of passwords ever again when working with Moodle.   66 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle    Chapter 4  Creating Your Course  In This Chapter ▶ Setting up your course on a Moodle site ▶ Mastering registration ▶ Adding learners to your course and keeping them there ▶ Understanding everything about Moodle user roles ▶ Creating groups ▶ Letting everyone know your course is ready ▶ Setting up PayPal so you can charge for your course  When you’ve created your Moodle course and you have the beginnings   of it ready to go, you can start announcing it to the world  or your   organization  and get learners into your course. Teacher and Course Creator  user accounts have permissions enabling you to structure and make changes  to the Moodle default course settings. This chapter helps you enroll learners,  set permissions, and get the word out. I also explain a few basic settings that  can help you organize and deliver a fabulous course.  For this chapter, I assume that you           ✓ Have a Moodle site running on a hosted server, or you have access to it   through your organization or educational establishment.  ✓ Your course has been set up. ✓ You’re ready to structure your course to meet the needs of your learn-  ers and achieve your teaching goals.  If you don’t have a site and or course set up, please go to Chapter 3 and  Chapter 13, where I tell you how to get your own Moodle site and walk you  through adding your first course. This chapter guides you through only some  of the site settings.   68 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Exploring the Front Page Settings  and Enrollment Options  To access the course front page settings, click the Settings link in the  Administration block  located on the left side, as shown in Figure 4-1 .  Moodle takes you to Edit Course Settings page. These settings enable you  to decide how you want things to appear to your learners and structure the  course layout to meet your learning objectives. In the following sections,  I describe these settings  in groups, as they’re divided on the Edit Course  Settings page  so that you can make changes if you don’t want to keep the  Moodle default settings.  Figure 4-1:  The basic  layout of  course  front page,  with the  Administra- tion block  on the left.                As you look over these settings and make changes, remember two things:  ✓ When you’re done, click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the   Edit Course Settings page.  ✓ Any field marked with an asterisk is a required field, and you must fill   it in.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  69  General     This is the largest group on the Edit Course Settings page. The following list  describes each setting  as shown in Figure 4-2 :  ✓ Category: Categories are set up by the site administrator. They can help   instructors and learners quickly find their courses if the site is large.  The Moodle default category is Miscellaneous, and your site admin may  have a list to help structure and organize the site. For example, a uni- versity Moodle site may be organized by schools  for instance, medical  school, business school, dental school, and so on  or departments  such  as math, science, engineering, humanities, and the like . If you have a  Teacher or Course Creator user account, you will not be able to create  new categories or change the names unless you have Administrative  capabilities.  If you want to change category names and create new categories, go to  the site Administration block and click Courses. As mentioned previ- ously, you need to have an Administrator user account or privileges  added to your Teacher or Course Creator account.  ✓ Full Name: Enter the full name of your course as it may appear in a   course catalogue, such as Moodle 101 in Figure 4-2. This is a required  field.  ✓ Short Name: Enter the short name as used by your organization, such as   MD101. This field is also required.  If you don’t have a specific short name, make one up! Moodle won’t let  you set up the course without a short name. The short name will appear  in the navigation bar.  ✓ Course ID Number: Enter the unique course alphanumeric ID.   This field has a variety of uses, and it can be left blank. It’s mainly set up  in case an organization has a unique identifier for each course and needs  to synchronize the IDs with backend data systems used for courses and  enrollments. Students don’t see ID, but if they need to see it because it’s  listed in a catalogue, you can use it as part of the course short name. ✓ Summary: The summary appears on the course listing page for your   learners to see. Enter a sentence or short paragraph depicting the  nature of your course.  ✓ Format: Moodle allows you to set a course format to support your teach-  ing requirements. The drop-down list gives you a number of options:   Weekly Format: This is one of the most popular formats, which   allows you to specify start and end dates and any number of weeks  you want the course to run.                              70 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 4-2:  The Edit  Course  Settings  page.                    The course dates will be listed based on the course start date you  enter, with the current week highlighted. This format is useful if  you structure your course by your organization’s academic calen- dar and your learners move at a similar pace. Figure 4-3 shows an  example of this format  on left .    Topics Format: With this format, the course is organized by topics or   units, and you choose how many topics you want to structure the  course. The right side of Figure 4-3 shows an example topic outline.  This is a useful format if time is not a constraint and some topics  have more activities or take longer and or build on knowledge  from previous topics. Moodle adds numbers for topics, which  you can change using the front page editing tools described in  Chapters 3 and 5.    Social Format: The main focus of the social format takes on the  structure of one main forum discussion. This format isn’t often  used for courses, but it’s used to create departmental or organiza- tional discussions around issues. For example, one school district  used a social format to involve teachers in a discussion on training  needs and training courses. Check out Moodle Lounge, an open  forum to chat with other Moodle users at http:  moodle.org  course view.php?id=55, http:  moodle.org to see how this  format is being used.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  71  Figure 4-3:  Course front  page show- ing a weekly  format.                     LAMS Format: LAMS stands for Learning Activity Management  System. This is an open source format that has been used for a  few years by instructors. The system uses a Flash-based author- ing environment. Moodle developers integrated the LAMS format  so that instructors can incorporate LAMS-based activities into a  Moodle course, benefiting from Moodle tools. LAMS is not widely  used because it is a bit dated. Instructors and organizations are  adopting Moodle or other similar open source content manage- ment systems or Web 2.0 tools.    SCORM Format: SCORM stands for Sharable Content Reference   Model. SCORM and AICC are standard content packages that are  used by a variety of applications that support the format. Moodle  enables you to use this package either as a complete course  format or within individual activities. For example, if you set up a  complete course with Adobe’s Articulate, you can use the SCORM  format and make it available on your Moodle site. For more infor- mation, go to http:  docs.moodle.org en.  If you use the entire course in a SCORM format, your learners can’t  interact with the Moodle tools. It makes more sense to create  SCORM activities.    Weekly Format, CSS No Tables: This format is very similar to the   weekly format without the table layout. You get more flexibility for  displaying variety of activities. Older browsers may not be able to  display this format.  ✓ Number of Weeks Topics: Choose the number of sections from the   drop-down list.      72 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle                                     You use this drop-down list only with topic and weekly formats. Ten is  the default, and you can choose up to 52. You can add sections as you  find the need. Moodle adds any new section to the bottom of the list.  ✓ Course Start Date: Specify the course start date. If you’re using a weekly   format, the start date appears in the first week. Choose your date to  coincide with the date that you want logs to start and your course to be  visible to students. If you set the date after you want the learners to see  sections, they will be unable to view them.  ✓ Hidden Sections: This function enables you to display a collapsed sec-  tion to your learners, showing them the unit title.  I suggest you leave the default setting  Hidden Sections Are Shown in  Collapsed Form  unless you want to hide the topic completely because  each activity and resource can be hidden.  ✓ News Items to Show: From the drop-down list, select how many news   items you want to show in the News block that appears on the front  page  right side column .  ✓ Show Gradebook to Students: Use this drop-down list to determine   whether your learners have access to their grade book.  By default, Moodle enters a grade for every graded activity that is dis- played to the learners from the Grades link on the course front page.  Unless you have a particular reason for not wanting learners to see their  grades and class average, I suggest you allow learners to view their  grade books.  ✓ Show Activity Reports: Displays all Moodle activities to learners.   Similar to the reports available to teachers from the Administration  block, if you enable the activity report for students, they can view all of  their own activities. Unless you have a particular learning objective for  the learners to view their Moodle participation  for example, you can get  them to chart, graph, use spreadsheet from the data obtained , I don’t  suggest enabling this feature. These log reports can place an extra load  on the server if you have a large number of learners enrolled in your  course. You may even find yourself battling your system administrator  on this one.  ✓ Maximum Upload Size: This option limits the size of files your learners   can upload.  You should know how much space your course has and then set this  option appropriately. Making this option much smaller than system  allocation is wise. Beware; students will use up space quickly when they  realize they can do exciting things with their projects and upload video  files and sound files.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  73  ✓ Is This a Meta Course? This is purely an enrollment functionality, mean-  ing a meta course automatically gets students enrolled from one or  more courses. A meta course in Moodle is a course that is linked to any  number of other courses to ease registration. See Chapter 13 for more  information.  Enrollments  The Enrollments settings  shown in Figure 4-4  enable you to make decisions  about the people who enroll and what they can see and do.  ✓ Enrollment Plugins: Moodle has various plugins, including internal   enrollment and PayPal to manage the course enrollment.  This concern may be taken off your hands if the system administrator  controls the enrollment; in that case, just leave the default. You can find  more details on enrollments later in this chapter and in Chapter 13.  ✓ Default Role: Allows you to set a default login roll for everyone that’s  enrolled. Moodle sets this to Student, and I strongly recommend that  you leave the default if you and your administrator want any control  over your course.  ✓ Course Enrollable: You have three options: No, Yes, and Date Range.  If you select Yes to allow self enrollment, the grayed out Start and End  Dates become active, and you can set the range as required.  This setting has no effect if users are enrolled using an external  database.                       Figure 4-4:  Course  Administra- tion Block:  enrollments,  groups, and  availability  options.     74 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle                             ✓ Enrollment Duration: This function sets how long a student can be   enrolled in the course, not how long self enrollment is available  as many  instructors believe . Another way some people use this setting is to  automatically unenroll students from a course instead of deleting them  manually.  Be careful about how you set this; for example, if you set it for 28 days,  all students will be locked out of your course after the duration. If you  aren’t sure what to select, leave the default setting.  Enrollment Expiry Notification  Use the Enrollment Expiry Notification settings  refer to Figure 4-4  if you  want users notified when their enrollment is about to expire. You have just a  few things to adjust here:  ✓ Notify: Select Yes from the drop-down list if you want all other regis-  tered users, other than student accounts, notified.  ✓ Notify Students: Select Yes from the drop-down list if you want students   ✓ Threshold: From the drop-down list, select how many days prior to the   course expiration date the enrolled accounts should be notified.  notified.  Groups  Moodle enables you to set up groups for your course or any activity and  assign any number of learners or teachers  or other user accounts  to the  groups. For example, if you teach three different sections of the same course,  you can set up three different groups, or you can assign groups to participate  in different forum discussions. I explain groups in more detail later in this  chapter in the “Managing Activities and Projects with Groups” section, but  you see the following two settings here.  Refer to Figure 4-4.   ✓ Group Mode: You have these three choices:     No Groups: You have one course with no groups for activities.   Separate Groups: Groups see and participate in only their own   group. Other groups are invisible.    Visible Groups: Each group member participates and works in his   own group but can also see other groups’ work. For instance in  Forums, everyone can see groups’ postings, but can post discus- sions and replies in only their own group.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  75  ✓ Force: If you force groups, you don’t have to set up groups in specific   activities, and you can assign learners to specific groups. See the section  “Managing Activities and Projects with Groups,” later in the chapter, for  details on creating groups.  Availability  The Availability settings  shown in Figure 4-5  determine the availability for  registered users and guests.  ✓ Availability: Enables you to hide your course or make it available to stu-  dents. If you’re making it available, I recommend that you set an enroll- ment key.  ✓ Enrollment Key: Select any alphanumeric key. Anyone who wants to   view your course needs this key to be able to access it. One nice Moodle  feature is that if you forget the key, you can select the check box, and  the key will be displayed.  ✓ Guest Access: Determine whether guests can access the course. Using  the drop-down list, you have a choice of letting them in needing a key,  not needing a key, or not letting guests in at all. Guests can only read  content; they can’t interact or add to any activity.  ✓ Cost: If a payment gateway has been added as an enrollment plugin,   you can set the cost in the field, and students have to make a payment  before they can enroll in the course.                    Figure 4-5:  Control  course  availability.     76 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Language  Select an option from the Language drop-down list if you want to force a lan- guage. If you force the language of the site, the Moodle interface is presented  in that language, and students can’t change languages within personal pro- files. I recommend you accept the default setting  Do Not Force  shown in the  preceding Figure 4-5.  Role Renaming  Moodle enables you to rename roles in your course. For instance, instead of  Teacher role, you may want to change it to Instructor, Tutor, or Facilitator.  The Student role can be named Participant, and Non-Editing Teacher can  become Mentor or Substitute. Moodle allows you to change role permis- sions for most of the roles in the course. See the later section, “Implementing  Moodle Roles and Course Permissions.” Note that the default role names, as  they appear in Figure 4-5, may have been changed at the site level by your  Moodle administrator. Even if they’ve been changed already, you can still  change the names for your course.  Adding Learners to Your Course  The methods to enroll learners in your course fall into two categories:  manual registration and self registration. The Manual method is part of the  Administrator role, a responsibility that falls to the Moodle administrator.  If, however, you’re wearing both hats, instructor and administrator, you can  review enrollment in Chapter 13.  Enrolling learners through self registration  In this section, I take you through the process of self registration, which  Moodle refers to as internal enrollment; it’s the default setting in Moodle.  Using this method is the most efficient and effective way to get learners into  your course.    What URL that you use for Moodle depends on how your organization or   Internet service provider has it set up, and it can take any number of forms.  For example, it can look like http:  nameoforganization.com moodle  or http:  moodle.nameoforganization.org.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  77  Testing your course  When you’re in the middle of creating a fabu- lous course for your learners, you need to have  learners in your course. At this point, you may  be asking yourself,  ✓  Will  learners  be  able  to  navigate  my    ✓  Will learners read the right information to   course?  start?   ✓  Are my instructions for assignments and   quizzes easy to understand?  These are all great questions, and the only way  you can answer yes to all of them is to get a  few students to test your course. Run a minipilot  session, observe your students, and get feed- back. Your test students can be previous stu- dents; students from your current courses; or if  you’re setting up training sessions, a colleague  or two. Rounding up testers who will do a com- plete run-through of your course and give feed- back is a valuable exercise, and it will put your  mind at ease. To prevent self-induced panic,  just be sure to set all this up with plenty of time  for testing before you launch your course.  Give your leaners these instructions to follow to self enroll:  1.  Go to the Moodle site URL  Web address  provided by the system   administrator or instructor.   A screen appears, asking whether you’re returning to this site or it’s  your first time here. See Figure 4-6.           Figure 4-6:  Moodle  login page.     78 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   2.  Click the Create a New Account button on the lower-right side of the   screen.   The New Account page appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.  Figure 4-7:  Creating  a new  account.                               3.  Choose your username and password.    With Moodle versions 1.9.7 and higher, your password has to be at least  eight characters long and include at least one lowercase letter, at least  one uppercase letter, at least one digit, and at least one nonalphanu- meric letter  such as %, , *, or ! .  4.  Fill in the remainder of the fields, making sure your e-mail address is   valid.   Note that all these fields are required in order for you to successfully  create an account.  5.  Select the Create My New Account button. 6.  Log in to your e-mail account.    You should receive a confirmation within a couple minutes of submitting  the Create My New Account form. You must click the link in your e-mail,  which confirms your registration and takes you to the Moodle site. You  also receive a default Welcome message.  The Welcome message that learners receive is standard, and you need  administrative permissions to make changes to or disable it.  When self enrolling, your learners may either enter your course, or enter  your organization’s site front page. If they enter the organization’s front page,  a number of courses may be listed. New learners need to select your course     Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  79  from the list. Most often, a pop-up window appears because the learners  need a key to enter your course.  I highly recommend requiring a key, or  you may never know who is in your course!  The learners can enter the key  into the pop-up window. After entering it, they are automatically registered  for your course. This is a one-time procedure. Next time they come to the  course, they will need to enter only the username and password.  If your course doesn’t require a key, the learners will be directed straight to  your course. They will be required to enter their username and password  every time they revisit the course.  If you set a key for your course, make sure you give the key to students with  the URL and registration instructions.  Enrolling learners through  manual enrollment  If your learners are manually enrolled in a Moodle site, they need to receive  the username and password from you or your Moodle administrator before  they can enter the course. If they have the login information and the organi- zation’s Moodle Web address, they need to access the Moodle site  by plac- ing the URL into a browser  and then enter their username and password on  the left side.  Refer to Figure 4-6.  As discussed previously, if your course has  an enrollment key, students are required to enter it. This is a one-time pro- cedure. Next time they come to the course, they will need only the username  and password.  If your learners are using Mac computers, advise them that the Firefox  browser is much more compatible with Moodle than Safari.  Here’s the catch with manually enrolled students: Before they can access  your course, you need to add them by assigned role in the course. This pro- cess is slightly different than the preceding one. To add learners who are  manually enrolled, follow these steps to add them into your course.  You would follow the same process for adding non-editing teachers or guests  to your course.     1.  Click the Assign Roles link in the Administration block of your course   front page.   Moodle takes you to an Assign Roles in Course: [Course ID] page, as  shown in Figure 4-8.               80 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 4-8:  Assigning  roles in your  course for  manually  registered  users.    Figure 4-9:  Adding  students   assigning  roles  to  your course.                    2.  Click the Student link in the left column in the table.     Moodle takes you to the Assign Roles in Course: [course short name]  page, as shown in Figure 4-9.  3.  Select the learner in the list of students on the right side.     You can select multiple learners by holding down the Ctrl or Ô key  while clicking the names.     Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  81                          4.  Click the Add button between the columns to move the selected learn-  ers to the left column.   You can remove learners from the course by highlighting names in the  left column and clicking the Remove button.   5.  Click the Assign Roles in Course: [Course short name] button at the   bottom when you finish moving the names.    Moodle takes you back to Assign Roles page  shown earlier in Figure 4-8 .  You can return to your course by clicking the Click Here to Enter Your  Course button.  To make sure all your learners are in the correct course, go to your course  front page and click the Participant link in the People block located, by  default, in the top-left column. If all your learners are listed, you are set to  start teaching and Moodling — enjoy!  Unenrolling learners from your course  In the unimaginable case that a learner may need to unenroll from your  course, you have two options:   ✓ You can remove the student from the course on the Assign Roles in  Course: [course short name] page.  Refer to the preceding steps and  Figure 4-9.   ✓ You can allow for self unenrollment. Moodle, by default, does not give   student accounts permission to unenroll themselves from courses.   To enable students to unenroll themselves from any course, follow the steps  in this section. Note that to take these steps you need either administrative  privileges or permission status on your Teacher role enabled.      If your IT administrator is new to Moodle and or wears too many hats and  Moodle tasks are a low priority, see whether you can bribe him to set a few  extra permissions on your Teacher role so you don’t need to keep running to  him  or inundating him with threats such as you’re going to jump off the build- ing if he doesn’t help you . Knowing how to change permissions on rolls will  impress him.   1.  In the Site Administration block,  located on the site front page , click  the Users link to expand your options. Click the Permissions link and  then click the Define Roles link below that.   Moodle opens a new Roles page with three tabs on the top. On the  Manage Roles tab, roles are listed in the left column, editing options in  the right. See Figure 4-10.   82 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 4-10:  Role man- agement.                     2.  Click the editing icon opposite the Student role.     Moodle opens the Edit Role page.  See Figure 4-11.    3.  Scroll down until you see moodle role:unassignself in the column on   the left.   4.  On the right, select the Allow radio button. 5.  Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.    You have to scroll down quite a bit. The role change is enabled immedi- ately when students log in.  Returning to your course, switch your role to Student view  by using the  drop-down list in the top-right corner of your course front page . Notice in  the students’ Administration block  the third down on the left, as shown  in Figure 4-12  that Moodle has enabled an Unenroll Me from [Course short  name] link.   Moodle default settings allow teachers to unenroll themselves. You may be  enrolled in a number of different site courses that you may have shared with  your colleagues or just enrolled in to have a look. Often, Moodle adminis- trators change this unenroll permission to prevent teachers from mistak- enly unenrolling themselves. If this is the case and you have permissions  to access to the site administration settings, follow the preceding steps to  change permission status on the student roles; in Step 2, instead of selecting  the Student role, select the Teacher role. You can then continue and change  the permissions as outlined in Steps 3-5.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  83    Scroll to find this option.  Select the Allow radio button.  Figure 4-11:  Editing a  student role.        Figure 4-12:  The student  view of the  Administra- tion block.     84 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Implementing Moodle Roles  and Course Permissions  I’ve touched on Moodle roles in every chapter so far, and it’s high time to  spend a few minutes defining them, how they affect course capabilities, and  what you can do if you want changes made to your course. Even though you  may think that you don’t really need to worry about roles and permission  capabilities, and all this is starting to sound like you may have to put on your  techie hat, don’t be disheartened. Having a basic understanding of where to  find more information if needed will give you skills to manage how your learn- ers and anyone else coming to your course can interact with it. Read on — I  promise it’s worth your time!    Even if you don’t have an Administrator permission status, this informa-  tion will be useful in persuading and or helping your IT admin to set specific  permissions on your account so you have more control over your course.  “The most valuable commodity I know of is information,” said Gordon Gekko   played by Michael Douglas in the 1987 film Wall Street . This statement is true  here as well: The more you know, the more you can help others help you.   Understanding roles and permissions  Moodle has a number of predefined rolls, as shown in Table 4-1. Each role  has certain capabilities and permissions assigned to it that specify what a  user can do within a Moodle course and or site, and a user can be assigned  multiple roles, such as Administrator and Course Creator.  For example, an Administrator role can restrict chat being used for all  courses on a Moodle site. Or permissions can be added to a Student role to  have Teacher role privileges for managing course activities such as wikis or  glossaries.   Table 4-1  Roles Administrator  Course  Creator  Moodle Roles and Their Capabilities  Description The most powerful role! If offered, take it, but with caution. You  will be able to do anything, but that may come at the price of  other instructors making demands.  Keep it quiet!  This role allows you to create new courses and teach in them.  Ask for this role also or permission to create new courses on  your Teacher role. Course creator is automatically assigned a  Teacher role.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  85  Roles Teacher  Non-Editing  Teacher  Student  Guest  Authenticated  User  Description Someone with a Teacher role  the most widely assigned role  for instructors, trainers, and teachers  can do anything within a  course, such as making changes within a course, grading, and  grade book and changing activities. Teacher roles can’t create  a new course. Ask for extra permissions for specific capabilities  like creating new courses. This role is great for a substitute teacher. She can teach in the  Moodle course and add grades, but she can’t set up resources  or alter activities. You can rename this role to appear friendlier  and not so restrictive. The student role is the main user of Moodle. It role has few  privileges, unless they’re given to the users by the teachers,  such as being able to edit forums. Guests can only read and link to specific resources. They can’t  participate or add to anything, thank goodness! A default role for all users who are logged in to Moodle. This  role is set up so that if a user has more than one role, when he  is logged in as that role  such as Teacher , it does not conflict  with any other role  for instance, the Student role if the Teacher  has both .   When it comes to discussing roles and how values function within permis- sions, you need to understand these three basic terms:   ✓ User: A specific participant that is allowed to enter a Moodle site. Each   user account has a specific role, which carries a set of permissions.  ✓ Role: Identifies any particular user’s position, such as Teacher, Student,   Guest, and so on.  ✓ Capability: Depicts particular Moodle features using a specific syntax.   For instance, moodle glossary:rate changes the capability on a stu- dent account giving permission for a student to rate a glossary entry.  Moodle has thousands, well, actually, more than 150 capabilities asso- ciated with roles.  ✓ Permission: Decides whether a specific user can use a capability within  Moodle activities. There are four settings that you can manipulate: Not  Set Inherit, Allow, Prevent, and Prohibit. When changing permission  status from Moodle defaults, please refer to Table 4-2  later in this chap- ter , which describes Moodle warnings assigned to specific capabilities.  To view roles and assign users the roles, click the Assign Roles link in the  course Administration block. Moodle takes you to the Assign Roles in Course:  [course short name] page. Notice the difference between what you see with a                86 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Teacher role  shown on top in Figure 4-13  and what you see if you have an  Administrator role or a Teacher role with permissions changed to give you a  capability to override roles  shown on the bottom .   Figure 4-13:  Viewing and  assigning  roles.                Setting up roles  You can create a new role and call it what you want  something intuitive that  makes sense to everyone is a good start , and you can assign permissions to  fit your course needs. Useful roles that instructors have used are the  ✓ Blogger role, for specific students to use an activity. ✓ Parent role, for providing parents access to view the Moodle course   and specific information about their child  for example, projects, grades,  blogs .  ✓ VIP role, assigned to a guest  such as an author, an actor, the President,   or other professional  so that the guest can contribute to forums and  answer questions.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  87  You need permission for this capability or an Administrator role to set up  new roles.  Follow these steps to set up a new role:  1.  Go to the Site Administration block on the site front page. 2.  Click Permissions to expand the list and then click Define Roles.    Moodle takes you to Roles page with three tabs on the top  as shown in  Figure 4-14 . You can change permission status from this page by select- ing the role.  3.  Click the Add a New Role button.    Moodle takes you to the Add a New Role page, which is shown in  Figure 4-15.  4.  In the Name field provided, give the role a name.    You can combine two words to name a role, such as Student Teacher,  Teacher Instructor, or Teacher Professor.  5.   Optional  Add a short name, which will be displayed in the profile   for all users to see, and a description.  6.  From the Legacy Role drop-down list, select a legacy role type.    Note: Legacy roles are the default roles and useful to select only if you  are using an older version of Moodle, or if the new role you are creat- ing is very similar to one of the Moodle default roles. You can leave the  default None if you are using Moodle versions 1.9.+.                              Figure 4-14:  Define roles  on this  page.     88 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 4-15:  The Add a  New Role  page.               7.  Scroll down the long permissions list to set the permissions for the   new role.  8.  Click the Add a New Role button at the bottom of the page.    Moodle returns you to the Role page with the new role added, as shown  in Figure 4-16. For this example, I added the Teacher Instructor role.    A number of the capabilities have warning triangles listed in the Risk column.    Refer to Figure 4-15.  I recommend you pay attention to them when you set  permissions to specific capabilities; if you aren’t sure what certain risks mean,  check by clicking the link Moodle Docs for This Page, at the bottom, or go to  http:  docs.moodle.org en Risks. See Table 4-2 for an explanation of  the warning triangle symbols.  Table 4-2  Icons Blue triangle Yellow triangle Red triangle Green triangle  Risk Warning Descriptions  Description Users can gain access to private information or other users. Users can send spam to site users or others. Users can add files and text that allow cross-site scripting. Users can change site configurations and behavior.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  89  Figure 4-16:  The Roles  page with  the newly  created  example  role, Teacher  Instructor.                 Overriding roles  You can override role capabilities at the course level or for specific activities.  Moodle gives you these three options:  ✓ Override at Course Level: This override affects all participants in the  course. The Administrator can put restrictions on a role, specific to a  course.  ✓ Override for a Particular Activity for All Participants: You can give  participants extra capabilities for a particular activity, such as rating  glossary entries or being able to reply to news forums, which by default  students cannot do.  ✓ Override for a Particular Participant  Student : For example, if you  want a student to be the course calendar monitor, you would set the  permissions at the particular user account. You can give students vari- ous status and responsibility to help you manage the course  for exam- ple, approving glossary, wiki, or database entries, and so on .  To make changes to the roles, go to the Administration block on your  course front page and click the Assign Roles link. Moodle takes you  to a new page with these tabs: Locally Assigned Roles, and Override  Permissions  as shown earlier in Figure 4-8 . If you don’t see these tabs,  speak to your system administrator.  Overriding a role in an activity and assigning a role in an activity sound simi- lar, but they aren’t; so I detail the process for each in the following sections.   90 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Overriding a role for an activity If you want to add or restrict capabilities on any course activities, follow  these steps:  1.  Choose an activity from your course, such as a Forum, and click the   Update This Forum button  top right .  2.  On the Override Permissions tab, select the role you want to override.    In this example, I’m changing the Student role. Moodle takes you to  Override Permissions in the particular activity you have chosen; notice  it cites the title of the activity at the top of the page.  See Figure 4-17.                           Figure 4-17:  Overriding  a role.    3.  Change the permissions by selecting the radio buttons.     The permissions that the Student role already has are denoted by the  square boxes around the radio buttons.  4.  Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the list.     Moodle alters the capabilities the next time anyone with the role you  just altered logs in to Moodle and accesses this particular activity.   When altering permissions on the capabilities, make sure you pay atten- tion to the warning triangles.  Refer to Table 4-2.   Setting a participant’s role override for an activity If you need a student to be a forum moderator to update the calendar set- tings, grade assignments, and so on, you can set a user role override for a  particular participant  such as a student . The steps are similar to assigning     Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  91  a role in your course. To assign extra capabilities to a specific participant’s  role, follow these steps:  1.  Select an activity or tool, such as a Forum  in this example , and click   the Update This Forum button  top right .  2.  Select the Locally Assigned Roles tab.    Moodle takes you to the Assign Roles in Activity Module: [Module Name]  page.  3.  Select the role you want to assign to a specific participant in your   course.   In this example, I’ve chosen Non-Editing Teacher.  See Figure 4-18.   4.  In the list on the right, select the name of the user to whom you want   to give the new role and then click the Add button.   The learner is added to the list and has all the capabilities of that  role for the particular activity. Notice in Figure 4-18 that I chose Ruby  Tuesday and moved her to the left.  5.  Click the Assign the Role in the Activity Module button at the bottom   of the page   Your learner has the permission capabilities of that particular role for  the activity.                           Figure 4-18:  Assigning  a role.        92 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   If none of the preset roles are appropriate for what you want to do, you or  your Moodle administrator can create a new role, which you can then assign  to specific participants in your course and or particular activity.  Managing Activities and  Projects with Groups  Moodle has a very useful tool for manipulating and managing groups of learn- ers and teachers within each course: the Groups functionality. This tool pro- vides an effective way to manage activities, projects, or the complete course.  For example, if you, as an instructor, have three periods of the same course,  you don’t need to set up three different courses; instead, you have just the  one course and you organize the different courses into three groups in the  course. This functionality is set up at the course level. If, on the other hand,  you have one very large course, you can use groups to set up sections.  If you set up groups in the course or at the activity level, you can run the  groups completely independent of each other. You can also set them up as  partially separate groups, allowing for some interaction, such as each group  can see each other groups’ activities  for instance, a wiki  but cannot interact  or add to the other groups’ activities.  To set up groups, they must be enabled in the course settings. Groups are  enabled by default. If you don’t see the Group icon and link in your course  Administration block, contact your Moodle administrator.  There are three group mode options that you will see when you’re adding  resources and setting up activities:  ✓ No groups: Groups aren’t used in the course; every learner participates   in all activities.  ✓ Separate groups: When using separate groups, you split up the course,  and participants in the groups can add to and see only their own work  or participate only in activities for their group, such as a group forum  discussion.  ✓ Visible groups: Learners contribute and work in their own groups,   but they can view the work of other groups. For example, if you set up  groups for wikis and make them visible groups, learners can access the  other groups’ wikis and read the entries, but they can contribute only to  their own wiki.                   Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  93  On your course front page, groups are indicated by the two small figure icons  next to the activity if groups are visible groups. If both figures are filled, that  indicates visible groups. If only one figure is filled, and one gray, the activity  is set up for separate groups.  Before you start using groups, you need to create your groups, set them up,  and then add learners  and teachers  to the groups. Moodle makes this pro- cess quite easy for you, and it takes just a few steps.  1.  Go to your course  not site  Administration block and click the Groups   link.   Moodle takes you to your course Groups page.   Notice two columns in Figure 4-19: Groups  on the left  and Members Of   on the right . The Members Of column lists all possible users you can  add to the groups.  2.  Click the Create Group button under the left column.    Moodle takes you to the Create Group page shown in Figure 4-20.  3.  Set options for your group:    Group Name: Add the name. This is a required field. The group   name will appear in various places in your course.    Group Description: Add a brief description identifying the group   and, if relevant, its purpose. Note that this description will appear  above group members on the Participants page.                         Figure 4-19:  The Groups  page show- ing the  Create a  Group  button.     94 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 4-20:  Creating  your group  editing  page.                                  Enrollment Key: If you set an enrollment key for the course and for   the group, anyone who enrolls in the course is also enrolled in a  group. Students need to know only the group enrollment key. Set  the first letter for each group enrollment key to be the same as the  course settings key. If a student forgets the key, a and types in the  incorrect characters, Moodle displays a pop-up window and gives  the learner a hint using the first character of the key.    Hide Picture: Use the drop-down list to hide learner profile pic- tures. If you allow for pictures to be shown, they’re listed with  every activity throughout the course. Showing pictures can use up  your allocated space if you have many students.    New Picture: Moodle enables you to upload a picture for the whole   group.  4.  Click the Create Group button.    Moodle returns you to the Groups page with your new group added in  the Groups list.  See Figure 4-21.    Notice the three new group setting buttons under the Groups column.   Edit Group Settings: Enables you to edit groups you have created.   Delete Selected Group: Allows you to delete the group.   Auto Create Group: Enables you to create groups automatically.  Note that unless you have created a group, the first two buttons  are grayed out.    Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  95    Under the right column is an Add Remove Users button.  5.  Click the Add Remove Users button to add learners to your new   group.   Moodle takes you to the Add Remove Users page.  See Figure 4-22.   6.  Select a student from the Potential Members list on the right by click-  ing a name. Then click the Add button.

You can select multiple learners by  holding down the Shift key  or Ô key on Macs  and clicking the names.  A participant with multiple roles can be in different groups. You can also  have a student in more than one group. This flexibility is useful if the  particular student has extra permissions for particular capabilities.  7.  Repeat the steps to create more groups and add students to the differ-  ent groups.  Letting Everyone Know  about Your Course  If you’re part of an organization such as an educational or training department,  you probably don’t have to worry too much about attracting students to your  course because you have assistance and support. If, however, you need to  advertise and market the course yourself, where do you start? The best option  is to go through your professional organization. If you managed to get your  course certified for professional and or continuing education credits, you can  use the professional body or educational establishment that granted you the  certification. Here’s a list of other sources you may find useful:  ✓ Professional organizations, such as ASTD ✓ Social network sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Ning, and Twitter ✓ Video sites, such as YouTube ✓ Blogs, such as Blogger  Google blog  and Google buzz ✓ Moodle.org and the Moodle community  Charging for Your Course  From Moodle version 1.8 onward, Moodle has a PayPal enrollment plugin  allowing you to charge for your courses and set up a payment system. The  PayPal enrollment plugin has to be enabled through the Site Administration  block on the site front page. Assuming you have administrative privileges,  follow these steps:  1.  If you haven’t done so already, go to www.paypal.com to set up a   PayPal merchant account.  Courses to expand the list.  2.  Go to the Site Administration block on the site front page and click     Chapter 4: Creating Your Course  97  3.  Click Enrollments.    You’re taken to the page shown in Figure 4-23.  Figure 4-23:  The  Enrollments  page,  enabling  online  payment.                               4.  Select the check box in the Enable column for Authorize.net Payment   Gateway and click the Save Changes button.   Moodle tells you it has saved the changes and provides a button to con- tinue, which takes you back to the previous page.  5.  Click Continue. 6.  Next to Payment Gateway, click the edit link, and Moodle takes you to   the page shown in Figure 4-24, instructing you to turn on the plugin.  Follow the instructions on the page.  7.  At the bottom of the page, select the Turn loginhttps On check box, and   Moodle takes you to the HTTP Security page, shown in Figure 4-25.  8.  Select the Use HTTPS for Logins check box. 9.  Click the Save Changes button.  You can have separate costs for each of your courses on your Moodle site.  If you set any course to Zero, students are not asked to pay when they log  in. If a site default cost is set up, you can override it by setting an individual  course cost.   98 Part I: Getting Started with Moodle   Figure 4-24:  The Moodle  Authoriza- tion Net  Gateway  Payment  page.    Figure 4-25:  The HTTP  Security  setting  page.             When students try to enroll for your course, they are presented with a pay- ment page asking them to pay the specify amount before they can enroll. If  you’ve set an enrollment key in the course settings, the students have an  option to enroll using the key. The enrollment key is useful if you have paying  and nonpaying students in the course.  You are now ready to start taking payment for your course when a learner  enrolls.  Set the cost to be competitive with other courses.   Part II  Creating and   Managing Course   Content   In this part . . .  The fun really begins here because you’re ready to add   content to your Moodle course. In these chapters,   you find out how to compose Web and text pages, link to  other sites, incorporate video and audio files, and make  your life easier with the Moodle grade book.   Adding Content to Your Course:   Chapter 5  Resources  In This Chapter ▶ Enriching your Moodle course by adding resources ▶ Adding content and files  including multimedia  to your Moodle course ▶ Using Web-editing tools to compose Web pages ▶ Embedding and editing graphics with the Moodle graphic tool ▶ Creating directories for your content  After you become familiar with the layout of Moodle and the flexibility   of the front page and blocks  discussed in Part I , you’re ready to start  building your course. Most likely you have an idea of what you want to teach   after all, you are the content expert , and you have an outline or syllabus  of how you structure your information and knowledge for teaching specific  subjects. With that knowledge, you can start adding content to support your  learning methods and learning goals, which I show you in this chapter.  If you  aren’t sure where to start, review Chapter 2, which gives you guidance on  how to design great Moodle courses.     You access the Moodle editing tools to change the appearance of and add   functionality to your class. I describe the editing tools in Chapter 3, and  they’re also listed on the book’s Cheat Sheet at Dummies.com.  See the inside  front cover for more details on the Cheat Sheet.   Adding Resources to Your Course  In Moodle, all the tools that help you add content are called resources, and  you find them in the Add Resources drop-down list in each section and week  of your course. The tools in the drop-down list aren’t ordered according to  any specific way of using them.   102 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content                             Inserting a label  A label is simply a bit of text and or graphics that you can add to the top  of each course front page in each topic or week. You can use labels to add  a unit title, a short introduction or explanation, or brief instructions telling  your learners what to do next. To insert a label, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the upper-right corner of your   course front page.  2.  In the section where you want to add a label, open the Add a   Resource drop-down list and select Insert a Label.   Moodle takes you to an Adding a New Label to Week  or topic  page,  shown in Figure 5-1.  3.  Add text for your label in the text box editor.    This is a required field, as denoted by the asterisk. Note that you can  be creative here: Use it for a heading, use different color text, or create  bullet points if you want a short outline.  4.  In the Common Module Settings area, choose whether you want to   make the label visible to your learners.    Other resources and activities have a few more Common Module  Settings.  Selecting Yes from the Visible drop-down list makes the label  visible to your learners. If you select No, it will be hidden until you want  to make it available for viewing. This option may be useful if you’re plan- ning a few weeks ahead and you want to coordinate topics. You can  make it visible by updating the label and changing this option, or from  the course front page, open the Eye icon when editing tools are on. See  Chapter 3 for more information about editing tools.  5.  Click the Save and Return to Course button, which takes you to the   front page of your course, where you can see your new label.   The bottom of Figure 5-1 shows the new label I saved. To preview what  the page looks like, click the Save and Display button instead of the Save  and Return to Course button.  Be creative with positioning. Notice you can indent the label by using the  right-pointing arrow when you have the editing features turned on.  Note the navigation bar at the top of the course front page under the title in  Figure 5-1. On this screen, the following links trace the steps “CI810➪Labels➪ Editing Labels.”    Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  103  Figure 5-1:  Inserting  a label.       Composing a text page  A text page is a simple page you can use for instructions or some basic infor- mation. The editing features are quite limited, and the pages you create using  plain text can appear dull. Because of the textual limitation, I rarely use text  pages. Within the same group of resources, Moodle provides the option of  adding a Web page that has more functionality and editing capabilities. See  the next section.  After knowing the limitations, if you want simplicity and speed, adding a text  page may be a useful resource for you. Follow these steps to create a text  page:   104 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content                                       1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the upper-right corner of your   course front page.  2.  In the section where you want to add a text page, open the Add a   Resource drop-down list and select Compose a Text Page.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Resource for Week  or topic  page.  3.  Enter a name  required  for the text page. 4.   Optional  Add a summary.    The name and summaries appear in the Resources outline and are both  accessible to all learners. The Resources outline is a good overview, so  it’s important you name the resource so it’s understood by your learn- ers. Short summaries provide further explanation and identification of  how the resource is tied to the learning goals. You and your learners  can access the Resources outline from the Activities block on the course  front page, located right under the Participants block on the left side.  5.  In the Full Text area, add the content for your text page in the   text box.  6.  From the Format drop-down list, select a different format to display   the text.   Although you don’t have text editor functionality to format the text,  Moodle tries to improve the layout and look and feel of the page. Plain  text is the default, or you can choose Moodle auto format, HTML format,  or Markdown format. Any of the formats will improve the look slightly,  though you may as well use the Web page and editor to add information.   Using a text page is useful if you copy and paste text from a number of  Web pages or Word and PDF documents. You don’t have to worry about  bringing the back-end code with the documents or using a clean code  utility. I discuss clean code tools in the “Using the Moodle Web Editor”  section.  7.  From the Window drop-down list, select whether you want to open the   text page in a new window.   The default is to open it in the same window. By asking Moodle to open  the page in a new window, you have a number of options to deselect  window functionalities and also change the default size. Read these care- fully because you need to allow for most of the default settings; otherwise,  you may restrict learners from using basic window functionalities. If the  Window options are not displayed, click the Show Advanced button on  the right. Refer to Chapter 3 for an explanation of the different settings.   I suggest that, unless your system administrator has blocked all pop- ups, you enable resources to open in a new window. If you don’t have a  new window opening up and you don’t enable the Moodle navigation  bar, learners have to close the resources by clicking the red X in the  right corner. Consequently, this action also closes the Moodle session,  and they have to log in again, which can become frustrating for learners     Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  105                             if they have to do this a few times. If you cannot use the New Window  option, select the Show Navigation check box so that Moodle adds the  navigation bar or instruct learners to add the browser back arrow.  8.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any Moodle activity or resource.   I discuss Common Module Settings in Chapter 3.  9.  Click Save and Return to Course button.    Moodle returns you to the course front page. You see the link to your  new text page with the text page icon in front of it. If you click the name  of the text page, you’re taken to it, or it will open in a new window   depending how you set it up; Chapter 3 identifies and explains all  the standard Moodle icons . As an alternative to clicking the Save and  Return to Course button, you can preview what the page looks like by  clicking the Save and Display button.  Composing a Web page  You can use a Web page for all the same tasks as the text page discussed in  the preceding section, but Web pages include more functionality and options.  A Web page has a full editing toolbar and HTML WYSIWYG editing capabili- ties.  WYSIWYG stands for What You See Is What You Get.  In addition to  creative text capabilities, you can add graphics, embed YouTube video clips,  embed sound files, and include links to other sites. See the “Using the Moodle  Web Editor” section, later in this chapter, where I explain in more detail the  Web page editor capabilities and adding graphics.  To set up a Web page, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the top-right corner of your course   front page.  2.  In the section where you want to add a Web page, open the Add a   Resource drop-down list and select Compose a Web Page.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Resource for Week  or topic   page.  3.  Enter a name for the Web page.    Anything marked with an asterisk, as shown in Figure 5-2, is a required  field.  4.   Optional  Write a summary.       A summary is useful to learners because they see it in the Resources  outline page. You and your learners can access the Resources outline  from the Activities Block on the course front page, located right under  the Participants block on the left side.   106 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   Figure 5-2:  Setting up a  Web page.                      5.  Add content for your Web page in the text box provided  as shown in   Figure 5-2 .   You can use various styles and graphics, embed YouTube videos, and  or link to resources. You can make it as creative as you need. If you copy  and paste text from another file, make sure you first paste the text into  Notepad or use an application to clean up the HTML code; otherwise, it  can look messy. If you’re familiar with HTML, you can paste straight from  Word or other applications and then tidy it up.  I explain accessing HTML  by toggling from text to HTML in the “Using the Moodle Web Editor” sec- tion.  However, I find the process much quicker when I just copy the text  into Notepad and then copy and paste from Notepad to the text field.  6.  From the Window drop-down list  see Figure 5-3 , select New Window   so the page opens in a new window.   The default is Same Window. If you open the Web page in a new window   I recommend that you do , you have a number of options to deselect  window functionalities and also change the default size. If the Window  options are not displayed, click the Show Advanced button on the right,  and Moodle opens the extra selections. For more information about the  new window and menu bar settings, see Chapter 3.  7.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any Moodle resource or activity.    Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  107  8.  Click the Save and Return to Course button, and Moodle returns you   to the course front page.   You see the link to the Web page, with the Web page icon in front of  it. Clicking on the title will take you to the Web page.  You can see an  example in Figure 5-4.     As an alternative to clicking the Save and Return to Course button, you  can preview what the page looks like by clicking the Save and Display  button.              Figure 5-3:  Choosing  how the  window  displays.    Figure 5-4:  A completed  Web page.        108 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   Linking to a file or a Web site  Learning how to compose a Web page in Moodle is relatively easy, and you  can quickly add content to your course, as shown in the previous section.  Moodle has another useful tool to add content by linking to a Web site or  one of your files. No doubt you have many different types of informative files  you’ve used, such as PowerPoint, Excel, and Word files, PDFs, sound files and  video files, or any other type of industry-standard files. Moodle enables you  to upload and link to these files. You can also link to various resources on  the Internet. I first explain how to upload and link to a file you’ve created, fol- lowed by how to link to a Web site.  Uploading and linking to your files You can easily upload any file you’ve created for your Moodle class or used  in your course on different systems. Remember that your learners need to  have the appropriate software on their computers in order to view certain  files. For example, if you upload a PowerPoint presentation, your learners  need PowerPoint to view it.     If you aren’t sure your learners have the software for the type of file you’d  like to upload, be creative by saving the file in a second format and upload- ing both. For example, when I upload a PowerPoint presentation, I also save  the presentation as a PDF file with the same name as the presentation; after I  upload it, I position it right under the PowerPoint presentation. Most comput- ers come with the Adobe PDF reader installed, or users can download it for  free from http:  get.adobe.com reader.  To link to a file you created, follow these instructions:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the upper-right corner of your   course front page.  2.  In the section where you want to add a file, open the Add a Resource   drop-down list and select Link to a File or a Web Site.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Resource for Week  or topic   page.  3.  Fill in the Name field  required; shown on the left side of Figure 5-5    for the file as you want it to appear on the front page.   It does not have to be the name of the file as stored on your computer.  4.   Optional  Fill in the Summary field.    This field is useful to learners because they can view the summary on  the Resources outline page.  5.  Link to the file by clicking the Choose or Upload a File button under   Location  shown on the left side of Figure 5-5 .                          Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  109    Moodle takes you to a directory that stores all the files you’ve uploaded.  The first time you upload a file, this directory is empty. Unless a file is  already in the Moodle directory, you have to upload the file from your  hard drive or thumb drive. Figure 5-6 shows you what the page looks like  with files listed.  6.  Add files to the directory:  a. From the directory page, click the Upload a File button.   Moodle provides you with the standard Browse button and a field  to locate the file you want to upload.  b. When you locate the file on your computer, click the Upload button,   and your file appears in the directory.  c. Select the check box to the left side of the file you want to upload to   Moodle and click the Choose link on its right.  Moodle automatically returns to the setup page and puts the path  into the Upload a File field. Figure 5-7 shows the file I chose, as it  appears in the Location field.                           Figure 5-5:  Linking to  a file or  Web site.    Figure 5-6:  The  directory.     110 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   Figure 5-7:  Choosing  a file.                                It’s important that after selecting the file in the directory, you don’t  click the Upload button. It seems that’s what you would want to  do, but that button only takes you back to the Browse field in the  set up Resources editing page. Clicking Choose uploads the link to  the Add a Resources page.  7.   Optional  Select the Force Download check box.    Moodle provides you with an option to force files stored in Moodle to be  downloaded, rather than being displayed in the browser window. If you  want learners to save specific files on their computers or if they may  have browser or multimedia plugin issues, select the Force Download  check box. This option may be useful for Word, PowerPoint, PDF, sound,  or video files.  8.  Select whether you want the file to open in a new window.    See Step 7 in the previous section “Composing a Web page” for an  explanation.   For now, ignore the Parameters section, which is used with linking  to other servers. See the “Linking to Web sites” section  Step 4  for a  detailed explanation.  9.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any other resource or activity in Moodle.  10.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the course front page, to the section where you  added this resource. You see a link with the title and file type listed  under the section where you added it. Moodle doesn’t have separate  icons for document types; the same Resources icon is displayed related  to all linked files, such as PDF, MP3, Word, PowerPoint, and so on.    Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  111  Linking to Web sites This procedure is very similar to linking to a file, as described in the preced- ing section, except that you don’t have to store the link in a directory like you  do a file. To link to a Web site, follow these steps:  1.  Follow Steps 1–4 in the preceding section, adding a name for the link   in the Name field.  2.  Add the location  the Web address  of the page you want your learn-  ers to visit.   You can copy and paste the Web address or click the Search for Web  Page button. Moodle launches Google in a new Web page. If you paste  the link, make sure you don’t include http:   two times — notice it’s  already set in the field.  3.  Select whether you want the Web page to open in a new window.    See the Step 7 in the previous section “Composing a Web page” for an  explanation.  4.   Optional  Set parameters.    Parameters are advanced features that you most likely will not use. The  parameters are useful when you want to send data about your learners  and courses to another site. For example, you may want to send infor- mation about your learners from your Moodle site to another school’s  server that will give learners access. If the parameters aren’t displayed,  click the Show Advanced button on the right. Select the options you  require, as shown in Figure 5-8.  5.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any course resources or activities.                           Figure 5-8:  The  Parameters  settings  of the  Resources  page.     112 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content        6.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the course front page, to the section where you  added this resource. You see an icon depicting the Web link and the  name you gave to the link.  Depending what the server requires, you can choose a parameter from the  drop-down list. For example, you may need the learner’s e-mail address, or  you may need a combination of e-mail address and learner ID. Moodle pro- vides you with every exception possibly required, and you can use up to five  parameters — pretty clever, don’t you think? Thirty parameter type entries  are available, and I list the most widely used ones in Table 5-1. You can see  the remainder by opening the Choose Parameter drop-down list.  Table 5-1  User User User User User User User Course Course  Course   Selected Parameter Options  Id Username First name Surname Full name Email address ICQ number ID Full name Teacher  Creating a directory and folders  If you need your learners to access many files that you’ve uploaded, display- ing directory, depicted as a folder, that contains all the files on the course  front page is simpler and easier for your learners. You can structure folders  by unit, theme, or types of files, such as links to resources or lecture notes.  Your learners can open the folders and subfolders and open the files they  need from there instead of scrolling through many different files.  To set up a directory, you first need to create the folder that will hold your  files. If you put it in the root directory  the default directory created by  Moodle , learners will be able to access all files, which you may not want. To  create a folder, follow these steps:    Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  113  1.  From your course front page, click the Files link in the Administration   block.   Files are denoted by a folder icon and is the third from the bottom.  Moodle takes you to your directory page, as shown in Figure 5-9.                           Figure 5-9:  A Moodle  directory.    2.  Select a folder, choose With Selected Folder from the drop-down list,   and click the Make a Folder button.   Moodle takes you to a new window where you can name your folder.  3.  Name your folder and then click Create.    Moodle takes you back to your folder screen with your new folder.  Figure 5-9 shows a number of folders.  4.  Use the navigation bar to return to your course front page.  Setting up a directory involves first creating the folder and then putting files  in it. Note: The “directory” that you create on your course front page is the  folder you created in your files utility.  It’s a slight mix of terms in the Moodle  language and can be confusing.  Follow these steps to set up a directory on  your course front page:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the top-right corner of your course   front page.   114 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content                                                    2.  In the section where you want to add a directory, open the Add a   Resource drop-down list and select Display a Directory.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Resource for Week  or topic  page.  3.  Fill in the Name field for the new directory, which is required. 4.   Optional  Add a summary.    The summary is useful to learners because they see it on the Resources  outline page.  5.  Select the directory you want to display in your class from the drop-  down list.  6.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any course resources or activities.   I discuss Common Module Settings in Chapter 3.  7.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the front page, to the section where you added  this resource. You see the folder with the name.  This folder is the direc- tory you will be choosing.   After you create your directory, you need to fill it with your files; to do so,  follow these steps:  1.  Go back to your folder directory by clicking the Files link in the   Administration block.   Refer to Figure 5-6.   2.  Select the check box next to the files you want to move to the folder.   3.  Under the With Chosen Folders drop-down list, click the Move to   Another Folder button.   Moodle refreshes the page, and at the top of the page, you see a state- ment confirming the number of files you’ve selected for moving.  4.  Select the folder where you want to move the files by clicking it.    The folder will open with the files there.  5.  Click the check box next to the files, and then click the Move Files   Here button.   Moodle moves the files. You will see them as the page refreshes.  6.  Return to your front page by clicking the class name in the navigation   menu.  Once you have created a number of directories and added files to them,  when you choose Add a Directory from the front page Resources menu, you  will see a drop-down list of all your folders.    Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  115  Adding an IMS Content Package  IMS Content Packages are packaged resources that have an agreed specifica- tion format  IMS format  enabling them to be re-used in different systems.  It’s a standard file format you can use without having to convert the material  into new formats. If you have purchased or developed online instructional  material that can be saved as an IMS Content Package, you can upload it to  Moodle. Another way to look at it is like a PowerPoint slide show that you  have used for training. If it has navigation, images, small quizzes, video clips,  and sound, you can add it as a IMS content resource and use it within your  class. You would find that if you uploaded a PowerPoint slide show, you  would lose the extra features listed.  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the top-right corner of your course   front page.  2.  In the section where you want to add IMS Content, open the Add a   Resource drop-down list and select Add an IMS Content Package.   Moodle takes you to Adding a New Resource for Week  or topic  page.  3.  Fill in the Name field for the resource.    I recommend giving it a name that best identifies the purpose, such as  Exam Review or Supplementary Material.  4.   Optional  Fill in the Summary field.    This field is useful to learners because they see the summary in the  Resources outline page. You can elaborate here or give brief directions.  5.  Add an IMS Content Package using the file uploading function dis-  cussed in the preceding section.   Follow Steps 7-9 in the earlier “Uploading and linking to your files” section.   Your IMS Content Package is most likely zipped. After you select Choose  link, Moodle automatically unzips the file.  6.  For the Window option, decide whether you want to display the IMS   Content Package in the same window or a new window.  7.   Optional  Set the display parameters.    Different from the parameters discussed earlier in the chapter, these  parameters relate to display and navigational features available in your  IMS CP. If you aren’t sure what to choose, the safest bet is to accept  Moodle defaults.  8.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any course resource or activity.   I discuss Common Module Settings in Chapter 3.  9.  Click the Save Changes button.                                             116 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content     Moodle returns you to the course front page, to the section where you  added this resource. You see a link with the title and file type listed  under the section where you added it.  Using the Moodle Web Editor  Like most software tools that allow you to enter content and format it, Moodle  has its own Web-based editor with all the industry-standard functionality and  a few Moodle-specific extras. I can reassure you that you will be comfortable  with most of the features because you have used them with other programs,  such as Word and Outlook. You can find this editor in most resources and  activities modules you set up for your learners and anywhere you can create  or send content, such as forum discussions, feedback for grades, and so on.  Figure 5-10 shows you the tools on the toolbar.  When the editor is open, place  the cursor over the icon to see the name of the tool.  Many of these tools, such  as Bold, Italic, and Underline, are familiar tools that appear in many applications.  Others, such as Clean Word and Anchor, may be unfamiliar to you if you’re new  to Moodle. I explain these tools in some detail in the following sections.  Cleaning Word    The Clean Word tool cleans most of the Word formatting from your pasted   text. If you use this button, or copy and paste from Notepad, you won’t trans- fer the HTML code and any other setting, meaning it looks better and loads  faster. If you’ve seen text with various characters and tags, that means some- one copied and pasted and didn’t clean it up.  You can download free HTML filter packs. There are a number of different  applications for different operating systems. This book is beyond the scope  of assisting you with finding the correct software and installation. I tend to  use Notepad. You can paste your content into Notepad, and then copy and  paste from Notepad.  Creating anchors    An anchor links terms within a document or outside the document within  Moodle and also to Web sites. To use the Anchor tool, follow these steps:  1.  Highlight the word that you want to become an anchor and click the   Anchor icon.   A small window pops up, asking you to name the anchor.                   Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  117                         2.  Type a name for the anchor. 3.  Click the Link icon  described in the next section .    Another small window pops up.  4.  From the Anchor drop-down list, choose the word you anchored and   from the Target drop-down list, choose Open In New Window.   Your link to another resource is created.  5.  Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.    Moodle takes you back to the course front page.  6.  Test the text you anchored to make sure it works.    Your anchored word s , once linked to another resource or linked to  another place in the same document, will look like any other active link.  You can create a set of anchors as you’re preparing the document and later  select the anchors when you want to link them to other Moodle resources or  activities, or to Web sites.  Anchoring and linking don’t work within a wiki module. You need to use a dif- ferent method to link wiki pages and link to external resources.

You need to use this tool to link your anchored text. The link tool  constructs a way to the external Web page, internal resource, or within the  same page using the text you anchor  explained in the preceding section  as  the link to the resource.  Inserting Web links To insert a Web link into your document, follow these steps:     1.  Highlight the text in your document that you want to act as a link and   then click the Insert Web Link tool  shown in the margin .   For example, if you were to type For more information, visit www. dummies.com moodle., I recommend highlighting www.dummies.com  moodle and making it a link so that learners can simply click those  words to be taken to the Web site.   A new small window pops up.  See Figure 5-11.                            Figure 5-11:  Inserting a  Web link.    2.  Provide the Web site address in the URL text field.    Notice that Moodle already places http:   in the field, so you shouldn’t  include this when you’re adding the address. If you do, the double  http:   results in a broken link  the dreaded 404 Error .   If the link is internal on the Moodle site, click the Browse button to find  your file within the Moodle course, saved in a Moodle directory that  holds all your files.  3.  Write a title for your link in the Title field, located under the URL field.    This is the text that will appear when the mouse rolls over the link. It  does not have to be the URL.    Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  119                                  4.  From the Target drop-down list, choose where you want to open the   new document.   I recommend selecting To a New Window. The other options are Same  Window, Same Frame, and Other.  5.  From the Anchors drop-down list, select the Anchor you created on   the page.  6.  Click the OK button to save the link.    Clicking the Remove Link icon depicted by the broken link to remove the   HTML links you’ve created. Make sure you highlight the text before clicking  the Remove Link icon.  Preventing automatic linking   Clicking the Prevent Automatic Linking tool  depicted by the link with a red X  icon  blocks selected text from being linked to other resources and activities.  Moodle allows for automatic linking if the filter has been enabled at the site  level. For example, if your course uses a glossary, Moodle links the term  throughout all activities and resources. Seeing many terms as highlighted  links can be distracting in quizzes, assignments, or in forum discussions. This  tool enables you to prevent this cross-site automatic linking.  Inserting an image    Any resource or activity  including the News forum  that has the HTML  editor capabilities allows you to upload images to your site folders and  embed images into your content. Adding images can support many different  learning activities. For example, adding a world map and linking from the  map to countries, cities, or demographic and geographical representations  can enhance content. Images can also be used for quizzes and assessment  activities. There are many different uses for pictures. Use your imagination  and a variety of media to enhance your students’ learning experience.  To add an image to your content, take these steps:     1.  Select the Insert Image icon in the editor menu bar.    Moodle opens a new window with the image-editing tools that help you  add and adjust the picture, as shown in Figure 5-12. In this example, I’m  preparing an image to include in a quiz question.   As with all Web-based tools, you should use the JPG, GIF, or PNG image  format.     2.  Click the Browse button to find and select the image you want to use.    Moodle places the address of the file’s location in the Image URL field.   120 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   3.  In the Alternate field, add an image title or other text.    You have to fill in the Alternate field, or the image won’t be saved into  your content. The alternate text appears when a learner moves her  mouse over the image.   Notice in the example in Figure 5-12, I didn’t add the name of the person  in the photo because I’m asking learners in a quiz to identify who it is.  If  I added the name, learners would obviously have the answer.    After completing the preceding steps, you can save the image  proceed  to Step 5 , and it will appear in your text bar. To adjust the size and  layout of your image, go to Step 4.  4.  Use these additional options  shown in Figure 5-12  to resize and posi-  tion the image.   This is not a required field, but something you may need to do to create  a size appropriate for the resource or activity.    Layout: You can set the layout of the image in relation to the text.  For example, the Alignment drop-down list allows you to choose,  left, right, text top, middle, baseline, absbottom  absolute bottom ,  middle, or top. For the Alignment drop-down list, the default is Not  Set. You can also put a border around the image or leave it with- out. Not entering any digits into the Border Thickness field leaves  the image without a border. Thickness is decided by entering the  number of pixels.    Spacing: The horizontal and vertical spacing is the space between   text and the image, and is also measured in pixels. If you leave  the fields blank, the text appears right next to the image. I                             Figure 5-12:  Embedding  an image.      Chapter 5: Adding Content to Your Course: Resources  121                 recommend 5–10 pixels for each field. Of course, if you don’t  have any text, only the image, there’s no reason to add anything  to these fields.    Size: In the figure, notice that I added the size, in pixels, of the   image. I wanted it small so that it would fit in the matching question  type. You can play with the width and height sizing to prepare the  image for your requirements. Remember to keep the same propor- tions as the original so the image doesn’t look blurry or distorted. 5.  Click OK  to the right of the Image URL field  to save your changes   and return to your editing window.  Notice the two fields and three buttons in the lower-left corner of the Insert  Image dialog box. Use the buttons — Create Folder, Browse, and Upload — to  locate image files that have not been uploaded to your Moodle directory.  The four Selection buttons — Delete, Move, Zip, and Rename — are actions  you can take with the files that have been uploaded to your Moodle files  directory.  Inserting a table    Inserting a table is simpler than inserting an image. Click the Insert Table   icon, located next to the Insert Image icon. Moodle opens a new window with  a number of fields to choose rows and columns, layout  the positioning of the  table within your content , cell padding, and cell spacing.  Changing the editing field to HTML source    If you plan to paste HTML code, you need to change the editor to raw HTML  mode. For example, when you need to embed YouTube into documents, you  need to toggle to HTML source  using the Toggle Text and WYSIWYG tool  and  paste the code, and then switch back. When you’re viewing the source window,  most buttons don’t work. If you know HTML code and want to play with  making changes to documents, this toggle feature will be your best friend.  Enlarging the editor    When you’re working in the HTML window, selecting the Enlarge Editor tool   enlarges the editing window. Working with HTML is much easier if your  editor window is expanded. You will be less prone to errors when copying  and pasting, and searching for bugs will be kinder on your eyes. You can  return to the default size by clicking the icon again.   122 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   File formats: Tips and suggestions  You can employ a number of strategies to optimize your Moodle resources,  allowing for quicker downloads, preventing broken icons, and ensuring your  learners will be able to view all your resources. Here’s a list of things to keep  in mind when preparing resources for your learners:  ✓ For learners to open specific files such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint,   and ODS, they have to have the associated software installed on their  computers. If you are unsure if all your learners have the appropriate  software, it’s safer to save the files in the PDF format. You can save text  documents as RTF  rich text format  files, which most word processing  programs can open.  ✓ Reduce sizes of all files. ✓ If you have to scan articles, save them as text scans, not graphic images. ✓ Slide shows can become very large, so save them as PDF files.   Alternatively, you can use SlideShare  www.slideshare.net  and link  to slide shows.  ✓ Save pictures as GIF or JPG files. PNG is also viewable in Moodle, but   PNG files can be much larger than GIFs and JPGs.  ✓ Sound and video files can be large, so using compression to minimize   size is important. Make sure that the files are not larger than your upload  capacity. Moodle supports the following formats: for audio, WAV, MP3,  RAM, and MOV; and for video, MOV, WMV, RV, and FLV. Learners need  media software to view these files. Most learners can play MP3 files and  have QuickTime, Window Media Player, or RealPlayer. Check whether the  videos you plan to upload can play with these media players.  ✓ Embedding images in Moodle resources or activities is an efficient way   to use images instead of uploading them as separate files  unless they’re  attached to wikis .  Note that if the URL address of the file changes, the image can’t be dis- played, and you see the dreaded red X. If this happens, first try refreshing  your browser. If the red X is still there, you need to do some sleuthing:  Turn on editing, click the Insert Image editing tool, click the image to open  the image editor, check the URL field, and go through the Browse option  to check whether the file is still where it was when you first added it to  the content. Sometimes when you back up your course and copy it to be  reused, or copy it to another server, a link can be broken. Making a quick  check and relinking the image can quickly solve the problem.  ✓ If you and your learners use digital cameras for projects and then plan   to embed those photos in resource files or attach them to specific activi- ties, reduce the photo size. You will be able to view 72dpi. Many large  photos quickly eat up allocated server space and can be slow to view.

You’re immersed in and surrounded by all modes of   media. This immersion has become more influential — and even needed and  demanded by generations that have been exposed to it from a young age  a  topic I discuss in greater detail in Chapter 2 . Moodle meets the demand by  encouraging and supporting the use of multimedia in Moodle courses.  Many tools are available that will help you integrate sound and video clips  to add richness to your course. You probably don’t want to spend too much  money on software or developers to do the work for you, so all the tools I  discuss here are available on the Internet for you to use. I also know time is  precious, and you need to save as much time as possible when you’re creat- ing and using sound and graphics. This chapter encourages you to explore  integrating sound and video to enhance your teaching goals and make you  realize you don’t need to develop very many new skills  or that much extra  time  to be successful at it.  In fact, I have a shortcut that solves the problems often related to multimedia  integration, and I start this chapter discussing it. You guessed it: integrating  wonderful YouTube! If, however, you want to be more adventurous and have  a video clip library, skip the YouTube section and continue on to the follow- ing sections on creating and uploading videos.   124 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   Using Moodle Multimedia Plugins  By default, most of the Moodle multimedia plugins are turned on. Before you  start adding sound and video, either check with your system administra- tor, or if you have administrative privileges, check to make sure that all the  required plugins are enabled. YouTube is one plugin that is not activated in  Moodle’s default settings. Chapter 13 covers the Administration block and  plugins in more detail.  Enabling plugins  The plugins are located in the Administration block on the front page of the  site. To check what settings are on and make changes, follow these steps:  1.  In the Administration block, click Module.    The list expands to show more options beneath Module.  2.  Click Filters.    The list expands again.  3.  Click Manage Filters.    Moodle takes you to the Multimedia Plugins page, as shown in Figure 6-1.  4.  Go down the list and select all the check boxes to ensure the filters   5.

Chapter 6: Adding Audio and Video to Your Course by Using Free Software  125  When you add your multimedia resources, Moodle finds URLs in the Moodle  files and replaces them with the required multimedia player. In Chapter 14,  I include a table that lists all the multimedia formats that Moodle supports  and recommends which to use that are most widely compatible with Web  browsers.  Checking out YouTube services  YouTube provides a number of fantastic services, giving you a variety of  options to use to meet your needs. The following services are offered by  YouTube, free of charge:     ✓ Link to YouTube videos. In Chapter 5, I cover how to use resources and  link to external resources. Follow the instructions outlined in Chapter 5  to link to YouTube and TeacherTube.com as you would to other sites on  the Internet.  TeacherTube.com  www.teachertube.com  is a fantastic service for  teachers and trainers; it provides free resources and enables you to  upload your videos, as you would to YouTube, but you can protect them  with a password making them available only to your learners.  ✓ Embed YouTube videos in Web pages. Doing so prevents learners from  accessing anything else on YouTube. I discuss how to do this in the next  section.  ✓ Add a YouTube video  or any video file you have  to the HTML block. ✓ Upload your own video files to YouTube and then link or embed   them.  ✓ Use YouTube as a conversion tool to optimize your videos. After opti-  mization, you can download and add the videos to Moodle.  ✓ Create an account with TeacherTube.com and upload your instruc-  tional videos. As I mention earlier, this is a password-protected service  where videos are viewable only to learners who have the password.  You can then embed videos or create links to them from your Moodle  course.  Embedding YouTube video and uploaded video clips to a Web page The process is fairly simple. The advantage to embedding a video in a Web  page  you can set up by using the Add a Resource drop-down list discussed  in Chapter 5  instead of linking to it is that your learners won’t have to leave  the Web page in your course to go to YouTube and be tempted to watch  other, non-task–related videos. And yes, even adult learners, not just the                      126 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content                                            young ones, are somehow drawn by the YouTube force field to start look- ing for their favorite songs. I discuss the procedure for linking to videos in  Chapter 5  in the section discussing the Web page editor .  To embed a YouTube video in a Web page, take these steps:  1.  From your course front page, click the Turn Editing On button in the   top-right corner.   Editing tools are now available on the course front page.  2.  Go to the section or week to which you want to add the YouTube   video.  3.  From the Resources drop-down list, select Compose a Web Page, and   then enter a name for the text Web page.   Anything marked with an asterisk is a required field.  4.   Optional  Write a summary.    This summary is optional but useful to learners because they see it  in the Resources Outline page. You and your learners can access the  outline from the Activities block on the course front page, located right  below the Participants block on the left    Chapter 5 provides you with more information on how to add Web pages  and content, and link to resources on the Internet.  5.  Go to www.youtube.com and find the YouTube video you want to use.    Notice the Share and or Embed buttons under the YouTube video  screen, as shown in Figure 6-2.  6.  Click the Embed button to select the code and then press Ctrl+C to   7.  Return to your Web page, look for the toggle icon in the editing menu   copy the code.     , and select it.  8.  Delete the HTML code already there and then press Ctrl+V to paste   the code into the window.  9.  Choose the remainder of the settings and then click the Save and   Return to Course button.   Moodle returns you to your course page with the Web page icon and  title. Click it, and your YouTube video starts to play.  The nice thing about embedding the videos in Web pages in your course is  that you can add titles, instructions, and any other content to the page. You  can use Web pages to quickly develop interactive lecture notes that include     Chapter 6: Adding Audio and Video to Your Course by Using Free Software  127  embedded video and sound. For example, in a language course, you can  embed a film clip or a recorded conversation, and then ask students to trans- late it. This can be used in the Quiz module with the essay question type.  Figure 6-2:  Adding  YouTube to  Moodle.                    You can embed any videos on the Internet that provide the source code. For  example, many news networks and education sites include a link usually  called Share or Embed, which provides you with the lines of code you need.  Adding a YouTube video to a block on the course front page If you want to add a specific video clip to your course front page  perhaps  an introduction to your course or a very important news segment relevant to  your current topic , you can do so in few steps. Adding instructional video  clips to a block makes it stand out more — it’s in front of your learners every  single time they log on to the course, so their excuses of “I missed it in the  course listing” won’t work! To embed the video in a block, follow these steps:  1.  On the course front page, click the Turn Editing On button in the top-  right corner.   The editing tools become available on the page.  2.  Select HTML from the Blocks drop-down list.    By default, the Blocks menu appears under the other blocks on the  right side.   128 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content     The new HTML block appears with all the editing tools available for the  block.  3.  Select the editing tool  the hand .    Moodle takes you to the Configuring a HTML Block page, as shown in  Figure 6-3.                             Figure 6-3:  The  Configuring  a HTML  Block page.    4.  Give your video block a title. 5.  Find your YouTube page, copy the code as described in the preceding   section, and paste it into the large Content text box.  6.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns to the course front page.  7.  Click the Turn Editing Off button in the top-right corner.    You can see your video in a new block, as shown in Figure 6-4.  8.   Optional  To reposition the video block, turn editing back on and   move the block using the arrows; when you’re done, turn editing off.    Chapter 6: Adding Audio and Video to Your Course by Using Free Software  129  Figure 6-4:  Course page  showing  video added  to the HTML  block.       A video uploaded to a block  Creating and Uploading  Instructional Videos  Many departments have video files of whiteboard lectures that you may want  to use in your Moodle course, or you may want to create some lecture or pre- sentation videos to use for future online courses. Showing you how to create  video for your course and optimize the video footage for online courses is  outside this book’s scope, but I can identify resources that will guide you to  create what you need, and I advise you on the best tools to use. Many basic  tools are bundled in your computer or can be downloaded for free. The fol- lowing list is filled with advice, good ideas, and links to resources.  You don’t have to be an expert to create videos and convert them to formats  supported by Moodle and viewable by all browsers. The following Web sites  demonstrate how to use various free video creation resources and download  conversion tools:   130 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content                                 ✓ Free Technology for Teachers  www.freetech4teachers.com p   video-creation-resources.html : Select the Free Downloads and  Free Video Creation Resources links. Other than free downloads, you  find tutorials and more — worth a visit.  ✓ Kioskea.net  http:  en.kioskea.net faq 44-how-to-make-a-  video-clip : An excellent tutorial.  ✓ Videomaker  www.videomaker.com : Loads of help, ideas, and links to   resources.  ✓ YouTube  www.youtube.com t howto_makevideo : This is a great   resource from YouTube on making and optimizing your videos. You can  upload them to YouTube, optimize them in correct format, and then  make them available on YouTube or download them and link to the  video files in Moodle.  ✓ TeacherTube.com  www.youtube.com t howto_makevideo : Has   more instructional information and a link to optimize your video.  ✓ For Windows OS  www.opensourcewindows.org  ✓ For Mac OS  www.opensourcemac.org  ✓ PowerPoint conversion, if you use media files and animation  www.  ispringsolutions.com products ispring_free.html : This is  a free PowerPoint Flash converter that keeps all sound and video and  even compresses the files. You can use OpenOffice to create a presenta- tion and then select Export from the OpenOffice File menu and have a  Flash file. Simple!  After you save your videos as .flv or .swf formats, you can upload them to  your Moodle course. The process follows the similar procedure of uploading  other files to your course  which I discuss in detail in Chapter 5 . Here are a  couple extra steps that you need to take:  ✓ Upload video files to your Moodle Files folder: The most efficient way   to link to your files from the course resources page is to first create  a folder in your Moodle Files folder and upload them there. You can  upload Zip files, which Moodle unzips when they’re needed. The Files  folder is accessible from the Course Administration block.  ✓ Choose from three options to display the video: Embed it in a Web   page, link directly to it, or place it in the HTML block.    Chapter 6: Adding Audio and Video to Your Course by Using Free Software  131  Incorporating Sound files  into Your Moodle Course  As with video files, you can upload sound files to your course. Sound files  may be useful for a number of teaching activities, such as translations  for  a language course in which students are translating content  or pronuncia- tion practice  for an ESL or a foreign language courses . You can also upload  recordings of historic speeches, poetry recitation, and music  for interpreta- tion or theory courses . No doubt you can find all kinds of uses for sound  files.  The MP3 format is the sound file most compatible with Moodle. You can use  any number of different conversion tools  which are usually bundled with  newer computers  to create MP3 sound files. The following sound file formats  are widely used:  ✓ .mp3 mp  ✓ .aac ✓ .wma  Windows Media Audio  ✓ .ra  Real Media   A good program for creating and converting sound files is Audacity  http:   audacity.sourceforge.net , a free, open source software for record- ing and editing sounds. It’s available for most operating systems  Mac OS X,  Microsoft Windows, GNU Linux, and others . With Audacity, you can record  your own lectures, readings, or music and then optimize those files for  Moodle and save them in an MP3 format. Audacity also enables you to open  other sound file formats and play with them and save them as MP3 files, or  you can open an audio file in another format.  Audacity enables you to  ✓ Record live audio. ✓ Convert tapes and records into digital recordings ✓ Edit Ogg Vorbis, MP3, WAV, or AIFF sound files. ✓ Cut, copy, splice, or mix sounds together. ✓ Change the speed or pitch of a recording.                              132 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   You can see a complete list of features at the Audacity Web site. For Audacity  tutorials, visit  http:  wiki.audacityteam.org index.php?title=Tutorials    Moodle media filters use Flash to play back audio in the browser. Flash is a   bit funny with audio; it requires fairly specific format ensuring that it’s widely  compatible with other players for iPods and cross platforms. Here are some  settings to keep in mind when using software such as Audacity to create  sound files for Moodle. For MP3 formats, use the following:  ✓ A sample rate of 11.025, 22.05 or 44.1 kHz ✓ Constant Bit Rate  CBR  rather than Variable Bit Rate  VBR  ✓ Joint-Stereo rather than Mono or Full Stereo    Sample rate or frequency, measured in kiloHertz  kHz , is not the same as bit   rate, measured in kilobits per second  Kbps . The latter is a measure of file size  and download time and also a rough measure of quality. Somewhere between  32 and 96 Kbps is appropriate with diminishing returns beyond 128 Kbps.  Incorporating Podcasts into  Your Moodle Course  A podcast is an audio or a video file that is streamed media, theme driven,  and downloadable. Podcasts emerged with developments of Web 2.0 technol- ogy and handheld devices like the iPod. Podcasts are especially useful in a  Moodle course when students access Moodle files through handheld devices  such as smartphones, iPads, and iPods. Students can use podcasts when  creating interviews, for instance, and the completed podcast can then be  uploaded to the Moodle course wiki, glossary, or database.  A number of free media software programs enable you to create podcasts:  ✓ Skype  www.ehow.com how_2034834_podcast-with-skype.html :   A great tool for creating podcast interviews or for recording meetings  and making them available. It’s free, and many people are very familiar  with Skype.  ✓ Audacity  http:  wiki.audacityteam.org wiki Creating_a_  simple_voice_and_music_Podcast_with_Audacity : See the pre- ceding section for details about Audacity.  ✓ Voicethread  http:  voicethread.com : Another application used   widely within education. Moodle supports Voicethread.                      Chapter 6: Adding Audio and Video to Your Course by Using Free Software  133                 Moodle for mobiles requires specific plug-ins. See http:  docs.moodle. org en Moodle_for_Mobiles.  Many great resources can assist you with creating podcasts. A very good  article published in 2005, which has been updated to keep current with  technological changes, is “How to create a simple interview using a podcast”  available at http:  onlamp.com pub a mac 2005 10 10 how-to- podcast.html. Also see Podcasting For Dummies, by Tee Morris, Chuck  Tomasi, Evo Terra, and Kreg Steppe.  You upload a podcast to your course similar to how you upload video files.  You can link to the podcast, embed it, or place it in a block. You can link to or  upload media files by using Moodle activities  wikis, databases, and glossaries .  Adding Real-Time Instructions  Video  Conferencing  to Your Moodle Course  If you’ve followed along so far, you know about all the various media pos- sibilities. I know you’re thinking, though: You want to hold real live meetings  or lectures in front of your whiteboard to enable students sitting at different  locations to ask you questions that you can answer and explain right away  using your Web browser or that you want to set up a brainstorming session  for your learners in real time — can you use Moodle and integrate your with  my course?” The answer is “Yes, indeed!” Aren’t you happy you asked?   Here are some of the perks:  ✓ You can collaborate in real time like you were really there with any of   your learners, located at different locations, anywhere in the world!  Hint: Just get the times right — the Greenwich Mean Time  GMT   Converter can help you out in this situation  http:  wwp.greenwich meantime.com gmt-converter2.htm .  ✓ You can share documents, whiteboards, record your sessions — with   no software to install! Just think of how much money you’ll save in  travel when these tools come bundled with video, voice, and phone  conferencing.  ✓ You can link to and or integrate a number of third-party software. The   one I recommend is the DimDim, which is open source software. There’s  no cost for small number of users, and if you use it within educational  organizations, you have more options for larger groups for free.  For a guide on setting up DimDim and integrating it with Moodle, go  to http:  cvs.moodle.org contrib plugins mod dimdim  Install.pdf?view=co.   134 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   A number of third-party software products also offer a similar service to  DimDim. You may have heard of some of them:           ✓ Elluminate: www.elluminate.com ✓ GoToMeeting: www.gotomeeting.com ✓ Oovoo: www.oovoo.com  The companion Web site includes hints and FAQs and links to other  resources.   Chapter 7  Grading Learners’ Progress   and Knowledge  In This Chapter ▶ Exploring the Grader Report ▶ Creating your scales ▶ Working with the Choice activity ▶ Adding Moodle surveys  Moodle grades and the grade book are multifaceted tools for assess-  ing student progress and recording achievement in a highly visible   and interactive module. This module enables you to record scores; calculate  grades for individuals, groups, and courses; and add feedback. I show you  how to use those tools in this chapter.  Assessing progress, knowledge, and learning is a difficult task, and numeric  grades aren’t always suitable. The Moodle developers thought of this and  provided a scale that uses nonnumeric, or qualitative, feedback, and Moodle  has preinstalled a quantitative scale in addition to giving you tools to create  your own.  In this chapter, I also show you how to use the Choice activity, which is a  question with multiple choice replies. Instructors can use the Choice activity  anywhere in the course to enliven a debate by asking a question, gathering  learners’ responses, and then making the results available to all learners.  Choice is also used at the end of units to get learner feedback, vote on topics,  or provoke learners to think about topics. After you start using Choice, you’ll  come up with variety of ways you can use it.  In the last section of this chapter, I explain how to use the Survey Activity  module, which helps instructors collect data from learners about their  course or their teaching methods. This data can help you analyze your  course and teaching methods as well as improve specific areas that you may  need to change. Alternatively, if your learners’ surveys confirm that your  course and your teaching are absolutely fabulous, you can just sit back and  gloat in satisfaction.   136 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   Exploring the Grader Report  Pages in Moodle  When you initially set up activities in Moodle, you can set up most of them to  be graded; to do so, simply choose the grading option during setup. Moodle  automatically records the activity in the grade book and records the grades  after learners complete the work and you mark it. Or if it’s a quiz, Moodle  marks it automatically and pushes the grade to the grade book. You don’t  have to do a thing! See Chapter 11 to read more about the Quiz module. The  Assignment module  see Chapter 10  is set up so you can create course- specific activities outside the scope of Moodle and enter the grades manually  in the grade book, allowing for a complete record for your purposes. Your  learners can access their grade books at anytime and see anything that will  be evaluated with a grade or a scale. As soon as you add grades comments,  learners can see them.  Moodle has tools that calculate, aggregate, and display grades in standard  formats that support most educational and training organizations’ require- ments. Moodle also includes exporting functionalities that instructors can  use to export and upload grades to an organization’s database. Before you  start using this grading tool  which will save you from marking and calculat- ing overall grades , you need to become familiar with the Grade module, so  I start this chapter by giving you a tour of the tabs you find on the Grader  Report pages.  Discovering the Grader Report tabs  From your course front page, locate the Administration block  on the left  side, unless you moved it  and click Grades. Moodle takes you to the Grader  Report page with the View tab selected, showing a grid with your students  listed down the left and graded activities displayed in columns, as shown in  Figure 7-1.  Depending on how the administrator set up the Grader Report, you see a  view similar to the one shown in Figure 7-1  with tabs across the top  or the  Choose an Action drop-down list in the upper-left corner. Both offer the same  choices.  To begin, I explain the tabs you see on the Grader Report pages and the  information on each. The Categories and Items tab enables you to group  specific activities  such as forums  and then change the grade setting for  that group only, so I discuss that tab separately in more detail later in the  chapter.    Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  137  Figure 7-1:  The View  tab of the  Grader  Report  page.                                View tab If you aren’t on the View tab already  the default tab when you first enter  Grader Report , click the View tab, or from the Choose an Action drop-down  list, select View Grader Report. Moodle displays the following information:  ✓ The first column lists all your students, sorted by last name. You can   change the sort order by selecting First Name at the top of the column  and then clicking the sort icon  the black arrow . Each name is also a  link that will take you to the student’s profile page, where you can add  notes, read blogs, send messages, and so on.  ✓ The grade totals for each activity and assignment are listed, and you   can view them in ascending or descending order. Click the small black  arrows at the top of the columns to change the order.  ✓ Each activity title is a link that displays the particular activity only, with   the following columns  as shown in Figure 7-2 :    Grade   Comment: This is your feedback.   Last Modified  Student    Last Modified  Teacher    Status: Brings up the grade window where you can enter or update   a grade and or feedback.    Final Grade   138 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content      ✓ The last column on the right displays the statistics for the course total.   You don’t see this column in Figure 7-1 because there are many items.  You have to use the horizontal scroll bar to see the last column.   Figure 7-2:  The Grader  Report,  Submissions  page.       Scales tab The Scales tab lists the Moodle scale provided and all the scales you set  up. You also have editing capabilities from this tab. See the later section,  “Creating Moodle Scales,” for more information about setting up scales.  Letters tab The Letters tab shows the settings for percentage ranges and letter grades  from highest to lowest. For example, 100 to 93 percent = A, 92.99 to 90  percent = A–, and so on. You can edit the letter grade percentage by click- ing the Edit link located on the tab.  Import Export tabs Moodle provides you with tools for importing and exporting grades in vari- ous formats. For example, you can export to Excel by saving your exported  files as CSV files. When your grades are saved as a CSV file, you have a  backup if somehow your grade book is lost, and you can import the file and  send it to your organization’s grade database. You may also want to import  grades from a spreadsheet into your grade book. Moodle enables you to  export or import your grade book to or from an OpenDocument spreadsheet,  a plain text file, or an XML spreadsheet. Note: If you upgrade grades for any  particular activity, say for an assignment activity, after they’re imported, you  can’t edit the grades on the Submissions page.    Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  139  Settings tab The Settings tab allows you to decide how the grade book appears to all  learners in the course.  ✓ Aggregations Position: Set this option to First if you want the Course  Total column in the first column in the Grader Report, or select Last if  you want the course total listed in the last column in the Grader Report.  The default is Last. Set this option to First if you have many activities  forcing you to scroll horizontally.  ✓ Grade Item: Enables you to choose the grade display type: real num-  bers, letters  such as A, B, C, and so on , or percentage, in any combina- tion. You can also choose the overall decimal point, which is the number  of decimal points in the grade that Moodle displays. The default settings  are Real and 2 decimal points.  ✓ Overall Report Displaying Ranking: The default is Hidden, but you can   choose to show rankings.  ✓ User Report: These settings decide whether learners can view overall  rankings and a percentage grade. The default is set to learners seeing  the overall ranking; however, you can override it.  My Preferences tab The My Preferences tab lets you set up how the Grader Report displays  grades and other relevant information. You have to select options from a  number of choices or leave the default settings. Here’s a rundown of given  options:  ✓ General Options: Enables you to adjust display of the following:    Aggregation View: Choose from Report Default  set by an admin-  istrator for all courses on the site , Full View  displays grades  and totals , Aggregates Only  displays only category and course  totals , and Grades Only.    Quick Grading: If enabled, the Grader Report includes text boxes  for each grade so that you can alter grades for a list of learners.  This quickens the process of entering grades for many learners.    Quick Feedback: Same as for Quick Grading, but for feedback.   Students Per Page: This function enables you to set how many   learners you want to see in each page of the Grader Report.  ✓ Show Hide toggles: This is a list of various display modes. I recommend   leaving the default settings unless you specifically need one that is hidden.  ✓ Special Rows: Options for displaying column averages.                                   140 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   I recommend leaving the default settings unless you need more information  displayed.  Categories and Items tab The settings on the Categories and Items tab are important if you want to  group specific activities, such as forums, and then change the grade set- ting for that group only. For instance, if you’re using the forums and giving  extra credit to students who add discussion topics, the Categories function  enables you to group all forums from one course together and then assign  extra credit by setting weights. Weights determine how much the grade is  worth in the overall total. For example, a grade can have a weight of 25 for  participation, 50 for homework, 20 for quizzes, 30 for final exams, and so on.  Note: The weights don’t have to add up to 100.  You can also change the aggregations and a few other functions. Grouping  the graded activities also makes it easier to view the Grader Report.  When you click the Categories and Items tab, you see the Simple view of  the Edit Categories and Items page. In Simple view, you see only the Name,  Aggregation, Weight, Max Grade, Actions, and Select columns. You can toggle  between Simple and Full views.  Both links appear below the tabs, in the  center of the page.    In Full view, the Edit Categories and Items page expands to open all function- ality, as shown in Figure 7-3, and you’re ready to manipulate your grading  options.  Figure 7-3:  The Edit  Categories  and Items  page in  Full view.         Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  141  You see all your graded activities and assignments listed in chronological  order. Categories are useful if you want to group a set of activities so you can  manipulate them to add extra credit, weights, or curved grades. To group  specific activities, select the check boxes in the rightmost column  under  Select  or choose All from the top or bottom of the page. At the bottom,  select the Add a Category by clicking it. Moodle groups the selected items,  creates a folder, and highlights the row in light blue, as shown in Figure 7-4.  Notice you have the standard editing icons to change settings or to delete the  category. To make changes to the category, click the editing icon.  Figure 7-4:  A new  category.             The Edit Categories and Items page shows many columns  refer to Figure  7-3 , which I detail in the following list:  ✓ Name: This is the name of your item or category. ✓ Aggregation: The Aggregation table has a separate drop-down list,   enabling you to choose the aggregation method you’re comfortable with  or required to use by your organization to calculate students’ grades.  Moodle converts to percentage values before the grade is aggregated  and then uses the method you have chosen to convert it to the ranges.  Explaining each grading option is beyond the scope of this book. Visit  http:  doc.moodle.org for a rundown on the choices. From the  drop-down list, you can choose from the following options:   142 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content                                                 Mean of Grades   Weighted Mean   Simple Weighted Mean   Mean of Grades  With Extra Credits    Median of Grades   Smallest Grade   Highest Grade   Mode of Grades    Sum of Grades    Available Aggregation Types  ✓ Extra Credit: Enables you to set extra credit values. ✓ Weights: After setting up the categories, you can set specific weights.   Moodle calculates weights as a percentage and adds it to a grade’s total. ✓ Max Grade: What you set the activity grade for. Usually if this column is  set for real numbers, you may have added anywhere between 5 and 100.  In the example shown in Figure 7-3, all mini projects and forum contribu- tions are worth 10 points.  ✓ Aggregate Only Non-Empty Grades: Select the check box below this   column heading to treat empty grades as minimal grades or not include  them in the aggregation. For instance, if a specific assignment is set up  to be graded between 0 and 100, and 25 percent of the students com- pleted the assignment and received grades, Moodle ignores the grades  if you’ve selected the check box; otherwise, Moodle counts the non- graded assignment and gives 0 in the aggregation.  ✓ Aggregate including Subcategories: Subcategories of assignments are   not included in the aggregation unless you select the check box. For  example, a project may have a number of assignments associated with  it, such as an outline, introduction, list of resources, and so on. You can  choose whether these will be counted in the aggregation.  ✓ Drop the Lowest: By selecting the check box, you can drop the lowest   grade. For example, if your values are set 0–100, you can choose to drop  anything below 20. You need to input the value next to the assignment  or grouped assignments.  ✓ Multiplicator: Allows you to change the value of a specific activity, mul-  tiplying the maximum grade with the maximum value you input.  ✓ Offset: If you applied the multiplicator, this number is added to every   grade. Moodle added these options to give you more flexibility and con- trol over your graded assignments, tests, and quizzes. These settings  can be adjusted anytime throughout the duration of the course.    Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  143                       ✓ Actions: Notice a number of standard icons allowing you to edit, hide,  move, and lock the category and assignment. If you choose the hidden  option, Moodle removes a category for display and grade calculation.  ✓ Select: Click this check box when selecting any of the listed activities you   need to make changes to. For instance, if you’re setting up a category,  select the check boxes in the Select column to move to the category.  Moodle gives you the Grade Calculations tool to set up your own grade based  on other graded items. Use this tool when you group together activities, such  as forum contributions. To set up the grade calculation, you have to follow a  formula-and-functions pattern found in most industry-standard spreadsheets  like the ones in Excel. I recommend that you do not use this unless you exper- iment with the tool first. If incorrectly set up, this tool affects your whole  grade book. You can easily make a small typographic error in the syntax  when you’re rushed to submit your grades before the deadline.  If you want to play with the Grade Calculations tool, click the Calculator  symbol shown next to the group category, as shown in Figure 7-4, and you’re  taken to the Edit Calculations page. First visit Moodle’s detailed explanation  and have a look at the syntax  http:  docs.moodle.org en grade_ calculations . Then, find a bit of time  not the day before your grades are  due , make yourself a cup of tea, and try it.  After you make any changes on the Categories and Items tab, make sure you  click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.  Excluding from grades,  and other exceptions  You can change various settings for assignments relevant to individual stu- dents. This can be useful if, for example, your student is ill during a specific  assignment and you want to exclude the assignment from her grade calcula- tions. To exclude a graded activity or an assignment, follow these steps:  1.  Click the View tab and click the Grader Report link among the links   under the tabs.   Alternatively, after selecting Grades from the Administration block, you  can use the Choose an Action drop-down list and select Grader Report  under the View option.  2.  Find the student in the list on the left, and next to the assignment list-  ing, click the editing icon.   Moodle has a nice feature: As you place your cursor over the editing  icon, the name of the student and the assignment are displayed. This is    144 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content               very handy when you have a long student list and many assignments,  forcing you to scroll horizontally.   Moodle takes you to Edit Grade page.  3.  Select the check box next to the Excluded option  the third one down .   Notice that you have many different grade options, such as overriding  grades, dates, and so on. Also included is a feedback text box where  you can communicate with your student regarding the particular  assignment.  4.  Click the Save Changes button    Moodle returns you to the Grader Report page.  Displaying grades  Your learners can view their grades and the grade book anytime. Direct them  to their Administration block, where they should have only two listings:  Grades and Profile. When students click the Grades link, Moodle takes them  to the User view and displays all the set work, their grades, and the course  average for each listed work and overall. The Moodle default setting enables  learners to view the course average. If you don’t want learners to see the  course average for overall assignments, you can change the setting by click- ing the My Preferences tab  which I discuss earlier in the “My Preferences  tab” section  and choosing No from the Show Column Averages drop-down  list. Don’t forget to scroll down and save your changes.  Creating Moodle Scales  Scales are a different way instructors can evaluate learners’ performance  instead of using traditional letter or percentage grades. For example, you may  not want to give a numeric grade for contributions in a forum discussion or  for adding comments to wikis, but you do want to evaluate the contribution  in a qualitative way. Often, qualitative evaluations are more meaningful for  learners and better for the learning goal you’re trying to support. The Moodle  developers have thought of this and created a scales tool that allows you to  build your own scales. Moodle also includes a scale you can use if you don’t  want to create your own. The scales can be completely nonnumeric, or with- out values attached, or you can attach values. For example, you can create a  scale for forum discussions.  Before you create the scale, think about the wording and how you want to  explain it to your learners. The learners will be able to see the text associated  with the scale when you evaluate their activity. If learners are unfamiliar with     Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  145  the meaning of the scales, they will be confused, and the evaluation exercise  is counter-productive. Worse, yet, you will be inundated with messages, post- ings, and e-mails asking you to explain it.  Follow these steps:  1.  Click the Grades link in the Administration block on your course front   page.   Moodle takes you the Grader Report page.  2.  Click the Scales tab, or if your Grader Report is set up with a Scales   drop-down list instead of tabs, choose View.   Moodle takes you to the page shown in Figure 7-5. You see a table with  the default scale and columns for Used and Edit.  3.  Add your own scale by clicking the Add a New Scale button in the   middle of the page.   Moodle takes you to the Scale window shown in Figure 7-6.  4.  Give the scale a name.    This is a required field  denoted by the asterisk . I advise you to choose  a name that will identify the scale for you because it appears in the scale  selection list, and over time this may become lengthy. In this example,  because I’m setting up a scale for forums, I simply called it Forums.  5.  Select the Standard Scale check box if you want to make this scale   available site-wide.   That means that other instructors can use it with their courses. If you  want the scale to be used only for your course, leave the box empty.  6.  In the Scale text box, add your scale, starting from negative to positive.                                   Figure 7-5:  Moodle  scales.     146 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   Figure 7-6:  The Scale  window.                     Scales must be separated by commas only! If you don’t use commas or  you use other symbols and you try to save your scale, Moodle places  a box around the field and gives you an error message stating Please  enter a comma-separated list of values  at least two  values required.  7.  In the Description text box, write a meaningful description explaining  the scale and whether any value associated will count towards grades.   Learners have access to the description because they need to under- stand the scale.  8.  Click the Save Changes button when you’re done.  Moodle returns you to the Course Scales page, where you see your new scale  listed in the table. You can edit the scale from this page by clicking the edit- ing icon on the right. If you need to create more scales, select the Add a New  Scale button and follow the procedure outlined here.    You can use the scales with any activity. You will find the scale in the grade  option of all activity edit windows. The scales appear in the drop-down list  with the grade values. To see the scales, scroll up — Moodle always adds the  scales above the numeric values, and for the first time you use the drop-down  list, it appears that the scales are not listed.    Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  147  Moodle scale: Separate versus   connected knowers  In case you don’t have time to create your own  scale,  Moodle  includes  a  default  scale  you  can  use  to  evaluate  learners’  performance.  It’s based on a theory that puts people into two  large groups, based on how they approach the  world:   ✓  Separate knowers try to stay objective and   avoid personal knowledge.   ✓  Connected knowers learn by being socially  connected in a more compassionate and  sympathetic way. According to this theory,  connected knowers don’t like confrontation. Moodle’s default scale uses this method of how  people  approach  the  world  and  sets  up  the   scale  using  the  following  categories:  Mostly  Separate Knowing, Separated and Connected,  and  Mostly  Connected  Knowing.  To  find  out  more about this scale, the research behind it,  and how the rating system is determined, follow  these steps:   1.  Click the Grade link in the Administration   block.    2.  Click the Scales tab and then click the edit   icon in the Edit column.   Moodle  provides  everything  you  need  to  know in the editing text box, including refer- ences where you can find more information.     Moodle.org provides you with a variety of example scales you can use. Visit  http:  docs.moodle.org and type scales in the search box.  Adding Choice to Your Course  Moodle Choice is a simple one-question survey you can use to get quick  feedback from your learners about any course topic or activity. For example,  instructors use Choice at the end of units to get student feedback on that par- ticular unit. Used over a period of time with many courses, instructors have  been able to collect valuable data about specific topics or units, for example,  and what types of activities learners prefer or find useful.  The best part is that the Choice tool is quick to set up, and the results are  easy to evaluate. Most learners do not mind spending under a minute on a  poll. You have two restrictions when creating your informal Choice poll:         ✓ You can ask only one question. ✓ The question must be in multiple choice format.   148 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   Creating a Choice activity  To add a Choice activity to your course, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the upper-right corner of your   course page.   The front page changes to show editing tools, allowing you to change  the appearance and add functionality to your course.  2.  Click the down arrow next to Add an Activity and then select Choice.    You see the Adding a New Choice screen, as shown in Figure 7-7. The  selections follow a similar format of other Moodle activities.                           Figure 7-7:  The General  and Limit  areas of the  Adding a  New Choice  screen.    3.  In the General area, fill in the Choice Name  required .    It’s useful to use descriptive names, especially if you will use Choices  frequently.     4.  In the Choice text section  also in the General area , add your question. 5.  Decide whether you want to limit the number of responses by select-  ing Enable from the drop-down list.  Disable is the default.     By enabling a limit, you choose how many responses are allowed for  each option available for learners to select; when the limit is reached,  no other student can select the response. If you disable the limit, each of  the responses can be selected by any number of students.    Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  149  6.  Enter the responses in the Choice fields, and if you enabled a limit,   enter the value.   Moodle provides five Choice fields by default.  7.   Optional  If you need more than five Choice fields, click the Add 3  Fields to Form button shown in Figure 7-8 and repeat Step 6 for the  new fields.  8.  Select the Restrict Answering to This Time Period check box  shown  in Figure 7-9  and enter dates and times if you want to limit the time  the questions are available.                   Figure 7-8:  If neces- sary, you  can add  three  additional  Choice  fields.    Figure 7-9:  Don’t forget  to save your  changes.     150 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content                               9.  In the Miscellaneous Settings area, choose layout and display options.    Your choices are    Display Mode: From the drop-down list, select whether you want   to display the responses horizontally or vertically. If you have  very few responses, they look better horizontally displayed; a  large number of and or long responses look much better dis- played vertically.    Publish Results: In this drop-down list, you have four options to dis- play the results to the students: Do Not Publish the Results to the  Student, Show Results to Students Immediately after They Answer,  Show Results to Students Only After the Choice Is Closed, and  Always Show Results to Students.    Privacy of Results: Depending on what you chose on your Publish   Results setting, from the drop-down list select whether you want to  publish results anonymously or with learners’ names.    Allow Choice to Be Updated: Select Yes from the drop-down list if   you want to allow your learners to change their minds.    Show Column for Unanswered: Select No from the drop-down list if  you don’t want to show names of learners who didn’t answer the  question.  10.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any Moodle activity.   See Chapter 3 for a rundown of the Common Module Settings.  11.  Click the Save and Return to Course button.  Moodle saves your settings and returns to your course front page. Notice  that Choice has its own unique icon, and it also appears in the Activities  block, the Upcoming Events block, and the course calendar.  Administering choices  To keep track of Choice responses and gather feedback, Moodle has a View  [number] Survey Responses link that appears in the top-right corner of the  Choice page. Clicking the link takes you to a Responses page  shown in  Figure 7-10  where you see the students, their replies, and tools to organize  and maintain the responses.  You see the student names even if you selected  in the Privacy of Results field the option to post anonymous results; the ano- nymity means only that participating students and guests cannot see other  participants.     Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  151  Figure 7-10:  Viewing  responses.       You can delete selected responses from the With Selected drop-down list.  You also have links to Select All Deselect All right above the drop-down list.  This saves you from moving from student to student when you want to delete  a large group of responses.  Moodle also features download functionality so that you can save data in  industry-standard formats. You have three choices: Download in ODS  Open  Document Spreadsheet  Format, Download in Excel Format, and Download in  Text Format. Select the format you want to use to download your data, click  the button, and follow the instructions.  Using Moodle Surveys  The Moodle survey module includes a set of questions installed in Moodle;  you can’t use it to create your own surveys. Moodle developers took care to  install prepared, standardized survey instruments for teachers to use. The  questions have been designed for use with online learning environments par- ticular for educational purposes. If you want to create your own surveys, you  can use the quiz tool as a questionnaire, which I discuss in Chapter 11.  Choosing the right survey  Moodle offers three types of surveys. Counting slight variations, you have  five options when choosing a survey:   152 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content                           ✓ Constructivist On-Line Learning Environment Survey  COLLES : This   survey is made up of 24 statements asking learners about how they think  the course is relevant and useful to their studies. It asks learners to com- ment on the interactivity nature of the course and involvement of other  learners and the instructor. Moodle splits the survey into three different  types:    COLLES Actual: Ask learners how they’re currently interacting with   a course.    COLLES Preferred: Asks learners how they think they would like to   interact with a course.    COLLES Preferred and Actual: Combination of the two with ques- tions from both how they’re currently interacting and how they  would like to interact.  ✓ Attitudes to Thinking and Learning Survey  ATTLS : This survey is   based on how learners interact in a collaborative environment and apply  it to online learning. The survey aims to measure the interactive nature  of the course.  ✓ Critical Incidents: This survey presents learners with recent events  related to their online learning experiences and asks them to answer  questions about how they relate to events.    A lot of research has gone into the development, testing, and use of these sur-  veys. Visit the Moodle Web site for references to read more about the surveys,  the metrics used, and the research methods that were used to develop these  surveys.  Creating a survey  The actual procedure to set up the survey in your course is relatively simple  because it’s predetermined. All you need to do is choose the survey, a set of  predetermined questions you want to use, add the introduction explanation  in the edit text box, and you’re done. To add a survey to your course, follow  these steps:   1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the top-right corner of your course   front page.   The front page changes to show editing tools, allowing you to change  the appearance and add functionality to your course.    Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  153                           2.  Select Find Survey from the Add an Activity drop-down list from the   section in your course where you want to administer the survey.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Survey page, shown in Figure 7-11.  3.  Fill in the survey Name, which is a required field. 4.  From the Survey Type drop-down list, choose which of the five Moodle   surveys you want to administer.  5.  In the Custom Intro text box, explain the purpose of the survey and   how you want to use it with the course.   Also let your learners know they’ll be able to see the results.  6.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any Moodle activity   See Chapter 3 for a rundown of the Common Module Settings.  7.  Click the Save and Return to Course button.    Moodle saves your settings and returns you to your front page.  To view the survey, select it by clicking the survey name  next to the icon   on your course front page. When a participant completes the survey and  submits it, Moodle returns a Thank you [name] message and provides a  button to return to the course front page.  Figure 7-11:  Adding a  survey.        154 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content   Administering and managing surveys  Surveys will not take you too long to administer and manage. They are self- contained, and Moodle has tools enabling you to download the data into a  spreadsheet or plain text file.  When selecting the survey from the front page, Moodle takes you to the sum- mary of your results. See Figure 7-12.  Figure 7-12:  View the  survey  results in  graph form.                In the top-right corner of Figure 7-12 is a link that informs you how many  people have completed the survey. Click that link — it reads View [number]  Survey Responses — to see a summary report with five links in the upper left,  as shown in Figure 7-13, that allow you to view the data in different formats  and download the data. The following list details your choices:  ✓ Summary: Takes you to a Moodle page that shows the survey responses   against the average.  question type.  ✓ Scales: Shows you a graphical representation of scale responses for the   ✓ Questions: Demonstrates all questions and student responses.    Chapter 7: Grading Learners’ Progress and Knowledge  155        ✓ Students: Lists the student, including a link to his profile and the date   and time he completed the survey.  ✓ Download: Takes you to a page with three buttons enabling you to  download the data in three different formats: ODS, Excel, and Text.  Select the format and click the appropriate button.  Figure 7-13:  Survey  report.         Although students or guest accounts can’t see participants’ results other than   a general graphical report, the teacher, admin, and course creator accounts  are able to view individual responses. I advise you to inform your students  that the surveys are not completely anonymous, and if you intend to use the  surveys for research purposes, you need to ensure anonymity.   156 Part II: Creating and Managing Course Content    Part III  Adding Activities  to Your Moodle   Course   In this part . . .  Before you jump into the chapters in this part, you   need to be comfortable with the Moodle layout. If   so, you’re ready to start Moodling and creating interactive  content for your learners because the chapters here really  show you how to             ✓ Add forums, chats, and blogs  ✓ Implement wikis and glossaries ✓ Pass out assignments and feedback ✓ Give and grade quizzes ✓ Collect, organize, and share searched resources   through Moodle databases   Chapter 8  Adding Communication Modules  In This Chapter ▶ Using discussion forums to engage learners ▶ Creating and using chat rooms ▶ Using messaging and notes within Moodle ▶ Introducing your learners to Moodle blogs  Making use of Moodle communication tools allows you to use technol-  ogy your learners are familiar with to enhance the course experience.   Whether your course is completely online or part of a blended learning  initiative, making use of Web 2.0 technology and communicating with your  students support the nature of Moodle as a collaborative environment where  instructors and students learn from and support each other. The strength  of the tools is in the flexibility of how you use them to liven your training or  teaching methods.  Adding Forums to Your Course  Also referred to as online message boards, forums are fabulous, powerful  tools that can engage your learners in collaborative projects, such as out- of-class test reviewing, group project discussions brainstorming  with all  brainstorming documented , debating among classes, contributing to a topic  discussion that’s not in real time, role playing, inviting guests, and so on.  Forums enable learners to practice skills not easily supported in traditional  class settings. Studies have shown that learners participate in forum discus- sion more than they would in a traditional classroom setting. Educators  have identified the following reasons for learners’ increased participation in  forums: Shyness is less of a factor, language barriers are less of a hindrance,  and peer pressure is lessened. In addition, when learners discuss a topic in a  forum, they can employ their computers’ usability options to overcome dis- abilities that affect communication, and they have time to research and think  through their answers before replying.   160 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Before you create any forums, though, you need to choose what type of  forum you want to create. To do that, you need to think about how to best  integrate forums into your course. I discuss these issues before showing you  how to actually create a forum.  Effectively using forums  with your learners     Before you dive in and start creating stimulating forums for your course, take  some time to think about the following issues:  ✓ Determine how the forum discussion will be related to the learning   goals and topic. Learners need to understand why they’re asked to par- ticipate in an activity that can potentially be time-consuming.  ✓ Clearly explain your intentions of use and directions for your learn- ers. Understanding that the forum discussion is related to something  and that each forum can have any number of new discussions with any  number of replies can be confusing. If you don’t clarify the structure and  if learners don’t understand that each new discussion topic needs to  relate to the course activity, learners may create discussions on unre- lated issues. Of course, this doesn’t apply if it’s your intention to open a  discussion as a free form of expression.  Monitor free-for-all threaded discussions. Topics can become hot  quickly. Learners are known to be more forthcoming when not having  to face others in discussing issues that ignite passionate feelings. You  may find yourself having to bring white flags into your course and hold  United Nation–style peace meetings.  ✓ Decide whether you want to assess learners’ participation in forums.  Moodle forum activities can be graded by you or rated by you or other  learners. If you decide to use ratings or any form of assessment, make  sure your learners understand how their contributions will be evaluated.  Watch out for quality versus quantity.  ✓ Establish classroom protocols for polite and positive replies. Learners  should not be made fun of, or made to feel small, for their contributions  by other members of the class. Preparing guidelines regarding rudeness,  vulgarity, and what is otherwise not acceptable will save you effort if  such a situation should arise. If this is a concern, remind learners about  school policy regarding student behavior and how it also applies to  the online environment. If you assign points  set up forum marking or  scales , for participation, often that’s enough to deter negative behavior,  and learners are more likely to participate.                Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  161                 After you’ve ironed out the preceding issues, get creative and make Moodle  forums work for you. You can use different types of forums  which I discuss in  the next section  to engage and encourage participation in discussion topics.    Getting a forum discussion going is probably the most challenging aspect of  the activity. Unless your learners are forum-use savvy, you may need to start  a discussion topic to get them going — which you may want to do anyway to  keep topics in line with other course work and to keep your learners focused  on learning goals. With that in mind, here are ideas to get you started with  Moodle forums:  ✓ Use the News forum to make announcements to your students. This is   the only forum where students can’t reply. Moodle sets up the discussion  forum as a default, and it’s displayed at the top of each Moodle front page.  Instructors can use this forum for general announcements to all members  in the course  for example, “Don’t forget exam review in chat room”  or  topic-related announcements. Moodle sends each news forum to your  learners’ e-mail accounts, so you don’t have to accept excuses like “I  didn’t know there was a new announcement on Moodle.” The item is also  added to the Latest News block on the course front page.  ✓ Invite guests to participate in an interview-style forum. For example,  an author, a politician, or some other notable person may be more will- ing to participate in a limited forum discussion than to visit a class.  Organize your learners to post questions for the visitor and then let the  learners rate the questions and choose the highest rated ones to use as  topics to engage the guest in discussion.  ✓ Set up Q & A forums. You and your learners can use these forums effec-  tively for reviewing, debates, and problem-solving.  ✓ Encourage debate-style discussion by setting up a forum around   topics. Moodle is a great platform for topical issues that ignite passion.  Use the same format for less-heated activities, such as reading groups. ✓ Consider using role-play scenarios. Assigning learners  or letting them  choose  a character and its persona is fun. Learners have to post topics  or replies based on knowledge of the characters they’re portraying. This  is an effective way for learners to investigate and think like the character.  For example, choosing a historical figure to understand how decisions  were made in a particular era can be a powerful learning activity and  much more fun than just reading about the person and writing a report.  Choosing the right forum  Because Moodle is consistent in the layout and setup procedure of all activi- ties and resources, setting up a forum is easy. The most important aspect of  setting up the forum is first thinking about the type of forum you want to set  up and then choosing correct options. Moodle supports four types of forums:   162 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                ✓ A single, simple discussion: You post the main topic and instructions,   and learners are allowed to post only replies to the discussion. This type  of forum provides the instructor with the most control over the discus- sion topic. This forum type is useful if you want to post an issue ques- tion and ask learners to reply.  ✓ Each person posts one discussion: This forum type is useful if you want   to restrict new discussion postings or require that each learner posts  one discussion. Learners can post multiple replies. I use this forum type  when I expect each learner to contribute a discussion to the topic and I  plan to grade them for their efforts.  ✓ Question and answer  Q & A  forum: This forum type is fabulous for   many different activities. All learners are expected to post a discussion  before they can see other learners’ postings and replies. I’ve used this  forum for guest interviews. I asked learners to post questions for our  guest. After everyone posted a question, learners could reply to the  questions and then rate them. Questions with the highest ratings were  e-mailed to the guest. Q & A forums are also used in math and science.  The instructor posts a problem to solve; each learner has to post a solu- tion before they can see other learners’ answers.  ✓ Standard forum for general use: This is the simplest, most flexible forum   for various activities. Your learners can post multiple discussions and  replies. Keep track of discussion topics because heated replies can trigger  new discussion postings not related to your course learning objectives.  Creating forums  Setting up a forum is simple after you decide what type of forum you want  to use with your course and whether you want to assess the posting with  grades or scales. To begin, follow these steps:  1.  On your course front page, click the Turn Editing On button. 2.  Choose Forum from the Add an Activity drop-down list, as shown in   Figure 8-1.   The Add an Activity drop-down list appears next to the Add a Resource  drop-down list in the every week or topic on the front course page.   Don’t forget to first locate the week or topic set where you want to post  the forum. Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Forum page for the  course section selected.  3.  In the General area, type a name in the Forum Name field.  See   Figure 8-1.    Anything marked with an asterisk is a required field.    Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  163  Figure 8-1:  The top  half of the  Adding a  New Forum  page.                                Be descriptive with forum names — the titles will appear on your  Moodle front page.  4.  Choose what type of forum you want to set up from the Forum Type   drop-down list.   The preceding section explains each forum type.  5.  In the Forum Introduction text box provided, enter a brief explana-  tion on how you want the forum to be used within the context of the  activity.   Describe how you’ll be using this forum in your course and how it  relates to the course learning goals. Use this space for specific instruc- tions on how to use the forum, state whether you’re planning to grade it,  and explain your grading requirements.  6.  Choose whether you want to force everyone in the course to be sub-  scribed to this forum.   Moodle sets the default to No. Click the drop-down list to choose one of  the following options:    Force Everyone to Subscribe: If set to Yes forever, everyone will   receive e-mail post when learners add a discussion topic or reply  to any given topic. Posts are sent 30 minutes after they’re added.  This gives the learner instructor chance to edit or change her  posting, which is a good idea for those hotheads who are quick  to reply and click the Post to Forum button, and later regret  it. The 30-minute delay can be overridden by the Teacher or  Administrator roles.   164 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     Selecting Yes Initially: Choosing this setting subscribes everyone as  above, but they can unsubscribe, and it’s helpful to get your learn- ers comfortable using forums and posting replies. It’s also useful  for learners who would rather read than write — make peer pres- sure work for you.    Subscriptions Not Allowed: This setting restricts learners from sub-  scribing and is useful if a forum is set up for teachers only, or if  you want to restrict second-semester students or latecomers from  joining the forum.  7.  Choose whether to track who reads which forum posts.    You have three options listed in the Read Tracking for This Forum drop- down list: Optional  the default , Off, and On. Moodle highlights unread  forum posts. If you choose Optional, learners have a choice to turn  this feature off or on. The Off or On setting does not give learners the  options to override.  8.  Determine a maximum size for forum attachments.    This setting enables you to determine how large files can be uploaded  to the forum in the course. Moodle enables learners to attach files or  images to forum postings. I recommend that you select a smaller upload  size from the drop-down list or restrict attachments altogether unless  it’s required by the learning activity. If the forum is active with many  participants, learner downloading speeds can be affected, if they start  uploading files, and you’ll use up your allocated server capacity.  9.  Make your choices in the Grade area, as shown in Figure 8-2.                        Figure 8-2:  Settings for  the second  half of the  Adding a  New Forum  page.                                            Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  165    Moodle’s default grading is set to No Ratings, with various grade options  not activated. If you don’t plan to grade or use scales for forums, skip this  option. You will find that numeric or word scales are useful to give par- ticipation points to learners. Moodle automatically enters forum ratings in  learners’ grade books. To set up forum grades, select the following:    Aggregate Type: From the drop-down list, select the type of rating.   Your choices are Average Rating, Count of Rating, Maximum  Rating, Minimum Rating, and Sum of Ratings. If you’ll be using a  descriptive scale, Moodle will ignore the aggregate.    Grade: Depending on your aggregate choice, choose a numeric   grade or a scale. I cover grades and scales in Chapter 7.    Restrict Ratings to Post with Dates in This Range: Selecting this  check box restricts rating to the specific time you select in the  From and To dates. This option is useful if students are given per- mission to rate  see the next section , or if you want students to  keep on task and participate in a given period.  10.  Restrict posting to encourage participation from every learner.    The Post Threshold for Blocking area gives you three options:    Time Period for Blocking: From the drop-down list, choose 1 Day to   1 Week. If you want to add restriction right away, choose 1 Day.   Post Threshold for Blocking: Enter the number of times a learner   can post to the forum. This restricts the overactive and enthusias- tic learners speaking out or doing work for others.    Post Threshold for Warning: Set the value to warn them. Quite   simply, if you allow for three postings, you can set this value by  entering 2. When the learner post two discussions, Moodle informs  her that she can post only one more.  11.  Choose options in the Common Module Settings area as you would   when you set up any Moodle activity.   See Chapter 3 for a rundown of the Common Module Settings area.  12.  Click the Save and Return to Course button.    Moodle saves your settings and returns you to the course front page.  Managing and Administering Forums    After you create your forum and when your learners are ready to post discus-  sions, click the Forums icon from your course front page to access your  forum. Click the Add a New Discussion Topic button, as shown in Figure 8-3,  and you’re taken to the Your New Discussion Topic page where you create a  discussion.   166 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 8-3:  Click the  Add a New  Discussion  Topic  button.                      Moodle provides forum tools for you and your learners:  ✓ Subscriptions links: Your learners see these links and have a choice to   subscribe to the forum and receive all post in their e-mail. If you enabled  learners to unsubscribe, they see a link in the same area on the forum  page.  ✓ Forum instructions: These appear in the center, followed by a button to  add a discussion topic. You and your learners need to click this button  to start the forum. When you use a forum for the first time, take the ini- tiative and post the first discussion to get your learners familiar with the  layout.  For instructors, this forum page has three extra options:  ✓ Update This Forum: This button, located in the top-right corner, takes  you back to the main editing page, where you can, for example, change  the forum instructions.  ✓ Show Edit Current Subscribers: Located with the subscriptions links,   this functionality allows you to make subscription changes, such as  pushing the forum to e-mail, forcing all members to subscribe, and so  on. Generally, you have at your disposal all the functionality you have  when you set up the forum.  ✓ Separate Groups: This drop-down list is located in the top-left corner and   allows you to choose groups if you have group sets within your course.  Adding forum discussions  Beginning a discussion topic requires only a few simple steps:    Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  167                   1.  Click the Forums icon from your course front page. 2.  Click the Add a New Discussion Topic button in the center of the page.    The Your New Discussion Topic page, as shown in Figure 8-4, appears.  3.  Fill in the following fields  anything marked with an asterisk is   required :    Subject: Give your discussion a name.   Message: Write what you want to discuss — identify the topic. It’s  useful to remind your learners to stay within the scope of the cen- tral theme or topic.    Format: When you’re using text editing boxes in Moodle, they can   come in a number of formats, of which HTML is the most widely  used and is set as default. You can leave the default setting, and  things will work as you expect. For instance, URLs will automati- cally become links and indenting or line breaks will be interpreted  as new paragraphs. For more information on the formats, click the  Help icon.  Figure 8-4:  The Your  New  Discussion  Topic page.        168 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     Subscription: You and your learners can decide whether you want   to receive e-mail copies of the posts.    Attachment: Lets you attach a file to the forum.   Mail Now: This field is available only to you. Student accounts   cannot override this. Select the check box if you want to override  the 30-minute posting delay.    Group: Shows the group that’s involved in this discussion. You set   this group when you set up this particular forum discussion.  4.  Click the Post to Forum button.  After you submit the discussion topic, Moodle tells you the post was saved  and informs you that it will be posted in 30 minutes. After making a post, you   or your learners  have 30 minutes to go back and make changes. When the  discussion is posted, your learners cannot make changes to it unless permis- sions are changed on students’ profile settings. See Figure 8-5, which displays  a learner’s posting and a reply from another learner.                   Figure 8-5:  Example of  a learner  posting  a discus- sion to the  topic and a  reply from  another  student.    Viewing, archiving, and searching  forum discussions  The forum viewing pages offer you a few more forum capabilities and infor- mation about the postings. Figure 8-6 shows a standard list of discussions,  who posted them, and the date and time of posting.    Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  169  Figure 8-6:  Forum page  listing all  discussions  and replies,  by whom,  and when  posted.                      Here are the most widely used tools:  ✓ Reply: Clicking this link opens an editing window, allowing you and your   learners to reply to a posting.  ✓ Edit Delete: These links take your learners back to their posting to edit  it or delete it — as long as they do so within 30 minutes of posting. After  30 minutes, they can’t make changes. There’s no time limit for you to  make changes.  ✓ Show Parent: Shows the original discussion topic. ✓ Split Discussions: This option allows you to split the discussion to   create new ones. This option is useful if a new topic is started in a reply  that begins to generate discussions and you think it may be of more  value to stand on its own.  ✓ Rate Posts: Allows you to rate the postings. If you want users to be able   to rate the postings, permissions need to be set in student profiles.  Permission changes are beyond the scope of the book. Please visit  http:  docs.moodle.org en Forum_permissions for more details.  Above the discussion topics is a Display option drop-down list, which is  useful for managing discussions. Moodle lets you view the discussions in four  ways. The drop-down list gives you the following options:   170 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                               ✓ Display Replies Flat with Oldest First: All replies are displayed under   the discussion topic with oldest first.  ✓ Display Replies Last with Newest First: This option is the same as the   preceding one except that newest replies display first.  ✓ Display Replies in Threaded Form: The discussion is in complete form,   but all replies post only headlines and author and date posted.  ✓ Display Replies in Nested Form: My preferred viewing. You see all dis- cussion topics and replies in full form with replies tabbed to the right.   Figure 8-5 displays the nested form.   Moodle provides these extra tools that aren’t seen by your learner:  ✓ Move This Discussion To: Moodle lets you move the forum discussion  to any other area in your course. If one of your forum discussions gets  very long, you can use this utility to create a forum archive and then  move all the entries there. The drop-down list enables you to move the  forum discussion to any other forum listed in other units or weeks, or to  an archive folder. This drop-down list is not available for learners.  Categorizing forum discussions and storing them in archive folders or  combining them with other discussions keeps the current discussion  easier to maintain, and makes the information available as a reference  for your learners.  You can create an archive with few simple steps.  a. Turn on editing, locate the unit or week in your Moodle course where   you want to place the archive, and select Forum from the Activities  drop-down list.  I usually place the archive in the last week unit.  b. Set up the forum as instructed in “Creating forums” section, earlier in   this chapter.  I suggest you call the forum Archive and let learners know in the  instructions let learners the title of the forum as it was listed prior  to archiving.  c. Go back to the forum you want to archive and click it. d. Click the Move This Discussion To drop-down list and select Archive   Forum, and then click the Move button.  Archive Forum should be the last one in the list if you placed it at  the bottom of your course.  Moodle moves the whole discussion to the Archive forum. You and  your learners can view the archived discussion by clicking it from  the forum listing accessed from the Activities block on the course  front page.    Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  171  ✓ Search Forums: Searching a forum is useful if you or your students want   to find certain terms or topics. Located on the front page, this tool can  be handy if you use forums extensively and if the discussions become  a resource for your students. It’s also useful if you need to grade the  forum. Enter the student’s name in the forum search, and Moodle  returns all forum contributions for that student.  You can enter a search term from the front page Search Forums block,  or you can use the search feature within the discussion itself. The  Search field is located in the top-right corner. If your search yields too  many results, you can refine your search using the advanced search  link, located in the right corner of your search results page. Clicking the  link takes you to a detail search page where you can search your topic  in any number of ways, such as by student name, date, and specific  forums. You can use the standard advanced search options by clicking  the advanced search link located below the search field. A new search  page opens enabling you to enter details related to what you’re trying to  search. For example, if you’re searching for a specific learner and dates  he may have been active in the course, you have that option.  Adding a Chat to Your Course  A chat is synchronous communication, which is a way of describing how it  allows you and your learners to hold a text-based discussion in real time.  The Moodle chat room is different from the forum  which is asynchronous   because for forum discussions, the learners don’t need to be logged in at the  same time. In a chat room, students need to be logged in to the session at the  same time and participate in a structured activity you can control. The Moodle  chat room is similar to Google chat, AIM, MSN Messenger, and other chat  rooms. However, the Chat module in Moodle is unique because it’s tied to your  course, and you have instant access to all the messages between learners, and  between you and your learners. Having a record of the communication can be  used in other activities, and you control how it’s used within your course.  Effectively using chat with your learners  Although not as robust as some of the instant messaging found on the Internet,  the Moodle chat room is an effective learning tool that instructors find useful.  Here are a number of ways that instructors use the Moodle chat room:  ✓ Question and answer: With online courses, you can use it as traditional  online office hours, where students can ask you questions related to the  syllabus. You can leave the past chat sessions available for students to  re-read, and you can post some of the questions to the News forum.            172 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                      ✓ Test reviews and preparation: You can make yourself available before  tests. You can use the questions and answers at a later date to create  exam questions or prepare final exam reviews.  ✓ Study and project groups: You can set up a number of chats for stu- dents to work in groups on projects or review for tests. You can set  up chats for individual groups you’ve assigned for the projects, which  restricts other learners from entering the chat room. See Chapter 4 on  how to create groups.  ✓ Guests: You can invite a guest to join a chat room and participate in a   debate or answer learners’ questions. For instance, a counselor set up a  chat for a guest medical expert to answer questions related to his day- to-day work and his expertise. He was not able to take a day off work to  visit the school, but happily agreed to spend an hour in a chat room.  ✓ Foreign language or ESL: One of the most creative ways I’ve seen   instructors use the chat is for students to hold an open discussion in  their French and German courses. The teacher saved the transcripts  from the chat and posted them as an assignment, asking the students to  correct the grammar and spelling. It was an exercise everyone enjoyed. ✓ For sick students: A number of teachers have used the chat room when  their students were ill and in the hospital for an extended period of time.  Group work exam preparation and project feedback were completed by  using the chat room.  Creating and entering into a chat session  The Chat module follows the same standard format as other Moodle activi- ties. To set up a chat, follow these steps:  1.  On the course front page, click the Turn Editing On button. 2.  Choose Chat from the Add an Activity drop-down list located in the   course center sections.   Don’t forget to first locate the section set where you want to post the  forum. Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Chat page for the course  section selected.  3.  Fill in the chat name.    I suggest using descriptive names — the title will appear on your Moodle  front page.   Fields marked with an asterisk must be filled in.  4.  Fill in the introduction text.    Use this space to tell the learners the purpose of the chat. If some learn- ers are using chat for the first time, add instructions on how to use it.  When I use the chat for the first time with a course or group, I usually say     Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  173                                              something like: “I will be in the chat room to answer questions related to  the course. Click the Click Here to Enter Chat link. You will be taken to a  chat window. Ask me questions by typing in the text line at the bottom.” 5.  Enter the date and time you will hold the chat in the Next Chat Time   field.   Depending on where your Moodle site is hosted, you may have a different  time frame showing up in the chat. Ask IT whether the server time is the  same as the time you are at; otherwise, when you enter the chat room, a  different time may be displayed, which will confuse your learners.  6.  In the Repeat Chat Sessions field, determine whether you plan to hold   regular chats scheduled at the same time.   Moodle publishes the chat in the Calendar, Latest News, and Upcoming  Events blocks on the front course page. You have four options you can  select from the drop-down list:    Don’t Publish Any Chat Times: If you select this option, Moodle  leaves the chat room open, and learners can enter it any time,  which may not be ideal if you’re using it for structured activities.    No Repeat: Select this option to create a chat on a specific date and   time. This setting is useful if you don’t hold regular chat sessions.    At the Same Time Every Day: Your course calendar will list the   event for however long you specified.    At the Same Time Every Week: This option is the same as the pre-  ceding option, but on a weekly basis.  7.  Save the past session.    To do so, enter a specified amount of time in the field. The default is set  to Never Delete. You can specify days by selecting them from the drop- down list.  8.  Decide whether everyone or teachers only can view past sessions.    If you want only teachers to view past sessions, select No from the drop- down list.  9.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any Moodle activity.   See Chapter 3 for a rundown of the Common Module Settings.  10.  Click the Save and Return to Course button.    Moodle saves your settings and returns you to the course front page.  When you and your learners first click the chat link from the front page,  you’ll enter the home page for the chat session. You see your description and  purpose of the chat, information of the next chat session, and a Click Here  to Enter the Chat Now button. If this is the first session, nothing else is dis- played on the page.   174 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   If you set up the chat session so that messages are saved and if you’re return- ing to the chat, you see a View Past Chat Sessions link in the top-right corner.  You can click the link to see a transcript of the chat. To enter the chat, click  the Enter Chat Room button, and a new, smaller window opens.  Figure 8-7 shows the Chat screen, which is divided into two frames. The left  frame displays the chat messages, including the name and profile picture of  the person who entered each message. The right frame lists all the people  who are currently participating in the chat session, displaying each partici- pant’s profile picture, name, and the time he or she entered the chat. To  enter messages, type in the text field at the bottom and press Enter. If you  don’t want the chat window to auto-scroll, you can disable it by deselecting  the Auto Scroll check box below the text input field. The auto scroll places a  scroll bar in the text window when text fills it. Scrolling up may be useful if  you need to return to a question a student may post.  Figure 8-7:  A basic Chat  screen.             Managing and administering a chat  Moodle provides a number of features that enable you to manage your chat  session.  ✓ Refresh: Chat refreshes every five seconds, so don’t worry if you don’t   see your message right away. You may hear a sound every time it  refreshes.  ✓ Beeps: To get someone’s attention, you can click the Beep link on the   right next to her name, and she’ll hear a beep  if her sound is turned on .     Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  175                                If you want to beep everyone, enter beep all into the text field. If you want  your learners to respond to the beep, ask them to turn on their sound.  You can also ask everyone to turn off sound if it becomes annoying.  ✓ Internet addresses: Typing in any standard Internet address results in a   link and opens a new window with the Web page you wanted.  ✓ Smileys: You and your learners can type any emoticon supported by   Moodle, and it shows up as an appropriate smiley.  ✓ HTML: If you’re familiar with HTML, you can insert images, change text   color, or add sound to chat session.  You may want to limit how many students can enter a chat room. Working  with a large number can be difficult and time-consuming. Small groups work  best if you use the Chat module with your course, you may think about set- ting some protocols to manage sessions.      If several students are on Chat and a large number of replies come in within  seconds, Moodle Chat is known to freeze up. If you will use chat with large  groups, one option is to build a server daemon that takes the load off the data- base. For discussions and solutions, see http:  moodle.org mod forum  discuss.php?d=2947.  I post the following rules on the front page in the first week of every new  Moodle course:   ✓ Wait for the teacher moderator to ask for your questions. ✓ Do not use the beep unless you feel someone is not paying attention or   an answer question you posted is directed at the specific person.  ✓ If you just can’t wait to answer your questions  if you’re the student   who stands up and jumps up and down with a hand up , send a question  mark in the chat.  ✓ If you have an observation or a comment or you think something is   important, send an exclamation point in the chat and wait for the  speaker to acknowledge you.  ✓ Uppercase letters usually indicate shouting. A combination of upper-   and lowercase is difficult to read.  ✓ Give others time to respond. Don’t send a set of rapid messages. Often   it’s difficult to tell which response goes with which message. This is  very important if more than two people are using chat. I often enter the  learner’s name first and then answer his question, especially if several  questions come in before I can answer them.  ✓ Ask learners to not judge typing skills and typos and spelling errors.  Everyone makes errors, and you don’t want to set a standard where  others feel they have to be as careful in a chat as a forum. Some stu- dents won’t be active if judgment is used.   176 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                 Using Moodle Messaging  ✓ Think before you press Enter. This is important if students use this as an  in-class reward activity for finishing work. Chat transcripts are saved for  a long time. Tell your students to be polite to their classmates.  ✓ Use humor and sarcasm carefully. Humor and sarcasm are very dif-  ficult to interpret when people can’t see facial expression. Use smileys  for emotions.  You can use the standard smiley supported by Moodle.  Entering the characters into the text bar results in the smiley appearing  in the chat window — for example :-  makes the smiley.   The protocol you devise varies with the age group you teach; however, some  of the suggestions are relevant to all learners.  When you want to send private communications, Moodle messaging may be  the tool for you. Users can send private messages between instructor and  learner, between instructors, or between learners. Messages are not spe- cific to a Moodle course. If your organization has a Moodle site with many  different courses, all the people registered with the Moodle site can send  messages to each other. If you want to avoid clogging up your e-mail, this  is a fantastic alternative because Moodle messaging enables you to have all  Moodle course-related messages held within it.  Creating messages  You can send messages to other Moodlers from their profiles or from the  Message block. I recommend enabling the Message block to encourage learn- ers and instructors to send messages through Moodle because you can track  all messages from one place, and you know when the message has been read.  Messages are sent via a pop-up window, which saves you time because you  don’t have to open another messaging utility or e-mail. However, if some of  your learners avoid visiting the Moodle course, the messages are still sent to  their current e-mails registered with their student accounts. Your learners  won’t find an excuse for lack of notification and communication.  To send a message, follow these steps:  1.  Open a message window.    You can access the message window from your own profile page, the  button on the bottom Messages page, or the Message block. Each  learner has the Message button on their profile and can access the  Message block from the course front page. To enable the Message block,  refer to Chapter 3 for instructions.    Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  177                                             2.  Click the Search tab and enter the name of the person you’re sending   a message to.  3.  If the learner is in your course, select the Only in My Courses check   box and then click Search.   A message box opens with the name you entered in Step 2.  4.  Type your message and click the Send Message button.    Moodle copies the message, and it appears above the text field.  You can also send messages to a group of learners by selecting any number  of participants from the Participants block on the front page.  1.  Click the Participants link. 2.  Select which participant you want to send a message to by selecting  the check box next to the profile or clicking the Select All button at  the bottom.  3.  From the With Selected users drop-down list, select Add Send Message. 4.  In the text box, type your message and click the Preview button.    Moodle shows the message.  the Send button.  5.  Edit the message by clicking the Update button or send it by clicking   Managing and administering messages  Three tabs on the message window offer a few cool message features. One of  these is the Search tab, which I discuss in the preceding section. The other  two tabs are Contacts and Settings:  ✓ Contacts tab: After you send your first message to another Moodler, you  can add him to your contact list. Click the Add Contact link, and Moodle  creates a contact list and adds him. As well as adding a contact, you can  block a contact by clicking the round green button. You can also use  your contact list to remove contacts or see the history.  ✓ Settings tab: Enables you to select a number of options to manage your   messages and contacts.    Automatically Show Message Window When I Get New Messages:   Make sure your browser needs are set so it doesn’t block pop-ups  on your Moodle site.    Block All New Messages from People Who Are Not on My Contact List    Beep When a New Message Comes   Use HTML Editor   178 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     Version without Frames and JavaScript    Email Messages When I Am Offline: Offline means not on the   Moodle site. You can set up the time you are away and determine  the e-mail address where you want messages sent. Don’t forget to  save your changes.  Adding Notes about Your Learners  Notes are a useful tool that instructors can use to keep memos on learners’  performance, illness, or achievements. You can also use notes to share infor- mation about learners with the Moodle instructors of other courses. Notes  are not visible to learners; they are visible only to you, and you have the con- trol to make your note available to other instructors.  Creating notes  You can access the Notes page and create notes anywhere that you can click  a learner profile or from the Participants link on the front course page. To  create a note, take these steps:  1.  Click the Participants link in the People block on your course front   page.  2.  Select the check box next to the desired learner. 3.  From the With Selected Users drop-down list, select Add a New Note.    You can also find the Notes section on an individual student profile,  Notes tab. See Figure 8-8.   Moodle takes you to a new page with the learner’s name, a text box for  your note, and a drop-down list on the right of the note to select who  gets to view the note.                       Figure 8-8:  Ready to  add a new  note on the  Notes tab.      Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  179                                  4.  Write your note. 5.  Set privacy for your note by choosing an option from the drop-down   list next to your notes.   Your choices are    Personal: The note will be visible only to you.   Course: The note will be visible to other teachers’ accounts that   have access to your course.    Site: The note will be visible to other teachers in all courses on the   organization’ Moodle site. 6.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the participants list.  Student accounts or guest accounts don’t have access to the notes. The tab  does not appear on their profiles.  Using notes  Notes help you keep tabs on your learners and can be useful when you are  assigning projects, grading, or setting up groups. Do think carefully about  making a note available to a whole site. For example, if a school Moodle site  has 300 courses, the note you placed on the learner’s profile will be available  to all the teachers. This functionality is useful only if you want to share some- thing with many instructors that interact with the student  for example, if  your student won a scholarship or was in the hospital for an extended length  of time .  To look at your newly added note, select the learner profile, and you see a  number of tabs appear across the screen. The following list briefly describes  their functionality:  ✓ Click the Notes tab to go to the notes functionality. Under Personal is   the newly added note. See Figure 8-9.  ✓ From this Notes page, you can edit or delete the note by clicking the   blue link. For instance, you may want to make it available to the course.  From the Edit link, you have the drop-down list that allows you to  change the status of the note.  ✓ You can add new notes to Personal, Course, and Site. Notice that by   the Course option, you have a list of which courses the student is reg- istered for.   180 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 8-9:  Looking  at added  notes.             Adding Moodle Blogs to Your Course  Moodle blogs provide yet another way to enable you to creatively engage  your learners in self expression. The term blog comes from what now is an  ancient term Web log coined in the late ’90s. Moodle blogs — which can  be written and read by instructors and students alike — have replaced the  Moodle journal, which is still available but is no longer a default application.   If you want to use Moodle journals, you have to ask your administrator to  enable the feature. I recommend sticking with blogs, which your learners are  likely to think are a lot cooler than old-fashioned journals.   Don’t worry that the Moodle blog will be available to the whole world.  Moodle developers are very clever and have installed tools that enable you  to choose who views your blog entries. Also of note, each Moodle user can  have only one blog.  Effectively using blogs with your learners  As with all other projects and activities that you use with your learners,  Moodle blogs need to have a clearly defined learning goal, and you must  convey that to your class. Here are a few examples of how instructors and  teachers have found versatile uses for blogs:   ✓ Encouraging creativity: Writing about their personal experiences or   interests can be related to a project or left open-ended.  ✓ Enhancing reviewing and critical analysis: You can set up reviewing   and analysis around a lecture or presentation, and ask your learners to  briefly blog about the presentation. Present the class with a film and or  issues — give them five minutes to blog.    Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  181                ✓ Supporting writing skills: With younger learners, encouraging writing  about topics they’re interested in enhances all aspects of their educa- tion. They can keep a diary about their learning or any other topics. The  blog can be shared only between you and your student to keep personal  entries confidential.  ✓ Encouraging individual research projects: Students can use blogs to   collect information and keep a log of project work. You and your learner  can keep track of progress. This can take shape similar to a fieldwork  journal.  ✓ Encouraging group work: Learners working together can each keep a  blog on their part in a group project. It allows them to share and keep  track of each others’ work. Peer pressure helps to keep everyone on  track. For example, you can require each group member to write two  blog posts per week.  Blog tags  One cool feature of Moodle blogs is the use of blog tags, which are relevant  keywords and or terms used within a blog. These tags are one way to identify  a blog theme or find information in a blog. An instructor can enable blog tags  to be displayed on the course front page.  To keep learners focused on what they’re blogging about, ask them to iden- tify keywords  tags  that’d draw readers to their blogs. You can present it to  them by suggesting, “If you were looking for your own blog, what keywords  would you put into a search engine like Google?” Learners are very Google- savvy; they’re sure to understand this analogy. I discuss tags a bit more in  the following section.  Creating blog posts  If you plan to ask your learners to blog, I recommend you use your own blog  as an example. For instance, you can blog about topics like how to start blog- ging in Moodle and your expectation of blogging, ground rules for the blogs,  and how you will evaluate them if they’re part of an assessment exercise.  Your blog can be sort of a meta blog.  Unlike other Moodle resources or activities, blogs are user-based and found  on all participants profiles. To set up your blog, here’s what you do:  1.  On your profile page, click the Blog tab.    Moodle takes you to a new page.   182 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   2.  To add a new entry, click the Add a New Entry link  in the center of   the page or from the Blog menu on the right .   See Figure 8-10.   You’re taken to the blog editing page.  3.  Give your blog post a title  see Figure 8-11 .    This is a mandatory field, as denoted by the asterisk.  4.  Write your content or copy and paste it.    Don’t forget that if you’re pasting from Word, use the Word clean func- tionality feature. Alternatively, copy from Notepad.  5.  Click the Browse button to attach a picture or other file.                           Figure 8-10:  Click the  Add a New  Entry link.    Figure 8-11:  The blog  editing  page.      Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  183                     You should be familiar with the Browse and Add documents or  Pictures tool. This attachment functionality is that same used through- out Moodle and other applications, such as e-mail applications that  allow attachments.  6.  Use the Publish To drop-down list  shown in Figure 8-12  to set who   gets to read your blog.   You have three options:    Yourself: It’s good to start with restricting the blog for only you  to read. This allows you to draft it and to choose your keywords   which I discuss in the next step . When you’re happy with it, you  can change this setting to share the blog.    Anyone on Your Site: Your blog will be visible to all classes on the  organization’s Moodle site. Restrictions can be set to only groups,  teacher, and course through the Admin options. You need to have  administrative permissions or ask your IT to make the changes for  you. The changes are made in the site Administration block in the  security section.    Anyone in the World: You don’t see this third option in the drop- down list because by default, it’s disabled. Moodle blogs aren’t  available to be accessed by anyone on the Internet unless permis- sions are changed in the site Administration blog. Most administra- tors don’t allow this because it can pose security risks. If you want  your learners to have their blogs available on the Internet, you can  use Google’s Blogger  www.blogger.com  or Edublog  http:   edublog.org  and link to the blogs from your course front page.  Figure 8-12:  Choosing  options from  the Publish  To drop- down list.        184 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                   7.  Enter tags  keywords  so others can find your blog in searches.    Each blog post should have one or two tags linked to it. Tags are useful  for search term retrieval and grouping blog entries by subject matter.  Two types of tags exist:    Official tags: These tags are site wide, so they show across all  courses on a Moodle site. The system administrator needs to  enable official tags.    User-defined tags: Learners can create their own individual tags.   Try to minimize tags to no more than two because if you have  many learners blogging, and enable Blog Tag block on the course  front page, the list becomes too long and can look sloppy. Make  sure you use a comma to separate the tags.  8.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle takes you to your blog page  see Figure 8-13 . Your blog post is  in the center, your blog tags are on the left, and your tags for the site are  on the right.  Figure 8-13:  Your blog  page.       Administering blog posts  Moodle provides you with a number of editing tools to manage your blog and  blog tags from the Blog Menu block, in addition three links that under blog  posts: Edit, Delete, and Permalink.  Notice the four editing tools in the Blog Menu block in the upper-right corner   refer to Figure 8-13 :    Chapter 8: Adding Communication Modules  185                                   ✓ Add a New Entry: I explain this in the preceding section. ✓ View My Entries: See all your blog entries if you’re in your own blog. From   the Blog Tags block, you can view particular entries based on the tag. ✓ Blog Preferences: Clicking this menu item takes you to a new page   where you select how many blog entries are shown on a page. Moodle  sets the default to ten.  ✓ View Site Entries: Clicking this link lists all blogs on the Moodle site,   listed by most recent entry. If there are more than ten, you see a link to  page numbers and a Next button at the bottom of the page. All tags asso- ciated with the blogs are shown in a menu on the right.  Under each of your blog posts are three more tools that help you manage  your blog  refer to Figure 8-13 :  ✓ Edit: Takes you back to the same editing page where you created the   blog post. You can add or change tags, edit text, or change the title.  ✓ Delete: Clicking this link removes the post and all tags associated with   it. Moodle asks you to confirm the delete before it is removed.  ✓ Permalink: Clicking the Permalink link places the Web address of your   blog in your browser address bar, allowing you to copy the link and  send it to someone via e-mail. Remember that the person must have a  Moodle account to view the blog.  The Blog Tags block  If blogs are an important part of the learning goals you set out for your class,  you can encourage learners to read the blogs by placing their blog tags on  the front page. The blog tags are listed for all the blogs in a cluster known as  a tag cloud, and the most frequently accessed blog tag appears in a large font.  Tags are course wide, so if blogging is a one-to-one activity between you and  your learners, you do not want to use the Blog Tags block.  To add a Blog Tags block to your course’s front page, follow these simple  steps:  1.  On the course front page, click the Turn Editing On button in the top-  right corner.  2.  Find the Add Blocks block, located on the right side, and select Blog   Tags from the drop-down list.   The drop-down list has a number of operations for you to play with; for  instance you can edit the Blog Tags block, move the whole block, hide it,  and so on.   186 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   3.  Click the Edit link to configure the Blog Tags block.    Moodle takes you to the editing page. Both the Blog Tags block and the  editing page are shown in Figure 8-14.  4.  Adjust the settings to your liking.    You can change the following settings:    Blog Tags Block Title: Instead of Blog Tags, you can call it the name   of your course or activity.    Number of Tags to Display: The tags are displayed on your course  front page and on the blogs; I usually change the default 20 to 10.    Display Tags Used within This Many Days: Select from the drop-  down list how many days you want to leave tags on the front page.   Sort the Tags Display By: The drop-down list has two options: Tag   Text and Date Tag Was Last Used. Choosing the Date Tag Was Last  Used option quickly shows you which blog is getting the most  viewing.  5.  Click the Save Changes button.  Have fun blogging!                             Figure 8-14:  The Blog  Tags block   with editing  turned on   and the edit- ing page.     Chapter 9  Adding Collaborative Modules  In This Chapter ▶ Using wikis to foster learners’ involvement ▶ Crafting glossaries into learning modules ▶ Providing lessons that engage and challenge ▶ Making effective use of Moodle’s collaborative offerings  Adding collaborative modules to your Moodle course supports the edu-  cational philosophy of learning by doing activities with other learners.   That philosophy simply says that people learn from each other by sharing  information and constructing projects for all to use.  In this chapter, you find out how to create specific Moodle modules for the  learners in your course to use with you and or other learners. For example,  this chapter shows you how to create and manage a wiki that the course  participants can use to learn about a chosen topic. You also discover some  interesting uses for glossaries and use the Glossary module for collaborative  project work. You set up lessons that lead your learners to follow a guided  or branched path through information supporting their learning strategies.  When you incorporate these modules, you can turn passive learners into  active participants in your course.  Adding Wikis to Your Course  Wiki-wiki is a Hawaiian word meaning quick. In Moodle and other learning  content management systems  LCMS , a wiki is a collection of collaboratively  authored Web pages that are set up to be easy to add to and edit. The most    188 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   famous wiki is Wikipedia  www.wikipedia.org ; you and your class are  most likely familiar with this online encyclopedia.  Wikis can be powerful modules for collaborative activities because their  structure includes Web page–editing capabilities that help you coordinate  information between any number of class members. As a teacher, you can  decide whether the entire class can edit a wiki together, or you can create  group wikis that are editable by specific class members. Moodle ensures that  wikis are easy to set up and even easier to use, which makes them a great  resource for any type of course project.  Effectively using wikis with your learners  Use your imagination and make wikis work for you and your class. Teachers  and trainers use wikis in various ways: with a whole class, with multiple  classes, with groups  subdivisions of courses , or with specific learners for  individual research projects.  Here are a few ways that using a wiki can benefit your learners:  ✓ Encouraging creativity: Use wikis to encourage learners to upload   images, link to resources, use graphical editing options, and add sound  and or video clips as appropriate for the course. For example, a wiki  designed for an introductory fashion design course can allow class  members to get more creative by posting their fashion designs, linking  to fashion shows, adding designs by famous designers, and planning and  staging a show.  ✓ Encouraging group work: Use wikis to encourage learners to work in  groups on activities such as sharing lecture notes. For instance, you  can set up a group wiki for each topic or lecture to encourage learners  to share notes, add concrete examples, and decide what’s valuable to  review for exams.  ✓ Managing group projects: Assign a group project and give each group  a specific topic to post research, link to resources, create outlines and  presentations, or design and develop a product. For example, a graduate  student in my course, a teacher, who was reading the book The Outsiders   by S. E. Hinton  with her class set up group wikis around various ’60s  themes, such as hairstyles, music, culture, fashion, art, TV programs,  movies, and significant political events in the United States and around  the world. The kids loved it and had lots of fun creating the wiki pages   and learning while doing so .             Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  189     ✓ Enlivening individual research project work: Use the wiki to super-  vise individual project work that’s shared only between you and your  learner. Encourage your learner to use multimedia presentations, video,  sound, text, readings, debates, interviews, and reference lists to create  a project for assessment. You can use the wiki to observe and guide the  learner from the beginning stages starting with an outline.  Just think of how green you and your learners will be as you save mountains  of paper when you don’t require your learners to hand in paper-based proj- ect work.  Choosing the right wiki structure  You have standard information to fill in and choices to make when you set up  a wiki for your course. Preparing standard information for your wiki — such  as a name and a descriptive summary — may seem simple, but giving a little  thought to making these items informative, engaging, and intuitive for the  class is important. Some choices you make affect the overall wiki configura- tion and determine who has access to read, edit, and add to the wiki materi- als. Other options you must choose are more technical in nature and relate  to the level of complexity you want to incorporate.  The wiki name and summary description are required information in Moodle.  Give your wiki a name that ties it closely to the course outcomes, learning  objective, or specific project. In the summary field, describe the purpose of  the wiki and how it will be used as part of your course, or if it’s a wiki for a  project, describe how you expect participants to contribute to it and how  you’ll assess it.  After naming your wiki and adding a summary, you need to determine how  your wiki will be used with the course and set the appropriate permission  in the Type field. This field is important because the setting determines  who has editing permissions and can add to or help maintain the wiki, as  follows:           ✓ Teacher: Choose this option if you’re the only one with editing permission. ✓ Groups: Select the Groups setting if the group has editing and or view-  ing permissions.  ✓ Student: If students have editing permission, select this choice.   190 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Table 9-1 gives you a comprehensive explanation about setting options.  Wiki Types and Permissions  Table 9-1  Wiki Type  Teacher  or Trainer  Groups  Student   Individual  Learner  or  Trainee   Group Mode - No  Groups Only one wiki is  created, and only  the teacher can  edit it. Students  can view the wiki  and all contents.  One wiki for the  whole course  is set up. The  teacher and all  students can edit  the wiki.  The wiki is  student-teacher– based. Only the  student and  teacher can view  and edit this wiki.  Group Mode -  Separate Groups One wiki is set up  for every group, but  only the teacher  can edit the wikis.  Students from other  groups cannot view  the page. One wiki per group  is set up. Students  can edit the wiki  in their group only.  Other groups can’t  view the wiki.  Each student has  her own wiki,  which only the stu- dent and you can  edit. The wiki can  be viewed by other  students in the  group.  Group Mode -  Visible Groups Each group can  create one wiki, but  only the teacher  can edit the wiki.  All groups can view  the wiki.  Each group has its  own wiki, which  the group members  can edit. Other  groups can view  the wiki but can’t  edit it. Each student can  have her own wiki,  which only the stu- dent and teacher  can edit. The wiki  can be viewed by  all students in the  course.  Creating wikis  Creating and setting up a wiki are relatively simple processes. Moodle follows  the same editing procedure that you use when setting up other Moodle mod- ules.  See Chapter 3 for the discussion on basic editing procedures.  After  you’ve decided where you want to add the wiki, follow these steps:     1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the upper-right corner of your   course front page.    Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  191       The front page changes to show editing tools, allowing you to change  the appearance and add functionality to your course.   The editing tools are listed in Chapter 3 and on the book’s Cheat Sheet  at Dummies.com.  See the inside front cover for more details about the  Cheat Sheet.    Note the question mark icon next to certain features. Clicking this icon  opens a help window that explains Moodle specifics about that feature. 2.  Find the section or week in your course where you want the wiki to  appear. In each section, you should see two drop-down lists, one for  Add a Resource, the other for Add an Activity. Click the down arrow  next to Add an Activity and select Wiki from the list.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Wiki page, shown in Figure 9-1,  which has a similar layout to the pages for other activities — such as  setting up a forum, as outlined in Chapter 8.   The top portion of the Adding a New Wiki page is shown in Figure 9-1; you  have to scroll down to see the rest, which is shown next in Figure 9-2.                          Figure 9-1:  The set- tings on the  Adding a  New Wiki  page.    3.  Fill in the Name and Summary fields, which are required.       In the Summary description, if the wiki is meant to be used by learn- ers for a project, you may want to add requirements and state whether  you’ll use any assessment to evaluate class members’ work on the wiki.  Be as clear and concise as possible. Bullet points may help here.   192 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                4.  Select what type of wiki you want to set up from the Type drop-down list.    Your choice here sets the editing permissions, which I describe in the  preceding section.  5.  From the Print Wiki Name on Every Page drop-down list, select No if  you don’t want the name showing on every page; alternatively, leave  the default, Yes.  6.  Select the HTML setting from the HTML Mode drop-down list.    Usually, the default setting is HTML Only, which means you don’t see  the HTML tags.   Make your selection based on the technical skill level you have and the  skill level you expect from your wiki participants. Unless you and your  class are very familiar with HTML and want to add or change the look  and feel of the page, you may want to stick with the default HTML Only  setting and rely on the Moodle wiki editor, which allows you to view and  edit HTML source code using the toggle editing tool.  See Chapter 5 for  instructions on how to use the WYSIWYG editor.    The other two settings are No HTML, which shows all HTML tags, and  Safe HTML, which shows only certain tags.  7.  Continue selecting options that define the wiki’s allowable features.    Make choices for the following:    Allow Binary Files: Select Yes if you want to have the option of  uploading graphics, audio, video, and other nontext resources.  Your learners will have much more fun creating and viewing the  wiki if you allow them to add media. Text-based-only wikis are  boring!  You always want the option to upload various types of media   other than text  unless your IT support puts a tight cap on space  allowance. To combat this situation  should it arise , get your  picket signs out and march with your class to the IT office and  demand more space. Or picking up the phone or sending the IT  folks an e-mail may work also.    Wiki Auto-Linking Options: Select the check box next to Disable   CamelCase Linking if you don’t want Moodle to automatically  create a new wiki page when it sees a word with a capital letter at  the beginning and another capital letter somewhere in the middle.  For example, the name GeorgeWashington  no space between the  first and last name  creates a new wiki page.       Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  193      If you don’t disable CamelCase linking, you must make sure there’s  no space between the words you’re using to link! I tend not to use  CamelCase — it’s prone to causing errors whenever students type  text or copy and paste text into the wiki editor.  You can disable this feature because Moodle provides you with  another way to create new pages — by putting brackets around  the words. For example, if you discuss the [first moon landing],  putting brackets around these words, Moodle recognizes this as an  instruction to create a new wiki page, with the text in the brackets  becoming a link to the new page. I go into further detail on this in  the upcoming “Checking out a new wiki page” section.  8.  Select the check box next to the desired student admin options.    Moodle gives students specific editing and administrative privileges,  which you control. I cover each of these options in the next section.  9.  Type a name in the Page Name text box, shown in Figure 9-2.    Adding a name here is important only if you want the name of the first  page to be different from the name of the wiki.  10.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set  up any Moodle activity. Then click the Save and Return to Course  button.   Moodle saves your settings and returns your new wiki-editing page, as  shown in Figure 9-3. See Chapter 3 for a rundown of the Common Module  Settings.                        Figure 9-2:  Scroll down  to make all  your wiki  settings.     194 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 9-3:  A new wiki  page.       Managing and Administering Wikis  After you set up a wiki for your class or individual learners, you can start  creating new wiki pages. As you start using the wiki, you and your learners  will be inspired to find creative ways to present and use wiki content. This is  where the fun begins!  Checking out a new wiki page  Your new wiki page includes a number of features you and your learners  need to familiarize yourself with. Looking at your wiki page, Moodle first  displays the summary located above the tabs, as shown earlier in Figure 9-3.     Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  195  Above the main text area are five tabs you and your learners can click to  interact with your wiki. Here are descriptions for the tabs and what they do:  ✓ View: You and your learners see this tab when browsing the wiki. It is   the page you and your learners first come to when you click the wiki  from the front course page or when you first create the wiki. The View  tab includes a link to all the attached files for the wiki page.  ✓ Edit: From this tab, you can change content, attach files, and create new   wiki pages, as shown in Figure 9-4. Notice that I place brackets around  [Difference Engine], [Ada Lovelace], and [Charles Babbage], which tells  Moodle to create new wiki pages.  ✓ Links: The Links tab displays a list of all the titles of wiki pages that link   from the page. Each title is a link to that particular wiki page.  ✓ History: Check out the History tab to see the complete activity of the  wiki page. Every time learners click the Save button, they save a new  version of the wiki page, and the History tab shows you the changes,  who made them, and the date and time, as shown in Figure 9-5.  The History tab also offers three more cool functions:                    Figure 9-4:  Editing a  wiki page  and setting  up new wiki  pages using  words in  brackets.     196 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     Browse: Allows you to view every version of a wiki page.   Fetch-back: Fetches an old page for editing. Once changes are   made, it becomes the newest version of the page.    Diff: Highlights the differences between two consecutive versions  of the same wiki page. The additions have a plus sign  + , and dele- tions have a negative sign  - .  ✓ Attachments: On the Attachments tab, you can attach any type of file to  your wiki page, add a comment in the comments box, and give the image  a name that is different from the saved image file. The Attachments tab  also shows you who attached the file and the date it was attached. You  can link straight to the learner’s profile by clicking the name. Figure 9-6  shows the upload field, a linked image, and the name of the user who  added the image to the wiki page, a text box for comments, and a field to  enter the name.                   Figure 9-5:  Displaying  the layout of  a wiki his- tory page.    Each time you see a profile picture and name of a learner’s activity, you can  access his or her full profile by clicking the name.  Creating wiki pages  Accessing your wiki is simple. Moodle takes you right to your first page when  you set up the wiki, or you can go to it by clicking the wiki icon from your  front page. Then you’re ready to take these steps:    Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  197  Figure 9-6:  The Attach- ments tab.                             1.  Add content to your first wiki page by typing in the editing box.       You can copy and paste text from Notepad or another plain-text docu- ment into the editing box, or use the Clean Word function in the edit- ing box, as described in Chapter 5. But you can’t copy and paste text  straight from Word or other word processing software because you will  copy HTML code, which will make your page look messy.  2.  Place brackets around any words or phrases you want to act as links   to generate new wiki pages.   For example, earlier in the chapter in Figure 9-4, I placed brackets  around the words [Difference Engine], [Analytical Engine], and [Ada  Lovelace].  Note: I highlighted the words in yellow so they are visible in  the figure. Moodle software does not highlight the text.   3.  Click the Save button under the text box.    Moodle refreshes the page and thanks you for your contribution.   In the center, you can see your new text with a red question mark next  to the word or phrase you enclosed in brackets. This is a link to your  new wiki page.  4.  Click the red question mark, and Moodle takes you to the new editing   view page.   You or your learners can add content and create as many new links and  wiki pages, from every new page, as you need.   198 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Assigning wiki admin duties  For the successful evolvement of your wiki, and so that you and your learners  can experience the wiki as a fun and collaborative activity, you need to assign  administrative duties to your learners. A lot of learners will get a kick out of  being “wiki wardens.” If you use wikis in your course or in groups, choosing  group leaders with specific tasks will help manage the wiki. Administrative  tasks include monitoring new wiki pages, keeping an eye on most updated  pages, testing links between wiki pages and to external resources, and remov- ing wiki pages  called stripping pages . For example, you will want one of your  learners to help with removing old versions of all wiki pages, or the database  can quickly fill up. Every time someone adds a link, attachment, or any other  file to a wiki page, Moodle saves the old version.  There are three wiki management tools you will want to familiarize yourself  with. They are the Search Wiki, Choose Wiki Links, and Administration tools  located under the Moodle navigation bar. Each is described in more detail  here.  ✓ Search Wiki: Allows learners to find wiki pages that include specific   search terms. The search results list every page, as a specific link,  where the search term is found. For example, I entered Ada Lovelace  into the wiki search engine, and the search page returned five links.  See Figure 9-7.  ✓ Choose Wiki Links: Click the down arrow next to Choose Wiki Links to   explore your wiki in different formats. This is useful when looking for  information by means other than a search. These tools are also useful  to assist you or your learners to view wiki page activities. Wikis need to  be monitored to identify errors and whether you need to delete old wiki  pages or alter any content. You can view the wiki pages in the format  listed here:           Figure 9-7:  Search  results.      Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  199                                         Site Map: Moodle displays all the wiki pages by name, starting with   the first wiki page. Each name is also a link to that particular wiki  page.    Page Index: Lists all the pages in the wiki alphabetically. Each page   is a link.    Newest Pages: List most recently updated and created pages.   Most Visited Pages: Generates a number of most-visited wiki pages  with the hits  number of times it was visited . If you set up learners  to create individual wiki pages, you can give an award to the win- ning page based on visits. Alternatively, you may just want to keep  a check on high-traffic pages just in case learners swayed away  from the original task and decided to add something resembling  entertainment value to distract learners in the course.    Most Often Changed Pages: Keep an eye on a page that may be con-  stantly changed. You may find a wicked wiki battle is happening  between a few learners and clogging up your database.    Updated Pages: Displays wiki pages by time and date of last edit.   Orphaned Pages: These are standalone pages that were created but   all the links to them have been deleted.    Wanted Pages: These are pages that have not been created, but   identified by learners by placing brackets around text.    Export Pages: Moodle allows you to select your wiki pages and  export them as HTML files to a Zip folder you can download or  save in one of your Moodle directories.    File Download: Allows you to download all files that you or your   learners attached to wiki pages.  ✓ Administration: Click the Administration drop-down list to find tools that   you and your learners can use to keep your wiki running effortlessly.  For instance, you may want to look for orphaned pages using the Search  Wiki links tool discussed earlier, and delete them or reconnect them.  Orphaned pages are wiki pages that are not linked to or from another  page, or have no links in them to go to another wiki page — they are  stand-alone pages that no one would find. Learners may leave orphaned  pages if they frequently update and add files to wiki pages. Too many  orphaned pages can quickly take up database space, and you may find  your Moodle course using up your allocated server space.    Set Page Flags: Allows you to set specific permission for each wiki   page. See Table 9-2, which explains each flag.   200 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Table 9-2  Page Flags TXT BIN  OFF  HTM RO  WR  Setting Page Flags Permissions  Page Flag Properties Allows the wiki page to contain text. Allows binary  graphics  content. Short for offline. The page is there but can’t be read if learners  don’t have editing permissions. Allows HTML content instead of wiki default text. Short for read-only. Learners can read the wiki page but can’t  make changes. Means read-write or writable. Allows anyone in the course to  make changes.             Remove Pages: Allows you and your learners to remove orphaned   wiki pages. You need this tool because orphaned pages can’t be  reached through the wiki View or Edit tabs.    Strip Pages: The wiki keeps track of all changes and stores old ver-  sions in the database. It’s important you check the history and  occasionally delete all the old versions so the database doesn’t get  cluttered.    Revert Mass Changes: No need to panic. This tool allows you to roll   back the clock and restore an older version of the wiki if learners  make a mess of many pages in the wiki. You don’t need to share  with your learners that at a click of a button you can restore every- thing and clean up their catastrophic mess. Letting them stew  about their mistakes for a few minutes may be satisfying. Keep  paramedics on hand though.  Note: Students can work simultaneously on the same wiki but not on the  same wiki pages. Moodle informs students if a wiki page is being used  it is  locked , and they’ll have to try later.    Be sure your learners know that it’s important to save after editing because  if they open a page and forget to save the changes, the opened wiki page is  locked, and no one else can view or edit it. You or IT support can change  permissions, allowing learners to override locked pages. See Chapter 13 for  advice and information on how to change permissions.    Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  201  Adding a Glossary to Your Course  The Moodle glossary is a neat module for activities involving gathering  resources and sharing information. The glossary is simpler to use than the  wikis and lessons, and you can use it collaboratively with your learners,  encouraging your learners to find and present information. Be sure your  learners know that it’s important to save after editing because if they open a  page and forget to save the changes, the opened wiki page is locked, and no  one can view or edit it. You or IT support can change permissions, allowing  learners to override locked pages. See Chapter 13 for advice and information  on how to change permission and how to bribe your IT staff to do it for you.  A structure such as the glossary can be fun. Moodle enables you to create a  course glossary, or allow groups or individual learners to create their own.  The glossary will assist them in understanding the terms in context of the  assignment, project, or unit and will act as a resource for others.  Effective ways to use your glossaries  Use your imagination to add the Moodle glossary to your learning activities.  Learners can use it just like a dictionary, but the Moodle glossary is much  more than a word list your learners may need for your course. The features  allow you and your learners to share the glossary lists, add comments to  individual glossary entries, and link the glossary terms. Moodle allows you to  enable the glossary terms to be highlighted whenever they appear throughout  the Moodle site or in individual courses. The highlighted terms become links  to the entry in the glossary. You can use the Random Glossary Entry block to  show the glossary entries on your main course page — similar to Blog Tags,  explained in Chapter 8 — or set up a Question Answer format. The possibili- ties are endless if you forget the old definition of a glossary and start using the  Glossary module. You will quickly discover how flexible and extensible it is.  Here are a few successful uses of the glossary:  ✓ Collaborative glossaries: Learners work together to create a glossary of   unfamiliar terms related to the topic studied or project work.  ✓ Developing review questions for exams: Learners create glossaries   around questions and answers. They can link and enable note function- alities to add depth to the topic.  ✓ Project work: A collaborative research project allows learners to create   a resource for each topic, sharing it with others in the class.            202 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   ✓ Creating course directories: Learners can create a glossary entry for   themselves and add content. This can become a sharing and learn- ing activity if learners add resources to their entries. For example, a  summer trip to Rome can include links to places visited, local culture,  music, art, history, local cuisine, and so on.  Creating glossaries  Setting up a glossary is simple. Moodle follows the same process you find  when setting up other Moodle activities  such as forums, as described in  Chapter 8, and the wikis described in this chapter .  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the top-right corner of your course   front page.   The front page changes to show editing tools, allowing you to change  the appearance and add functionality to your course. The center of the  front page displays two drop-down lists in every week or unit of your  course: Add a Resource and Add an Activity. The editing tools are listed  in the Cheat Sheet and explained in Chapter 3.  2.  Click the down arrow next to Add an Activity in the section of the  course where you want the glossary to appear, and select Glossary  from the drop-down list.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Glossary page, shown in Figure 9-8.  The page has similar layout to the pages for other activities you may have  set up — such as the wiki, as outlined in the earlier in the chapter. If you’ve  already created wikis, you will find creating a glossary easy going!                    Figure 9-8:  The set- tings on  the Adding  a New  Glossary  page.      Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  203                                       3.  Fill in the glossary Name and Summary fields, which are required.    In the Summary field, you may want to add instructions on how the glos- sary should be used and state whether you’ll use any assessment to  evaluate learners’ work on the glossary. Be as clear and concise as pos- sible. Bullet points may help here.  4.  Continue selecting the general options defining the glossary’s allow-  able features.   Make choices for the following options:    Entries Shown per Page: Decide how many words and definitions   will be displayed to learners at any one time. The default is 10.    Is the Glossary Global? It is usually decided by administrators of   the Moodle site. As a teacher, you may not have permission to acti- vate this setting. If the permission is set, glossary terms appear for  every course on the Moodle site.    Glossary Type: Decide whether the glossary is main or secondary.  You can export entries from a secondary glossary to a main glos- sary. The default is Main.    Duplicated Entries Allowed: Select Yes if you want to allow for more   than one definition for any term.    Allow Comments on Entries: Selecting Yes enables learners to add   comments to any definition. Moodle makes the comments avail- able through links at the bottom of the definition section.    Allow Print View: Selecting Yes allows learners to link to a printer-  friendly page.    Automatically Link Glossary Entries: If you select Yes, Moodle high- lights and links all words in the course to the glossary definition.  To be able to automatically link glossary entries, the autolinking  feature needs to be enabled in the Site Administration Block in the  Modules section, in the Filter sub-section. Your system administra- tor needs to enable this if you don’t have administrative privileges.  See Chapter 13 for more information on how to do this.    Approved by Default: Decide if you will allow learners to add entries   with or without your approval required.    Display Format: Decide how you want the glossary to appear to  your learners. I recommend that you figure out how you want to  use the glossary and then choose a style. It’s fun to experiment.  Remember that you can easily delete any module you are not  100-percent happy with. Click the drop-down list and select one of  the following.         204 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                             You are familiar with Simple Dictionary Style, where authors are not  shown and attachments appear as links only. Continuous without  Author displays all entries and editing icons. Encyclopedia is similar  to the Full with Author format, but attached images are displayed.  Entry List style displays terms and concepts as links. FAQ is a very  cool format showing a list of frequently asked question. Moodle  automatically attaches a term as a Question and displays the  concept and definition as an Answer. Full with Author is similar  to a forum format, showing attachments as links. Finally, Full  without Author is the same as Full with Author but doesn’t display  authors’ data.    Show ‘Special’ Link: Select Yes as prompted if you want to enable   your learners to browse the glossary by selecting the first character  of a word. Special Link shows characters like $, , @, %, &, and ?.    Show Alphabet: Select Yes to allow your users to browse the glos-  sary with ease, using the alphabet displayed as tabs.    Show ‘ALL’ Link: Select Yes if you want to allow your learners to  view all glossary entries at once. I usually select No because the  alternative browsing options are familiar to most learners.    Edit Always: Selecting Yes assigns editing permissions to you and   or your learners for all entries.  5.  Choose the Grade options as you would when you set up any Moodle   activity allowing grading.   For example, you can set up glossary grading scales as you set up the  forum grading, as outlined in Chapter 8.   Make choices for the following:    Allow Entries to Be Rated: If you select the check box next to User   Ratings, the grayed-out choices become highlighted.    Users: This option allows you to grade or enable learners to grade  the entry and definitions. Select Only Teachers or Everyone from  the Users drop-down list.    Grades: Select the down arrow next to Grades to choose a grading   scale.    Restrict Ratings to Entries with Dates in This Range: Select the check   box if you need to restrict when learners can grade, and then  select the down arrows next to From and To.  6.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would when you set up   any Moodle activity and then click the Save and Return to course  button.   See Chapter 3 for a rundown of the Common Module settings.    Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  205  Moodle saves your settings and returns you to the course front page. You  can see the newly added glossary icon with its title in the week or unit where  you first set it up.  This book’s Cheat Sheet at Dummies.com has all the Moodle icons. For more  information about the Cheat Sheet, see the inside front cover.  Managing and Administering Glossaries  After you create your glossary for your class or individual learners, you can  start populating it with entries. I suggest you add a few entries and attach an  example file when you first introduce the glossary to your course.  Checking out a glossary page  When you and your learners first view the newly created glossary page, it  may look baffling because it appears quite busy with many features. It’s actu- ally easy to use, and your learners will have a lot of fun populating it when  you start adding entries.  Click the glossary icon from the course front page.  It’s located in the week or  unit where you set up the glossary.  Moodle opens the glossary, as shown in  Figure 9-9.  Figure 9-9:  A new  glossary  page with  an entry.        206 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                           ✓ Browsing the glossary: Notice the four large browsing tabs in the   center.  letter.    Browse by Alphabet: Learners are able to look up words by its first     Browse by Category: You can create categories for your glossary  and then learners can use them when looking for specific words.  For example, you can create categories for each unit topic and  add related entries. To learn how to set up categories, see the  next section.    Browse by Date: If learners will add content to the glossary, brows- ing by author is useful to keep track of who is participating in the  assignment.  ✓ Import Entries and Export Entries: In the top right under the Update   This Glossary button, you see two links allowing you to import and  export glossaries. You can import a glossary from another course, or  this course, and you can export a glossary to a file that you can down- load to your computer or another Moodle course. Importing and export- ing are outside the scope of this book; if you need details, visit http:   docs.moodle.org, or access the Moodle forums at http:  moodle. org, or go to this book’s companion Web site at www.dummies.com  go moodlefd.  ✓ Waiting approval: If you set the Approval default to No when you set up  the glossary, after your class begins to add entries you see an additional  link with a number, in brackets, telling you how many words are waiting  for your approval before they can be added to the glossary. When you  click the link, you’re taken to a page with a list of these new entries, and  a check box next to each.  ✓ Printer icon: If you set Allow Print View to Yes when you set up the glos- sary, you see a small printer icon right under the Import Entries Export  Entries links. Your learner can click the printer icon to print the entries  and definitions in a printer-friendly format.  ✓ Search: You and your learners can search for terms by entering the key   term in the field located right above the browsing tab. If you want to  search for an entry anywhere in the text, select the check box next to  the text entry field.  When you understand the layout of the glossary page, you can start adding  terms to your glossary. If you plan to use the glossary as a collaborative exer- cise, add a few terms, definitions, and notes to demonstrate to your learners  how the glossary looks. I advise you to take your students through a short  tutorial, emphasizing how the activity is related to the learning goal or the  course or project. If you use one glossary across a number of units or topics,  you may want to think about categorizing the terms, enabling your learners  to search by categories.    Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  207                                              To add a new glossary entry, take these steps:  1.  Click the Add a New Entry button located in the middle of the glos-  sary page.  The earlier Figure 9-9 shows the button.    Moodle takes you to the Add a New Entry page. Notice the name of your  glossary at the top of this page.  2.  Fill in the new word or concept in the Concept field. 3.  Fill in the definition and or explanation in the text box. 4.  If you have set up categories for your glossary, choose the category   where the new term belongs by highlighting the category name in the  selection box.   See the upcoming “Adding categories” section if you need to know how  to add categories.  5.  If it would be useful to your course members, add synonyms in the   field next to Keyword s .   If you have more than one synonym, enter one word per line in the text  field.  6.  Click the Browse button next the Attachment field to add a file to your   glossary term.   The file can be any type, text, graphics, sound.  7.  If you or your learners require the term to appear as a link, select the   check box next to This Entry Should Be Automatically Linked.   Activating the automatically linked functions enables you to choose  from the following options:    This Entry Is Case Sensitive: Select this option if correct case is a   requirement for the word s .    Match Whole Words Only: Select this option if you want to match   whole words  concept  or part of a word.  8.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle saves the new term and returns you to the main glossary page.  Commenting on entries  If you selected Yes for the Allowing Comments on Entries option when you  first set up the glossary, you and your learners can see small icons at the  bottom right of the glossary for each term added.  You can see the icons in  the earlier Figure 9-9.    208 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                              Figure 9-10:  Adding  categories  to your  glossary.    ✓ Speech bubble icon: Click the icon, and a text box appears for comments.   As with all editing additions and changes in Moodle, you have to click  the Save button for Moodle to make changes and return to the term with  the new comment right below it.  ✓ Editing and delete icons: You and your learners can edit and delete the   comments.  The comment will appear right under the term and next to the bubble icon.  Moodle tells you how many comments are associated with the term.  Figure  9-9 shows one comment.  If you enabled the author details to show, you can  link to the author’s profile.  Adding categories  To add a category, here’s what you do:  1.  On the main glossary page, click the Browse by Category tab.    Moodle takes you to the Edit Categories page.  2.  Click the Edit Categories button.    Moodle refreshes the screen, taking you to the Categories page, where  you can add and edit categories. Click the Add Category button to get to  the Add category page shown in Figure 9-10.  3.  Give the new category a name and decide whether you want to link   the category as well as the term.   I recommend against linking the category name because any occurrence  of the words will be linked, and when your learners click the link, they’re  taken to the Browse by Category page instead of the main glossary page.  This may be confusing.  4.  Click the Save Changes button, and Moodle returns you to the Add   Category page.    Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  209    If you don’t want to add another category, click the Back button, and  Moodle returns you to the Browse by Category page. Notice you can see  your new category in the drop-down list located in the right side under  the tabs  as shown in Figure 9-11 .        Figure 9-11:  Find your  category in  the drop- down list.    Adding Lessons to Your Course  In Moodle, a lesson is an activity that’s structured to adapt answers to  questions and send learners to different pages of the lesson based on their  answers. Moodle adapts to the learner so content can be interesting and  ever-changing. Lessons are most useful  and fun  when you’re presenting  branched or guided content or an assessment activity because these types of  lessons enable learners to follow their own paths through the information.  Unlike other activities in Moodle, creating lessons is more complicated, but  if you spend time planning them, you will quickly find they aren’t as tricky as  they may first appear. Taking extra time thinking and organizing your content  will benefit the lesson’s success and usefulness. Go on; jump in and have fun!  Effectively using lessons with learners  Classroom activities can support various learning styles that involve remem- bering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating new  knowledge. One of your main goals as an educator is for your learners to put  to use new knowledge and be creative. The unique aspect of a Moodle lesson    210 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                  activity over other Moodle activities is that you enable your learners to drive  the lesson. Structuring is tied to a learning objective based on the choices  learners make on each page. Here are a few examples of how you can use  Moodle lessons for instructional and or assessment purposes:  ✓ Branched assignment or quiz: Set up questions where each correct   answer allows the learner to continue; if the learner answers incorrectly,  Moodle loops back to display more information before allowing the  learner to answer the question again. Question types can be multiple  choice, matching, true false, and essay, though the essays require you  to correct them.  ✓ Flashcards: You can set up lessons to test knowledge or for review,   like a stack of flashcards  which most learners are familiar with .  Vocabulary, multiplication tables, sign language, geography, new policy,  quotations, anatomy, periodic table elements — these are just few exam- ples of successful uses of lessons.  ✓ Case studies: Learners are presented with a real-life situation and, as   they proceed through the lessons, they need to decide what to do next.  For example, case studies have been used with CPR training, where  learners need to learn and understand a sequence of steps to save vic- tims from choking or heart attacks.  ✓ Role play: By using simple role play, your learners can take on the per- sona of a literary character  such as Hamlet or Huck Finn  and answer  a set of multiple choice questions leading them to scenarios where they  have to demonstrate they have read the material. If the learner chooses  an incorrect answer, you can structure the role play to take her back to  an explanation, or refer her to specific parts in the book. As stated pre- viously, you need to structure the lesson and decide what type of feed- back you use for incorrect answers.  Choosing the right lesson  Before you start building your lesson, you need to decide which type of  lesson page style you want to use. Only you will be able to view the page  structure; your learners will see only the questions. They will not see that  the way they answer the questions determines what they are presented with  next, such as the path through the lesson.  ✓ Branching page: Give your learners choices to select an option from a   branch presented as a chain of questions. Because there is no correct or  incorrect answer for each response, the choices are not graded. When  learners complete a chain, they’re returned to the branch table and  choose another one or end the lesson.    Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  211                             ✓ Question page: You can set questions requiring your students to provide  a correct answer. Depending on the answers you have set up, the learners  are taken to another question or looped back. The question page allows  you to include information, instructional content, and graphics before dis- playing the question. You can set scoring for question pages.  Creating lessons  Structuring and organizing your content are the most challenging parts of  creating a lesson activity for your learners. Before you start, I recommend  drawing a flowchart after deciding which type of lesson you want to set up.  The flowchart should include the following:  ✓ How you will represent the first page ✓ The number of options you have and where each option leads the   learner  ✓ Where you want to give feedback or hints  More than one option can lead to the same information. Wherever it makes  sense to do so, be sure to reuse pages! Reusing pages keeps your page num- bers smaller.  When Albert Einstein was asked about the most difficult part of his work on  the theory of relativity, he replied, “thinking about the problem.” To assist  you with planning and structuring a lesson activity, you can download a  template from this book’s companion Web site at www.dummies.com go  moodlefd.  The general settings that come first are similar to settings for other activities   such as the wiki and glossary outlined earlier in this chapter . Dive right in  and create a lesson by following these steps:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the top-right corner of your course   front page.   The front page changes to show editing tools allowing you to change the  appearance and add resources and activities to your course. The editing  icons are listed on the Cheat Sheet and in Chapter 3.  2.  Locate the week or unit in your course for which you want to add   the lesson, click the down arrow next to Add an Activity, and select  Lesson from the drop-down list.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Lesson to Week page, shown in  Figure 9-12, which has a similar layout to pages for other activities you  may have set up.   212 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 9-12:  Add a new  lesson.                                 Don’t let the long list scare you away — I promise most settings can be  left as default and updated later. Play, test, get your hands dirty, and  have fun!     3.  Fill in the Name field, which is required. 4.   Optional  Select the check box next to Enable if you want to set a   time limit for the lesson. The field and text come to life. Add the time  limit in minutes.   By setting a time limit on the lesson, if learners run out of time, Moodle  allows them to finish the lesson, but questions are not counted.  5.  Select a number from the Maximum Number of Answers Branches   drop-down list.   I advise to choose a higher number so you don’t limit yourself. For  example, if you put only 4, you’re limiting yourself to only four multiple- choice or matching answers or four branches. You can always change  the settings later on.  6.  Fill in the Grade Options section if the lesson will be used for   assessment.    Practice Lesson: Select Yes if you want the lesson to be only used   for practice. The scores won’t be recorded in the grade book.    Custom Scoring: Select Yes if you want to score each question   independently.    Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  213                                    Maximum Grade: Select a value from the drop-down list. I tend to  set the grading to 100 unless I know I have a set of 10 or 20 ques- tions and then assign each to be worth 10 or 5 points. Working  with 100 gives you the most flexibility. If you leave this setting at 0,  Moodle knows you aren’t using the lesson for assessment.    Student Can Re-Take: Selecting Yes allows students to go through  the lesson questions and re-enter answers. If you set this to Yes,  you need to decide how you want Moodle to handle the scoring,  which is what the next option is for.    Handling of Re-Takes: From the drop-down list selecting Use Mean  or Use Maximum tells Moodle how to assess learners at the end of  the lesson if they retake the lesson. If you selected No for the pre- ceding option, Moodle ignores this setting.    Display Ongoing Score: Selecting Yes shows learners how they’re   doing as they progress through the lesson.  7.  Fill in the Flow Control section  shown at the bottom of Figure 9-12 .    These settings allow you to set how learners will move through the  lesson. Learners can move at different paces depending how you set up  the reviews, attempts, and feedback in the lesson settings.    Allow Student Review: Selecting Yes allows your learners to move  through the lesson again from the start or back and forth to check  answers.    Display Review Button: If you select Yes, a review button is dis-  played under incorrectly answered questions. The learner will see  “Yes, I’d like to try again” and “No, I just want to go on to the next  question.” The learner is given another chance to answer a particu- lar question before a penalty is given.  If you’re using essay questions, leave the default setting for Review  button set to No because it isn’t compatible with this type of  assessment.    Maximum Number of Attempts: If you allowed your learners to use  the review functionality, you now need to set how many attempts  they’re allowed before a penalty is set. For example, if you set  a matching question with eight different matches, you may set  the penalty to 3, meaning the learner can choose three different  options before he is penalized for an incorrect answer and moved  to the next page.    Action after Correct Action: Select from the drop-down list what you   want the learners to see after they answer a question.  Normal - Follow Lesson Path: You want to direct learners to a  page following the correct answer.      214 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course    Show an Unseen Page: You can direct your learners to a randomly  selected new page they have not seen before if they answer the  question incorrectly. You will find this setting useful with flash- card-type questions and exercises.  Show an Unanswered Page: You can set this option if you want  to see the page again, but it will be shown only if they have not  answered the question correctly. This setting is most useful with  flashcard exercises to give your learners another chance if they  did not get a correct answer.    Display Default Feedback: If you don’t want to set up your own   feedback, leave this setting to Yes. Moodle’s default feedback is  That’s the correct answer That’s the wrong answer.    Minimum Number of Questions: Leave the default 0 unless your  lesson is set for grading. Learners are told how many questions  they have attempted and how many they are expected to attempt  before their work is graded. Each learner will have to answer the  minimum number generated to receive a grade. If the learner  answers fewer questions, his grade will be based on the value at  which you set it.    Number of Pages  Cards  to Show: You use this setting only if you’re  using a flashcard lesson. Select the number of cards you want your  learners to view. Once the student sees all the cards, the lesson  ends. See the next section for instructions on how to effectively set  up a flashcard lesson.  8.  Fill in the Lesson Formatting section.    You have to scroll down to see this section, as shown in Figure 9-13.                         Figure 9-13:  Set your  lesson- formatting  preferences.      Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  215                                         Moodle lets you present the lesson as a slide show. The default is No.  If you leave it set to No, you don’t need to worry about the following  settings.   Selecting Yes from the drop-down list activates the slide show and a few  options for customizing it.    Slide Show Width and Slide Show Height: The default settings are  same for all the pop-up window options used with the resources.  You can make this window smaller or larger, though I recommend  you do not make it much smaller than the default.    Slide Show Background Color: The Moodle default is white. Choose  a different HTML color code if you want to change the background  of the lesson.  Changing the color requires you to enter an HTML character color  code reference. Remember to use the six-character HEX value in  the field.       Display Left Menu: Selecting Yes displays a navigation bar on the   left side allowing your learners to jump slide to slide. Without this  bar, learners have to proceed through the slide show in order  and exit only when they finish. You can set a percentage grade for  learners to achieve before allowing them to jump freely reassuring  you they’ve completed the lesson to an acceptable standard before  you allow the freedom to roam.    Progress Bar: Selecting Yes from the drop-down list enables learn-  ers to view their progress at the bottom of the lesson page.  9.  Fill in the Access Control section.    Selecting these settings gives you options to place various restrictions  on the lesson.    Password Protect Lesson: If you select Yes, you’re required to enter   a password. Your learners need to enter it before they can begin  the lesson. If you forget your password, selecting the Unmask  check box shows you what you’ve entered.    Available From and Deadline: Entering dates and times in which   learners have to complete the lesson.  10.  Select the Dependent On settings.    These settings allow you to set conditions on the lesson activities pre- ceding the lesson.   If you’ve set this lesson as a practice lesson or if this is your only lesson,  you cannot set dependency values, and Moodle defaults to None. If you  have more than one lesson, select the lesson that this one is dependent  on from the drop-down list and then make the following selections:   216 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     Time Spent: Requires your learners to spend a specific time on the   previous lesson. Enter a value in minutes or leave it at 0.    Completed: Requires your learners to have completed the lesson   selected.    Grade Better Than %: Setting a required percentage restricts the   learners to achieve a certain grade to access the lesson.  11.  Fill in the Pop-Up to File or Web Page section.    This section is at the bottom of the Adding a New Lesson page. The  options are shown in Figure 9-14.    Click the Choose or Select File button, which is standard to most soft- ware and discussed in Chapter 3. The file or page will be displayed in a  separate window at the beginning of the lesson.   Enabling a file or a Web page is useful if you want your learners to see,  read, or hear a file or Web site before or during the lesson. For example,  you can show your learners an image  such as a map  that they can  use to answer specific questions. Or you can use a sound file of spoken  words for any language course if part of your lesson is built around oral  comprehension.    Show Close Button: Default setting No restricts learners to close the   window. Selecting Yes allows learners to close it.    Window Height and Width: Change the default settings if you require   a different size. You can always go back and change the window  after viewing the lesson. Notice that these are required fields.                               Figure 9-14:  Adjust how  windows  display.      Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  217                      12.  Review the Other option settings, which give you more flexibility and   save you time when creating the next lesson.    Link to an Activity: Selecting an activity from the drop-down list will   display it at the end of the lesson. All activities you have created  will be listed. If you don’t choose anything, Moodle will return the  learner to the front page.    Number of High Scores Displayed: This is a required field and   ignored if the lesson is set as a practice lesson. Choose a high  score, and the learners achieving the highest score will be able to  enter their names.  This feature is useful for igniting the competitive nature of your  students, or if they’re an inactive bunch, bribery can work.    Use This Lesson’s Settings as Defaults: Selecting Yes will save all   your settings for the next lesson you’ll be preparing. This is a very  useful feature if you need to prepare a series of similar activities,  such as flashcards or case studies.  13.  Choose the Common Module Settings as you would have when you set   up any Moodle activity and then click the Save and Return to Course  button.   Chapter 3 describes the Common Module Settings.   Moodle saves your settings and returns you to the course front page.  You can see the newly added lesson icon with its title in the week or unit  where you first set it up.     Managing and Administering Lessons  After you set up the core structure of the new lesson for your learners, you  can start populating it with content and questions. It isn’t as difficult as you  may think, but because it’s an activity enabling you to create instruction and  assessment, it’s more time-consuming than some of the other activities —  but well worth it!  Checking out a lesson page  After you first create a new lesson, click the lesson icon on the course front  page, and Moodle takes you to a How to Add Lessons to Your Class page,  with the Edit tab open.  See Figure 9-15.  Here you have four options:   218 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   ✓ Import Questions: Allows you to import from different formats such as   Microsoft Word, Hot Potatoes, Blackboard, and Examview, creating a  question for each.  ✓ Import PowerPoint: Slides from a presentation are imported as branch   tables, including previous and next answers.  ✓ Add a Branch Table: Creating a branch table provides your learners with  a method of moving through pre-order pages where you create branches  or paths. The main difference between branch pages and question pages  is that branch pages enable learners to choose their own paths through  the information. They don’t receive page responses, and moving through  the lesson doesn’t impact their grade. If you want students to move  through the information in a specified order, there’s no reason for you to  use branch table lessons; instead use the question page.  ✓ Add a Question Page: Question pages are similar to branch pages but   with more exciting functionality. Your learners see content, which is fol- lowed up by a response. Answering the question makes Moodle respond  with a response and a Continue button that takes them to the appropri- ate page. You can use question pages for assessment, and the results  will show in the learners’ grade book.                    Figure 9-15:  An editing  page for a  newly cre- ated lesson.    If this is the first time you’re creating a lesson, I recommend you start with a  question page.  Creating a question page lesson  Question page lessons are ideal for delivering content and a follow-up ques- tion or response, ensuring that your learners are assimilating and under- standing the content.  To begin, click the Add a Question Page link from the editing page shown earlier  in Figure 9-15. It’s the last link under Moodle’s question, “What would you like     Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  219  to do first?” Moodle takes you to a new Add a Question page  see Figure 9-16 ,  showing six tabs, one for each question type — multiple choice, true false,  short answer, numerical, matching, and essay.  Figure 9-16:  Choose  the type of  question  you’d like  to add.                        1.  The Multiple Choice tab should be opened. If not, click the Multiple   Choice tab.  2.  Select the Multianswer check box if your multiple-choice questions   require students to choose more than one answer.  3.  Fill in the Page Title field.    Giving the page a descriptive title is useful for you and your learners.  You can organize your questions by titles. Your learners can see the title  after completing the lesson.  4.  In the Page Contents field, add the page content including your first   question.   If you’re creating a flashcard, entering a question is all you need to do in  this part.     5.  In the Answer 1 box, enter a possible answer to the question, as   shown in Figure 9-17.   220 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 9-17:  Entering  answer  choices and  responses.                                       6.  In the Response 1 box, enter a response for the answer.    In my example, it’s useful to place the first answer as the correct one, so  I entered Well done! and then gave further explanation. Moodle shuffles  the questions and answers every time it displays them to learners.  7.   Optional  Select an option from the Jump 1 drop-down list, which   determines what page the learner sees next.   By default, for the Jump 1 drop-down list, Moodle takes the learner to  the next page and question. This jump assumes that the first answer  was the correct one. You can change the setting to take learners else- where if they make an error.   By default the Jump 2–4 drop-down lists have Next Page selected,  assuming answers 2–4 are incorrect.  8.  Enter the score for the answer in the Score field. 9.  Continue to fill in the following Answer boxes, Response boxes, Jump   drop-down lists, and Score fields.   This may sound silly, but be sure you create a correct answer.  10.  When you finish, click the Add a Question Page button at the bottom   to go to a new lesson construction page.   The four tabs shown in Figure 9-18 allow you to manage your lesson.    Preview: Selecting this tab enables you to view the questions.   Edit: Shown in Figure 9-19, this is your main workspace. Notice   right under the Edit tab, two links: Collapsed View and Expanded     Chapter 9: Adding Collaborative Modules  221  View. Collapsed View shows your questions in a table format,  allowing you to edit the question, and it has a drop-down list for  action functionality.  The Expanded view  shown in Figure 9-20  shows details of the  question and offers a number of further options:  Import Questions: Allows you to import questions from your com- puter’s hard drive without having to go back to the main page.  Add a Cluster: You can add specific questions to a cluster, and  Moodle randomly chooses the questions. You may find this useful  if you want different questions to pop up for different students.  Selecting the Random Question within a Cluster option, from the  Start Cluster menu enables most options.                 Figure 9-18:  Lesson  construction  pages with  your first  question.    Figure 9-19:  Your main  workspace.     222 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 9-20:  Additional  editing  options.                    Add an End of a Cluster: One cluster question has to be desig- nated as an end of a cluster, acting as a jumping point to direct  learners to more questions or information pages.  Add an End of Branch: If you’re using branching pages and tables,  you should end each branch with an end page, which directs learn- ers to the last branch table so they can choose another branch or  activity.    Reports: Click this tab to see an overview or a detailed report of   individual learners’ activity within the lesson. The overview is the  default setting.    Grade Essays: Clicking this tab leads you to options to grade essay  questions. If you didn’t set essay questions in the lesson, nothing  is displayed under the tab.  The lesson module has many more cool features, functionality, and options  such as creating flashcards. Because I don’t want to scare you off with too  many pages, I offer more instructions with accompanying examples on this  book’s companion Web site at www.dummies.com go moodlefd.  Go on. Start planning your first lesson and have fun. Your learners will think  you’re the coolest instructor!   Chapter 10  Creating Assignments  In This Chapter ▶ Using the Assignment module ▶ Constructing online and offline assignments ▶ Managing submissions  The Moodle Assignment module provides you with means to grade and   give feedback on learners’ work created online or created offline and   then uploaded. The work is not graded automatically, like the Quiz module,  though once assigned, you can input the grades and feedback in Moodle, and  your learners can view the grades and feedback in their grade books. The  Assignment activity module has two broad categories:  ✓ Offline: Learners can complete work on their computers and then   upload the files from their hard drives, or you can present the material  offline, in a traditional classroom setting.  ✓ Online: Learners can complete the assignment requirements online.  You can think of this activity module as a catch-all for anything that you want  to set and record in the course Moodle grade book that cannot automatically  be marked by the Moodle Quiz module.  Effective Ways to Use Assignments  Instructors can be very creative when selecting and assigning work to their  students. You may not necessarily like evaluating performance with a test  only. The Assignment module is designed to support you in setting any type  of work, and Moodle lists it in a number of places such as the calendar, grade  book, and Activities block on the front page. You can give feedback and add  grades to the posted assignments. The Assignment module allows learners to  do the following:  ✓ Upload content for grading: This content can include essays, pre-  sentations, Web pages, audio or small video clips, spreadsheets, and             224 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                     photograph portfolios that students have completed and saved to their  hard drives.  ✓ Complete work online: Students can write essays and reports and   answer questions online.  ✓ Take part in case studies: Case studies usually have a more entailed   process and are completed over time. They usually have several distinct  parts, are like puzzles to solve, and are an excellent learning tool that you  can use with the Assignment module. A case study usually comprises  basic information that defines the problem, a method to resolve the  issue, and data that supports the results conclusion. For disciplines like  math, statistics, and engineering, this format may differ and have more  distinct parts than medical, law, or business case studies. For example,  I set up a case study for my graduate school learners; it involved setting  up a scenario of students taking a course online, giving the graduate  learners some information about the makeup of the class  student demo- graphics , and asking them to look at different learning styles and how  they can be supported in an online environment. Next, I asked them to  set up a demo course online and then test it with a few students. Finally, I  asked my learners to report their findings and write a summary.  ✓ Participate in project work: For example, when I teach Moodle courses,  I assign mini projects requiring learners to set up various Moodle activi- ties. These are set and listed as assignments, and I mark them offline,  and then give a grade and feedback to the learners in Moodle online, and  the grades are published to the grade book along with the feedback.  The Moodle Assignment module is set up with four assignment types that  give you flexibility to set work, review and mark the work, and then later add  feedback to the assignments. The four types are  ✓ Upload Single File: Learners can upload a file in any format, including a   Zip file.  ✓ Offline Activity: This can be any activity performed outside of class that  cannot be viewed or assessed by Moodle. An offline activity may be, for  instance, a presentation, debate, play, or a physical creation  such as a  model of something a learner had designed .  ✓ Online Text: Learners add text online; for example, writing an essay.  You can view it online, grade it, and add inline comments. Clearly out- line your objectives in the syllabus and instructions online, and then  guide your learners to meet the requirements. For instance, if a student  is expected to write an essay online, either instruct her to prepare in  advance and to not leave the Moodle session for more than half an hour  or inform her about Moodle timing. If learners need to leave the session,  they can add a note, submit the assignment as-is, and then return later  to finish. Online text assignments are often used for reflective work,  with or without instructor feedback, and can be a useful learning activ- ity. They tend not to be used for exams.  The essay question in the Quiz     Chapter 10: Creating Assignments  225  module is better suited for this type of assessment because you can con- trol the timing and security settings.   ✓ Advanced Uploading of Files: This type of assignment permits learners  and instructors to enter notes and upload new versions. For example, a  learner can upload a draft with comments and questions, the instructor  can comment on the draft, and then the student can access the feedback  and upload a final version. The instructor then enters the assignment  grade and adds feedback.  Creating Assignments  After you decide what type of assignment you’re going to set, the procedure  is not very complex. Follow these steps:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button.    The front page changes to show editing tools, allowing you to change  the appearance and add functionality to your course.  2.  From the Add an Activity drop-down list, choose an assignment.    Note the four types of assignments, described in the preceding section,  are listed here. Make sure you choose the drop-down list in the section   or week  you want it to appear in your course.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Assignment page, as shown in  Figure 10-1.  3.  In the General area, fill in the fields accordingly.                        Figure 10-1:  The Adding  a New  Assignment  page,  General  settings.     226 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     Anything marked with an asterisk is required.                                              Assignment Name: Give the assignment a descriptive name.   Description: In the Description text area, you can explain the   assignment in detail, add requirements, and state how you will  assess the work.  Be as clear and concise as possible. Bullet points may help here. I  usually copy and paste from my syllabus so there’s no confusion.  Don’t copy straight from Word or any other type of file; you’ll copy  the code, which will make your content look sloppy, filled with  code characters. Use Notepad or the Clean Word tool located in  the text box’s toolbar .    Grade: Select the grading scale from the drop-down list.   Available From and Due Date: Add the date and time by using the  drop down-lists. You set when you plan to make the assignment  available and when it’s due. If dates are not important, select the  Disable check boxes.  Notify your students that the Upload box doesn’t appear on the  assignment listing until the date from when the assignment is avail- able. Not seeing an Upload box may cause confusion when students  look at the assignment and don’t see the usual field with a Browse  button and an Upload button. I usually explain how the uploaded  process works in the description text area when I set the assignment.    Prevent Late Submissions: If you will be accepting late submis-  sions after the due date specified, leave the default No; otherwise,  choose Yes from the drop-down list.  4.  Select the appropriate options for the type of assignment you chose in   Step 2.   Note, General settings and Common Module settings are the same for all  four types of assignments. Sections below explain unique option setting  for each.   If you chose Advanced Uploading of Files  see Figure 10-2 , make these  choices:    Maximum Size: The maximum course upload, listed at the bottom of   the drop-down list, is set by Moodle admin. You can make changes  to this in your course settings. If your learners will be uploading  video or sound files, make sure you allocate enough space.    Allow Deleting: Decide whether students can delete uploaded files   before they’re due.    Maximum Number of Uploaded Files: From the drop-down list,   choose how many files learners can upload for the assignment. The  Moodle default is 3, but you can choose up to 20. Note that learners  don’t see this number. If you require a number of different uploads     Chapter 10: Creating Assignments  227  for the assignment, to avoid confusion, inform your learners in the  description and syllabus that they can upload the required number  of assignments.    Allow Notes: If useful to the learning goals and assignment, you can  enable notes, which allow your learners to add notes in a text box  when they upload the assignment. Notes can be useful if students  want to add any instructions, have questions, or want to bring  your attention to any aspect of the assignment. Another good com- munication tool!    Hide Description before Available Date: Select Yes if you want the  students to be able to see the description of the assignment. I usu- ally leave the default No, unless it affects the assignments.    Email Alerts to Teachers: Select Yes if you want to be alerted every   time a student uploads a file. The default setting is No.    Enable Send for Marking: Decide whether you want to be alerted by   an e-mail when your learners are ready for the assignment to be  marked. The default is set to Yes.    If you chose Online Text Assignment, select the same options as for  Advanced Uploading of Files Assignment, except the following choices.   Allow for Resubmitting: Select Yes, if you want to allow students to   resubmit assignments after they’ve been graded. The default set- ting is No.    Comment Inline: Select Yes if you intend to comment inline or edit  the original text. Moodle will copy the submissions into a feedback  comment field when you’re grading. The default setting is No.    For the Upload a Single file assignment, all the options are the same as in  the two previous assignments.                             Figure 10-2:  The Adding  a New  Assignment  page,  Advanced  Uploading  of Files and  Common  Module  Settings  sections.     228 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                       Offline Activity is the simplest assignment type to deal with, in terms of  selecting options. All functionality is explained in the first two assign- ments. If you choose to grade the activity, it’s listed in the grade book,  and you can enter the grades and comments just as with the other three  assignment types.  5.  Choose the Common Module Settings.  See Figure 10-2.     Make choices here as you would when you set up any Moodle activity.  6.  Click the Save and Return to Course button.    Moodle saves your settings and returns to your course front page. Notice  that the assignment has its own unique icon, and it also appears in the  Activities block, the Upcoming Events block, and the course calendar.  Note, if you click the Save and Display button, Moodle shows you the  Assignment page instead of taking you to the course front page. This  is useful if you want to verify how it appears and to check for errors. If  you’re happy with it, use the navigation bar to return to your course front  page, but if you want to make changes to the Assignment, click the Update  the Assignment button located on the right side in the navigation bar.  Administering Assignment Submissions  Only a few administrative tasks are involved with assignment submissions  and upkeep. Moodle adds useful functionality for you to view submissions.  When you’re ready to mark and or comment on students work, the following  tools make your job easier.  ✓ Viewing students’ submissions: You can view student’s submissions in   two ways. You can click the Assignment link in the Activities block, and  Moodle takes you to a table that lists all the assignments by week topic  assigned, tells you what type the assignment is, states the due date, and  tells how many were submitted and what the grades are.  See Figure 10-3.   This is a very useful overview. Each assignment name is a link that takes you  to that specific assignment. If you click the View X Submitted Assignments  link, Moodle takes you to an Assignment Submissions page like the one  shown in Figure 10-4.  Another way to access the assignment is from the course front page.  By clicking the name of the individual assignment, Moodle takes you  to new page listing the assignment description and another link in top- right corner informing you how many assignments have been submit- ted. Select this link by clicking it. Moodle takes you to the Assignment  Submissions page like the one shown in Figure 10-4. Notice this page is  set up as a table with headings First Name Surname; Grade; Comment;  Last Modified  Student ; Last Modified  Teacher ; and Status. You can  sort the list by clicking the heading.    Chapter 10: Creating Assignments  229  Figure 10-3:  A table that  details all  assign- ments.    Figure 10-4:  The  Assignment  Submissions  page.                ✓ Grading students’ submissions: To grade a submission, click the Grade  button in the Status column on the right.  See Figure 10-4.  Moodle takes  you to the Student’s Assignment Grade and Feedback page, as shown in  Figure 10-5. The look and feel of the feedback page and links are identi- cal for all assignment types with slight differences to compensate for the  diversity of functionality.    Upload a Single File and Advanced Uploading of Files: The main dif-  ference is that you have a link to access the uploaded document  located in the bottom-right corner. If it’s a Web page, you can open  it in the browser. A Word document also opens, but if you want  to make comments, you need to save it to your hard drive. For  Advanced Uploading of Files, you also can use a response file to  give students feedback. When students are finished with the final  document, they click Submit for Marking.   230 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     Online Text: You can view the submission in a separate box with   the word count located above. If you’ve enabled the inline com- ment option when setting up the assignment, Moodle copies the  text into the feedback comment box.        Figure 10-5:  The  Assignment  Grade and  Feedback  page.    When you finish reviewing and commenting on the assignments, choose the  grade from the drop-down list located in the top-left corner, add comments in  the comments box, and select the Save Changes or Save Changes and Show  Next button.    Two more neat functionalities are located in the grade window. If you want to   grade multiple assignments, all on the same page, select the Allow for Quick  Grading check box in the bottom left of the assignment Submissions page.  All you need to do is add grades and make comments and then click the Save  All My Feedback button. Remember that you can access students’ profiles by  clicking their names, which may be useful if you want to add a note, as dis- cussed in Chapter 8.  All assignment types have the Grade drop-down list located in the top-right  corner. Below the drop-down list, Moodle tells you whether the grade is final.  The textbox is very useful for feedback and to highlight any aspect of the  project or assignment. Below the feedback text area, select the check box if  you want the learner notified by e-mail that the assignment has been graded.  This is useful if you’re giving feedback on drafts of an assignment. At the  bottom, you have four buttons: Save Changes, Cancel, Save and Show Next,  and Next. The first two buttons are self-explanatory; the latter two each take  you to the next learner in your class list.   Chapter 11  Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  In This Chapter ▶ Using assessment creatively to give learners a positive experience ▶ Crafting the Quiz module to create worksheets, quizzes, and tests ▶ Setting up various question formats that you can reuse ▶ Adding, editing, and previewing questions ▶ Collecting data on all aspects of your assessment activity  Some form of assessment is important in training and education.   Instructors spend time evaluating performance and even more time   giving feedback to learners. As an educator, you may not like using quizzes  and tests to measure performance, but often they’re required by the orga- nization providing a certificate of accomplishment or a degree. In an online  learning environment, if you aren’t interacting with your learners, then set- ting quizzes, tests, and assignments is the only way you can validate that  your learners are remembering, understanding, and demonstrating they are  able to apply what you’re teaching them.  With Moodle’s Quiz module, you can set up a variety of assessment activities  to accomplish course outcomes and requirements. Moodle computerized  assessment is designed to take marking off your hands and enables you to  add feedback for each question or overall feedback for a series of questions.  Imagine, writing feedback only once! Moodle can also manipulate questions  to randomly shuffle multiple-choice answers and matching questions within  the question, and you can control questions to be shuffled between attempts.  Possibilities seem endless when you start using this module.  Looking at the Testing Features  The Moodle Quiz module is slightly more complex than some of the other mod- ules. It comprises of two separate parts: the quiz body, what your learners see  and interact with in your Moodle course, and the question bank, which holds  all the questions you create. The question bank is like a wardrobe for all your    232 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   questions. Your wardrobe contains shelves  question categories , where you  group questions depending on topics, themes, units, semesters, or any other  category you currently use to organize your courses.  The Question Bank module is separate, allowing you to create, hold, reuse,  and combine your questions in any combination. Your question bank can  comprise multiple-choice, true false, short answer, numerical short answer,  matching, random short-answer matching, calculated, essay, and embedded  answers  Cloze .  If you’re wondering about that last one, the Cloze question type comprises  a piece of text from which a number of words have been removed. A learner  is required to insert the missing word s . In some cases, the missing words  are supplied as a single list, from which the student has to select, which in  effect is matching a word with the space where it belongs. It’s just a match- ing question.  Moodle also includes description questions, which are really just holding  spaces for you to add instructions, pictures, or anything else between a set  of questions. Moodle added this functionality, enabling you to include notes  or instructions in some of the question types or between question types,  because the question setup features don’t leave space for instructions.  The neat aspect of populating your categories with questions is that you can  reuse them as many times as you like and in as many courses as you like. As  your question bank grows, it becomes a valuable, time-saving resource.  The Quiz module has considerable flexibility, allowing you to use it for more  than just setting quizzes and tests. Here are few examples of how instructors  use Moodle quizzes:  ✓ Worksheets: Although Moodle calls this module a quiz, you can set it up   with any assignment title. For example, if you’re creating practice work- sheets for foreign language courses, you can call it “French nouns work- sheet 1.” Creating worksheets is one way you and your learners can ease  into using the module before using it for formal quizzes and test. Moodle  marks your worksheets and records them in the grade book. You can  exclude worksheets from the grade book if you prefer not to add scores  to the final course grade.  ✓ Self assessment: Setting up quizzes for learners to measure their knowl-  edge is easy. You can set the quiz settings for repeat practice at speci- fied time intervals. You have the option of showing learners correct  answers and feedback, or you can choose to hide the correct answers  and just provide feedback. Like the worksheets, you can exclude self- assessment quizzes from the grade book.          Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  233  ✓ Timed and secured tests: Moodle enables you to time your tests and   to set them for specific dates. Moodle includes security provisions  that prevent learners from accessing the Internet. You can also use IP  addresses and secure individual computers.  ✓ Short quizzes or test to evaluate topics: Quiz tools allow you to set fre-  quent, short quizzes. You can use a combination of all question types or  stick with one style  for example, multiple choice .  ✓ Graphical enhancements: Moodle lets you import graphics into your  questions. This feature is very useful for basic identification exercises.  For example, you can upload a map and ask learners to identify coun- tries and cities, or upload a picture of a skeleton and ask learners to  identify bones.  Creating a Quiz Body  Setting up the quiz body requires you to choose a number of settings and  create parameters for how your learners will interact with the quiz. You’re  creating a repository for your questions, which are stored somewhere else in  the Moodle engine.  See the later section, “Creating a question bank.”   To create the quiz body, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the upper-right corner of your   course front page.   The front page changes to show editing tools, allowing you to change  the appearance and add functionality to your course. The editing tools  are listed on the book’s Cheat Sheet at Dummies.com and in Chapter 3.  2.  Click the down arrow next to Add an Activity in the section week  where you want the quiz to appear, and select Quiz from the drop- down list.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Quiz setup page, shown in  Figure 11-1.  3.  In the Name text box, fill in the quiz name.    Use descriptive names that will make sense to your learners. If you’re  using the Quiz module to set a worksheet, name it just that  for example,  “French Verbs Set 1” .  4.  In the Introduction text area, explain the quiz in detail, add require-  ments, and state how you will assess the work.   Be as clear and concise as possible. Bullet points may help here. I usu- ally copy and paste from my syllabus so there’s no confusion.                                   234 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 11-1:  Adding  a quiz.                            5.  Set the following Timing preferences if you intend to place a time   limit on when the quiz is opened and closed and how long the learn- ers have to take the quiz:    Open the Quiz and Close the Quiz: Dates when the quiz will be avail-  able to take and when it closes. To activate the date entry boxes,  deselect the Disable check box, and the fields are made available  for editing.    Time Limit  Minutes : Selecting the Enable check box permits you  to set a time limit for your quiz. Enter the time in whole numbers.  Remember that you’re setting the time in minutes.    Time Delay between First and Second Attempt: Set the time for how  long your learners have to complete the quiz between the first and  second attempt. From the drop-down list, select the time.  Your  options are from 0 to 7 days.  If you don’t want to enable more  than one attempt, leave the default, None.    Time Delay between Later Attempts: Set the time for how long your  learners have to complete the quiz after the second attempt. Select  the time  your options are from 0 to 7 days  from the drop-down  list. If you don’t want to enable more than two attempts, leave the  default of None.  6.  In the Display section, shown in Figure 11-2, specify how questions   will be displayed to your learners.    Questions per Page: Decide how many questions you want to be  displayed on each page. Select the number from the drop-down  list. I suggest you shoot for higher numbers so you aren’t limited                         Figure 11-2:  Choosing  quiz  settings.     Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  235  if you decide to add more. If the questions exceed the page size, a  default navigation button appears at the bottom.    Shuffle Questions: Decide whether you want questions shuffled   between attempts.    Shuffle within Questions: Decide whether you want answers within  questions shuffled between attempts  only for multiple choice and  matching .  7.  In the Attempts section, set the number of attempts you like to allow,  along with grade penalties. You have these three different settings to  consider:    Attempts Allowed: From the drop-down list, select how many   times you will allow learners to take the quiz. The default is set to  Unlimited. Your options are 1–10 attempts.    Each Attempt Builds on the Last: This option is useful if you’re using  the quiz as a practice exercise. If you set the drop-down list to Yes,  learners can see their incorrect responses when they retake the  quiz.    Adaptive Mode: Set this option to Yes if you want to let the learners  try to answer the question again, but want to apply a small penalty  to the score. Moodle provides an extra button for the learner to  submit the answer. The learner sees the result right away with the  score and can try again immediately. The learner has a choice of  whether to take a chance at a penalty or keep the original incorrect  answer.   236 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                             8.  In the Grades section, these settings enable you to decide on grade   settings:    Grading Method: If you allow your learners to take the quiz more  than once, select an option from the drop-down list to determine  how Moodle records the grades. Your options are Highest Grade,  Average of All Attempts, first Attempt, and Last Attempt. If learners  have only one shot at the quiz, Moodle ignores this setting.    Apply Penalties: From the drop-down list, select No if you don’t   want penalties applied if you’re running Adaptive mode.    Decimal Digits in Grades: Moodle calculates grades to the number   of set decimal points. The default is 2, but you can choose 0–3.  9.  In the Review Options area, Moodle provides you with a number of   options to control when and how learners receive feedback. They can  receive feedback during these timeframes:    Immediately after the Attempt: Usually within one to two minutes   after clicking the Submit All and Finish button.    Later, after the Quiz Is Still Open: Within a few minutes if the quiz is  still opened. If there’s no ending for the quiz, learners can see feed- back anytime.    After the Quiz Is Closed: Immediately after.    For each timeframe, you also have a series of choices on what informa- tion you include in the feedback.    Responses: What the learner entered for each question.   Answers: The learner is shown the correct answers to each question.   Feedback: Learners see the feedback you added for each response   to each question — it’s question-specific.    General Feedback: Not specific to learners’ responses. One   response is given for the question. This feedback may be useful  to give extra information, such as links or references, to increase  learners’ understanding of the topic.    Scores: Moodle displays the scores that the learner collects for   each question.    Overall Feedback: Displayed to learners after they complete the  whole quiz, and feedback depends on the overall score received.  The feedback is part of this setup.  Instructions are available in  Step 12.        Make sure you select check boxes in only one set of timeframes; oth- erwise, the learners may not be able get back in the quiz again. For  instance, if you’re choosing for learners to see feedback immediately  after the quiz, don’t select the Later, While the Quiz Is Still Open check  box or the After the Quiz Is Closed check box.    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  237     10.  In the Security section, shown in Figure 11-3, you have a set of   browser and computer security settings preventing students from  cheating on the quizzes by venturing off to the Internet, copying and  pasting, accessing thumb drives, and so on. Here are the areas you  can control:  Figure 11-3:  Modifying  security  settings.                  Browser Security: From the drop-down list, select Full Screen   Pop-Up with Some JavaScript Security. Learners need a JavaScript- enabled Web browser.  Most browsers are JavaScript enabled  unless that functionality has been turned off.  Moodle brings up  the quiz in a new, full-screen pop-up window without any naviga- tional features such as an address bar, forward and back buttons,  and so on.    Require Password: You can assign a password in the field, which  learners need to input before they can take the quiz. Requiring a  password is useful if you want different groups of learners taking  the quiz at different times. A Moodle feature I love is the Unmask  check box next to the password entry field. It allows you to view  the password you entered by simply selecting the check box. No  need to keep a record of all your Moodle passwords!     Require Network Address: If you want learners to take a test in a lab   and or you need to set proctored tests, this feature allows you to  restrict the test so that it’s available only on a set of computers  that have a range of IP addresses. For example, if you want to make    238 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course      it available on 30 computers with an IP range from 125.125.125.25  to 125.125.125.55, in the field enter 125.125.125.25 55.  You may require your IT administrator’s help identifying the IP  numbers. Moodle allows you three options: Full IP Addresses,  which specifies individual computers on a network; Partial  Addresses, which matches computers with the first two sets of  numbers; and CIDR, which allows you to use only an IP prefix.  11.  In the Common Module Settings section, choose the Common Module   Settings as you would when you set up any Moodle activity.   I discuss Common Module Settings in Chapter 3.   In the next section, Overall Feedback, you can specify what feedback is  shown to learners after they finish the quiz.  12.  In the Grade Boundary text box, enter the grade as a percentage,   and in the Feedback text box, enter the text that you want to appear  onscreen.   If you run out of fields for boundaries and feedback, click the Add 3  More Feedback Fields button at the bottom of the page, and Moodle  opens the new fields.   Your feedback is based on overall scores received by individual learn- ers. Moodle sets up fields for grade boundaries starting with 100%.  The  0% and 100% are added automatically by Moodle, although you add your  own feedback. Remaining boundaries are up to you.  For example,     Grade boundary: 100%    Feedback: “Absolutely fabulous.”    Grade boundary: 90%   Feedback: “Well done; showed you studied.”   Grade boundary: 40%    Feedback: “See me as soon as possible.”   The grade boundary feedback is based on the % and better. So in the  preceding example, learners with 90% to 99% would see the “Well done;  showed you studied” comment. Learners with 40% to 89% would see  the “See me as soon as possible” comment. I recommend setting these  boundaries in increments appropriate for your grading scale.  If you want to enter more feedback than the fields shown, click the Add  3 More Feedback Fields button. You can do this several times, setting up  a detailed range.   If you’re getting an error message such as “boundaries must be between  0% and 100%”  and they are , first check that the Maximum Grade for  this quiz is set to something greater than zero.  I tell you how to adjust  that setting later in the chapter in the “Questions in this quiz” section.  If  that is entered correctly, check what you have entered into the Grade                                           Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  239  Boundary fields, making sure you enter only one % grade in each, such  as 50%. It’s very tempting to add a range such as 65–70%, but that will  cause the error message. If you want specific feedback for 65% to 70%,  just type 71% into one Grade Boundary field, enter 65% into the Grade  Boundary field below it, and add the appropriate feedback for both.  Moodle gives the feedback for the 65% to 70% range.       13.  Click the Save and Return to Course button.    Moodle saves your settings and returns to your course front page.  Notice that the Quiz module has its own unique icon that appears in the  Activities block, Upcoming Events block, and the course calendar.  Creating Quiz Questions  After you’ve finished setting up the quiz body, as described in the preceding  section, you’re ready to start adding questions to your quiz. Before you can  add questions, you need to set up your question categories and then the ques- tion bank. Be sure to start by setting up categories in which to organize your  questions even if you’re just playing around. Over time, the categories will help  you find specific questions to add to your quizzes, tests, and worksheets.  Setting up categories  Think of a question category as a folder you have set up on your computer.  When creating questions, you can store them in these categories similar to  the way you store files in your folders. You can set up subcategories as your  question bank grows.  Setting up categories is purely for you to keep a potentially very large bank  of questions organized, making it easier to search when adding the questions  to your worksheets, quizzes, or tests. Each category must have a name, and  you can include a short description. You can create a hierarchy and specify  a parent category for each set of questions. This enables you to separate cat- egories into categories, subcategories, sub-subcategories, and so on.  Before beginning, think of a naming convention that’s intuitive to your  courses and topics. You can set up categories any which way that works for  you. For example, you name a Parent category Chemistry 101, and subcat- egories by theme: Science of Chemistry, Matter and Energy, Atomic Structure  and Electron Configuration, and so on. This way, you will have a set of ques- tions in each subcategory from which you can pull questions for quizzes,  tests, reviews, mid-term, and so on. Another Parent category can be AP  Chemistry, with similar subcategories. This will then enable you to choose  easy and harder questions for various assignments.   240 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   To set up a category, you need to go to the editing page of your quiz.  1.  If this is your first time setting up a category and questions, select the   quiz you just created from your course front page.   Alternatively, you can select Questions from the Administrative block on  your course front page.   Moodle takes you to the Editing Quiz page shown in Figure 11-4. Note  that if you click the Questions link from the Administration block, the  page looks slightly different, but tabs and functionality are the same.  More frequently, teachers use this process to create questions after set- ting up categories.  Figure 11-4:  The Editing  Quiz page.                                       2.  From the Edit tab, click the Categories link.    Moodle takes you to a list of default categories, as shown in Figure 11-5.  You see headings for the quiz, course, category for your course, and  system. Aim to store your categories either under the default course cat- egory or create your own categories.  3.  Scroll down until you see the Add Category section shown in Figure 11-6.   From the Parent drop-down list, select the parent category that will  contain your new category.   I recommend that you use your course name as the parent.  4.  In the Name text box, give the category name.    For example, enter Moodle for Teachers.  5.  In the Category Info box, describe the category.    I usually state the courses that will use questions from this category.  6.  Click the Add Category button to save your new category.    Notice that when Moodle saves the category and returns you to the cat- egory lists, you can edit, delete, and move the categories. Clicking the  icons to the right of the name allows you to make any changes.    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  241  Figure 11-5:  The Edit  Categories  page.    Figure 11-6:  Adding  question  categories.             Creating a question bank  After creating categories, you’re ready to start creating questions to populate  the categories and then add them to your quiz. Moodle has ten types of ques- tions you can create and add to your quizzes. You can mix and match them  however you want when adding them to the quiz. There is no predetermined  order, question number, and question type required by Moodle. You’re in  complete control of your quiz’s questions and structure.  The question types in the Moodle drop-down list are as follows:  ✓ Calculated: These types of questions are used for mathematical equa-  tions. You set up holders for specific mathematical values that are listed  in the Moodle dataset. For example, you can ask students to calculate  the area of a triangle by inputting 1 2 * {base} * {height}.   242 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                           ✓ Description: This is actually not a question type. It is purely a text box   you embed between questions so that you can add instructions. For  instance, when you come to a new set of questions that require extra  information, you can add instructions for the new set, or you can add  a few paragraphs and ask students to read the text and then answer  a series of questions. You can also embed graphics. You will find  Description useful, as most of the question types don’t have input fields  for instructions.  ✓ Essay: Use essay questions for short answers; I advise no more than   two paragraphs. You need to mark each essay question and assign the  grades manually. If you require your learners to write a longer essay, use  the Online Text Assignment module.  ✓ Matching: This question type is represented by two columns, where text   from one column must be matched with content in the other. For exam- ple, a line from a poem should be matched with the poet. I suggest that  you enter the longer statement in the left column and the shorter state- ment in the right column, as the matches appear in a drop-down list. So  in the poetry example, the line from the poem would be on the left, and  authors on the right.  ✓ Embedded Answers  Cloze : This question type allows you to embed   answers such as multiple choice, short answer, and numerical answers  in the text. You can embed more than one answer type and any combi- nation. Language and math teachers like this question type.  You need to embed the syntax for the question type in the text in order  for the Moodle engine to recognize it, or you need to use third-party  quiz software, such as Hot Potatoes, to embed answers. Detailed expla- nation of the syntax is beyond the scope of this book. Check http:   docs.moodle.org en Question_bank for a detailed explanation and  examples.  ✓ Multiple Choice: This is a familiar question type bundled with a few   extras. Moodle can shuffle answers within the question. Moodle lets you  select multiple answers, you can add feedback for every answer, and  you can assign positive or negative grades, which discourages guessing  or if you allow for your learners to take the test more than once.  ✓ Short Answer: This question type requires learners to type in a word or  phrase. Moodle allows you to choose case sensitivity, a wildcard answer   described in the upcoming “Short answer” section , and feedback. I  advise you to keep answers short and add several acceptable answers.  The only way Moodle can mark this is by matching text exactly. You do  have an option to override the answer, though that defeats the purpose  of Moodle automatic grading taking that workload off your shoulders.  I tend to go back to short answer questions only if too many students  are getting them wrong, or if a student has a borderline grade.    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  243  ✓ Numerical: This is just like the short answer question with extra func- tionality allowing you to set an accepted error range for each answer.  For example, if the answer is 50, you can set up the accepted error of 3,  meaning that 47, 50, and 53 would be evaluated as correct.  ✓ Random Short-Answer Matching: For learners, this question looks   just like matching; however, you provide several answers for each sub- question. So instead of two long lists as in the matching question, each  subquestion has two to three possible choices. See Figure 11-7 for an  example of how this question looks when presented to learners. Notice  that the question has three subquestions and a drop-down list for each.  ✓ True False: Learners are given two choices for each question, true or   false. The format for setting this question type is similar to multiple  choice, though simpler.              Figure 11-7:  A short- answer  matching  question.    When creating your questions, you’re following a similar format to setting  up some of the other activities. Moodle provides you with a form with vari- ous options for each question type. The form is consistent in layout, and  you need to input each question, the answers, and the feedback. It does take  some time to create a complete bank of questions. But remember, you have  to do this only once. Start small; for example, add one quiz or worksheet.  Moodle marks and pushes the grades to the grade book. Don’t get discour- aged. It may be a slow process until you get the hang of it. Remind yourself  that you can reuse the questions over and over.  Setting Up Various Types of Questions  The following sections explain, in detail, how to set up various questions  types in Moodle.  The order in which I list the explanations follows the popularity of use. For  instance, Multiple Choice, Matching, and True False are more popular with    244 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   instructors than Random Short-Answer Matching and Embedded Answers   Cloze .  Note that after you give your question a name, you don’t have to state what  type of question it is because as soon as you save the question, Moodle lists  it with a specific icon representing the question type. The icons make it  easier for you to organize and identify the question type, giving you the free- dom to name them as you wish. Table 11-1 lists all the questions with the cor- responding icons. The icons help you identify the questions when you view  or move them into your quiz  discussed later in the chapter . If you need  more assistance, visit http:  docs.moodle.org en Question_bank.  Table 11-1  Question Types and Icons Used in the Question Bank Question Icon  Embedded answers  Cloze   Question Type Calculated  Description  Essay  Matching  Multiple choice  Short answer  Numerical  True false  Random short-answer matching    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  245  Multiple choice    Multiple-choice questions enable you to set up single and multiple-answer   questions, upload images, and give specific answers weights to calculate  grades. To create a new multiple-choice question, follow these instructions:  1.  Click the Questions link in the Administration block on your course   front page.   Moodle takes you to the Question Bank page, shown in Figure 11-8.  2.  From the Category drop-down list, select your category, and from the   Create New Question drop-down list, select Multiple Choice.    Don’t forget to change the category where you want to store the ques- tions. Moodle leaves the default category unless you select yours from  the drop-down list.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a Multiple Choice Question setup page,  shown in Figure 11-9.  3.  In the Question Name text box, give the question a name.    I suggest you use a descriptive name to identify your question. Naming  the question by topic, unit, theme, class, and so on will be helpful as  your question bank grows. Setting a generic name like Question 1 or  Intro 1 won’t help you when you have several hundred questions in your  question bank. Moodle adds an icon to the question to identify its type.  Refer to Table 11-1, which lists all the icons.  4.  In the Question Text field, add your question.                              Figure 11-8:  Adding a  question to  the Question  Bank.     246 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 11-9:  Adding a  multiple- choice  question.                             5.  If you want to include an image with your question, select your image   from the Image to Display drop-down list.   In the Image to Display drop-down list, Moodle lets you choose from all  the images saved in your directory. You need to have images uploaded  to Moodle in order to be able to add them to questions. You don’t have  the option to browse your hard drive. Refer to Chapter 5 for details on  how to upload images.  6.  In the Default Question Grade text box, shown in Figure 11-10, enter a   whole number, and the percentage will be calculated based on this.   This is the maximum grade for the question.   The fields with asterisks are required fields.   For simplicity, each of my questions tends to be worth 1 unless it has  several parts, such as the matching short answer, where I may allocate it  4 or 5  25 20% for each answer .  7.  In the General Feedback field, add the general feedback that your   learners will see when they complete the question.   This isn’t based on the response and isn’t necessary if you’re giving  feedback per correct or incorrect answers. You can leave this field  blank, if you’d like. Learners see general feedback only if you selected  the Feedback option in the Immediately after the attempt column of the  Review Options are when you set up the quiz. See the “Creating a Quiz  Body” section for more information on adjusting feedback settings.    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  247  Figure 11-10:  Choosing  multiple- choice  question  options.                             8.  From the One or Multiple Answers drop-down list, select an option to  determine whether your question will have only one correct answer  or multiple answers.  9.  Select the Shuffle the Choices check box if you want the choices shuf-  fled on each new attempt.  10.  From the Number the Choices drop-down list, you have an option to   choose the style of numbering for the answers.   The default is lowercase alphabet  such as a, b, c .  11.  For the sections labeled Choice 1–Choice 5, compose the choices for   your question. Specify the following information for each choice:    Answer: Write your answer.   Grade: If this choice is incorrect, leave the default, NONE, or from   the drop-down list select the percentage mark for the particular  question. If you have only one correct answer, select 100%. If mul- tiple answers are correct, divide 100% by the correct answers. For  instance, if two answers are correct, each grade would be 50%.    Feedback: Add your feedback for the choices, if you’re using the   feedback options, telling students why their answers are incorrect   for each incorrect answer  or providing a positive statement for  the correct one.   248 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   12.  If you need more choices, click the Blanks for 3 More Choices button. 13.  In the General Feedback section, you can indicate what feedback   to display For Any Correct Response, For Any Partially Correct  Response, and For Any Incorrect Response.   This feedback feature is useful if you have more than one choice.  14.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle takes you to a busy question and category page. I refer to this as  my Questions workspace page. See Figure 11-11 depicting the new ques- tion on the right. All the functionality in this workspace is described in  the later section “Viewing, Editing, and Adding Questions to Quizzes.”  New question  Matching    Matching questions provide learners with a drop-down list to a question.   They’re useful for many different assessment activities such as memorizing,  visual identification, and language understanding. See Figure 11-12. To set up  a matching question, follow these steps:  1.  Follow Steps 1–7 in the preceding section. In Step 2, select Matching  from the Create New Question drop-down list.  Refer to Figure 11-8.    I entered Match the Moodle Tools with the Description as the question.                          Figure 11-11:  Questions  workspace  page.       Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  249  Figure 11-12:  A matching  question.                           2.  If you want to shuffle the questions  if you allow for multiple   attempts — that’s when this feature is useful , select the Shuffle the  Choices check box.  3.  In the Question boxes for Questions 1–3, add the questions with the   answer below.   You need to add at least three questions in order for Moodle to accept  the matching question, and you must include up to three answers. You  can leave one or more blank questions, with extra answers so that you  don’t have one answer to each question. For example, you can add  seven descriptive questions and have 10 answers in the drop-down list.  4.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the Question Bank editing page, where you can  preview the question and add it to your quiz.  When you’re creating a series of questions of the same type, you don’t need to  go through this process each time if the only thing you’re doing is changing  the question and the answers. To save yourself time, here’s what you do:  Open an existing question of any type; keep all the same settings; change the  Name  such as Moodle basics Q2 ; add the new question and answers; and at  the bottom, instead of clicking the Save Changes button, click the Save as New  Question button.  True false    The true false question is a very familiar format that is simple to implement.   See Figure 11-13.  The only thing you need to remember when you’re setting  up feedback for this question type is that the first answer, whether true or  false, is the correct answer.   250 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Follow these steps to create a True False question.  1.  Click the Questions link in the Administration block on your course   front page.   Moodle takes you to the Question Bank page shown earlier in Figure 11-8. 2.  From the Category drop-down list, select your category, and from the   Create New Question drop-down list, select True False.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a True and False Question setup page.  3.  From the Question Category drop-down list, choose the category   where you want the question to be stored.   The Adding a True False Question page appears, as shown in Figure 11-14.  Figure 11-13:  The Preview  question  page.

Follow Steps 3–7 in the section “Multiple choice,” earlier in this   chapter.  5.  From the Correct Answer drop-down list, shown in Figure 11-15,   choose True or False.   Notice Moodle prompts you that the first answer has to be the correct  one. Add feedback for the True answer if you think it may be helpful.  6.   Optional  Enter feedback for the False answer. 7.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the Question Bank editing page, where you can  preview the question and add it to your quiz.  Short answer    The setup for a short-answer question is similar to the setup of the questions  discussed previously in this chapter. The most important thing to remember  when setting up the short-answer question is to keep answers as short as  possible. The Moodle quiz engine evaluates whether the answer is right or  wrong by exact matching, character for character, in the order you specify.  Warn your learners about spelling errors. There is no implied intelligence  that can deduce an answer if the wording is correct in context but phrased  differently. Think about possible acceptable answers, enter them, and use a  wildcard as a space holder for text when appropriate.   252 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Moodle uses the asterisk character  *  to indicate a wildcard allowing any  sets of characters between words, within words, before a word, or after a  word. Table 11-2 shows how you can use a wildcard with a two-word answer   Paris and London in this example  and how Moodle would grade it.  Here are some things to remember when working with wildcards:  ✓ Standard practice for using the wildcard is to place the wildcard answer  last in the list of questions answers so that Moodle knows what to do if  nothing else matches.  ✓ Wildcards are needed because Moodle finds the answers by comparing  characters exactly to your answers. So spell the words correctly — and  tell your students to spell them correctly, or the answers will be marked  incorrect.  Using the Wildcard  Table 11-2  Paris*London *Paris* or *London* * “Paris London”, “Paris, London”, “Paris; London”, “Paris &  London”, “Paris and London”, “Paris or London”, “Paris not  London”  100% 50% 0% All acceptable,  so you need to  be careful  To set up a short-answer question, follow these steps:  1.  Follow Steps 1–2 in the section “Multiple choice,” earlier in this   chapter.   Be sure to select Short Answer from the Create New Question drop- down list in Step 2.  2.  In the Question Text box, add the question.    If you want to leave a blank space, use the underscore character, as in,  “______was the first American president.”  3.  In the General Feedback field, add feedback your learners will see   when they complete the question.   Include feedback if it would be useful to the goals of the assignment.  4.  From the Case Sensitivity drop-down list, you have an option to decide   whether case is important in the answer. The default is No, Case Is  Unimportant. Select Yes if case is important.                             Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  253                                    If you change the setting to Yes, think carefully about when this is  important. For example, if a learner types george Washington, and case  sensitivity is set, Moodle would mark this answer incorrect. 5.  In the Answer 1–3 fields, fill in the following information:       Answer: Enter the answers you will accept. Don’t forget about the   wildcard and that it should be used as the last answer.    Grade: Assign a percentage grade. If a word is frequently mis-  spelled, you can allocate partial credit.    Feedback: Add feedback for any answer or leave it blank.    If you want to add feedback for all wrong answers, use the wildcard   the asterisk, *  as the only answer, and leave None as the grade. If you  need to add more possible answers, click the Blanks for 3 More Choices  button under the Answer 3 field. 6.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the Question Bank editing page, where you can  preview the question and add it to your quiz.  The bottom portions of Figures 11-16 and 11-17 show how the quiz looks with  one correct and one incorrect short answer.  Numerical    You will quickly see that numerical questions are much like the short-answer   questions discussed in the preceding section; the difference is that you can  set answers in an error range you specify. You can also accept answers in  multiple units  such as metric and imperial . For your learners, the look and  feel are identical to short-answer questions.  To set up a numeric question, follow these steps:  1.  Follow Steps 1–2 in the section “Multiple choice,” earlier in this chapter.    Be sure to select Numerical from the Create New Question drop-down  list in Step 2.  2.  In the Question Text box, add your equation and or the Question.    This can include an equation, text, or an image of a formula if the  Algebra filter or TeX filter is not enabled. See Chapter 13 and the com- panion Web site, www.dummies.com go moodlefd, for more informa- tion on how to enable the filters. You need administrative privileges.  Enabling these filters allows you to use mathematic notations. These  filters enable math functions to be added to the WYSIWYG editing bar.   254 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 11-16:  Previewing  the  question.       Figure 11-17:  The results  of a submit- ted quiz.                        3.  If you want an image, select it from the Image to Display drop-down   list.   You have to upload the image to your Moodle folders first. Moodle dis- plays the image right after the textual question and before the answer  field.  4.  In the Default Question Grade field, enter the maximum grade points   for the question.   For example, enter 1 point for each question.  5.  The Penalty Factor field is applicable only if you set up the question   in Adaptive mode only. You can add 0 or just leave as is.   Moodle ignores the setting if it isn’t set in Adaptive mode.    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  255                                 6.  If feedback would be useful, add general feedback that will appear   when the learner answers the question.   The general feedback is not based on the answer.  7.  In the sections Answer 1–3, fill in the following information for each   answer:     Answer: Enter the answer.   Grade: Select the default grade from the drop down list.   Accepted Error: Enter the accepted error range for the answer. For  example if the answer is 10, and you will accept 9.5 or 10.5, enter .5  as your accepted error range. Add feedback for the accepted  answer. This is what the learner will see if she got the question  correct.    You also have to specify incorrect answers using the wildcard  the  asterisk character, *  as the answer and setting the grade to NONE. If  you need more choices, click the Blanks for 3 More Choices button, and  Moodle adds three more answer fields.  8.  In each of the Unit fields, add the unit and, if needed, add the multiplier.    You can specify metric and imperial units. For example, if the answer  is 5, accept 5cm or add .01 as the multiplier for cm to m. Moodle will  accept 5, 5cm, and .05m as correct answers.  9.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the Question Bank editing page, where you can  preview the question and add it to your quiz.  Random short-answer matching    The random short-answer matching questions are very easy to set up, and   they add variety to your quiz, test, or worksheet. Your learners will just think  it’s another matching question. To set it up, you give an introduction to the  set of matching questions, and Moodle randomly selects short-answer sub- questions from the current category  make sure the short questions are  included in the category , creating a drop-down list of all correct answers.  Moodle shuffles the questions and answers, selecting different question for  each new attempt at the quiz.    The topic has to be the same, or the answers in the questions won’t make   sense. For example, categories of capital cities and countries should include  questions answers on only capitol cities and countries. If you include ques- tions about French verbs, the answers will be mixed up and not make sense.  This is when subcategories become useful. Remember that each question is  weighted equally to generate overall points.   256 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                To set up a random short-answer matching question, take these steps:  1.  Follow Steps 1–3 in the section “Multiple choice,” earlier in this chap- ter. Be sure to select Random Short-Answer Matching from the Create  New Question drop-down list in Step 2.  2.  In the Question Text box, inform the learners of what they’re match-  ing and the learning goals, or use Moodle’s default text.  3.  In the General Feedback field, add feedback if it would be helpful. 4.  From the Number of Questions to Select drop-down list, select how   many questions you want to add to the matching questions.   It’s important you don’t add more than the number of short-answer  questions you have in the question bank under the category.     5.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the Question Bank editing page, where you can  preview the question and add it to your quiz or edit it.  Essay    Essay questions are designed to contain a question you set, and your learn- ers can enter one to two paragraphs of text. Essay questions can be embed- ded with other question types. Moodle cannot score these questions; you  have to score them yourself and enter the grade manually. Until you mark the  grade, the learner will receive a score of 0.  If you use essay with other question types in a quiz, Moodle will correct all the  other questions and push the grade to the learner’s grade book. Learners can  see their grades right away, so I advise that you include in your instruction a  note that Moodle will record a 0 mark because it is waiting for you to mark the  essay.  To grade an essay in a submitted quiz, select the Results tab from the Editing  Quiz page, and then under the tabs, click the Manual Grading link, which takes  you to a page where you can read and score the essay and add comments.  To set up an essay question, here’s what you do:  1.  Follow Steps 1–3 in the section “Multiple choice,” earlier in this chap- ter. Be sure to select Essay from the Create New Question drop-down  list in Step 2.  2.  In the Question Text field, write your question and, if necessary, any   instructions.    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  257                                       If your question has few parts, then bullet points or numbers can help  the learners to structure the essay.     3.  In the General Feedback box, add general feedback.    Adding Moodle-generated feedback in most circumstances is helpful,  though for essay questions you have options to add comments when  you mark the essays, so you can leave the fields blank  4.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the Question Bank editing page, where you can  preview the question and add it to your quiz or edit it.  Calculated    The main purpose of using the Calculated question type is if you’re teaching  math and you want to create multiple questions by using a specific formula  with different numerical values. Moodle will randomly pull the numbers from  a dataset you can specify. For example, to set up a worksheet to practice  division problems, creating two placeholders and a division sign, such as  {a}   {b}, tells Moodle to select values for a and b automatically. Each time  the test is taken, different values will be added, and your learners will be pre- sented with a new practice activity each time. Just think all the time this will  save you marking practice work sheets!  To set up a calculated question, take these steps:  1.  Follow Steps 1–3 in the section “Multiple choice,” earlier in this chap-  ter. Be sure to select Calculated from the Create New Question drop- down list in Step 2.  2.  In the Question Text box, shown in Figure 11-18, add the question   your learners need to answer.   Make sure you use at least one wildcard and add the values Moodle will  randomly assign in curly brackets. For example, you could enter {x} *  {y}  {a}.  3.  Fill in the Default Question Grade and Penalty Factor fields, if necessary.    Penalty factor is necessary only if you are using Adaptive mode.   Moodle ignores the penalty factor if you did not select Adaptive mode in  the quiz setup page.  4.  Add general feedback if needed. 5.  In the Answer section, shown in Figure 11-19, enter the following   information:    258 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 11-18:  Setting  up the  Calculated  question.       Figure 11-19:  Setting  acceptable  answers.         Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  259                                  Correct Answer Formula: Add the correct answer formula. Moodle   needs to recognize a formula, such as {a} {b}, in order to set up  the question. See the correct syntax formula at http:  docs. moodle.org en Question_bank.    Grade: From the drop-down list, select 100% grade value for the   correct answer. You need to select 100% unless you set up the quiz  at a different percentage.    Tolerance: Select the tolerance of error you will accept. For exam-  ple, choosing a relative error of .05 could be acceptable for my pre- ceding division example.    Tolerance Type: From the drop-down list, select the type of toler-  ance  relative, nominal, or geometric .    Correct Answer Shows: Decide on the precise number of significant   figures or decimal places you will accept for the correct answer.  Moodle sets 2 as the default.    Format: From the drop-down list, choose the option that indicates   decimals or significant figures.  6.  In the Feedback field, add answer feedback as appropriate. 7.  If required, add units for the correct answer  meters, oz, kg, and so   on , as shown in Figure 11-20.   You can add both metric and imperial.  8.  Click the Next Page button.    Moodle opens another page for you to complete, as shown in Figure 11-21.  Figure 11-20:  Indicating  units.        260 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   9.  In the Mandatory Wild Cards Present in Answers section, decide   whether you want to use the same existing private data set as before  or use a new shared data set. These are your choices:    Private: If you select this option, you’re restricting Moodle to use it   with this question only.    Shared: If you select this option, you allow Moodle to share it with  other calculated questions within the same category. This option  will save you time.  10.  Click the Next Page button.    Moodle takes you to page 3, shown in Figure 11-22.  Figure 11-21:  Choosing  wildcard  options.                     Figure 11-22:  Creating a  dataset.         Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  261                              11.  Create a dataset for questions s  in the category.    All you need to do is generate a series of values for the placeholders. It’s  better to shoot for generating more values because Moodle will not have  to repeat values. For simplicity, I let Moodle create values. Here’s the  information you need to fill in:    Param: Add the value you want to start with.   Range of Values: Enter the range of values in the fields and enter   the lower and upper limits for the values you would accept.    Decimal Places: Choose a number of decimal places for the value.   Distribution: Choose the distribution of values between the limits.  Uniform means any value between the limits is equally likely to be  generated; Loguniform means that values toward the lower limit  are more likely.  12.  Scroll down to the Add section and select the Force Regeneration   option.  13.  Click the Get New Items to Add Now button. 14.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the Question Bank editing page.  Embedded answers  Cloze      If you want to set questions within text, use the embedded answers  Cloze   question-type. Often, instructors like to take a passage from text and embed  short-answer, multiple-choice, or fill-in numerical questions right into the  passage. This question type is often used with language instruction. A Cloze  question comprises a piece of text from which a number of words have been  removed. A learner is required to insert the missing words. In some cases,  the missing words are supplied as a single list from which the student has to  select, which, in effect, is matching a word with the space where it belongs.  Simply, it’s just a matching question embedded in text and can be repre- sented as a selection in a drop-down list of possible answers.    You cannot use a graphical interface for this question type, and you need to  use specific syntax to embed the format. Using third-party software, such as  Hot Potatoes, is the simplest way to design these types of questions, and then  you can import them right into Moodle.  To create an embedded answer, follow these steps:   262 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   1.  Follow Steps 1–3 in the section “Multiple choice,” earlier in this chap- ter. Be sure to select Embedded Answers  Cloze  from the Create New  Question drop-down list in Step 2.  2.  In the Question Text field, shown in Figure 11-23, add the question   text with the embedded answers using the specific syntax.   See the bullets at the end of this list for a summary of the syntax.  You can find more information on how to use the syntax on the  Moodle.org Web site  http:  docs.moodle.org en Embedded_ Answers_%28Cloze%29_question_type .                               Figure 11-23:  Setting  up an  Embedded  Answers   Cloze   question.    3.  Fill in the default Question Grade and Penalty Factor text boxes  if in   Adaptive mode .   The Penalty factor is important only if you set the Adaptive mode in the  Quiz. If you did not set it, the Penalty factor will be ignored.   Note: You will be adding the weight value for the grade inside the Cloze  questions – it’s part of the syntax.  4.  In the General Feedback field, add feedback if is useful to the learning   goals.  5.  Click the Decode and Verify the Question Text button.    Moodle gives you a preview of the questions, answers, and points to test  if you entered the correct syntax.    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  263                                                 6.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the Question Bank editing page.  Here’s the syntax you can use with Cloze questions:  ✓ All question type items are coded inside curled braces { }. ✓ The number that appears between the opening brace and the colon,  such as 1 in {1:, is the weighting of that item; if it’s set at 1 for all the  items, you don’t need to specify it, so you can have {:.  ✓ After the colon, you have the item question type: MULTICHOICE,   SHORTANSWER, NUMERICAL.  ✓ If you’ve installed the REGEXP question type plugin, you can also use the   REGEXP question type.  ✓ The syntax for MULTICHOICE and SHORTANSWER is nearly the same;   the only difference is in the way the item displays to the student.  ✓ The order of the various answers is indifferent  except if you want a   catch-all for wrong answers; see the next bullet point .  ✓ In the SHORTANSWER type, you may want to put a catch-all  wrong    answer in order to send “wrong, try again” feedback; you can do this by  inserting an asterisk  *  as the very last expected answer in your formula.  ✓ A correct answer is preceded with the equal sign  =  or a percent-  age  usually %100% . Note: The equal sign doesn’t seem to work with  SHORTANSWER.  ✓ A wrong answer is preceded with nothing or a percentage  usually %0% . ✓ You can allocate points between 0 and 100 to some questions if you put   the appropriate percentage in your quiz setup.  ✓ All answers except the first one are separated from one another by a   tilde  ~ .  ✓ Answers can be followed by an optional feedback message, preceded  with the pound sign   . If there is no feedback message,  can be pres- ent or absent — it does not matter.  ✓ The feedback message and correct answer are displayed in a small   Feedback pop-up window upon mouse hovering  if and when the correct  answer and or feedback have been declared accessible to the students  in the Quiz settings . You can use HTML tags to format your feedback.  It can help not to have the form fields for the answers too close to each  other.  ✓ Unfortunately in MULTICHOICE MODE, you can’t have the answers  scrambled. In SHORTANSWER mode, it is not possible to make the  answers case-sensitive.   264 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Description       Description is not a question type. Moodle developers have added this option   to the question bank because a number of individual questions do not allow  for instructions, and you may need to add content between questions. This  tool works similar to the label resource: All it does is allow you to add text   or graphics  to instruct learners. For example, instructors have used the  description option to present a map to students and then present a series of  multiple choice questions. Another example is language teachers using it to  display a few paragraphs in a foreign language, and then they can check  whether learners can understand the passage by asking them to read it and  answer a series of following questions. Use this functional utility creatively to  support your quiz activities as you find need.  The description option is quite simple to set up. Follow the same procedure  as for other question types. There is no grade allocation. After adding your  content and or image, you can add general feedback in a text box provided,  but most likely you won’t have any use for feedback here. Like with all the  other question types, make sure you choose the correct category and don’t  forget to save your changes.  Viewing, Editing, and Adding  Questions to Quizzes  The Moodle Question Bank editing page has a number of different tools that  enable you to add the questions to your quiz, preview them, edit them, and  move them between categories and quizzes. Moodle uses icons to depict the  questions and functions. Refer to Table 11-2 for the icons and their explana- tions.  To access the Question Bank page, click the Questions link in the  Course Administration block, located on the left side of the course front page.   Editing the question bank and quiz  The Quiz Question page is divided into two parts: Questions in This Quiz and  Question Bank.  Question Bank The Question Bank section is on the right  see Figure 11-24  with a number  of different tools to manage your questions and categories. You have three  drop-down lists:    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  265           ✓ Category: This drop-down list enables you to display your ques-  tions stored in specific categories you created. You also have options  to include various questions by selecting the check boxes, Display  Questions from Sub-Categories Too and Also Show Old Questions. If  you create a very long list of questions, and the question names are too  generic and don’t give you enough information to identify specific ques- tions, select the Show Question Text in the Question List check box to  add the text above the question in the list.  ✓ Create New Question: This drop-down list offers all the question types.   Use this list when you need to add a new question.  ✓ Question sorting: Moodle allows you to sort your questions by type,   name, or date created.  Sort  Figure 11-24:  Adding  questions  to a quiz.       Below the drop-down lists are your questions with certain tools to view, edit,  delete, and move them. Table 11-2 shows all the icons and their functional- ity. Below the list of questions, you have four operations you can carry out  with selected questions. Notice that you can select individual questions by  using the check box in front of the questions or by clicking the Select All or  Deselect All links. Furthermore, you can use the following buttons:   266 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                    ✓ Add to Quiz: Selected questions are moved to the quiz question list  located on left side of the page. Note you can move the question only  once.  ✓ Delete: Selected questions are deleted. ✓ Move To: Selected questions are moved to a different category that’s   selected using the drop-down list.  ✓ Add: Click this button to add random questions. Select from the drop- down list how many questions you want randomly added to the quiz.  Each attempt results in different questions.  Questions in this quiz After moving questions to the left section titled Questions in This Quiz, you  have more tools to help you organize, structure, edit, and preview your quiz.  Refer to Figure 11-24; starting from the left, here are the columns in the table  of questions:  ✓ Order: Order the questions by clicking the up and down arrows next to   the questions.  ✓ Question Name: Lists the name of the question. ✓ Type: The icon depicts the type of question. ✓ Grade: In the input box, set the number of points for each question.   Think about the type of question and the points you will add. For exam- ple, you may want to give a matching question, requiring 10 matches,  more points than a True or False question. Moodle weighs each question  to match the total points possible that you allocated the quiz when you  set it up. Below the total points, you can set the Maximum Grade for the  whole quiz. This number can be larger than the total — Moodle simply  rescales the grades out of a maximum grade.  ✓ Action: You can preview each question by selecting the magnifying   glass icon. A new window opens with options to complete the question  and several buttons: Submit the Page, Submit All and Finish, Fill with  Correct, Start Again, and Close Window. The options allow you to see  correct and incorrect answers with the feedback you’ve added.  Below the table of questions, you find these two check boxes:  ✓ Show Page Breaks: If you want to add page breaks, after several ques-  tions, select the check box, and Moodle adds a Next button. I recom- mend you do add page breaks if you have many questions; otherwise,  your learners will have to scroll.  ✓ Show the Reordering Tool: Selecting the reordering tool allows you to   increase line numbers between questions, starting at the top. Moodle  increases lines in a factor of 10, leaving you room to insert new questions.     Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  267  You can leave the default or increase by a factor of 10  recommended .  Using line numbers and changing line numbers by the questions are ways  to reorder the questions. If you added page breaks, the new pages are  also given line numbers. However, if you remove the show page breaks,  the line numbers aren’t displayed, and only gaps show. I don’t use the line  numbers because they’re a bit cumbersome. I find that by ordering ques- tion using page breaks and Moodle’s own numbering system, the quiz is  displayed well and efficiently.  When you’re finished, don’t forget to click the Save Changes button!  Previewing the quiz  After previewing your individual questions and adding them to your quiz, you  need to preview and take the quiz yourself to make sure the layout, feedback,  and points allocated for each question are all correct. From your Editing Quiz  page, select the Preview Tab, and Moodle takes you to the quiz.     To get to the Editing Quiz page, click the quiz from the Activities block on the  course front page, and then select the Edit tab. Table 11-3 shows the icons you  see on the Editing Quiz page.  Table 11-3  Icons  Moodle Editing Quiz Page Icons  Description or Question Type Moves the question to the quiz  Allows you to preview the question  Allows you to edit the question  Moves question up or down in the list  Deletes the question   continued    268 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Table 11-3  continued  Icons  Description or Question Type Allows for a number of questions to be selected and moved  to a quiz  Calculated  Description  Essay  Matching  Embedded answers  Cloze   Multiple choice  Short answer  Numerical short answer  Random short-answer matching  True false  If you set a keyword for the quiz, you need to enter it. Take the quiz, submit  the answers, and finish. When you submit the finished quiz, Moodle returns  a page with the results, as shown in Figure 11-25. Notice all the information  Moodle gives to learners just below the name of the quiz: You see the date and  time when the quiz was taken and completed, the time it took, the total points  scored out of the maximum, the percentage grade, and general feedback.  Below the scores, Moodle displays the answers. In this particular example,  if the answer is incorrect, the correct answer is not displayed because the  teacher set up the quiz to let each student take it four times. If the student’s  answer is incorrect on the last try, the correct answers are displayed.    Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  269  Figure 11-25:  Reviewing  a submitted  quiz.          If you allowed for shuffling within multiple-choice questions and have a com- bined answer  such as a, b, and c are all correct but answers d and e are not ,  shuffling doesn’t work because the answers don’t combine the same way the  next time the student takes the quiz.  a, b, and c may include d as a, b, or c.   In this case, I recommend you use All or None as one of the multiple-choice  options instead of a, b, and c. Be careful about using All of the Above as an  answer because this answer may appear as a. You can, of course, choose not  to use shuffling within multiple-choice questions and then not worry about  inconsistencies if you have more than one answer correct and or use All of  the Above.  Managing Quizzes and Data  Moodle collects data on all learners’ activities, which is discussed in Chapter  14. Within the Quiz module, data is collected on individual learners, including  results for individual responses and itemized analysis for each question.  Viewing the results  On the Editing Quiz page  refer to Figure 11-25 , click the Results tab. This  action opens the Overview quiz reports page, shown in Figure 11-26. There  are four links right under the tabs: Overview, Regrade, Manual Grading, and  Item Analysis.   270 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 11-26:  Looking at  the Results  tab.                   ✓ Overview page: This page displays detailed information about learn-  ers’ attempts, including dates when the quiz was taken and completed,  time taken, overall score, score per question, and the feedback. If more  than one attempt is allowed, you see the follow-up attempt s  under the  learner’s name. The check box to the left of each attempt allows you  to delete it. Note: If you want to add questions to the quiz, you need to  delete all the attempts before Moodle allows you to make any changes.  At the bottom of the list, Moodle provides the overall average score as  well as Select All and Deselect All links, which select all the attempts on  the quiz or deselect the selections.  See Figure 11-27.  To remove the  attempts whether they’re all selected or just individual selections, click  the Delete Selected Attempts button.    Downloading data: Moodle provides you with tools to download  the data into industry standard formats. Located right under the  Delete Selected Attempts button, you can click a button to down- load the data in ODS format, Excel format, or text format. Just click  the appropriate button and follow the simple instructions.    Preferences for the page and the report: Moodle default setting dis- plays information about all attempts on the quiz. The drop-down  list below the download buttons lets you select All Attempts, which  includes students in the current class and all past students who  attempted the quiz who are no longer enrolled. The All Students  option selects everyone whether or not they attempted the quiz.  The other two options — Students with Attempts Only and Students     Chapter 11: Quizzing and Testing in Moodle  271  with No Attempts Only — are self-explanatory. Below the drop-down  list is a check box further allowing you to show or download only  the attempts that are graded for each user for the highest grade.  Figure 11-27:  Selecting  and dese- lecting  attempts.                    You can also select how many students you want to be displayed  on each page and if you want to show or download marks for each  question — the default is Yes. Click the Save Preferences button.  Below the Save Preferences button, Moodle shows you a graphical  display of a number of students achieving grade ranges, as shown  in Figure 11-28.  ✓ Regrade page: This link takes you to a report listing all quiz answers   that you’ve altered when you were regarding. Moodle recalculates  the grade only if you change the point value for a question or a quiz.  Selecting the Regrade tab automatically starts the regrade process.  Please note that this tab triggers the process and highlights those stu- dent answers that have been changed through the regrading process.  ✓ Manual Grading page: This link is for manually grading questions that   cannot be marked by Moodle, such as the essay questions, and for  manually overriding and adding comments. For instance, you may find  learners answer a specific short-answer question correctly, though  Moodle marks it wrong. You can manually change the grade until  the quiz is closed. I would then suggest that you add the acceptable  answers to the question or alter the question.   272 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course      ✓ Item Analysis page: This tool is fabulous for evaluating the repeatability   of the questions in the quiz. Moodle displays this report in a table, as  shown in Figure 11-29. The basic info you want to see is comparing how  the highest scores from students compared with the lowest on individ- ual questions. Table 11-4 explains the table headings and how you can  use them for your analysis.  Figure 11-28:  Student  grade  ranges.       Figure 11-29:  The Item  Analysis  Table.

Standard deviation; measures the variation of selected answers Discrimination index Discrimination Coefficient  Below the table, you can choose a number of analysis options and use the three  buttons to download the table in ODS format, Excel format, or text format.  Importing and exporting questions  If you have a repository of questions from various resources or use third- party software such as Blackboard or Hot Potatoes, Moodle has built-in tools  and default formats enabling you to import questions and answers.  Often the method isn’t straightforward with some of the software. It all  depends on the database and on how it is set up. I found that it takes me  longer to edit and check everything than using the Moodle interface and cre- ating my questions. If you have hundreds of questions, I recommend experi- menting; some good third-party tools can aid the process if you don’t have  success with the importing tools within Moodle.  You can also export your questions to a text file and make them available for  reuse for other applications.  Links to Import and Export Questions pages are found on the Edit Quiz page,  right under the tabs.  Refer to Figure 11-7.  Clicking these links takes you to  the Import Questions From File page, from which you choose formats and    274 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   make selections such as the category you want to import questions to or  from, file format, and nearest grade. You can find more detailed explanation  on the companion Webs site as well as links to resources on the Web.    Moodle supports a popular quiz format called Hot Potatoes and TexToys quiz- zes. Teachers create the quizzes on their computers and then upload them to  their Moodle courses. The Hot Potatoes module called hotpot module plugin  is hidden within Moodle by default until you or your system administrator  turns it on. If you have an administrative user account, go to the site front  page Administration Block. From the subcategories, click Modules, and then  click Activities. Enable the plugin by selecting the eye icon hide show column.  You can find more information about administrating Moodle in Chapter 13.   Chapter 12  Using Databases to Share  Resources and Adding the   Latest News via RSS  In This Chapter ▶ Understanding the reasons to use the Moodle database ▶ Building a database, adding fields, and editing the interface ▶ Exploring what your database looks like to you and your learners ▶ Managing your database and ensuring the quality of entries ▶ Adding RSS feeds to your front page and Moodle Activities  The Moodle Database module is a simple database that you can quickly set up   and is easy to use for general purposes. The database has been embedded  in Moodle to serve as a tool for collaborative development that introduces your  learners to the structure and function of databases as well as their usefulness.  The Moodle database isn’t meant to be as powerful as MS Access or MySQL.  Rather, it’s a tool that you and your learners can use for projects, galleries,  portfolios, and resources. In this chapter, you find out how to set up a data- base, add your own fields, and tweak the interface. You can have your learners  help structure the database and learn an important skill. If that would be too  much to ask of your learners, you can set it up for them, and they can populate  it with data such as text, links, photos, graphic files, sound, and or video.  In addition to databases, this chapter also introduces you to RSS feeds and  how to set up an RSS feed block on the course front page as well set up RSS in  other Moodle activities  such as a forum, wiki, and database . I can hear you  thinking, “Why is she introducing newsfeeds in a chapter on databases?” Great  question! The answer is twofold. First, I think it’s a great tool, and I struggled  with where to put it. You can add newsfeeds in a number of different places in  your course  such as your front page, forums, glossaries, wikis, and databases     276 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   to inform your learners about the latest topical issue and give them informa- tion they need. The reason you chose to bring this information to your learners  is because you thought it has some value. Sharing valuable information and  resources is exactly what databases are for, just like newsfeeds.  Harnessing the Power of Databases  The Database module enables instructors and learners to build, make avail- able, and search a large storage space of information in a variety of formats.  This information can be on any topic, and you or your learners choose what  to add. You can add multiple databases to a course.  Exploring how Moodle databases work  You can set up the database in one of three ways:           ✓ As a course database, where everyone in the course contributes   and or uses it  ✓ As a group database, used for group projects that can be shared with   other groups of the course or the whole Moodle site  ✓ As an individual project database, between you and your learner, or   for your own use, which is limited only by your imagination  Your learners can use the database for storing images, files, videos, sound files,  Web addresses, numerical data, contact data, and so on. The Moodle database  also enables you and learners to rate and view entries, write comments to  entries, and set up an approval option so that you can safeguard the database  entries. For instance, you can set up a group of students with permission allow- ing them to approve what’s entered and viewable by the other course members.  The Moodle community provides good examples of how to use a Moodle  database. See the database in action at http:  moodle.org buzz. This  site is made available through Moodle.org and uses the database to store  news and publications about Moodle from around the world, as shown  in Figure 12-1. You can find other examples on the Moodle.org demo site,  http:  demo.moodle.net.    The Database activity module is a collaborative activity within your course; it  should not be confused with the MySQL Moodle database that stores all your  course data for the modules in the Moodle site.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  277  Figure 12-1:  An example  of how the  Moodle  database is  being used.             Finding creative ways to use a database  As you familiarize yourself with Moodle activities and experiment with using the  database, you will find many uses for it. After you teach your learners about its  capabilities and set up a few simple databases for group or individual projects,  you’ll be surprised at the creative uses your learners will come up with.  The Database module isn’t just for learners, though. Instructors can also collabo- rate and develop a database that they can share among themselves. For exam- ple, several teachers of different subjects created a college information database  pertaining to their areas of expertise. They involved the students and created  a repository of study programs in computer science, arts, science, math, social  sciences, literature, and languages. Students collected information on local and  out-of-state colleges and categorized them so they could be searched by size,  requirements, fees, rankings, contact person, scholarships, and so on.  Here are few other ways that you can use the Database module:  ✓ Storage for content and images so that learners can upload files and   then download them from other places  ✓ Private student storage for project   278 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                              ✓ Contact database for teachers or students  personal, business,   or academic   ✓ Scholarship repository ✓ Research repository  articles, URLs, references, experts, and students   own research data   ✓ Image gallery ✓ Subject database that can include a collection of data such as links to   resources, experts, citations, and so on  ✓ Arts competition: database created by style and medium, such as   pottery, oils, watercolors, poetry, musical pieces, drama, and so on.  If the competition is within the school, consider letting the students be  the ones to review entries and decide the winner, or if it’s an outside  competition, let them pick which piece will represent the school.  ✓ Summary of course activities, including lectures, problems solving,   and so on  Students can use this summary for reviews for tests or to catch up  after an absence. Students can ask to contribute after each class, lab,  or lecture. This summary will take some organization skills, but it’ll  be a great resource to populate information.        Adding a Database to Your Course  The Moodle database is slightly more complex than the Quiz module, but less  so than the Lesson activity. If you have set up a database or are used to struc- tured information, you’ll find this database quite simple to use. If you haven’t  had any experience, don’t worry: Find a chunk of time and follow the instruc- tions at your own pace. There are no risks involved. You can easily change set- tings at a later date. The database is a standalone module and has no impact on  anything else you’ve done in your course prior to adding the database. That’s  one of the strengths of Moodle: All activities are independent of each other.  In the simplest form, a database has two parts:   ✓ Fields are the tables where you store data in the form of text, dates,   files, images, URLs, and so on.  ✓ Templates are what you and your learners see. Templates are the front   end, whereas the fields are the back end of the database. Templates  enable you to control the layout of information when you’re adding to,  editing, or viewing the database.  Before you dive in to adding a database, spend few minutes thinking about  what information you want it to contain. Planning ahead will save you time in    Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  279  the long run because you need to make these decisions when you’re setting it  up. To help you with your planning, here are few questions to ask yourself:  ✓ What will I be using the database for?   Knowing vaguely is okay for the first time you create a database. Don’t  worry; you don’t have to be precise. Sometimes it’s good to play and get  your hands dirty.  ✓ What type of information will the database contain? Will it contain one   topic  a single entry  and data related to the topic? Or will it contain  multiple entries with detailed information related to each entry?  ✓ How will I and others want to view the information? ✓ Will learners be adding and editing the database?    The companion Web site has a number of examples of databases and a flow   chart and template that will help you plan your database.  After you’ve answered some of the questions in the preceding list, you’re  ready to create the database. You set up the database in two parts, similar  to the way you use the Quiz module to set up quizzes. You first set all the  settings for the database as you did in the quiz. Then you create the fields  and set and or edit the template.  Setting up your database  To set up the first part, the database, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the upper-right corner of your   course front page.  2.  From the Add an Activity drop-down list, in the week or topic section   of your course, select Database.   Moodle takes you to the Adding a New Database page, shown in Figure 12-2.  3.  Enter a name for your database as well as a short description of the   purpose of the database.  4.  Select the following General options as they relate to your course   and project:    Available From To Dates: This availability is for both viewing the   database and adding entries to it.    Viewable From To: Setting these dates enables the database to be   available only for viewing. It’s closed for adding any data.                                      280 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 12-2:  The Adding  a New  Database  page.                  Required Entries: You can make this a required activity, meaning   students have to enter a certain number of entries before it will be  considered complete. From the drop-down list, select the number  of entries required of each student. Moodle will send reminder mes- sages to the students who haven’t completed the required entries.  You can require up to 50 entries. The Moodle default is None.    Entries Required before Viewing: You can set the number of entries   each student is required to submit before they get to view other  entries in the database. If they haven’t completed the required  entries, they can see only the entry page and not the pages with  complete data.  If you set up the database to require entries before viewing,  make sure you or your system administrator disables the data- base autolinking filter. If it isn’t disabled, Moodle can’t determine  whether a learner has submitted the required entries. You can dis- able or enable autolinking from the Site Administration block. From  the block, click Modules, then Filters, and then Manage Filters.    Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  281                           This is discussed in Chapter 13.  Remember that you need to have  an Administrator user account or privileges to access the setting.  Alternatively, get very friendly with your system administrator. It’s  always a good idea to become his good friend. Overworked and  unappreciated, bring them Coke and Skittles and tell them how  wonderful they are — doesn’t take much, really.    Maximum Entries: This setting allows you to put a limit on how   many entries students are allowed to enter into the database before  they’re blocked. This has been added to help prevent spamming.  Most of the time you don’t have to worry about this problem. Place  a requirement if you feel some students will get so carried away and  “data happy” that they may do the work for others.    Comments: Enabling this function by selecting Yes from the drop-  down list allows for comments to be added to each entry and view- able as a drop-down field in the template.    Require Approval? If you set this functionality to Yes, each entry  will require approval before it’s added to the database. You can  set up a role for an assistant that approves the data entries, or you  can enable this capability to specific learners. See Chapter 4 for  details on how to set permissions to activity capabilities.    RSS Articles: Select the number of articles you want to be automati-  cally added to your database. Note that you need to enable the  RSS feed in the Site Administration block. If you don’t have the  privileges on your user account, ask your system administrator to  enable this module.  See the discussion on RSS newsfeeds in the  last section in this chapter.     Allow Posts to Be Rated? If you enable this setting, it allows you to   rate entries, and the score will be added to the grade book. It’s one  way to get your learners involved. For example, you can ask them to  add three entries, each worth five points. Receiving points that go  toward their final grade or may be an incentive to add more quality  entries. This is more of an incentive for younger learners in secondary  schools than for learners attending training sessions or college levels.    Grade: If you allow for posts to be rated, the grade functionality  is enabled. From the drop-down list, select a scale or a numeric  value. See Chapter 8 for details on how to set up scales and grades. 5.  In the Common Module Settings section, choose the following functions   as required for the course:    Group Mode: If the group mode is forced at the course level, the set-  ting within individual activities is ignored. If you created groups, you  can choose No Groups; Separate Groups, where students only work  within their groups; or Visible Groups, where students see other  entries but cannot add to the database if they aren’t assigned to the  group. I discuss groups in detail in Chapter 4.   282 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     ID Number: This option is useful to set if you’re grading the activ- ity, and it will appear in the grade book and or exported to a CSV  file. The grade book ID numbers keep the tables shorter, which  means less horizontal scrolling.  6.  Click the Save and Display button.    Moodle takes you to the database editing page, where you can create  the fields for entries, as described next.  Adding fields to your database  The next step is to create fields for your data. You can either create your own  fields or use presets, which are fields you’ve created earlier in another appli- cation or within Moodle database. The purpose of the presets functionality is  to save you time so that you don’t have to create the fields more than once if  you’re replicating the database entries.  Figure 12-3 shows the Database field design and editing page. Notice the tabs  across the page. You’re going to be working in the Fields tab, which opens by  default when you first define your database by following the steps in the pre- ceding section. If you were to use presets, you would import them from the  Presets tab, as described in the section “Viewing Your Database — What You  and Your Learners Will See,” later in this chapter.             Figure 12-3:  A newly  created  database.  The Fields  tab is  opened.    Exploring the types of fields Fields define the basic structure of your database and the information your  learners will be entering. Individual fields are units of information. You create  your database by selecting the different units that you need for your informa- tion related to something you’ve chosen to support your teaching unit. You  can have any number of fields defining different types of information. For  example, in the Moodle demo Resources for Social Networks shown in Figure  12-3, I can have a date field for my Moodle social network resources, used for  listing the date when specific entries were posted. Table 12-1 lists the specific  field choices as well as a brief explanation of how you can use them.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  283  Table 12-1  Field Type Check Box  Date  File  Menu  Menu   Multi- Select  Number  Picture Radio  Buttons  Text  URL   Text Area  Latitude  Longitude  Number  Types of Database Fields  Description Enables check boxes. Each new line represents a new check  box. Text will appear next to the check box. Multiple check boxes  enable users to select more than one entry. For example, if you  were listing after school activities, you would need more than one  check box to enter, sports, music, work, and so on. If you want to  limit the entry to only one selection, use the Radio Buttons field. Allows learners to enter a date. Moodle offers a drop-down list for  selecting a day, month, and year. Learners can upload any type of file to this field. If they’re upload- ing a graphic file, advise them to use the Picture field. Enables learners to use a drop down menu. Each listed option  needs to be added on a different line. Same as Menu, though this option enables learners to select more  than one of the choices from the drop-down list by holding down  the Ctrl or Shift key as they select. Learners can enter any number, whether it’s positive, negative, or  zero, and the number can include decimal notations. Used to upload any image file from learners’ computer.  Used to require a student to choose one option from a range of  options. If the learners don’t select any of the options, Moodle pre- vents them from submitting the entries and prompts them to select an  option. You can use this field with Yes No or True False questions. A text box field enabling learners to enter text up to 60 characters  in length. Formatting options are not available.  Allows users to enter text over 60 characters with formatting  options  similar to forum posts .  Enables learners to enter a Web address  URL . They’re given an  option to select autolink, which automatically makes the URL an  active link to the address. If you force a name of the link, the name  will be used for the displayed hyperlink. Enables learners to enter geographic locations by entering the  latitude and longitude. When learners view the entry, Moodle  automatically provides links to geographic data services such  as Google Earth Maps, OpenStreetMap, GeaBios, Mapstars,  Multimap, and so on.  Note: The teacher can choose which of  those links appear or choose not to use any at all.      I suggest you inform your learners about the capabilities and restrictions of  the specific fields, such as the Text field.   284 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Defining your fields Open the Fields tab of the database field design and editing page  refer to  Figure 12-3  and then follow these steps to define the fields you need for  your database:  1.  From the Create a New Field drop-down list, select the type of field   you need.   The Text Field editing page appears. The options that appear on this  page depend on what type of field you selected from the list. For exam- ple, if you selected Text Field, you see the page shown in Figure 12-4.  Figure 12-4:  The Text  Field editing  page.                              2.  Enter the field name.    All the field names in the database need to be unique and short because  they will be displayed in the template. Intuitive names are good.  3.  Add a short description of the field. 4.  Add and or select other settings as required by the type of field.    For example, in Figure 12-4, adding a text field requires only Steps 1  through 3 and then clicking the Add button. Other fields, such as a Text  Area field, require you to enter the width and height of the text box and  offer you some default settings that you can alter. All the different types  of fields are straightforward, but if you need more information, visit the  Moodle docs at http:  docs.moodle.org en mod data field.  5.  Click the Add button.    Moodle takes you back to the Fields page and shows the field you just  added, as shown in Figure 12-5. Notice the Default Sort Fields drop- down list options. I left the default settings. These fields enable you to  determine how new fields are organized in the database. You can make  changes to them any time.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  285  Figure 12-5:  A database  showing  newly  created field  and field  positioning  options.               Figure 12-6:  The Field  Added page.       6.  Repeat Steps 1 through 5 to add more fields.    In the example shown in Figure 12-6, notice how Moodle builds your  fields, giving you options to edit, delete, and sort each.   When you’re finished adding all the fields you require, you’re ready to  start editing your templates, as described in the next section.  Editing your database interface  After setting up all the fields you need for your database, Moodle creates a  default template that determines the front end, also referred to as the inter- face. This template enables you and your learners to view, list, and edit the  database entries.  The templates are all HTML pages  Web pages  with a specific set of tags for  the Database module. When you first select the Templates tab, Moodle takes  you to the Single template, as shown in Figure 12-7. You can select another  template by clicking one of the template links directly below the tabs.   286 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Template links  Figure 12-7:  Adding a  Single  template  to the  database.             Editing the Single template The Single template is used to display a single entry instead of a list of  entries. This template gives you more space for text or images. Think about  how you will organize the information if you have a number of entries in a  single-entry template.  All the tags available for the single template are listed on the left side of the  editing page.  Refer to Figure 12-7.  Moodle reads the tags by looking at the  information between the square brackets [ ], which define data tags, mean- ing that when you enter data  text or numbers  in the fields, the Database  module knows to replace the generic description you entered  for instance,  replacing [URL] with the actual URL . So what you are doing is editing the  entry instead of creating a whole new one.  Tags represented by  mean that the text currently in the template will be  replaced by a link or an icon button to enable a particular action. These tags  are specific to actions such as   ✓ edit, which creates an icon you can click enabling you to edit an entry ✓ delete, which creates a clickable icon enabling you to delete an entry  There are a number of these tags, such as More, Approve, Comment, and  User. You can create more icons by just adding icon to the editor. See  the Moodle.org online documentation for more information on tag usage at  http:  docs.moodle.org en Database_templatesTag_usage.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  287  Under the available tags list, you see two buttons that give you additional  editing options:  ✓ Reset Template: Allows you to revert to the original template created   when you set up the fields. So don’t worry; go and play. It’s okay to make  mistakes. You’ll learn from them, and you can always go back to the  original — nothing is lost.  ✓ Disable Editor: This option is useful if you want to work in raw HTML  code instead of toggling between the editor text box and the code. If  you click the Disable Editor button, Moodle provides you with pure  text window to alter the HTML tags, as shown in Figure 12-8. Notice  the button name changes to Enable Editor so that you can return to  the editing window to see the results of your clever changes.  After you make changes to your database template, make sure you click the  Save Template button.  Exploring other templates In addition to the Single template, you can choose from six other possible  templates based on your database requirements. Here’s a rundown of the  other templates you can use:  ✓ List template: This template is the first thing students see when they  access the database. The default template generated after you select  your fields isn’t very exciting, and you may want to lay it out so it looks  less bland and boring. You’re provided with three fields and given an  option to add a header  an overview , a body, and a footer. The header  can be used in the tables identifying each row, the body for the data,               Figure 12-8:  A Single  Template  editing page  showing  the HTML  code for  the fields.     288 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                  and the footer to end the table. The overview is useful when you are  exporting the database as a CSV file. HTML tag knowledge is useful. For  example, if you want to use the footer to end the table, all you need to  do is add the   tag. With a little tweaking, you can make the  whole List template into one table, which looks a lot neater. Visit the  companion Web site for the coding and examples or visit http:   moodle.org buzz to view an example.  ✓ Advanced Search template: This template is useful if you want to add  an advanced search in your database. It’s especially useful if you have  many fields and your database will grow quickly. Users need to be able  to narrow a search when exposed to a large amount of data.  ✓ Add template: Use this template when you want to add or edit entries   to the default template. Using this template, you can create an interface  form enabling learners to enter data quickly in one form than specific  fields. This is useful if you have lots of data to fill in.  ✓ RSS template: This template enables you to structure how the newsfeed  is presented to the learners.  I discuss RSS feeds in more detail later in the  chapter.  Remember that the database will publish the entries right into  the field, without your having to do anything. Just imagine choosing a topic  and having all the news fed into your database without spending hours  searching the Internet or going through your favorite journal articles and  Web sites to gather the information for your students. Quite brilliant.  ✓ CSS template: If any HTML templates require CSS to enhance styles,   you can add them to the CSS template. Using CSS, you can change fonts,  colors, spacing, alignment, and other display features that may be lim- ited by the HTML tags. You need some knowledge of CSS in order to  use this template.  ✓ JavaScript template: Same as with the CSS template — if you know   JavaScript, you can add JavaScript routines in this template. The  JavaScript will be defined when the page loads. For example, you can  run scripts around names and how many times they’re displayed, or  define the size of images and sound files. Knowledge of JavaScript,  run-time routines and HTML is essential. If you have no idea what  I’m talking about, forget this template.  Adding an entry  After you’ve edited the template and saved your changes, click the Add Entry  tab located above the template links. Moodle takes you to the interface to  add or edit an entry. In Figure 12-9, I entered the information into the fields  specified in the template shown earlier in Figure 12-7.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  289  After you complete your entry, click the Save and View button at the bottom  of the page. Moodle informs you that the entry was saved and then displays  the entry, as shown in Figure 12-10. Notice that the tab switched to the View  Single page, with editing and deleting icons at the bottom of the screen.  Figure 12-9:  Adding a  new entry  into a  database  URL field.          Figure 12-10:  Moodle  confirms the  new entry.                 290 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Viewing Your Database — What  You and Your Learners Will See  When you or your learners select the database from the course front page,  Moodle displays the main database page with a number of tabs. Each tab has  a specific function. Student roles, by default, see only three tabs, as shown in  Figure 12-11. In this list, I describe all the tabs shown in Figure 2-12:  Figure 12-11:  The  learners’  view of the  database  from the  View List  tab.                   ✓ View List tab: This is the first page you and your learners see when you  select the database from the course page. The page lists the entries that  you and your learners have added. You decided how many entries can  be viewed in the list when you set up the database. Note that you see  the same view; the only difference is that you see more tabs.  ✓ View Single tab: Only one entry is displayed. If you enabled users to add   comments, the comment feature is available here.  ✓ Search tab: Enables you or your learners to search for specific entries. ✓ Add Entry tab: Allows you and your learners  if you enabled student   entries  to add entries to the database by filling in the form you cre- ated. I give an explanation on how to add entries earlier. The front end,  the interface is decided on the templates you have chosen and possibly  edited. Note: Your learners can see this tab only if you enabled the  Student role to add entries to the database.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  291  Figure 12-12:  The main  database  page  showing  all the tabs  available.                   ✓ Export tab: You can export your data to a CSV file with a choice of   delimiters, Excel, or ODS. This is a required field. One format must be  chosen in order for Moodle to proceed with the export. You can also  choose which fields you want to export. They’re all listed with a check  mark in the check box. If you don’t need a particular record of the entry,  deselect the check box and then click the Export Database Records  button. This tab is not seen by your learners.  ✓ Templates tab: The template controls how you enter and edit the data  into your database. For the lowdown on the individual templates, see  the section “Editing your database interface,” earlier in this chapter.  This tab is not seen by learners.  ✓ Fields tab: This is the tab where you define what type of data you want   to enter into your database.  See the earlier section “Adding fields to  your database” for more on this tab.  This tab is not seen by learners.  ✓ Preset tab: A preset, in the Moodle database, is an ingenious functional- ity that allows you to reuse the database you created, saving you valu- able time. Similar to the quiz question pool, the motto is “create once,  reuse many times.” For example, if you set up your course in groups and  you want each group to have its own database, you can replicate it by  using this functionality. Similarly, you can share the database  referred  to as preset  with your colleagues, just as the Moodle community has  shared its most popular databases with you. For example, the ever-so- popular image gallery preset is bundled in the Database module to help  you learn how to use this tool and get you started creating quickly.  Check out the companion Web site for more presets!  To import a preset, follow these steps:   292 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   1.  Click the Presets tab.    The Presets page appears, as shown in Figure 12-13.  Figure 12-13:  The  importing  and  exporting  settings of  the Presets  page.                              2.  In the Import section, click the Choose File button, locate the Zip file   on your computer, and then click the Import button.  3.  After the preset is imported, you can alter the fields and the template,   and start to add entries.   Note that after you’ve imported and or created a number of databases,  you will have an option to choose a previously loaded preset.   Quite simple, don’t you think? All the tedious work is done for  you — marvelous!  If you’ve developed an absolutely fabulous database and it has become a  marvel to all your colleagues and learners, share it! You will be loved by all.  What better way is there to become popular in your department, organiza- tion, and even an international star than by sharing your creation through  the Moodle.org community?  To export your database preset, click the Presets tab and then do one of  the following:  ✓ Select the Export as Zip option by clicking the Export button. Follow the  steps to save your file as a zipped file on your computer so that you can  import it to another course or Moodle site.  ✓ Select the Save as Preset option by clicking the Save button. Moodle  takes you through a few steps, and Moodle publishes the database for  other teachers on the site to use. When you save your database as a  preset, it appears in the preset list, and you can reuse it.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  293  Managing Your Database  Making sure users enter quality information into the database is an impor- tant aspect of developing a collaborative tool that can be used as a valuable  teaching resource. Be sure to educate your learners about entering quality  data instead of just populating it willy-nilly. Structure is only one aspect of  a database. Learners often enter information based on their knowledge and  understanding of the purpose of the database and its goals. Don’t be shy  about going over organization, accuracy, and interpretation — grasping  those elements can become a learning exercise. However much you intro- duce the concept, as the database grows, you need to track the information  to ensure the information’s consistency and accuracy.  Moodle has added a number of tools that help you manage the information  and ensure the quality of the entries.  You can either set these options when  you first create your database or go back later and enable them.    ✓ Comments: By adding comments, you can guide students, give them   feedback, and let them know you’re watching and reading what they’ve  entered. I can hear what you’re thinking: “How can I possibly find time to  add comments to entries, especially if I have more than 90 students in my  three Moodle courses!” You don’t have to do this alone. Remember that  you can set permission to specific student accounts, guest accounts, or  create a new database monitor role. Why not get an assistant? You can  ask a previous student, trainee, or a group leader to take the burden off  your shoulders.  ✓ Require Approval: Moodle hides entries from the learners in the course   until you, or someone with the capability approves the new entry.  Requiring approval helps you ensure that the entries are valuable and accu- rate before they become available to learners. Note that this is not a default  setting: You need to select the option for it when you set up your database. ✓ Ratings: If the preceding two tools seem like too much work, one way to   ensure quality and quantity is to assign grades for entries to the database.  You can set up a simple point system or use a scale. Rewarding students  for their contribution is most likely the best method to ensure quality.  Students like to be rewarded, and they can view creating entries as a  simple way to bring up a grade. Rating in the database doesn’t provide  you with a feedback field as in the Assignment or Quiz modules. However,  you can combine rating with comments, and this becomes a powerful  learning and assessment tool, even more so if you involve groups.            294 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course                                 Enabling students, guests, student teachers, or any other user account to  rate, comment on, or even approve entries can save you time. You select the  setting options for enabling comments when you set up the database. You  need to enable the other capabilities by giving the roles specific permissions.  If you didn’t set the rating, comment, and approval functions when you set up  the database, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Update This Database button on the database viewing page,   located in the top-right corner.   Moodle takes you to Editing Database page. You see three tabs as with  all activities. Moodle defaults to the Settings tab, where you can update  and change any of the options and settings.  2.  Scroll down the page. From the drop-down lists next to Comments and   Require Approval?, select Yes.  3.  Next to the question Allow Posts to Be Rated?, select the Use Ratings   check box. Select the grade or scale from the drop-down list.  4.  Click the Save and Display button.  To allow for specific capabilities on different roles, follow these steps:  1.  Repeat Step 1 in the preceding step list. 2.  Select the Override Permissions tab by clicking it. 3.  From the Role to Override drop-down list, select the role you want   to override.   For example, in Figure 12-14, I selected Student.  4.  From the Capability list, select the Allow radio button for the Write   Comments feature and the Rate Entries feature.  See Figure 12-14.   5.  Click Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen.  Your students in the course now have the abilities to rate and comment  on entries. If you want only specific learners to have permission, you need  to override the permission capabilities from their profiles. Note: You can  create a new role  such as Student Teacher  and assign the role the capabili- ties discussed in this section, and then give specific students this role.  Refer to Chapter 4 for more information and examples on roles and  setting permissions.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  295  Figure 12-14:  The  Override  Permissions  page.       Adding RSS to Your Course  I know you have been itching to learn how to add a newsfeed to your course  and to finally understand what RSS stands for so you can impress all your  friends. RSS is a geeky term standing for Really Simple Syndication  also  referred to as Web feed, feed, or channel . What this means is that when  you subscribe to a site on the Internet, the news is brought to you so that  you spend less time looking for updated information in blogs, e-zines, news  headlines, audio, or video. The short summary in the RSS includes publishing  dates and a link to the source.  “Fantastic,” I hear you thinking! Before I take you through the steps on how to  add it to your course, I need to give you a little more information.   296 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Moodle enables you to bring feeds  information  to various activities in  Moodle. You can use RSS with                                ✓ Forums ✓ Glossaries ✓ Databases ✓ The course front page  blocks   For you to be able to use RSS, it needs to be enabled in the Administration  block in the Server subsection. If you don’t have administrative privileges,  ask your system administrator to enable it. It will also have to be enabled in  the Forum activity. When you’re making this request, ask the administrator  to enable administrative and teacher submitters in the Blocks section. If you  need instructions on how to make these changes, see Chapter 13, which pro- vides a brief rundown on many of the Moodle administrative tasks.  Including RSS on the course front page  The RSS feeds block allows you to bring feeds to a block on the course front  page. The block will automatically update to bring in the latest feeds. You can  add one or more RSS feeds to your course front page. You create a list of the  Web sites and then you can select from the list how many you want to arrive  to your activity or course front page block at any one time. Site and course  front pages are common places for an RSS feed block s .  To set up an RSS feed block, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Turn Editing On button in the top-right corner of your course   front page.  2.  Find the Blocks block on the front page  you may have to scroll down   to find it  and select Remote RSS Feed from the drop-down list.   The Remote News Feed block appears, as shown in Figure 12-15.  3.  Click the edit icon on the Remote News Feed block.    Moodle takes you to the default page, Configuring a Remote RSS Feeds  Block, shown in Figure 12-16.  4.  Set the following options to configure the block feeds:    Display each link’s description? Select Yes or No from the drop-down  list. If you select Yes, the block shows the description of each article  as it appears on the Web; select No, and the block displays only the  title. Both are generated by the feed — you have no work here.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  297  Figure 12-15:  The course  front page  showing the  RSS block.     Figure 12-16:  The  Configuring  a Remote  RSS Feeds  Block page.                      Remote News Feed block    Max Number Entries to Show per Block: The default is 5. Moodle   displays the most recent first.    Choose the Feeds . . .: After you select a number of feeds, you see a  check box next to them and you can select each feed by selecting  the check box. You can break up the feed block by having more  than one.    Title: Make sure you add a title, or Moodle takes the title from the   newsfeeds, which can be messy if you have more than one feed.    Display a Link? If you select Yes from the drop-down list, Moodle   provides you with a link to the full article and the original site from  where it was first published. This link is useful if your learners will  want to reference the information in their projects, essays, and  so on.   298 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course     Show Channel Image? Newsfeeds have images and logos and dis-  play them with the feed unless you leave the default as No.  Allowing for images and logos can eat up your Moodle space,  which is particularly problematic if you’re on a restricted space  budget. I recommend leaving the default No if you need impressive  negotiating skills to get more space for your course.  5.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle returns you to the course front page. You see the title of your  newsfeed in the block.  6.  From the RSS block, click the Add Edit link located right under the   editing icons.   Moodle takes you to the Configuring a Remote RSS Feeds Block page  again, this time with the Manage All My Feeds tab selected, as shown in  Figure 12-17.       Unless you get the privilege to add the feeds, which I strongly recommend,  only the administrator has this privilege but can be easily changed to  Administrator and Teacher. Bring your system administrator a soda and  chocolate ask for this privilege.  7.  Fill in the following information about the feed you want to add:    Add a News Feed URL: Copy and paste  or type  the URL address   of the RSS feed in the field provided. Moodle generates the RSS  page address.    Custom Title: In the field provided, add your title. Moodle tells you   that if you leave it blank it will use the one supplied by the feed,  which means the generating site.    Shared Feed: Select this check box if you want to make the feed avail- able to all the courses in the Moodle site. This option can be useful,  for instance, for an announcements feed in college publications.                                 Figure 12-17:  The  Configuring  a Remote  RSS Feeds  Block page.     Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  299   Remember that even if you select this option, courses that don’t  have the RSS block enabled will not display the RSS block. Don’t  rely on sharing the RSS feed block as a main means of communicat- ing important news.    Validate Feed: Before clicking the Add button, Moodle provides a  validation feed tool to confirm the feed URL is accurate. Click the  Validate Feed link. Wait a few seconds, and Moodle returns a vali- dation page congratulating you, as shown in Figure 12-18.                   Figure 12-18:  The output  of Moodle’s  feed   validator.    8.  Click the Add button to submit the feed.    Moodle confirms the addition and returns you to the Manage All My Feeds  tab, where you can edit it and add another feed.  See Figure 12-19.    Note that it will take a little time before the server refreshes, and  you will see the new news feed in your newly created Remote News  Feeds block.   300 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course   Figure 12-19:  The  Configuring  a Remote  RSS Feeds  Block page  with a new  feed added.                     Add RSS to forums  If you set up a forum discussion around a specific learning goal topic, a  debate, or a project, you and your learners may find it very useful to enable  newsfeeds to be brought to the forum. Forum newsfeeds can generate fur- ther discussions and debates. Even though RSS is enabled, it also has to be  enabled in the Site Administration block, located in the Modules subsection  in Activities under Forum. When you enable RSS, the Forum Editing page  includes an RSS section with two extra settings. If you already have RSS  enabled for your activities, you don’t have to worry about pleading with  your system administrator.  To set up RSS in your forum, follow these steps:  1.  Add  or select update  a forum in the section where you want the   forum to appear. If you already have a forum set up, click the Forums  link in the Activities block, select the particular forum, and click the  Update This Forum button located in the top-right corner.   If this is a new forum discussion, complete all the fields to set up the  forum. See Chapter 8 for details on how to set up a forum.  2.  In the RSS section, specify these two settings  see Figure 12-20 :    RSS Feed for This Activity: From the drop-down list, select Posts   if you want the feed to send any news post to subscribers. Select  Discussion if you want the fee to send new discussions to subscrib- ers. Leaving the default None disables the RSS.    Number of RSS Recent Articles: From the drop-down list, select the  number you would like. Five is a good, manageable choice. Moodle  is quite generous, enabling you to set up to 50 newsfeeds. This  would be an extraordinary number to allow and would quickly use  up your allocated space if the topic could generate this much info.  Your system administrator may have tweaked this option so that  you only have choices up to 5.   Chapter 12: Using Databases to Share Resources and Adding the Latest News via RSS  301  Figure 12-20:  The Forums  set-up page  showing  RSS options.    Figure 12-21:  A forum  discussion  with RSS  enabled.                3.  Click the Save and Return to Course button.    Moodle returns to your course front page.  Click the new or updated forum, and Moodle takes you to it. Notice the  RSS icon shown in Figure 12-21. Whenever you see this icon, a newsfeed is  enabled for the activity.    You can add RSS to your glossary, wiki, and database by using a similar pro- cedure as described in the Forum section. You don’t have to enable filters in  these modules as you have to in the Forum module. When RSS in enabled in  your course, it’s available to use in the modules.  RSS icon   302 Part III: Adding Activities to Your Moodle Course    Part IV Moodle   Management   In this part . . .  This part empowers you to manage your content. In   Chapter 13, I show you how to optimize your files for   smooth running, how to back up your data, and how to  replicate your course with a quick shortcut so that you  don’t have to start from scratch. It’s a techy chapter, and  you can skip it if you aren’t responsible for administering  the Moodle site. Chapter 14 guides you in the collection of  user reports to keep on top of your learners and demon- strate impressive statistics in your annual report.   Chapter 13  Administering Moodle Courses  In This Chapter ▶ Administering a Moodle site ▶ Setting up courses ▶ Setting up different types of user accounts ▶ Changing the look and feel of the Moodle site and individual courses ▶ Adding permissions to user accounts ▶ Using Moodle module filters and security  Your Moodle installation comes complete with default settings that   enable you to get your courses up and running without too many   system tweaks. You have many options for customizations, performance,  and enabling or restricting various module filters. Many of the administra- tive options are located and accessible by Teacher roles from the course  Administration block, as discussed elsewhere in the book. I also make fre- quent references throughout the book to administrative permissions and the  Site Administration block located on the site front page.  In this chapter, I introduce most of the administrative functions that enable  Moodle to run smoothly. I also explain, in more detail, several functions that  you need to understand. Moodle has too many settings for me to cover all of  them in this chapter, and most often, many settings are taken care of by the  system administrator or by IT support staff members who are given the task  of looking after Moodle. It may be that you end up wearing multiple hats: site  administrator, course creator, and teacher. If this is the case, you need to pay  special attention to this chapter. If you have IT support in your organization,  it’s useful for you to know what is in here so that if your system administrator  is new to Moodle, you can inform him that there are ways you can get what  you need with few tweaks. Believe it or not, often IT staff are given the job to  support new software without any prior experience — that’s why they require  mass quantities of caffeinated beverages and walk around blurry eyed.  The structure of this chapter follows the categories listed in the Moodle Site  Administration block, shown in Figure 13-1. This structure is also followed  by the help files at Moodle.org. Each item in the Site Administration block is  a link that takes you to the particular section or displays more subsections.    306 Part IV: Moodle Management   Note: You need to have an administrator user account or administrative priv- ileges in order to be able to view the Site Administration block.  Site Administration block  Figure 13-1:  The Site  Admini- stration  block.         This chapter touches only the surface of information for the IT administrator,  so if you need additional information on a particular setting, click the Moodle  Docs for This Page link located at the bottom of the page. This link takes you  to the Moodle documents written and updated by Moodle.org developers.  Notifications  The Notifications page has useful details, including the version of Moodle  you’re using, which you may need if you want to report a bug to Moodle.org   http:  tracker.moodle.org . This page may also include a warning  that your site may not be secured if the cron  the time-based job scheduler  that runs predefined tasks  has not been run. Most often, you don’t need to  worry about this, because the cron is run automatically.  This page also displays a Moodle Registration button with a statement above  the button, Please register your site to remove this button.  You or your system administrator would have registered with Moodle.org  when you first downloaded Moodle; however, it’s a good practice to update     Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  307  your registration  I update quarterly  to help Moodle.org keep accurate  Moodle global statistics, which you can visit at http:  moodle.org stats.   By the way, keeping on top of registering the site doesn’t remove the button.   Users  User, in Moodle, is an account that has a particular role, and each role  has a permission status assigned to it. The main default user roles are  Administrator, Teacher, Student, Non-Editing Teacher, and Guest. User man- agement is the most time-consuming administrative job because unlike the  other utilities, registering and maintaining users, roles, and permission for  courses is an ongoing process throughout the lifecycle of courses. Moodle  has a number of tools that can make the process easier, depending on how  you and or your organization decide to register students. There are three  main sections in the Site Administration block under the Users category:  Authentication, Accounts, and Permissions.  Authentication  Authentication is all about creating accounts for learners and anyone else  who needs access to courses, enabling learners and others to log in to  Moodle courses. Creating student accounts is covered in Chapter 4, where  I suggest that the most efficient way for new learners to acquire a Moodle  course account is through self registration. Self registration may not always  be possible, for any number of reasons, such as the way an organization is  structured and the server architecture; however, Moodle provides you with  alternative authentication  the Moodle word for creating accounts  methods.  From the Site Administration block, click Users to open three subfolders,  each of which is a link. Click the Authentication folder to view the following  authentication options:  ✓ Manage Authentication: This page, shown in Figure 13-2, enables you to   choose the authentication method  plugin  for your organization. Click  the closed-eye icon in the Enabled column and then click the Settings  button located to the right of the plugin. You can select more than one  plugin. I recommend you order them using the up and down arrows,  placing the plugin that will handle most registrations at the top.  In Moodle 2.0 onwards, the Authentication link has been dropped, and  you access this page by clicking Access Administration, then Plugins,  and then Authentication.  You can take a few more actions in the Common Settings section of the  page  see Figure 13-3 :            308 Part IV: Moodle Management   Figure 13-2:  The Manage  Authen- tication  page for  plugins.    Figure 13-3:  The  Common  Settings  section  showing  registration  plugins.                  Self Registration: If you include e-mail–based self-registration, select  Email-Based Self-Registration from the Self Registration drop-down list.    Guest Access: If you need to set up guest access, select To Show   from the Guest Login Button drop-down list. Moodle places a guest  login button on the login page. Note, by default, this setting is     Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  309  set to Show the guest login button. It may have been disabled by  someone with admin privileges, in which case you would have to  select the Show option from the drop-down list.   This page offers a number of other options, and I recommend you  leave the default settings unless configuration is necessary to meet the  requirements of the department’s system architecture.  When you’re finished making changes, click the Save Changes button. ✓ Email-Based Self-Registration: These permission settings enable learn-  ers to create their own accounts using their e-mail to register. There are  a number of options your learners are required to input and select in  order to complete the registration process, otherwise the registration  will fail. Chapter 4 shows the New Account page that learners need to  complete and submit. Required fields are highlighted by the asterisk  * .  Self registration is covered in more detail in Chapter 4.  After learners complete the self-registration process, they receive a con- firmation and a default welcome message. Learners’ profiles are created  with the information they were required to provide. They can, at any  time, update their profiles, change their passwords, upload their pic- tures and add to their profiles when they have access to the course.  I recommend that you open self registration for a limited time only and  then disable it. Disabling it prevents spammers from accessing forum  posts, blog entries, and so on. Another way to minimize site spam is to  limit self registration to specific e-mail domains, which can be set from  the Manage Authentication page.  Refer to the preceding bullet.   ✓ Enable reCAPTCHA element: This is a setting you want to enable   because it’s a small program that tests whether a user trying to register  is really human. Because bots still can’t read distorted text like humans,  they can’t access a site that’s protected by CAPTCHA, so the CAPTCHA  successfully prevents programs from entering and generating spam.  ✓ Manual Accounts: The system administrator needs to create all the user   accounts manually. Locking the default removes the ability for self registra- tion. See the following section for more information on manual accounts.     Accounts  The Accounts settings are related to all the individual user accounts in the  Moodle site. The Accounts folder has a number of subcategories, each a link  with various options:  ✓ Browse List of Users: This page lists all users and provides links to   their profiles.  If you have a large number of courses, you may want to filter this list by  course, dates first or last accessed, and so on. To do so, click the Show                           310 Part IV: Moodle Management   Advanced button to see a list of fields to select from, as shown in  Figure 13-4, which shows the Hide Advanced button because Show  Advanced has been clicked. This page also enables you to add a new  user by clicking the Add User button at the bottom of the page, which  takes you to a registration page that’s identical to the self-registration  page discussed in Chapter 4.  ✓ Bulk User Actions: This link takes you to a page where you can perform   a variety of actions for registered users, such as adding or sending a  message, deleting users, or forcing a password change, as shown in the  drop-down list in Figure 13-5.  ✓ Add a New User: This page enables you to set up a new user account.   You need to complete a number of required fields in order for Moodle to  set up the account.  Users can update this page from their profiles, so keep the info to the  minimum required. If a student forgets her password, you can reset it  from this link by clicking the Update Profile button at the bottom of  this page.  You can set up a test account and use a secondary or spare e-mail  address for it.  ✓ Upload Users: If you need to register a large number of learners at once,   this page  shown in Figure 13-6  enables you to do just that using a  simple CSV file.  Click the Moodle Docs for This Page link at the bottom of the page for  more information about bulk registration.  Before you set about this task, I advise that you check out the other  authentication options, as this task can be time consuming. For example,  letting users self register or connect to your organization’s external  database will be much easier than registering each user individually.  For alternative ways to manage authentication, see http:   docs.moodle.org en Manage_authentication.  ✓ Upload User Pictures: Enables you to upload pictures and assign them   by name or user ID.  ✓ User Profile Fields: You can alter and create new user profile categories   and fields. You can set up any type of field, such as a menu of choices,  text area, or check box.                                 Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  311  Figure 13-4:  The Browse  List of  Users page  with Show  Advanced  settings  enabled.    Figure 13-5:  The Bulk  User Action  page.           312 Part IV: Moodle Management   Figure 13-6:  Uploading  a CSV file  page.                   Permissions  I touch on roles and permissions in several chapters, including a more detailed  explanation in Chapter 4. New roles and permissions utilities equip you with a  variety of options to manage how different user accounts  Student, Teacher,  Guest, and so on  interact with Moodle activities, resources, and other user  accounts. For example, a teacher can give a student permissions to help with  approving what’s added to wiki pages and with monitoring forums. However,  before a teacher can do this, you need to enable certain permissions. You need to  understand three utilities: Define Roles, Assign System Roles, and User Policies.  Define Roles The Define Roles page has three tabs:   ✓ The Manage Roles tab is the first page you see.  See Figure 13-7.  All   roles currently assigned to the Moodle site are displayed with editing  capabilities in the far right column. You can move the roles up and down  and rename them or enable particular capabilities. If you want to change  many of the permissions and capabilities, it’s easier to create a new role.  The Add a New Role button under the defined roles takes you to a page  enabling you to do just that. Adding a New Role is discussed in more  detail in Chapter 4.  ✓ The Allow Role Assignments tab  shown in Figure 13-8  enables you to   assign roles  permissions assigned to the role  from user accounts hold- ing the role in the left side to the roles in the columns. Just select the  check boxes and then click the Save Changes button.  ✓ The Allow Role Overrides tab enables you to choose which role s  you   can override by each of the roles in the left column.  This page is similar  to the Allow Role Assignments tab in Figure 13-8.  For example, it may  be important for you to enable teachers to set role overrides so that  students can have specific permission when they use certain activities   such as forums, chat, or wikis .  To enable teachers to set role overrides, you need to first allow the  capability to override roles and then set which role s  teachers  can override.    Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  313  Figure 13-7:  The Roles  editing  page.    Figure 13-8:  The Allow  Role  Assign- ments tab.                          1. Go to the Manage Roles tab.  Refer to Figure 13-8.  2. Click the Teacher role on the left.   Moodle takes you the role’s detail page.  3. Click the Edit button at the top. 4. Scroll down to permissions until you see the capabilities and then   change the capability moodle role:manage  or moodle role: safeoverride in some older versions  and select the Allow option.  5. Click the Save Changes button. 6. Select the tab Allow Role Overrides.   314 Part IV: Moodle Management            7. Select the check box es  in the teacher row for the role s  they   need to be able to override.  It’s useful for teachers to be able to override Non-Editing Teacher,  Student, and Guest roles. You wouldn’t want them to be able to  override the admin.  8. Click the Save Changes button.      The role changes take effect only after the person holding that particular  role logs in again.  Assign System Roles I cover adding students to your course in Chapter 4  that is, assigning the  role of a student . You can do the same for Teacher, Guest, Course Creator,  and any other predefined user account in the course. You can also create a  new role, which is explained in the same chapter.    Any role you assign from the Site Administration block is a global role, mean-  ing the user will have access to every course unless a key is set. Note the  Teacher role does not need a key. For example, if you add a user to a Teacher  role, the user is registered as a teacher in every course instead of just the one  or two courses he’s teaching.  User Policies This page enables you to change various policies for roles and accounts to  help with authentications and registration. If you’re linking to a database to  register in bulk, you need to review these settings.  Courses  Teacher, Course Creator, and Administrator roles are all responsible for adding  courses to a Moodle site. Although teachers are an integral part of the process,  they don’t have permissions on the Teacher role to add courses unless the  administrator changes the capabilities. If you’re an administrator, and depend- ing on the organization and how involved you are with the site, you may want  to give the Teacher role the capability to add courses to save you time.  You can find a number of links within the Courses folder: Add Edit Courses,  Enrollments, Course Default Settings, Course Request, and Backups.  Add Edit Courses  It’s good practice to define a number of categories before you start adding  courses. Moodle provides you with one category, Miscellaneous. You can     Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  315  name your categories anything you want, though it makes sense to follow  either departmental listings or a logical and descriptive format that instruc- tors and students will be able to easily understand.  To add a category, follow these steps:  1.  Click Courses in the Site Administration block and then click   Add Edit Courses.   You see the Course Categories page, shown in Figure 13-9.  2.  Click the Add New Category button.    The Add New Category page appears, as shown in Figure 13-10.                   Figure 13-9:  The Course  Categories  page.    Figure 13-10:  The Add  New  Category  settings  page.     316 Part IV: Moodle Management   3.  In the Category Name text box, give the category a name and, if   useful, add a short description in the Description box.  4.  Save the category by clicking the Create Category button.    Moodle takes you to a page where you can add courses, as shown in  Figure 13-11.                               Figure 13-11:  The Add  Edit Courses  page.    Figure 13-12:  The  Add Edit  Courses and  Categories  page.    5.  If you want to add a new course, click the Add a New Course button   and then fill in the information about the course.  6.  When you finish, click the Save Changes button, and Moodle takes   you to Assigning Roles in Your Course page.  7.  Add a Teacher role and then click the Click Here to Enter Your   Course button.  8.  Return to the Add Edit Courses page by clicking the link in the Site   Administration block.   This page provides you with a number of options to edit and move the  categories around.  See Figure 13-12.     Selecting one of the categories in the Course Categories drop-down list brings  you to a list of courses  see Figure 13-12 , and you have the same editing capa- bilities as with the categories, including a drop-down list to move the courses     Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  317  to a different category, Add a New Course button, and Re-Sort Courses by  Name button. You can hide the course and category by clicking the eye icon.    You can edit the default Miscellaneous category — just select the editing tools  and rename it to meet your requirements. Click the Edit This Category button  to make changes.  Enrollments  Authenticating and enrolling users are discussed in the Users category in  this block, explained earlier in this chapter. In this section, Moodle gives you  options to set up course enrollment.  Exploring the Enrollment plugins The default setting enables users to self enroll by selecting a course name  and then selecting Yes when the question “You are about to enroll your- self as a member of this course. Are you sure you want to do this?” If you  don’t want self enrollment or you want to set up a payment method, Moodle  enables you to set up other methods to manage enrollment by using plugins.  Figure 13-13 shows the Enrollments page with the following plugins:  Figure 13-13:  The  Enrollments  page.             ✓ Authorize.net Payment Gateway ✓ External Database   318 Part IV: Moodle Management   ✓ Flat File ✓ IMS Enterprise File  from 1.6 onwards  ✓ Internal enrollment  default method  ✓ LDAP ✓ Moodle Networking ✓ PayPal                                            The Moodle documentation  you can find a Moodle Docs for This Page link  at the bottom of the Moodle page, as shown in Figure 13-13  explains each of  these methods in detail. When you know the type of enrollment method you  want to use, your next step is quite simple — all you need to do is select the  check box in the Enable column and then click the Edit link. Remember to  click the Save Changes button.  Setting up automatic payments Moodle provides you with two different plugins to set up automatic payment  methods for your learners: Authorize.net Payment Gateway and PayPal.  Here’s how to set up those modules:  ✓ Authorize.net Payment Gateway module: This module enables you to   set up a payment method by third-party merchants. You may have to  pay a fee for the service, which you can add to the cost of the course.  There are many different merchant options, including the usual, major  credit-card merchants.  1. In the Site Administration block, click Enrollments. 2. On the enrollments page  refer to Figure 13-13 , select the check   box for Authorize.net Payment Gateway.  3. Click Edit in the Settings column.   Moodle takes you to the plugin page shown in Figure 13-14.  4. Follow the instructions, and if you need more information, Click   the Moodle Docs for This Page link.  5. Click the Save changes button when you’re finished.       For security reasons, you need to turn on security filters. These can be  found in this Site Administration block: Click Security and then click  HTTP. Select the first check box next to HTTPS.  ✓ PayPal: This module enables you to set up a payment method through   PayPal  www.paypal.com . You need to set up a PayPal account before  you enable Moodle to take payments. PayPal provides you with links  and icons that you can add to your Moodle page.  To enable PayPal plugins, follow the procedure in the preceding bullet,  but instead of selecting Authorizing.net, select the PayPal check box     Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  319  from the Enable column, and then click the Edit link. This action takes  you to the PayPal plugin module, where you select options for the  course.  See Figure 13-15.  Make sure you click the Save Changes button.  Figure 13-14:  Setting  up an  Authorizing. net pay  gateway.    Figure 13-15:  The PayPal  settings  page.          Course Default Settings  The default course settings determine how the course appears to all learners  or any other user. The basic settings define the course front page that teach- ers access to start developing their courses. Teacher roles have a number of  options to make minor changes to the course front page, which is discussed  in Chapter 3; however, you can make changes here to give the teachers and  course creator other layout options.   320 Part IV: Moodle Management   Course Request  In case you want any user account to be able to request new courses, Moodle  enables you to set up the functionality. Just follow these steps:  1.  Click the Course Request link.    Moodle opens a Course Request page, as shown in Figure 13-16.  Figure 13-16:  The Course  Request set- tings page.                           2.  Select the Enable Course Requests check box. 3.  From the Default Category for Course Requests drop-down list, select   the category.  4.  From the Course Request Notification drop-down list, select who   should be notified.   Note that only accounts with permission to register courses will be listed.  5.  Click the Save Changes button.    Moodle places a button for all users on the All Courses page. You can  see the course requests on the Courses Pending Approval page. You  need to check this page regularly.  Backups  The Backup page is the same as the backup from the course Administration  block, which I cover in Chapter 14. Please refer to that chapter for a detailed     Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  321  explanation. It is covered in the course sections because teachers are able to  back up without having administrative privileges.  There’s one difference in the Backup on the Site Administration block: You  can set automatically scheduled backups for all courses.  Grades        The Grades and Gradebook modules have been revised in Moodle versions  1.9+ and include a number of vital differences. The changes are good and  make it easier for you and your students. Note: If you’re using an older ver- sion, you should either update or go to http:  docs.moodle.org and find  documentation for your version.  The Moodle Grades module is made up of two parts:  ✓ Grades: The scores you or Moodle assigns for work in the Moodle course. ✓ Gradebook: A repository for all grades for every learner in your course.   The Gradebook module is a tool for you to use with your course and  every student, and it’s available for all learners so they can see their  own grades and course averages  if you enable that functionality . The  links in the Grades section of the Site Administration block enable you  to make changes to the default settings.  From the Grades section, you can access the links described in the  following sections.  General Settings  General grade settings enable you to change the defaults and create a set of  defaults for your site courses. You can enable or disable the graded roles,  outcomes, scales in aggregated grades, publishing grades, or a number of dif- ferent grades features. There are too many to list here and explain each. The  Moodle Grade Settings page, shown in Figure 13-17, provides a brief explana- tion for each setting. If you need more help, click the Moodle Docs for This  Page at the bottom of the page to find a more detailed explanation.   322 Part IV: Moodle Management   Figure 13-17:  The General  Settings  page for  grades.             Grade Category Settings  The category settings allows you to choose which options teachers can view  and use when adding or editing a grade category in their course grade books.  This also sets the default values. Note that making any changes affects all  courses on the site.  You can find two important check boxes next to most features on this  settings page:  ✓ Force: Selecting this check box removes options the teacher can view.  For  instance, the teacher can see “mean of all grades” only as an aggregation.   ✓ Advanced: Selecting this check box hides the specific feature until the  teacher clicks the Show Advanced button. Teachers quickly familiarize  themselves with the Hide and Show buttons. This functionality reduces  the initial menu choices for teachers but provides them a button to see  the choices if they want.  Grade Item Settings  The Grade Item Settings page provides you with options to edit settings for all  grade books used by teachers. Modifying the default settings changes what  items are displayed for each grade. Turning the setting on or off would require  teachers to input data. See the Grade Item Settings page for an explanation of  each option available. Under each option, Moodle briefly explains each function.    Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  323  I discuss scales at great length in Chapter 7. On the Scales setting page, you  can see all the scales that have been added, and you can change the site-wide  scale that came with the Moodle setup files as a default. Moodle’s default  scale uses categories that include Separate and Connected ways of knowing,  also discussed in Chapter 7. Here you have the option of renaming it, altering  it, or deleting it altogether. You can also set up a whole new site-wide scale  that the teachers have an option to use with their courses.  Scales  Letters  The Grade Letters page is important because it lists all the letter grades. You  have the option of making changes to the default settings. For example, you  can change the letter grade boundary for A. Current default setting lists the  grade A as 93% and above, with A– given the boundary 93–90%.  Report Settings  The grade book report settings determine the appearance of grade book  reports in all courses on the site. The site administrator can find the default  and enabled disabled settings in the administration area.  ✓ Grader Report: Settings enable you to decide how the grades will be   presented. The default settings are a good start if you’re unsure.  ✓ Overview Report: Just one option for you to decide whether you want   the report to display the position of the user in relation to the rest of the  learners in the class, for each graded item.  ✓ User Report: This setting enables you to set what the learners see in   their grade books. The teacher can override any setting in the User  Report in the course setting section located in the Administration block  on the course front page.  Moodle has two separate Moodle pages for location: Location Settings and  Update location time zone.  Location Settings  You have three options to make changes on the Location Settings page:           Location   324 Part IV: Moodle Management            ✓ Default Time Zone: The first drop-down list is for the default time zone.   It’s set for where the server is located. You can change this.  ✓ Force Default Time Zone: You can enable users to choose the time zone   or force one for everyone.  ✓ Default Country: The default allows users to choose their country. If you  choose the country, it will become the default for all new user accounts,  site-wide. I recommend letting users choose.  The remainder of this page is related to IP settings and IP address lookup and  includes a short explanation for each choice.  Update Time Zones  The Update Time Zones page enables anyone with administrative privileges  to update their local database with information about world time zones. This  option is useful because you may need to make changes to accommodate  Daylight Saving Time.  Language  Moodle is available in 82 languages and widely used around the world. You  can give users a choice of language, or you can force a language for a course.  The Language category offers three different settings.  Language Settings  The Language Settings page gives you a number of options, such as setting  the default language, enabling users to set a language for their browser, dis- play menu for language options, and so on. Each selection is explained on  the Moodle editing page specific to the particular selection, with a link at the  bottom of the page to Moodle docs for more detailed explanation.  Language Editing  The Language Editing page provides you with a tool to change any word or  phrase used on the site. You may, for instance, want to change the word  Assignments to Offline Activities. The Language Editing link takes you to a new  Moodle page with three links under the main tab, as shown in Figure 13-18:    Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  325  ✓ Check for Untranslated Words or Phrases ✓ Edit Words or Phrases ✓ Edit Help Documents   Each link takes you to an editing page with a number of options for changing  the default settings.  Language Packs  Moodle has more than 75 languages that you can install on your Moodle site.  To add a language pack, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Language Packs link  under Language  in the Site   Administration block.   Moodle takes you to the selection page, shown in Figure 13-19.  2.  Select the languages you need from the Available Language Packs list  on the right and then click the Install Selected Language Pack button  to move them to the left column.                         Figure 13-18:  The  Language  Editing  page.    Figure 13-19:  The  Language  Packs page.     326 Part IV: Moodle Management   Modules  The Modules link enables you to manage activities, blocks, and filters. In pro- gramming terms, modules are separate objects. In Moodle, modules are small  separate activities that you and your learners can interact with. They are sep- arate, in terms that they can be saved, updated, and reused. You can import  other modules and plugins from Moodle.org. If you’re an IT administrator, I  encourage you to visit and explore what’s available. For example, Moodle.org  has a lot of cool themes you can download as separate plugins.    Moodle.org plugins are safe to use. Be very careful when adding third-party  modules or plugins because they may cause difficulties if not installed prop- erly. Check the Moodle.org forums and ask about a third-party module or  plugin that you’d like to try. When you post within 24 hours, you’ll get replies  from developers and or users who may have some experience with the  particular plugin.  Activities  When you click the Activities link in the Site Administration block under  Modules, and then Manage Activities, Moodle takes you to the page shown  in Figure 13-20. This page lists the various activity modules in table format.  Here’s the lowdown on the individual columns in this table:  Figure 13-20:  The Manage  Activities  page.          ✓ Activities: Lists how many activities are currently on your Moodle site.  If you click the number next to the activity, the courses that include the  module are displayed.    Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  327                          ✓ Version: Shows which version of the module you’re running. This option   is useful if you want to report bugs.  ✓ Hide Show: You can click the eye icon to close it so that the module   is not enabled. Remember that in doing this, all courses on the site  are unable to use the module. By default, some modules are hidden.  Opening Hot Potatoes Quiz is useful because it allows teachers to  import question. Some of the other modules are hidden because  Moodle no longer supports them, although they’re still available to  use. For example, Journal is hidden because it’s very similar to Blogs. ✓ Delete: You can delete any module other than the forum. You have no   reason to delete any modules unless a specific upgrade requires you  to do so. If you need to delete a module, you also have to delete the  module folder called moodle mod located in the system settings.  You have to delete this from the server.  ✓ Settings: The Settings link takes you to individual activity settings that   you may need to set up. The following list gives a quick rundown on the  more useful and important settings. You can also access the settings  from the individual module in this block under the Modules link.    Assignment Forum: You can set the maximum file upload. This fea-  ture is useful to keep the database from getting clogged up. This set- ting is also available in other modules, though the Teacher role can  adjust upload sizes for individual courses. It may not be necessary  to restrict the maximum file upload site-wide. For example, if you  restrict the Database module and a course needs to use this module  to create a database of pictures, the course would be restricted.   Chat: If courses use the Chat module frequently, encourage the   teacher to clear chat data. This setting enables you to use a server  daemon  a program that runs in the background and handles ser- vice requests  to reduce the load.    Database, Forum and Glossary, and RSS: If your teachers need to   use RSS, enable the filter in each individual activity.    Resource: These settings enable you to allow teachers to create links  to files on your organization’s local fileserver or devices such as CD  drives, network drives, and external devices, such as USB sticks.       Quiz: Please be very careful making any changes to this setting —  it affects every quiz in every course on the site. These options can  be set for individual quizzes in each course.  Blocks  The Blocks section gives you editing tools to make changes or enable filters for  all blocks in the site. Clicking the first subsection, the Manage Blocks link, takes  you to a page similar to the Activities page  described in the preceding section .   328 Part IV: Moodle Management   Here are a few of the columns you may want to use on the Blocks page:  ✓ Hide Show: Using the Hide Show column, you can hide any block so it  does not appear in any course’s Add a Block drop-down list and cannot  be used in any course. This option is useful to save space if certain  blocks won’t be used.  For example, the Global Search block is rarely  used at course level.  In the Instances column, you can view instances  of blocks occurring in the courses.  ✓ Multiple: This column enables you to restrict multiple uses of the block  in a course. Not all blocks have the capability. The HTML block is such  an example. Unless you have a server space issue, you have no reason  to restrict this option for all courses on the site.  ✓ Settings: Some blocks have extra settings, which you can access by   clicking the Settings link.  One block that you may want to configure on the Blocks page is the RSS  Feed block.  You can get to this page by clicking the Manage Blocks link.   Newsfeeds are very useful for teachers, and unless you enable it in this  module, you will be inundated with requests. To enable RSS, follow the steps:  1.  On the Blocks page, click the Settings link next to RSS.    You can also get there directly from the links in the Site Administration  block: Just click Modules and then Blocks.    The Remote RSS Feeds page appears, as shown in Figure 13-21.                              Figure 13-21:  The Remote  RSS Feeds  settings  page.    2.  Fill in the following fields:    Entries per Feed: This is the number of news items to show for   each newsfeed.    Timeout: Select a timeout period in minutes. Below the option   is an description of what a timeout is.    Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  329          Submitters: Select who can set up RSS. Notice I highlighted   Administrators and Teachers. You don’t want to give everyone  the capability to add RSS, even though students may have editing  capabilities for glossaries and wikis. Instructors need to monitor  what newsfeeds arrive in the course.  3.  When you’re finished, click the Save Changes button.  Sticky blocks seem to pop up in various places and can add confusion, so  here’s a little detail on the subject: A sticky block is a block you can set up on  the whole Moodle site, and it forces the block to appear in every course and  or users’ front page. For example, the Participants and Administration blocks  are sticky blocks because they appear on every course front page.  Filters  Filters enable you to set up automatic-change text on the front page into dif- ferent forms, such as hyperlinks. For example, titles of resources can auto- matically become hyperlinks that take you to the relevant resource. There  are many options and extensions, and you can download special filters from  the Moodle.org site’s Modules and Plugin database.  You can enable a number of filters for the site. These filters are all listed on the  Manage Filters page, shown in Figure 13-22. They’re all important for the com- plete functioning of the activities. Pay particular attention to the following filters:  Figure 13-22:  The Manage  Filters  settings  page.        330 Part IV: Moodle Management                     Security  ✓ Multimedia: Click the Settings link to see a list of many different filters.  All are selected, by default, except the last one in the list, which is the  YouTube filter. If your instructors want to be able to embed YouTube in  Web pages or link to YouTube, you need to enable this filter. Make sure  you click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.  ✓ Algebra Notation and TeX Notation: These filters both need to be   enabled in order for code to be converted to GIF images. TeX Notation  enables you to display math notations correctly. You can find many  plugins to enable easy use of mathematical functions and notations for  more advanced math and engineering courses. Click the Moodle Docs  For This Page link at the bottom of the page, which includes a link for  Algebra settings listing resources for additional mathematics filters. The  companion Web site, www.dummies.com go moodlefd, also has a link  to resources for plugins for mathematic notations.    The Multimedia and TeX Notation filters both have separate links on the   Filters submenu. Clicking these links also takes you to the settings pages for  these filters.  Moodle developers take security very seriously. Moodle is widely used at uni- versities, so you can be reassured that security is in place to protect courses,  user accounts, and data, Like with all software, hackers get in, and develop- ers set up patches. As you know, there’s no such thing as complete security.    Moodle.org provides a list of basic recommendations to keep your site as   secure as possible. The following list summarizes the recommendations:  ✓ Carry out regular Moodle updates ✓ Make sure you disable Register ✓ Use strong passwords for admin and teachers  ✓ Trust the users who get Teacher role privileges  You can find more information at http:  docs.moodle.org en Security.  Check out the following sections to discover more about the settings that  help you manage security and enable users to link to resources.  Site Policies  Site policies settings determine what users can access and see as well as  who can enter your site. Click the Site Policies link to go over the default     Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  331  settings  which provide the required security , though you may want to  enable others. Each setting has check box and a short description.  You can trust the defaults, which I highly recommend, and go through the  page to see all the available settings when you’re comfortable with Moodle.  HTTP Security  The HTTP Security page allows you to choose a number of security options,  such as using HTTPS to encrypt user login details, enabling cookies, and  using the required Flash version that is known not to pose a security risk  as some versions have known security risks. I recommend using the default  settings unless you have HTTPS on your server. For example, if you enable  HTTPS for logins in Moodle and you don’t have HTTPS set up on your server,  you will lock yourself out of your site.  Module Security  Use the settings on the Module Security page, shown in Figure 13-23, to disable  any activity for all user accounts other than the administrative account. For  example, you can disable the Chat activity across the whole site or for specific  courses. Notice each option is explained, and if you don’t understand the impli- cations, don’t change the default settings until you investigate them thoroughly.  Figure 13-23:  The Module  Security  settings  page.        332 Part IV: Moodle Management   Notifications  Appearance  You can set up Moodle to inform you if someone is trying to steal student or  teacher logins. If you enable the Display Login Failures option, a link is added  to the site front page after you log in, informing you of the number of failed  logins. Click the link to access the login error page.  If you worry about logins failing, you can set up e-mail notification to inform  you about failed attempts.  Anti-Virus  Moodle includes an antivirus feature you can enable. It’s an open-source  virus scanner called ClamAV, and you need to install it on your server first  in order to enable the capabilities in this page. See www.clamav.net for  further information. If you have antivirus running on your server, you don’t  need to worry about it and can leave the default settings.  Moodle has a number of editable features that enable you and your users to  change the look and feel of the course front page. There are also options for  some of the blocks, calendar, and HTML editor. I explain each main function- ality briefly. You can use customized modules to spice up your course front  page — if you need to change the appearance and customize the look and  feel of your site and or courses, you can find plugins and information within  the International Moodle support group. Read on; you’ll enjoy these sections.  Themes  Themes are a popular topic in Moodle. You, as an administrator, can choose  a theme for the site, which will be carried through all the site’s courses.  Setting a Moodle theme is similar to setting up your desktop on your com- puter; you can choose background colors, fonts, sizes, and so on. You can  also set permissions to enable teachers  and students if the students have  the capability  to choose their own theme for their course. Changing the  theme does not affect any functionality within Moodle.  Many companies using Moodle integrate their corporate branding so the site  matches with the corporate identity.  All this is possible from few pages and selections. You have two options:    Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  333        ✓ Theme Settings: This page is a list of options where you decide whether   other users can change themes and choose and hide blocks.  ✓ Theme Selector: Moodle bundles a number of theme templates that you  can choose from. Each theme provides you with a small screen shot and  preview and information links, as well as a Choose button to select a  new theme.  You can download many themes and instructions on how to edit your front  page theme at http:  docs.moodle.org en Themes.  Calendar  The Moodle calendar can display events for the whole site, course, groups,  and individual users. A number of settings and options pertain to the organi- zation of the calendar and capabilities for other roles. Click the Calendar link   under Appearance  in the Site Administration block to make changes to the  default settings.  HTML Editor  I discuss the HTML editor in Chapter 3 in detail. This administration page  enables you to change the look and feel of the editor, and you can add or hide  extra buttons. For instance, you can add a spell checker button, include a math  function button, and hide emoticons. Note that the spell checker plugin takes  up space and may slow down your system. To access the HTML editor page,  click the HTML Editor link under Appearance in the Site Administration block.  This option enables you to remove all HTML tags from all activity and  resource names.  HTML Settings  Moodle Docs  The Moodle Docs for This Page link that appears at the bottom of each Web  page leads administrators and teachers to a fantastic resource: documenta- tion maintained at Moodle.org. The Moodle Docs settings page enables you  to remove this link or have the link open a new pop-up window when clicked.  By default, the link is enabled, and clicking it takes you to the page. You    334 Part IV: Moodle Management   need to use the browser Back button to get back to your Moodle page.  If you prefer a pop-up window, enable the setting.  My Moodle  The My Moodle utility enables a customizable front page displaying a user’s  links to all the site courses and specific activities. For example, if the user  has unopened assignments or unread forum posts, Moodle provides links to  them. You can enable this functionality by selecting the check box next to  Force Users to Use My Moodle. You can also decide how many courses to  display by typing the number in the field. Don’t forget to save your changes.  Course Managers  The Course Managers setting empowers you to decide who is listed in the  course description. By default, the teacher’s name is listed. If there are a  number of Teacher roles, they are all displayed.  AJAX and JavaScript  Moodle provides you with the ability to enable the use of AJAX  advanced  client server interfaces using JavaScript  across the complete Moodle site.  With this setting enabled, users can still make a choice in their profiles;  otherwise, AJAX is disabled for everybody.  Manage Tags  The Manage Tags setting displays all the tags created in the courses and the  user who created them, including how many times they were used. If inap- propriate tags are used, they appear tagged and in red font.  You have an option to add Official tags, which are displayed to every user on the  site. Official tags are useful so that many duplicate tags are not created around  a topic or a theme creating a long list. I discuss tags in detail in Chapter 8.  Front Page  The site front page is similar to the course front page. You can make changes  and edit the site front page by simply clicking the Turn Editing On button  located in the top-right corner.    Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  335  Front Page Settings  Enables you to give the site a name to appear on every page above the navi- gation bar, a short name that appears in the navigation bar, a front page  description that you can use for your general organization introduction  or anything else relevant, and a number of other options. Leave the default  settings if you aren’t sure about the purposes they serve.  Front Page Roles  You can set up front page roles and overrides the exact same way you set up  roles in Chapter 4. If you decide to use a front page forum, you need to assign  a Student role to everyone on the site on the front page in order for them to  receive e-mail copies of the forum.  Front Page Backup and Restore  Moodle enables you to back up the site front page the same way you back up  courses, as discussed in Chapter 14. All the settings follow the same format.  Front Page Questions  The Front Page Questions link leads you to the question pool for all the quiz- zes in the site. You can make any changes to the quiz categories or create  new quizzes. You can limit the questions to be used on the site, course, or  within a quiz.  Site Files  The Site Files link takes you to a list of all the backup files for all courses on the  site. These files are similar to the site files for each course. All actions and but- tons work in the same way discussed in Chapter 3. This storage area can be  accessed by anyone who has access to the URL or can guess the URL. To ensure  security of backup files, they should be stored in the secure backupdata folder.  Server  The Site Administration block includes many settings for adjusting how  Moodle relates to the server and the server settings. Most of the default    336 Part IV: Moodle Management   settings should be left as they were configured by Moodle on installation;  however, you need to be familiar with a couple that involve setting permis- sions for teachers to be able to use certain tools:  ✓ System Paths: Server information. Leave the default settings. ✓ Email: Options to change hosts and usernames, e-mail forwarding, and   so on. Leave the defaults unless you have difficulties with e-mails.  ✓ Session Handling: Server information related to database, timeout on  users logged in to the system, and cookies. Leave the default settings. ✓ RSS: You need to enable the RSS feed by selecting the check box. This   page has only one selection.  ✓ Debugging: If errors occur or users experience problems with any   aspects of Moodle installations, debugging is useful for developers and  anyone helping you. If you post questions to the Moodle help forums,  a developer may ask you to turn debugging on and e-mail the report.  Leave the default settings.  ✓ Statistics: You need statistics enabled if you want graphical representa-  tions of user activities and summaries, as discussed in Chapter 14.  ✓ HTTP: These options are for developers who want to make changes to   frames, slash arguments, and so on. Leave the default settings unless  you know what you’re doing.  ✓ Maintenance Mode: The settings enable you to secure your site while  maintenance is taking place. If registered users attempt to access their  courses, they will receive a message stating that that Moodle mainte- nance is taking place.  ✓ Cleanup: Enables you to tidy up the sites by unsubscribing users from   courses after they’ve completed those courses. You can also delete  unconfirmed users and clean up the log files.  ✓ Environment: This is a system check so you can ensure your server   meets all the requirements to run the Moodle version you plan to down- load and any future Moodle updates.  ✓ PHP Info: Provides info about the version of PHP being used. Leave the   ✓ Performance: Information on memory status, cache, and so on. Leave   default setting.  the default settings.                                      Networking  You can set up networking options to share resources among Moodle sites.  For your server to be able to be networked to other Moodle sites hosted on     Chapter 13: Administering Moodle Courses  337  different servers, you need specific extension. Setup and requirements are  outlined in Moodle docs for the specific setup pages. By default, all network- ing settings and capabilities are disabled.  Reports  Similar to how teachers can get reports and logs of all activity that happens in  their courses, you can view log files and reports of the complete Moodle site  with information related to course s  use, security risks, space, and so on.  ✓ Backups: This page enables you to set up scheduled backups and logs   related to back up.  ✓ Course Overview: To view the course overview information, you need   to enable statistics, as discussed in the earlier section “Server.”  ✓ Logs: Moodle provides you with an option to choose any combination   of course, site, participants, date, activity actions, and so on by using fil- ters as in the course reports. You can choose whether they’re displayed  on the log file page or downloaded in text, ODS, or Excel format.  ✓ Live Logs: Provides a link to a report of live logs for the past hour ✓ Questions: This page reports problems in your question database.   You should see a statement No problems found in your  question database.  ✓ Security Overview: A list of the security status of your Moodle site, with  a list of possible security risks, giving you status report of OK, Warning,  Serious, or Critical. This is good to check once in awhile. Note that if you  enable .swf filters, you will see a Critical message that this poses a  security risk.  ✓ Spam Cleaner: This page will start a program that enables you to search   all user profiles for certain strings and then delete anything that was  created by spammers. You can also search for inappropriate words by  using multiple keywords strings with commas  such as casino, porn . See  the Moodle docs for more information about reducing spam in Moodle.  ✓ Statistics: This page enables you to collect statistics on all activities.  This page is available through a number of different links in the Site  Administration block. The page follows the same format as course statis- tics that you find by going to the course Administration block and click- ing the Reports link.  ✓ Unit Tests: This page enables you to run a test on your Moodle site to   look for possible errors. A report is generated and displayed.                              338 Part IV: Moodle Management  Miscellaneous  Miscellaneous is a catch-all category for extra information a Moodle system  administrator may find interesting.  Experimental  This page lists all options that are experimental and in beta testing. They  aren’t necessarily stable, and they require testing and bug fixing. Leave all  the default settings unless you’re a developer and want to contribute to  developing any of the tools and features listed.  XMLDB  This tool enables developers to edit various Moodle options and tools such  as tables, field, keys, indexes, and so on. Leave the default settings unless  you’re a developer.  Finding Support  I can’t guarantee you won’t have any problems. However, when you do come  across a problem, you may be surprised that often you can solve the problem  by simply doing a little digging for information. The satisfaction is worth the try.  However, you may come across some issues that truly stump you. No need  to ever panic! Moodle support is available for free. Also, because Moodle  is used across the whole world, someone is up 24 7, will read your plea for  help, and help.  Here are all your options to get more support:  ✓ Go to this book’s companion Web site, www.dummies.com go   moodlefd.  ✓ Check out the Moodle documentation that I have made numerous refer-  ences to throughout this book, found at http:  docs.moodle.org. ✓ Head to the Moodle community discussion forums. You can search for  all kinds of answers to every problem imaginable. If you can’t find your  answers, don’t be too shy to ask questions; someone is always ready  to help. That’s the wonderful thing about the Moodle community. With  almost 50 million users worldwide, spanning 210 countries, you never  have to feel alone. http:  moodle.org forums.            Chapter 14  Managing Course Data, Repor ts,   Logs, and Statistics  In This Chapter ▶ Backing up and restoring your data ▶ Cloning your course and reusing it ▶ Keeping track of your learners online ▶ Generating reports ▶ Collecting statistics and displaying them to your bosses  The content that you upload to your course and the activities you and   your learners create and populate with information are the knowledge   data, the value, in your course. The job isn’t done when your term, semester,  or training is completed — managing the knowledge is a key to your contin- ued success as an online instructor. You need to make sure that the infor- mation you upload is kept up-to-date, ensure you optimize your files before  uploading, and clear old material so that you don’t use up your allocated  space too quickly.  When you have an effective and efficient course running smoothly, your  learners love it, and you’re the envy of all your colleagues. Of course you  don’t want to have to re-create a course like that. This chapter shows you  how to duplicate your whole course, rename it, and reuse it.  Because you created and made available a lot of content, you may want to  see whether your learners are accessing it and how long they spend with  various activities. This chapter introduces a number of Moodle tools you  can use to keep track of your learners.   340 Part IV: Moodle Management   Managing Your Course Data  and Staying Up-to-Date  After creating content, uploading it to your course, setting up various activi- ties, and getting your course running successfully, you may feel very pleased  with yourself. Well done. But you have more to do: Now you need to be able  to handle the updates and maintenance of your course. One of the most  important aspects of keeping your learners engaged is keeping your course  current by updating your files, deleting old files, and linking to new sites.    Learners are tech savvy: They can download a document and view the date  when it was last updated. Recently, one of my students told me how grateful  she was that I kept the course fresh and interesting. She told me that one of  her online courses had material dated 2003, broken links to sites that did not  exist, and a recycled syllabus dated 2000. She learned all of this within the  first week of the course, and she withdrew from the course and demanded  her money back. Rightly so!  Moodle has added tools in the course Administration block to help you  manage and keep your files updated. To view the Files tools, go to your  course front page, locate the Administration block  by default, Moodle dis- plays it on the left side, as shown in Figure 14-1 , and click the Files link.  Figure 14-1:  The Admini- stration  block on  the course  front page.       Moodle then takes you to the Files editing page, shown in Figure 14-2. Here  you find a number of tools to help you manage your course. All the files you’ve  uploaded are listed with a check box on the left. At the bottom of the list, you  find the following four buttons, which enable you to work with these files:    Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  341  Figure 14-2:  The Files  editing  page.             ✓ Make a Folder: Click the button to create a folder and place files into the  folder. You can make this folder available to your learners on the course  front page, or you can just use it to organize your files. For a step-by- step explanation on how to create a folder and display it to your  learners, see Chapter 5. The process is quite simple.  ✓ Select All and Deselect All: By clicking one of these two buttons,   Moodle enables you to select all the files or deselect them.   342 Part IV: Moodle Management    You may find these buttons useful if you’re deleting or moving many  files. Even though you may not want to move or delete all the files, by  selecting them all, you can go back and deselect individual files you  don’t want to move or delete and save a little time. When you click  the Delete button and realize that perhaps you didn’t want to delete  certain files, no worries. Moodle has a safety net: Moodle prompts  you to confirm that you want to delete selected files.  ✓ Upload a File: Click this button to upload any selected file from   your computer.  After you’ve selected the check boxes next to the files you want to manage,  select one of these options from the With Chosen Files drop-down list:  ✓ Move to Another Folder: Moving your files to specific folders you   created  such as YouTube tutorials, lecture notes, and so on  takes  just a few steps.  1. From the With Chosen Files drop-down list, select Move to   Another Folder.  2. Select the folder in which you want to place the files.   Moodle lists all the folders above the list of files. Empty folders are  at the very top.  See Figure 14-3.  In Figure 14-3, above the table of  file, notice that Moodle informs you of your actions and instructs  you on what to do next: 2 files selected for moving.  Now go into the destination folder and press  ‘Move files to here’.  3. Click the Move Files to Here button at the bottom of the screen.   Moodle moves your files.  See Figure 14-4.  Notice at the top of the  page, in the navigation bar, the new folder where you’re moving the  files is listed. In this example, it’s Example_For_Dummies_Folder.  Moodle moves the files to the new folder and displays them. Above  the new files, you see a folder with an up arrow, called the Parent  directory. If you select this folder, Moodle returns you to the list of  all folders and files.                              Figure 14-3:  On the  Files page,  Moodle  informs you  that you  selected  two files to  move.      Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  343  Figure 14-4:  Moodle  shows you  files have  been moved  to the  chosen  folder.    Figure 14-5:  Creating a  Zip file.                                  In my example, notice that the name of the folder is connected with  underscores  _ . You don’t need to use underscores when you give names  to files or folders — Moodle adds them automatically when it saves the  folder name. The database doesn’t like names that aren’t connected.  ✓ Delete Completely: Selecting this option from the With Chosen Files   drop-down list deletes the selected files and folders from your Moodle  course and site. Moodle prompts you to make sure you want to delete  the selected files.  ✓ Create ZIP Archive: A Zip file  an archive  consists of a folder that holds   any number of files you select, and the Zip utility compresses them in size  and creates a Zip file. This utility is very useful for storing files in archives  or storing larger files such as audio, images, and video. By using Zip files,  you can easily upload or download the files. You can make Zip files avail- able to your learners; however, they need a Zip utility in order to unzip  the folders. Most operating systems have a built-in Zip utility, such as  WinZip in Windows and MacZip or StuffIt Expander for Macintosh.  To zip a folder of files, follow these steps:  1. From the With Chosen Files drop-down list, select Create Zip Archive.    Moodle takes you to a new page where you see the files you  selected. In the example, I chose a folder with two files, as shown  in Figure 14-5. Moodle tells you that you’re about to create a Zip  file containing the listed files.  2. In the field below Moodle’s statement What do you want to   call the zip file?, give your Zip folder a name.  The default name is new.zip.   344 Part IV: Moodle Management                 3. Click the Create Zip Archive button.   Moodle returns you to the list of files. You see the Zip folder listed  alphabetically in your list of files. Notice three additional links on  the right side of the list:   Unzip: This link unzips your archived files and adds them to the  files area where the Zip file is stored.  Lists: If you click this link, Moodle displays all the files that are  stored in the archive. Note that you can’t view the files by click  this link. It’s there to refresh your memory. Moodle understands  that no matter how intuitive and logical your naming structure  becomes, you may forget at some point.  Restore: This link is related to the backup tools. After you’ve  backed up your course or specific data within the course and  uploaded it to your new course, you use this link to restore the  files and content. I cover restoring content in the “Backing Up  Your Course and Data” section, later in this chapter.  Organizing Your Data  Creating folders, storing your files in folders, and creating Zip archives of  your data are all aspects of organizing your allocated space for your course.  Organizing files in folders on your course front page also helps students navi- gate to and access the content they need. They will be grateful for a clean,  clear front page that doesn’t contain a long list of resources.  The other important aspect of organizing data is understanding file sizes,  how you can optimize your data to keep file sizes smaller, and which file  formats are most compatible with Moodle and browsing software. I touch on  optimizing file sizes in Chapter 5. Table 14-1 is a brief guide that can help you  decide which formats to use to save your data so that it can be viewed by  most learners. You most likely are familiar with these formats and have used  them at some point.    Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  345  Table 14-1  File Type  Mainly  Text  Based   Recommended  PDF  File Formats Identification and Recommendations Formats Supported  by Moodle RTF, Word, PDF,  HTML, PowerPoint   PPT . All widely  used for text,  though images  can be embed- ded within the text  document.   Software Required to  View Learners need a  PDF reader or PDF  Publisher, both of  which are free. If docs  are saved as RTF,  Open Office word- processing software  can read them  www. openoffice.org . To view the other  formats, learners’  computers need  compatible viewers.  JPG, GIF  Pictures  Images  Video   JPEG, GIF, and PNG.  The best formats  for browser based  applications are  JPEG and GIF. You  don’t need to buy  graphic software;  you can use Paint,  which comes free  with Windows, or  Paintbrush for Mac.  FVL, SWF, MOV,  WMV, MPG, AVI,  FLV, RAM, RPM,  RM, YouTube.  Audio  MP3, AAC, WMA,  RA, MP4.  YouTube,  SWF, FLV  MP3  These formats are all  supported by Moodle  plugins but they need  to be enabled.  See  Chapter 6.  Some of  the formats do not  work well with certain  browsers. They are playable on  most computers and  any Internet-connected  devices your learners  will use. Filters need  to be enabled.  See  Chapter 6.    346 Part IV: Moodle Management   Backing Up Your Course and Data  As you know, backing up your work is important. I believe everyone at some  point learned a hard lesson by losing work in some way related to crashes,  whether the loss was due to hard drive failure, a virus, sun spots exploding,  or satellites falling out of the sky. It’s always possible that some problems may  occur with the database on the Moodle server. Although Moodle has auto- mated course backups for the whole site your system administrator manages   see Chapter 13 , you still want to make sure your work is in safe keeping.  Backing up is the first part of copying and cloning process so you can reuse  the course. Get the highlighter out!  To back up your course so you can avoid forget-and-regret scenarios, follow  these steps:        1.  In the Administration block on your course front page, click the   Backup link.   Moodle takes you to the Course Backup page with the course name  and number listed, as shown in Figure 14-6.  Figure 14-6:  The Course  Backup  page.         Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  347  2.  If you don’t want to back up everything, deselect options as desired.   By default, Moodle has everything selected. Backing up everything is rec- ommended for a complete course backup that includes all learners’ data.   Notice the left column has Include All None links, and under those links  all your activities are listed. On the right, you have User Data check  boxes below All None links. These check boxes enable you to select  which data you want to back up.   For example, you may not want to back up all the data from the Chat  activity. If that’s the case, deselect the box in front of the User Data for  the Chat activity. Be careful not to deselect the activity Chat as you want  to back up the whole course.  3.  Click the Continue button at the bottom of the page to begin the   backup process.   Moodle takes you to the next page in the backup process, which lists  the details of the data you’ve selected for the backup.  4.  Change the backup name if you want and then click the Continue   button at the bottom of the page.   At the top of the page, the default backup name in the form of Course_ Shortname-Date-Time.zip.  See Figure 14-7.  You can leave the default  name or change it to something more intuitive.  I recommend always  including a date in the backup name.                             Figure 14-7:  Course  backup  details.     348 Part IV: Moodle Management     Depending on how much data you’re backing up, the backup process  may take a few seconds. If you aren’t convinced you selected correct  options or something doesn’t look entirely correct, click the Cancel  button instead or use the Back button in your browser, and start again.   The next page in this backup process  see Figure 14-8  shows what has  been backed up. At the bottom of the page, Moodle gives you a message:  Backup completed successfully.                Figure 14-8:  Course  backup  confirmation.    5.  Click the Continue button.    Moodle takes you to the final page, the backup directory that is acces- sible anytime from the Files link in the Administration block. In the pre- ceding section, I describe how you can download and organize files in  the directory.  Saving Time by Reusing Your Course  After putting in hours of work creating your course, you can sit back and relax  because you will never have to create another Moodle course if you offer the  same course, or even a similar one, again. The backup and restore processes  allow instructors to duplicate — yes, clone, as one of my students called it —  the entire course so it can be reused. You can also duplicate specific activities  from one course for use in another, similar to the import function.  Restoring your entire course  The process for restoring and duplicating a course is straightforward. Unless  your system administrator moved the backup, it’s stored in the backup  data folder located in the course Files folder, accessible from your course  Administration block.  To restore your course, follow these steps:    Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  349  1.  Click the Files link in the course Administration block.    Moodle takes you to the list of files and folders.  2.  Click the backupdata folder.    Moodle takes you to your backup files directory, as shown in Figure 14-9.  Figure 14-9:  The backup  file  directory.                                                      3.  Under the Action column, click the Restore link located next to the   backup file you want to restore or copy.   Moodle takes you to a new page stating You are about to start  the restore process for:, and then the filename is listed below.  4.  Click the Yes button to answer the question Do you want to continue?    The restore process begins. Moodle lists all the files on the next page  that appears.  5.  Click the Continue button at the bottom of the page.    The Course Restore page appears, as shown in Figure 14-10. This page  allows you to restore the course. You have an option to add and or  delete data to it first.  6.  Fill in the Category, Short Name, Full Name, and Course Start Date fields.       This is where you can clone  duplicate  a course by just giving it a new  name, such as Physics 101 Winter Term, and new start date.  7.  If needed, deselect the check boxes next to the activities you don’t   want to include.   By default, all check boxes are selected.  8.  At the bottom of the Course Restore page, as shown in Figure 14-11,   select the following options:    Metacourse: Choose whether this is a meta course.   Users: Choose Course or None. The default is Course.   Groups: Choose whether you will use groups.   Logs: Select No.  You do not want to restore log files.    Site Files: Files pertaining to the whole site, meaning available to   all courses.   350 Part IV: Moodle Management   Figure 14-10:  The first  half of the  options and  selections  page for  restoring a  course.                                 Grade Histories: Grade data related to your course. If you’re start- ing a new course, you don’t want to restore the grade histories.  Notice in Figure 14-11 that in this example there isn’t a drop-down  list to make a choice, just the word No, because I deselected  restoring grade history.    Role Mappings: Teacher roles, by default, are only given permis- sion to assign roles for Non-Editing Teacher, Student, and Guest.  9.  Click the Continue button.    Moodle takes you to the Confirmation page, which is the last page  before the restoration begins. This page informs you that certain course  data needs to be restored for specific activities and that the process  may take a long time.  10.  Click the Restore This Course Now! button.    If you include user data for specific activities, this button is available  only for users with this capability enabled  moodle restore: userinfo .   Moodle takes you to a new page informing you about the progress of the  restoring procedure. Moodle then tells you whether it was successful.  11.  Click the Continue button.    The restoration is complete, and you can see the restored course listed  on the site front page and under the courses category you’ve chosen.    Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  351  Figure 14-11:  The second  half of the  options and  selections  page for  restoring a  course.              Importing specific data from your course  You don’t need to go through the whole backup and restore process if you  want to import data from another course. You can import any number of  activities and resources from other courses, including other instructors’  courses if you have a Teacher role  or another role with editing rights  in  those courses. This importing tool allows you and your colleagues to reuse  popular and useful activities and resources, saving everyone time.    The importing tool isn’t designed to import student or teacher data from activ- ities  such as forums, chats, and so on . It imports the activity as you have set  it up without the discussion threads. The importing tool imports questions  from your quizzes, but not students’ data if they have taken the quiz.  To import activities or resources from your course, follow these steps:  1.  Go to the course to which you want to import data. 2.  Click the Import link in the course Administration block.    Moodle takes you to the Import Activities from Another Course page,  where you choose which course you want to select data from.  See  Figure 14-12.    352 Part IV: Moodle Management   Figure 14-12:  The Import  Activities  from  Another  Course set- tings page.                                  3.  From the Courses I Have Taught drop-down list, select the course you   want to import. Then click the Use This Course button immediately  below the list.   Notice at the bottom of the page you can import your groups.   Moodle takes you to a new page listing all the activities and resources  from the course you want to transfer.  4.  Select the type of activities or resources you want to import. At the   bottom of the page, choose whether you want to include course files  and site files for the course.   By default, everything is selected. The All None links enable you to  deselect everything.   The site files option imports backups at the site level. For this particular  example, the backup would be quiz questions in the question pool. Select  the yellow question mark, and Moodle informs you of what’s included.   Moodle displays a reporting page that informs you of what’s  being imported.  5.  If all looks fine, click the Continue button at the bottom of the page.    Be patient. This step can take a little time, so go get yourself a cup of tea  and relax.   Moodle returns another page informing you of what was imported.  6.  Click the Continue button at the bottom of the page.       Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  353    You have to wait again, and then another screen appears with an  Import course data statement and a Continue button.  7.  Click Continue and then, on the next page, click Continue again.    When everything is completed, Moodle returns you to the front page of  the course into which you are importing.     If you imported quizzes or assignments from your course, don’t forget to  change any dates  that is, starting availability dates and due dates  associated  with them; otherwise, the learners will not be able to access the content.  Resetting Your Course  to Clear All User Data  The resetting tool enables you to clear your course of all user data, keeping  all activities, resources, and settings for the activities. Resetting is useful for  activities  such as wikis, glossaries, forums  and for tools  such as groups,  grade book, and roles  when you want a new group of students to start on  the activities and you need to record their progress.    When you’re going through the procedure and selecting items to reset, your   user data will be completely deleted, and you’ll be unable to recover it. I  advise that you back up your course first, including the user data, before you  begin experimenting with the resetting tool.  See “Backing Up Your Course  and Data,” earlier in the chapter.   To reset your course, follow these steps:  1.  From the course you want to reset, click the Reset link in the course   Administration block.   Moodle takes you to the Reset Course page.     2.  Under the General options, set the new course start date and delete all   calendar events, course log reports, and user notes.   Click the Show Advanced button to display all options in each category. 3.  Under Role options, you can unenroll users with specific roles within  your course. You can also remove all overrides and role assignments  specific to this course.  4.  Go through the other sections and make your selections.    For the Gradebook reset option, note that if you select the option to delete  the grade book, individual grades will still be listed in the users’ accounts.  The Groups reset options enable you to delete all groups, and the Activity  reset options enable you to remove data associated specific activities.                           354 Part IV: Moodle Management           5.  After making all your changes, click the Reset Course button.    You have three other button: Select Default, Deselect All, and Cancel.  Most are self-explanatory. The Select Default button returns all the  default selections for the course as when you first set it up.   Moodle returns you to your course. Go through the course to make sure  all is just as you need it.  Viewing Logs, Reports, and Statistics  Moodle can provide teachers and administrators with detailed logs and par- ticipation reports of all the activities in a course. These tools are quite useful  when you need to track students’ activities in a course. You may want to ana- lyze your course reports on a regular basis to monitor, for instance, when your  students engage with the material and how long they spend in the course and  with certain resources and activities. This analysis is more important if your  course is completely online than if your course is a hybrid course or part of  blended learning initiative. Logs can inform you about whether students find  certain material you give them helpful. For example, if learners don’t look at  quiz review notes, you may be wasting your time preparing them.  After you retrieve the log files and they’re displayed for you, they also pro- vide you with active links to other parts of the course, such as links to user  profiles, to specific pages in activities, or to resources.     If you have administrative privileges, you can access site reports to keep tabs  on all the roles for every course in the site, which is handy if you wear an  administrative hat and have to prepare reports for your bosses. The site report  tool works the same way as the course report tool except that you access it  from the Site Administration block on the front page of the Moodle site.  Viewing course logs  The log files for each course show all activity within the course. You can view  what resources and activities are being used, when they are being used, and  for how long. Course logs show activity within the course. Instructors can  use this information to see what resources are being used and when. You  can check individual student activity or the whole course.    Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  355  To access your course log, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Reports link in the Administration block on your course   front page.   Moodle takes you to a new page with a list of filter options displayed in  drop-down lists, as shown in Figure 14-13. Below the drop-down list are  links to various reports that are covered in the next section.    Moodle doesn’t give a report on the complete time learners stayed in an  activity. That would be quite nice. However, if you need to make sure  someone stayed with a task for any particular time, you can work it out  by checking the start time and the time he left the activity or logged out.  Of course, students are clever, and if they know that you’re monitoring  time spent, they may just log in, open the activity, and then leave or  watch TV.  2.  Select your filter options for the required data.    You can use the available filter options to choose the logs required  for your reporting needs. Moodle collects a lot of data, so you need to  narrow the search by using the filters listed in Table 14-2.                   Figure 14-13:  Use the logs  and reports  setup page  to choose  data.     356 Part IV: Moodle Management   Table 14-2  Filter Course  Participant  Day  Activity  Action  Display  Download  Log Filters and Their Functionality  Description Teacher role is required in order for the log filters to appear.  This drop-down list includes all courses in which the instructor  is a teacher. You can choose to see all participants or individual users  registered for the selected course. You can choose any day of the course from the first day the  course started. All the activities and resources you set up for your course are listed  by topics or weeks. You can choose all activities or individual ones. The default is to view all actions. This filter allows you to select  Viewed, Updated, Deleted, or All Changes Made. Moodle enables you to display the log files on the page  which is  the default  or download them as a text file, in Excel format, or ODS   Open Document Spreadsheet .           3.  Click the Get These Logs button located on the right side of  or below   if you’re working on a small screen  the Display drop-down list.   Moodle retrieves your data. Figure 14-14 displays an individual student’s  activity for August 9. Notice the student’s name links to her profile, and  each activity is also a link to that activity page.   You can return to the logs and reports page by using the navigation bar  or the Back button in your browser.  Generating reports  Moodle can generate two different type of reports, one for activities, the other  for participants and log files for up-to-date uses. I’m sure that from the various  options you will be able to pull out dates to provide you with information you  require on how your course is being explored by all your participants.  Live Logs from the Past Hour Right under the drop-down lists of log filters in Figure 14-13  shown ear- lier , Moodle enables you to view live logs from the last hour. Live logs are  updated on a regular basis. They display a record of all users and all activi- ties accessed. You don’t have a choice of filtering out data. Click the Live  Logs from the Past Hour link located in the center of the page.    Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  357  Figure 14-14:  Report for  a particular  student on  a specific  date.                            Activity Report If you need a report a particular activity or all activities in your course, you  can use the Activity Report tool, which enables you to filter the exact details  you need and generate a report. The activities are displayed by the topic  and shown by name. The output of the generated report appears in the  following order:  ✓ Resource or activity name ✓ Number of times viewed ✓ Date last viewed ✓ Elapsed time since last view  To generate an full activity report, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Reports link in the course Administration block.    You arrive at the page shown earlier in Figure 14-13.  2.  Use the filter drop-down lists to narrow your search. 3.  Click the Activity Report link located under the log files.   358 Part IV: Moodle Management                   You can also generate an individual user activity report, but you first need to  access the learner from the participant’s block. This activity report gives you  a quick overview of how frequently a particular learner is involved in your  course and how much time that person spends with a particular activity. To  create an individual leaner report, follow these steps:  1.  On your course front page, go to the People block, located by default  at the top-left corner of your front page and click the Participants link.   Moodle takes you to a list of all registered users  participants  in  your course.  2.  Click the learner’s name.    Moodle takes to the learner’s profile page. You see a number of tabs  across the top of the page   3.  Click the Activity Reports tab.    Moodle returns an Outline report, as shown in Figure 14-15 with the learn- er’s name at the top of the page.  In this example, it’s me.  Notice the other  links under the tabs: Complete Report, Today’s Logs, All Logs, Statistics,  and Grades. You can look at forums or chats and see how involved your  learner has been. You can also generate statistics if required for an indi- vidual report on the student.  Figure 14-15:  The partici- pant Activity  Report.       Participation Report A Participation Report enables you to monitor learners’ participation in the  course and individual activities. It doesn’t give you an individual participant’s  report as described in the preceding section, but instead it gives reports for     Chapter 14: Managing Course Data, Reports, Logs, and Statistics  359  the roles assigned in the particular course. Administrator, Teacher, Student,  and Guest are the usual default roles. This type of report can be useful, for  example, if you created a VIP guest account for guest authors that partici- pated in a forum discussion. You can generate a report on participation  between the guests and learners to determine the success of the activity.  To generate a Participation Report, follow these steps:  1.  Click the Reports link in the course Administration block.    You arrive at the page shown earlier in Figure 14-16.  2.  Use the filter drop-down lists to narrow your search. 3.  Click the Participation Report link located under the log files.    Moodle presents you with a new page with several drop-down lists.  4.  Select the following options:    Activity module   Number of days you want the report to cover the activity   Roles   Actions  Your choices are All Actions, View, and Post.   5.  Click the Go button to generate the report.  Statistics If you or your administrator enables site statistics, Moodle collects statistics  about each course and can produce graphs displaying them, which can be  handy for departmental reports or other purposes.  To enable the statistics functionality, you need to have administrative privi- leges. You can find the statistics options by going to the Site Administration  block, clicking the Server link, and then clicking the Statistics link. All options  on the page provide you with information on each functionality.  For more on  this topic, see Chapter 13.     Statistics is not enabled because the data can be a heavy burden on the data-  base. If you need statistics for a certain period, make sure that you go back  and de-select the functionality after you finish collecting the data.  To view statistics output, follow these steps:  1.

In true For Dummies style, I include The Part of Tens,   which is all about the little extras that sometimes just  don’t go anywhere else in the book. The little extras are  important, however, and this part is the perfect place for  them. In this part, you find a list of issues to think about  before you create online courses and a list of creative  ways to keep your students engaged after the novelty of  Moodle wears off.   Keep reading, I promise it’s worth it!   Chapter 15  Ten Questions to Ask  before Building and  Launching Your Course  In This Chapter ▶ Nailing the basics before starting  ▶ Defining your online teaching model ▶ Supporting learning goals and learning styles ▶ Enhancing the online experience through communication and feedback  It seems so simple to collect your content, prepare your documents, and   run through some Moodle demo courses  http:  demo.moodle.net    or explore your colleagues’ courses on your organization’s Moodle site. After  that, you’re ready to leap in and start building your course, right? Wait, hold  on. Before you build, take a few minutes to ask yourself these ten questions;  they will save you time.  Is the Moodle Site Ready for Use?  If your organization is running a Moodle site, seek out the person who wears  the Moodle system administrative hat, tell him what a wonderful job he’s doing   getting on your system administrator’s good side is worth gold , and ask him  to set up your Moodle course for you. Bringing a Coke and Skittles may help.  Also, ask him the following questions:        ✓ “Are multimedia filters turned on, including YouTube?” ✓ “Are pop-up windows blocked? Can you turn them on?” If your IT asks  why they need to be turned on, tell him that you want files and Internet  sites to be opened in a new window, which makes navigating the site    364 Part V: The Part of Tens               easier for your learners and decreases the chances that they will log out  of the Moodle course by clicking the red X in the corner.  ✓ “How do my learners access my course?” Ask for the URL. ✓ “Do I have a maximum size for my course? What is it?”  ✓ “Do you run regular backups, and is there a scheduled downtime   when you run maintenance on the server? Do you notify everyone,  or is this a regularly scheduled occurrence?”  ✓ “If you need statistics about learners’ activities, are statistics turned  on?” If not, ask for them to be turned on and negotiate when you want  to collect data. Statistics quickly clog up server space. You may want to  collect data on your course activities for a short period to see what and  how learners are interacting with your course.  How Do Students Register  for My Course?  You need to know whether your learners will be self registering or whether  they’ll be registered by the system administrator. Alternatively, you may  be given permission capabilities on your Teacher account to register them   because that means less work for the administrator . Chapters 4 and 13 cover  registration in more detail. Self registration is the easiest — you simply need to  give students a URL or point them to a Moodle link on the organization’s Web  site. If, however, they will be registered by the system admin, let them know they  will receive an e-mail with details about how to access your Moodle course.  Who Do I Contact If I Have  Problems with the Site?  If you have a Moodle system administrator, make special note of that  person’s contact information and keep it handy.  If your organization doesn’t have a system administrator for the Moodle site,  find a knowledgeable Moodle friend. This can be a friend or a colleague in  your IT department. Bring her presents, tell her she is the most wonderful  person walking this earth. Ego boosting and bribery work very well. You  can also try a nice introduction e-mail first, and often that’s enough.  If you’re on your own, don’t forget that the Moodle community is very  active — someone will help:    Chapter 15: Ten Questions to Ask before Building and Launching Your Course  365        ✓ http:  docs.moodle.org: This is a great place to find documenta-  tion about anything and everything to do with Moodle.  ✓ http:  moodle.org community: The Moodle community is a great   place to find information in the forums and post questions. Someone  is online helping 24 7. Moodlers span the globe, and they are a friendly  bunch. The community has more than 1 million registered users!  I almost forgot: There’s me! Contact me at www.dummies.com go moodlefd.  What Type of Course Am I Offering?  Are you offering a complete online course? Are you creating a hybrid course  that’s both online and offline? Or do you have a regular class and want to  use Moodle to supplement and extend it? If your course includes face-to-face  time, your Moodle course organization doesn’t not need to make use of the  communication tools as much as if you’re running a course where you will  never see your students. Structure and organize your course around the  teaching model you’re adapting.     I discuss eLearning models such as blended or hybrid learning in Chapter 2.  What Are My Learning  Goals and Objectives?  Learning goals and objectives are important to the way you’ll organize your  course. Is this a course running for ten weeks or for a semester in an edu- cational organization? Is this a short training course whereby your learners  need to be introduced to new policies and then pass an assessment test?  Remember that you need to clearly define your learning goals and objectives  and then structure and organize your course to support those goals.  When you’re organizing your content, also be sure to identify your partici- pants’ learning styles and use the capabilities of Moodle to support the  variety of learning styles you come across.  If you keep in mind that knowledge is facilitated by the development of effec- tive instructional strategies, and no single medium can support them all, you  will be on your way to creating an effective and efficient learning environ- ment. See the companion Web site for more information on learning styles  and templates that can help you identify how your instructional methods  may support a variety of learning goals.   366 Part V: The Part of Tens   Did I Brainstorm and Organize  My Course Structure?  Take your syllabus, your TOC, and all the resources you want your learners  to read and then think how you will organize that content in your Moodle  course. Just by picking up this book, I know you’ve thought about putting  your content online and you have some ideas about how you want to extend  your conventional course. Don’t feel you need to do anything novel and  extraordinary; often that isn’t the best strategy. Never compromise your  teaching methods just because you’re using a different form of delivery.  After all, Moodle is designed with pedagogy in mind. You can structure  your course by weeks, topics, or discussion and build from there.  Thinking and working through exactly how you’re going to deliver the teach- ing are harder than actually doing it, and in my opinion, the delivery is the  most critical aspect of any successful course. Your syllabus is a great starting  point. Have a look at a few demo courses, plan your course  storyboards are  a good tool to help plan , and then begin. The companion Web site offers few  planning templates that may help.  How Will I Communicate  with My Learners?  As I’m sure you already know, communication and feedback are absolutely  vital to a successful outcome of any course. Moodle offers many different  ways to communicate with your learners. A whole chapter is dedicated to  communication tools, that’s how important I feel communicating with your  learner is. Start by browsing Chapter 8, and before you start setting up your  course, add communicative strategies to your planning stage. Plan how you  will communicate with your learners and how your learners can contact each  other, work in groups, and have peer time using Moodle. The younger genera- tions live in an online world anyway; they will take to it like fish to water.  Obviously, your communication strategies will differ depending on whether  you have a course that’s completely online or a course where you have face- to-face interaction with your learners. Even if you do have physical presence,  using Moodle for detailed feedback for assignments and quizzes may save  you and your learners time — they will come prepared or may even ask  questions in chat or e-mail, saving face-to-face time for course work.    Chapter 15: Ten Questions to Ask before Building and Launching Your Course  367  How Will I Assess My Learners?  Assessment in Moodle will save you a lot of time. Read Chapter 7 and then  have a look at the Assignment and Quiz modules in Chapters 10 and 11, and  then add your assessment strategy to your syllabus. You can also grade or  give credit for participation in forums, adding to glossaries, wikis . . . actually,  most activities can be assessed. The Moodle grades and grade book support  most traditional techniques and can take marking burden off of you. Plan and  plan and plan and when you decided how to do the assessing, make sure you  include ways you will inform your learners about assessment, about how to  access online assignments, and about how to upload them and how to use  the quizzes  worksheets or tests .  Am I Comfortable Using Moodle?  When you’re ready to start developing your course, I recommend you try  some of the tools and modules to get a feel for the site and how it works.  Either set up a new play course available only to you or start working on  the one you will use with your learners. Don’t get caught up in thinking  that everything has to be perfect; just enjoy it. You can delete anything  you don’t want, hide resources and activities  the closed eye icon , or  reset your course all together.  Getting to know Moodle is essential — you should know at least the core  basics before you offer the course. Start slowly and build up. For instance, if  you’re using Moodle as part of your traditional face-to-face class, start using  core basics, like uploading content, setting up a forum, and creating links to  resources. Also, be willing to learn with your learners when they get started  with your course: They’ll take to it quickly and may even offer you advice or  give you ideas about how to extend it.  Is My Course Ready to Go Live?  Testing your course is important — even more so if you’re offering a complete  online course where you’ll have minimal interaction with your learners. Recruit  a former learner or a colleague to go through it. Watch your helpers and see  how they interact with your course. Develop a check list and watch the interac- tions. Ask your helpers to test all quiz questions. Here are a few suggestions:   368 Part V: The Part of Tens                     ✓ Did they find the introduction document instructions? ✓ Did they read what they were instructed to read first? ✓ Were they confused? Did they click different things before they returned  to your instruction? I’m assuming you uploaded a syllabus or instructions.  In my courses, I prepare a “Please Read First!” document, upload it to  the top section so that learners to see it right away, and also e-mail it to  new learners.  ✓ Was the syllabus clear? ✓ Identify difficulties. ✓ Interview the testers and ask what they liked, disliked, found useful,   confusing, and so on.  The companion Web site  www.dummies.com go moodlefd  has a template  for a checklist and suggestions about how to run a pilot study or evaluation.   Chapter 16  Ten Creative Ways to Keep Your  Learners Involved in Your Course  In This Chapter ▶ Communicating with your learners ▶ Giving your learners ownership and responsibility ▶ Enhancing the online experience through feedback, group projects, and guest “speakers” ▶ Implementing databases and lessons  Everyone involved in education and training wants his or her learners to   have a good experience. Nothing is more rewarding than seeing learners  excelling and enjoying a course. In fact, that’s worth all the hours you slaved  to put the course together and deliver it. So, what can you do in Moodle to  get your learners to be actively involved in the course and have a good expe- rience? As you can imagine, Moodle offers many ways. This chapter features  ten suggestions that really work.  Communicate with Your Learners  As an educator or instructor, I don’t need to tell you how important com- munication is; however, people often assume that because a course is online,  instructors don’t need to be as hands-on. I beg to differ. The most successful  online courses are those in which instructors are actively involved and get to  know their learners, even though it’s only virtually. Here are few suggestions:     ✓ Complete your profile. Complete your profile with a picture and your   skills, likes, dislikes, and a bit about yourself so your learners can get to  know you. After all, you tell learners about yourself at the beginning of  each face-to-face course or training session. Also, encourage  or make it  mandatory  for learners to personalize their profiles.   Make sure your system administrator has not disabled this capability.  By default, all Moodle user accounts can personalize their profiles.      370 Part V: The Part of Tens                  ✓ Keep online office hours. Use the Moodle chat room effectively,   followed up with forum discussions.  ✓ Respond to your learners. Allow learners to e-mail or post messages,   and then get back to them quickly. Post the good questions  with  answers  to the News forum, which Moodle pushes to e-mail all learners  in the course. If appropriate, give the learners credit for brilliance; you  may just see more forum activity and participation, and you won’t have  to answer similar questions again.  ✓ Chat with your learners. Chats are great for making yourself available  to alleviate test panic by holding a session before it. The answers gener- ated can be downloaded and used for future FAQs — a great resource. ✓ Blog  and encourage your learners to blog, too . Many people like to   blog about themselves or something they’re passionate about. Blogs can  be individual journals between just you and your learner, or made avail- able to the course or site. They can be used to correct grammar as part  of an English course or a foreign language course. Blogs can be topic  related and are popular because of the ownership they exhibit.  ✓ Talk. Sometimes talking accomplishes a lot more if you have a situation   that needs attention, in much shorter time. If you think it necessary,  don’t hesitate to pick up the telephone or use Skype with the learner.   Remember, Skype is free.  Your learners will appreciate your commitment.   Use Forums for Discussions and  Other Class-Related Activities  You see a lot more activity if you start the forums and post the first discus- sion topic. Adding your input to discussions is also valuable because it  shows learners that you’re engaged and are reading their postings. If  learners find replies interesting and useful, they’re more likely to get  involved in the forum discussion.  You can make forums a required task as part of the course and assign grades,  points, or scales. Moodle pushes the marks straight to the grade book, which  ensures participation.  Set up a forum leader monitor, or let learners take turns and share the  responsibility. You can set up a rubric  a set of rules for assigning grades  for scoring  and give learners capabilities to rate or grade postings.  The following list details other ways that you can creatively use forums to  keep your learners engaged:     Chapter 16: Ten Creative Ways to Keep Your Learners Involved in Your Course  371              ✓ Debates: Use forums to set up debates among schools, organizations,   courses, or within a course.  ✓ Role-playing: Set up a forum around characters and use the character to   role-play. You can set up courtroom dramas, election scenarios, plays,  or major historical decision-making exercises. Learners then have to  learn all about the character to be able to take on the persona, answer  questions, and debate issues from his or her perspective.  ✓ Storytelling: Ask learners to take on a character persona and contribute   to discussions using the persona of the character.  ✓ FAQs: Forums can be set up as FAQs or question-and-answer discussions   in which everyone can answer.  Give Feedback  At the beginning of the course, inform your learners how they’ll be assessed  and which activities are part of the assessment. Doing so is standard prac- tice. The next invaluable responsibility is for you to give feedback. You can  automate your feedback in the Quiz module by adding feedback for each  answer or question, or overall feedback for the quiz based on outcomes. You  can also add feedback to assignments that display in the learner’s grade book  and are automatically e-mailed, with the grade, when you post it.  You can also give feedback for forum contributions and for creating and con- tributing to resources like wikis, glossaries, chats, and so on. Posting a brief  message to a learner to acknowledge and encourage her participation doesn’t  take up much of your time.  Assign Responsibility to Learners  Let learners monitor forum discussions, glossary entries, database entries,  download and mark chat session, decide which great chat topics get posted  to forum discussions, or monitor chats. Permissions can be added to indi- vidual user accounts, or you can set up a new group leader with enabled  capabilities to approve entries, so you can rotate who wears the hat.  Many activities can be set up to require submission approval before something  is added, such as a glossary, database, or wiki. Placing learners in charge to  approve an entry can create a feel-good factor among your learners and save  you valuable time ensuring that what’s posted isn’t rubbish or malicious.   372 Part V: The Part of Tens   Set Up Project Learner Groups  You can use many of the activities for projects. You may think that learners  who take online courses lack group experience on projects. This thought isn’t  entirely correct. Projects can be set up for groups, and various communica- tion tools in Moodle help members work together. In a traditional classroom  setting, learners don’t often meet after class. Instead, they use current social  media to communicate, which is what Moodle learners do.    Encourage your learners to use wikis in group projects. Wikis provide a great   resource for brainstorming exercises for projects. Their extensibility allows  for learners to upload resources to evaluate, link to the Internet, and start  organizing the project.  Invite Guests to Participate in the Course  Getting someone to come to your class to talk to your learners about their  work or to share adventures, skills, and expertise can be difficult. Well, it is  a lot easier to invite guests to participate in similar activities online. If the  format isn’t in real time  for example, a chat is in real time where the guest  is taken from his work and needs to be at a computer at a specific time , the  guest is usually happy to answer questions at his convenience. Here are a  couple suggestions on how to structure this activity:  ✓ Have students post questions for the guest using a forum: Enable every-  one to rate the questions; then, take the top ten questions and e-mail them  to the guest. When the guest e-mails back the answers, you can post the  answers to the News forum or on a Web page on the course front page.  ✓ Assign a VIP role to the guest: Create a VIP role and invite your guest to   participate in the forum discussion. I cover roles in Chapter 13.  ✓ Ask the guest to share his work: Invite a guest, such as an artist, author,  or someone with artifacts, to post his work in the Moodle course. Or if  that guest has a Web site, you can create a Web page and link to the work.           Reward Your Learners For Contributions  Creating a cool project using Moodle modules that every in the course or  site can benefit from or posting individual achievements on blogs or post- ing suggestions to forums are popular activities for learners to view and be  rewarded for. Martin Dougiamas, the original creator of Moodle, states that  in a true collaborative environment, people are both teachers and learners.     Chapter 16: Ten Creative Ways to Keep Your Learners Involved in Your Course  373  Why not give your learners a Moodle trophy  or at least acknowledgements  and fame  for being a great Moodler and promoting collaborative spirit?  Create Practice Tests  Practice tests are a great tool for learners to check their knowledge before  they have to be formally evaluated. The Quiz module can be set up for stu- dents to take the test repeatedly until they know the material and feel confi- dent with the subject matter.   The Quiz module can also be used for the end of a reading section or chapter  reviews, encouraging learners to keep up with course reading.   Dig In to the Delightful Database  The Database activity module is a resource that all instructors should use in  some capacity — if for nothing else than teaching learners how to set up and  use a simple database, a skill they’ll find useful in their employment, further  education, or personal use. Here are just a few ideas for using this module to  keep learners engaged:  ✓ Contact information: The database can be used for learners’ personal  contact details or portfolio, such as artwork, a photo album, essays for  college entrance, resumes, and so on. Learners can create a database  that will contain other Moodlers, instructors, business contacts, employ- ment or college information, family, and friends. Having all your contacts  organized and accessible makes it easy to set up project work with other  Moodlers. You won’t have any need to leave to Moodle environment to  e-mail, chat, and use other third-party software.  ✓ Project work: Used to collect information for a group project and then   to organize that info into categories to make it easily accessible for  future uses. For example:    Storage for grant proposals: A large amount of work goes into col-  lecting data and resources before an actual proposal is submitted.  Using a database enables a group to work collaboratively, from  different locations, and to store information in an organized reposi- tory that’s available for future similar projects.    Research repository: Research projects generate an extraordinary   amount of data and are often a collaborative exercise, which  makes this module ideal for such activity.               374 Part V: The Part of Tens      ✓ A portfolio: Learners can create a personal portfolio for potential   employers or for admissions offices for art schools, universities, or any  other type of training organizations.  Create a Competition  Learners love to compete, especially if there’s a reward at the end of it. You  can set up competition between learners or create teams. The Groups tool  is ideal for such competitions. You and another instructor sharing the same  Moodle site can compete between courses. Wikis, databases, glossaries,  forums, quizzes, and assignments can all offer fierce challenges. Review the  modules in the chapters, put on your referee hat, and see how creative you  can get in setting up a competitive activity for your learners.
