You will learn the fundamental concepts of web site standardization, along with the standardization  bodies that develop standards and the most influential web sites that announce, promote, and distribute  them. You will learn about the importance of web standards and understand the reasons for incorrect  implementations, along with techniques to correct or eliminate them. You will learn the web standards  by category, from server configuration and internationalization settings to standard-compliant markup,  style sheets, object embedding, metadata annotations, and news feeds. After reading these chapters, you  will have a solid foundation of web standards and will be able to select the most appropriate standards  for your projects.      1    C H A P T E R  1              Introduction to Web Standards   Technical standards are widely used in various fields of life—think of the standards of paper size and the  standard envelopes that fit them. Web standards, similar to other standards, are normative specifications  of technologies and methodologies. In other words, they are well-defined sets of requirements to be  satisfied. They are not only ideal from the technical point of view but also represent user needs.  However, web standards are often ignored; the World Wide Web consists of billions of documents that  do not consider proper restrictions or regulations, causing serious problems. This is because the Web is  a “free forum” where everyone can publish even without a technical background. Unfortunately, this  approach comes at a price: you will often encounter sites that download slower, have an inadequate  appearance, or have poor functionality. Further, in spite of the benefits of standard compliance, not only  content authors but also web developers find it difficult to implement web standards. One of the major  reasons for that is the lack of widespread distribution. Even the most popular web sites can be very  confusing, and in contrast to the common misconception, developers cannot use them as references to  learn from. Moreover, many developers ignore standards because they think incorrectly that developing  with standards means an additional workload. People have a limited knowledge about web standards,  and they generally know neither the reason nor the optimal method for applying them.   In this chapter, you will learn about the significance of web standards and the reliable resources you   should know in order to make the best use of web standards in your own applications. Web standards  are often ignored, causing serious problems that are described in the “Problem Statement” section later  in this chapter. This chapter sets out the major benefits of web standards. It will also give you a solid  understanding of the diversity and status of standards. After reading the chapter, you will be able to  recognize finalized specifications and select the most appropriate ones for any project.   The Basic Concepts  Web standards are applicable to the World Wide Web  for short, the Web . These formal standards define  and describe various aspects of the Web. According to the Web Standards Project, a major standards  promoter, “Web standards are carefully designed to deliver the greatest benefits to the greatest number  of web users while ensuring the long-term viability of any document published on the Web. Designing  and building with these standards simplifies and lowers the cost of production, while delivering sites  that are accessible to more people and more types of Internet devices. Sites developed along these lines  will continue to function correctly as traditional desktop browsers evolve, and as new Internet devices  come to market” [1].   Web standards are often de facto  in practice  standards. Since there is no law that enforces them,   web standards are ignored by a large share of web developers. The Recommendations published by the  World Wide Web Consortium  W3C , the largest web standardization body in the world, are not  exceptions either. However, in November 2010, W3C made a big step forward when it became an  ISO IEC JTC 1 PAS Submitter because any stable core web technologies produced by W3C are also in the  scope of ISO. The International Standards Organization  ISO  and the International Electrotechnical   3    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Commission  IEC  can efficiently contribute to the wider, and, if possible, global, adoption of W3C  standards by changing the status of de facto standards to de jure  in principle  [2].   Web site standardization refers to the development process of standard web sites or the correction  of nonstandard sites to fulfill the requirements to become standard sites. This phrase has been recently  associated with the philosophy of web design and programming that includes the application of widely  accepted technologies, techniques, and best practices. The list also includes various tricks, as well as CSS  and JavaScript hacks used by many developers, most of whom are not aware that these techniques  should not be used.   The main goals of standardization are functionality, interoperability, and browser and resolution  independence in order to ensure user experience, access to content, menu usability, and predictable  behavior.   The Role of Standardization  As you will see, there are several goals in web development, and they cannot be achieved without a  standardized approach. How is it possible to use printers on a daily basis without paper-size standards?  How could anyone use electric devices without standardized voltage? Why should web developers  expect that standards are not essential to quality assurance?   The grammar and other rules defined by web standards should be followed when authoring on the  Web. Although browsers have strong built-in error-handling features capable of eliminating problems  on the user side, web developers should not misuse these features.   Overall, designing costs are lower because fewer design decisions need to be made. Routine design   should be based on standards. A further advantage is that developers can use their knowledge again  when designing.   Users switch to other web sites within a few seconds if the content is not provided in an appropriate   manner. As a result, poor functionality and usability might have a severe impact on web site traffic and  business revenue.   Furthermore, various browsers interpret bad or broken markup in different ways. This could be a   reason for inconsistencies, bad layout, style problems, and unexpected script behavior. The best way is  to fulfill all the requirements of structure, syntax, and other rules described by the appropriate  Document Type Definition and W3C Recommendation  see the “W3C” section .   Applying up-to-date web technologies is difficult, but it’s vital for providing powerful features that   are expected by most users. Web authors should choose the right technologies to compete with other  developers. Standard compliance is an essential feature of web site development that guarantees general  quality [3].   Using web standards is, therefore, a promising way to improve the overall usability of the Web.   The Cost of Nonstandardized Markup  All Internet users encounter web sites from time to time that break apart and show elements in evidently  wrong places that are partly overlapped with unreadable content.   The cause is, in most cases, the nonstandard or browser-specific source code or the lack of standard   support of the web browser used to render the pages.   The majority of web sites are obsolete from the standardization point of view. Even the largest and   most well-known companies publish nonstandard documents constantly.   4    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS                                     The major drawbacks of nonstandardized documents are the following:   Inadequate search engine indexing. Crawlers cannot index incorrectly coded  documents, which can cause visitor loss.1   Incorrect rendering  one of the most significant drawbacks .   Longer download time.   Longer rendering.   Easier development.   Low level of accessibility.   Low level of backward compatibility.   Lost traffic, fewer visitors, and fewer sales. Because of the inconveniences and  problems listed earlier, web sites that are not standard-compliant have a higher  risk of losing functionality, popularity, and productivity.      Additional bandwidth load and hosting cost. Numerous needless characters in the   source code increase both file size and complexity.      Difficult updating and maintenance.   Benefits of Standard-Compliant Markup  Valid, standard-compliant markup has several advantages. Here are the most important ones:    Search engine crawlers can index documents more adequately, and the content is  basically search engine optimized.      Compared to those websites that violate standards, standard-compliant websites   can be downloaded faster.      Well-structured markup provides faster rendering.     Web documents that apply standards properly are rendered accurately.     More users are accommodated, and they probably stay longer because of correct   appearance and layout.2   Lower development costs  only in case of well-qualified developers and carefully  selected software tools .   Standard-compliant markup serves as the basis for website accessibility.         Backward compatibility is ensured as browsers evolve.     Optimal content lengths and file size  no unnecessary characters are listed in the   source code , as well as cost-optimal storage  potential for cheaper hosting .                                                     1 However, there are several additional factors that affect search engine indexing.  2 Thanks to correct rendering rather than design.   5    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS               Standard-compliant markup is easier to maintain and update than the markup  that violates standards.   Standard-compliant source codes become obsolete later, and upgrading is much  easier when new standards are introduced.      Compatibility with current and future browsers is guaranteed  at least from a   developer’s point of view .   Inspire implementation and force web browsers to support standards  progressively.   It should be evident that standard-compliant, clean code has many advantages over nonstandard  source code. Consequently, it is not only highly recommended but vital to consider standards during  web site development.   Development and Announcement of Standards  Generally, web standards are technical specifications of web technologies released by standardization  bodies. Most web standards are published by W3C [4]. Its Recommendations are vital when designing  with standards.3 W3C publishes specifications on markup languages, style sheets, metadata, XML  technologies, semantic markup, mathematical notation, and graphical formats, just to mention the most  important categories. However, there are also other influential standards organizations on the web  standardization scene  Table 1-1 .   Table 1-1. Influential Organizations on Web Standardization   Organization   Abbreviation   Web Site   Major Specifications and  Standards   Dublin Core Metadata  Initiative   DCMI   www.dublincore.org   Dublin Core Metadata   ECMA International   formerly ECMA    ECMA   www.ecma- international.org   ECMAScript [5]   International Organization  for Standardization   ISO   www.iso.org   Web site engineering and  other IT standards [6], for  example, user interface  standards, PNG functional  specification   Domain names, IP address  coordination, protocol  assignments [7]   Internet Assigned Numbers  Authority   IANA   www.iana.org                                                     3 The term recommendation refers to the lack of legal status. This is one of the reasons why they are  applied so rarely.   6    Organization   Abbreviation   Web Site   Internet Engineering Task  Force   IETF   www.ietf.org   Unicode Consortium   Unicode   www.unicode.org   Web Hypertext Application  Technology Working Group   WHATWG   www.whatwg.org   World Wide Web  Consortium   W3C   www.w3.org   CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Major Specifications and  Standards   Internet standard  STD   documents [8], Request for  Comments  RFC  documents  [9], for example, proper use of  HTTP, MIME, and URI   Unicode Standard,   Unicode Technical Reports   UTRs  [10]   HTML5, Microdata, Web  Applications, Web Forms,  Web Workers [11]   Recommendations, for  example,  X HTML, CSS,  DOM, XForms, SVG, RDF,  GRDDL, OWL   W3C  Founded and directed by Tim Berners-Lee  “the inventor of the Web”4 , the World Wide Web Consortium  is the largest international organization for developing standards for the World Wide Web. It has several  local offices throughout the world. The members of W3C are mainly universities and research groups  that are keen to participate in the development of web standards. W3C works as an open forum.  Efforts are made to ease contributions to web standards. In fall 2010, W3C released the Draft   Proposal “Making W3C the place for new standards” [12]. Openness could be the key to new, easier  contributions from the web community, including independent web developers without W3C  membership. It also contributes to the maximization of knowledge reuse [13]. Important standards such  as HTML5, CSS, SVG, MathML, various APIs, RDFa, and Microdata are summarized in a suite of  technical standards called the Open Web Platform, which is open for contributions from external  organizations and the public [14]. W3C is now “an open platform for web standardization” [15].   In fact, many problems web developers face every day have already been solved and published in   earlier W3C Recommendations, sometimes several years ago. Some technologies are based on ideas that  were originally created elsewhere but later shared with W3C to achieve wider support and popularity.   News feeds, for example, are not as new as one might think. They were described many years earlier  when they first appeared on the Web and became supported by major browsers, operating systems, and  office suites [for example, 16]. Surprisingly, RSS 0.9 was published as early as 1999 [17]!  A similar trend holds for markup languages, vector graphics, equations, and other specifications.   Mathematical notations are published as GIF image files all over the Internet, although the markup   language for this purpose became a Recommendation in 1999  with updates soon following .                                                     4 Although he is often referred this way, he does not call himself so.   7    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Vector graphics are seldom used on the Web, although W3C started to develop the SVG standard in  1998, and it became a Recommendation in 2001.5 High-resolution bitmap graphics are used instead. But  why? They should be replaced by SVG whenever possible, and raster graphics should be applied for  publishing photographs only. SVG is supported by Amaya, the free web editor browser of W3C, and  popular graphic suites like Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw. From 2010, SVG has also been indexed by  Google [18]. SVG 1.2 supports animation too. Editing SVG is not more complicated than editing bitmaps,  but SVG files are generally smaller in size, can be downloaded faster, and have incomparable quality  compared to bitmaps.   WHATWG  The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group  WHATWG  is a professional yet unofficial  community founded by individuals in 2004. It was a response to the relatively slow standards  development at W3C and its decision to abandon HTML in favor of XHTML and other XML-based  standards. The WHATWG has an invitation-only committee, which controls the editors of specifications.  Anyone can contribute to the efforts of WHATWG by joining one of its open mailing lists [19].   ERCIM  The European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics assembles researchers to work in  cooperation on various fields of ICT and applied mathematics including, but not limited to, information  system applications, information storage and retrieval, information interfaces and presentation, data  encryption, and database management [20]. The scientific approach is ensured by 19 organizations from  different countries across Europe. ERCIM has played a major role in the formulation of standards such  as SMIL and SVG [21].   IETF  The Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  is a standardization group within the nonprofit organization  Internet Society  ISOC  along with the Internet Architecture Board  IAB . IETF focuses mainly on  Internet protocols. IETF standards are generally on lower levels than web site developers are interested  in; however, even the well-known TCP IP has been developed by IETF. “The mission of the IETF is make  the Internet work better by producing high quality, relevant technical documents that influence the way  people design, use, and manage the Internet [22].” Technical documents are listed on the Requests for  Comments  RFC  web site [23].   Ecma International  Ecma International is a nonprofit standards organization that develops and promotes standards for  information and communication systems [24]. One of its most important standards from a web  developer’s point of view is the standardized scripting language ECMAScript  which JavaScript is based  on; see the section “JavaScript” for more .   Unicode Consortium  The Unicode Consortium coordinates the development, maintenance, and promotion of Unicode and  other internationalization standards [25]. The nonprofit organization defines the behavior and                                                    5 In contrast, Internet Explorer supports SVG natively from 2011 only.   8    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   relationship between Unicode characters. The consortium works in close collaboration with W3C and  ISO. The most important part of the cooperation is the maintenance of ISO IEC 10646, the International  Standard synchronized with the Unicode Standard.   DCMI  The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is a registered company in Singapore [26]. The open organization  develops and maintains interoperable metadata standards. DCMI provides annual conferences and  workshops, standards liaison, and standards promotion. A worldwide community of users and  developers is supported by DCMI through collaborative work in discussion forums, communities, and  task groups.   IANA  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority is the organization that oversees global IP address and top- level domain allocations, root zone management in the Domain Name System  assignments of ccTLDs  and gTLDs , MIME types, and other Internet Protocol–related symbols and numbers [27]. IANA is  operated by the nonprofit corporation Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers  ICANN   [28].   OASIS  The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards  OASIS  works on open  standards for web services, interoperability, security, and ebusiness. Its slogan is “Advancing open  standards for the information society” [29]. The consortium maintains influential information portals  on web services as well as on XML [30, 31].   ISO  Founded in 1947, the International Organization for Standardization is an international standardization  body that represents various standards organizations from all over the world [32]. ISO provides both  industrial and commercial standards. ISO has developed more than 18,500 international standards on a  variety of subjects, many of which are also used on the Web  for example, country codes, date time, and  time duration annotations .   Standards Promotion and Distribution  Many web standards are optional only and not enforced by law  which is the only way to achieve  worldwide application . However, there is a new trend that might change the situation within a few years   for example, there are accessibility standards that are enforced by law in some countries—see the  section “Defining Web Accessibility” . Until then, web standards are not present everywhere, and it can  be difficult for web developers to maintain up-to-date knowledge and learn new technologies. However,  people can use a variety of events and resources to inform themselves as individuals or through  affiliations, including conferences, printed or online documents, and books.   9    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Groups and Associations  There are numerous groups among enthusiastic web developers that distribute and expedite standards  and harmonize them with best practices. Membership fees are generally much lower than those of  standardization bodies. Some of them are open, and anyone can join free of charge.   Note that many technical groups and associations focus mainly on technologies rather than   standards. Their members are usually informed about the latest technology news only. The following  sections provide a quick overview of influential groups related to web standardization.   The Web Standards Project  The Web Standards Project  WaSP  was founded in 1998 by professional web developers to spread the  application of web standards published mainly by W3C. “The Web Standards Project is a grassroots  coalition fighting for standards which ensure simple, affordable access to Web technologies for all” [33].  The organization focuses on standard support, accessibility, and easier development.   WaSP’s major contributions to web standard support are known as task forces. Its aim is to attract   the attention of the most considerable companies and organizations of the world and persuade them to  become standard-compliant as much as possible. WaSP task forces include the following:   Education Task Force       Accessibility Task Force     Adobe Task Force  former Dreamweaver Task Force            Microsoft Task Force      International Liaison Group   The Street Team   The Acid tests used to compare standard support of browsers  see the section “Standard   Compliance Tests”  were introduced by the Web Standards Project.   Web Standards Group  As a web designer developer community, the Web Standards Group  WSG  focuses on web standards  and best practices to achieve standard codes. Thousands of IT professionals from around the world are  members of WSG [34].   Guild of Accessible Web Designers  The Guild of Accessible Web Designers  GAWDS  is a worldwide association of professional organizations,  individual web designers, and developers. GAWDS works on promoting accessibility standards [35].   International Webmasters Association  The International Webmasters Association is a W3C member that “provides and fosters professional  advancement opportunities among individuals dedicated to or pursuing a Web career, and to work   10    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   diligently to enhance their effectiveness, image, and professionalism as they attract and serve their  clients and employers” [36].   Web Industry Professionals Association  The Web Industry Professionals Association is a technical association in Australia. WIPA assembles  professional individuals working in the web industry to “exchange ideas, participate in debate, advance  education and promote ethical practice” [37]. WIPA is a major organizer of web courses in Australia.   Open Digital Rights Language Initiative  The Open Digital Rights Language  ODRL  Initiative is an international organization that develops and  promotes the ODRL vocabulary [38], which is an open standard for policy expressions  see the section  “DC, IMS, and ODRL” .   Staying Informed: Events and Courses  Beyond online resources such as official news feeds, there are several types of appearances and events  that contribute to the worldwide distribution of web standards. The list includes press releases, scientific  and professional conferences, talks, workshops, meetings, discussion forums, symposiums, and  tutorials. Many of the documents associated with these events are available online. Web standardistas  can use these documents to maintain up-to-date knowledge and keep abreast of the latest  specifications.   The primary resource for major events related to web standards such as workshops and conferences   as well as announcements of recommendations and presentations is the W3C web site at www.w3.org  [39]. Events are classified as “Talks and appearances” and “Events.” Past events are available in the News  Archive [40].   The World Wide Web Consortium also offers online training courses on standards such as SVG   through a dedicated portal [41]. The courses consist of weekly modules with instructions  lectures , link  collection, activities, and a discussion forum. The quality is guaranteed by the instructors since they are  either co-authors or editors of the relevant W3C standard or internationally recognized experts in the  field. Participants can expect to spend two to three hours per week on these courses.   The Internationalization & Unicode Conference  IUC  has been organized annually since 1977. It   covers the latest industry standards and best practices on software and web application  internationalization. Up-to-date information is available at www.unicodeconference.org [42].   IETF meetings are held three times a year. Information on upcoming meetings, requests, materials,   proceedings, and sponsoring are published on the IETF web site [43].   The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative has held the International Conference on Dublin Core and   Metadata Applications annually since 2001 [44].   WIPA provides up-to-date information on up-coming events such as Australian training courses   and workshops on the WIPA web site [45]. The association also has two RSS channels, publishing general  news [46] and industry events [47], respectively.   The Association for Computing Machinery  ACM  maintains an up-to-date calendar on IT   conferences and events, some of which are related to web technologies [48].   World Standards Day has been celebrated since 1970 by ISO, IEC, and ITU each year on 14 October   in Geneva, Switzerland. The message of World Standards Day 2010 clearly indicated a major aim of  standardization: “Standards make the world accessible for all” [49].   11    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Not all prominent events have a long track history, though. Many promising conferences and   workshops are good initiatives such as the popular conference Future of Web Apps [50]. Carsonified also  organizes online conferences on the latest technologies [51].   There are web sites that are collections of events and articles of a given topic. A good example is   www.semanticmetadata.net, which is a comprehensive site for Semantic Web developers [52].   Resources  One of the easiest ways to keep up-to-date with web standards is to subscribe to the news feeds of  standardization bodies and organizations. News is often published on the home pages of the related web  sites. Course materials, conference proceedings, and presentation slides are also available in many  cases. An endless variety of further resources are also available.   W3C provides a weekly newsletter [53]. Its latest news is available in both Atom [54] and RSS [55]   news feeds. The vast majority of W3C documents are public and freely available.   General news on Unicode is available through the news feed of the Unicode Consortium [56].  The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative publishes news on the home page of its web site and provides a   news feed [57]. The proceedings of the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata  Applications are available at the DCMI Conference Papers page [58].   Scientific journal papers with Digital Object Identifier  DOI  can also be found throughout the Web,  although many of these documents are not free of charge. Still, most of them provide at least an abstract  in PDF.   Types, Stages, and Status of Standards  The Web is a highly innovative medium where constant changes and improvements necessitate  continuous standard development. This results in different document maturity levels. For example, W3C  Recommendations progress through five such levels, also known as the W3C process flow [59]:   Last Call Working Draft      Working Draft  WD         Candidate Recommendation  CR         W3C Recommendation  REC    Proposed Recommendation  PR    The last version is considered by developers as the  de facto  standard to be applied. W3C   Recommendations are sometimes updated by separately published erratum. After a considerable  amount of changes, new editions are published that supersede the current version. However, their URIs  generally remain constant. The document status determines which version is the most up-to-date one  and which one should be applied. The list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of  technical reports can be found in the W3C technical reports folder [60].   Other standardization bodies use different status conventions. The Internet Engineering Task Force,  for example, applies document status such as Internet draft, informational, and proposed standard. The  latter one is defined as a “generally stable specification which has resolved known design choices, is  believed to be well-understood, has received significant community review, and appears to enjoy  enough community interest to be considered valuable. However, further experience might result in a  change or even retraction of the specification before it advances [61].” The IETF RFCs are designated as  standards, draft standards, proposed standards, best current practices, informational documents,  experimental documents, and historic standards [62].    12    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   The Microformat Community uses the status draft specification for those documents that are   “somewhat mature in the development process” and whose stability is not guaranteed [63].  Implementers of such documents are warned to keep abreast of future developments and changes.   ISO applies the following conventions:   Preliminary work item  PWI          New work item proposal  NP or NWIP, NP Amd TR TS IWA      Working draft s   AWI, AWI Amd TR TS, WD, WD Amd TR TS      Committee draft s   CD, CD Amd Cor TR TS, PDAmd  PDAM , PDTR, PDTS          Enquiry draft  DIS, FCD, FPDAmd, DAmd  DAM , FPDISP, DTR, DTS    Final draft International Standard  FDIS, FDAmd  FDAM , PRF, PRF  Amd TTA TR TS Suppl, FDTR        International Standard  ISO TR, TS, IWA, Amd, Cor    Many web standards are open standards, meaning that the development has been open to  individual contributors; they are publicly available, and certain copyright licenses might apply.   The Variety of Rendering Engines  Web documents and files associated with style sheet files, script files, images, and XML files are  processed and displayed  that is, rendered  or printed by rendering engines  layout engines . They are  usually embedded in web browsers and e-mail clients.   Although the statistics of usage share of web browsers [64, 65, 66, 67, and so on] are either   overestimated or underestimated, and thus generally not accurate, one thing is certain: no user agent  can be claimed as “the most popular” or the “most widely used” one. Consequently, browser  independence is more important than ever. Because of the differences in rendering and standards  support, the features of rendering engines should be considered in web site development for the sake of  interoperability and functionality.   No browser is perfect from the standards point of view. All have some problems with markup, styles,  ECMAScript, or accessibility. However, most browser developers realized that standards support should  be boosted; otherwise, they cannot compete with others.   From a web developer’s point of view, it is a rather complex task to achieve a similar  and not pixel-  by-pixel identical  appearance in various browsers. Because of different functioning and features,  various browsers might render even standard-compliant web sites differently. In practice, various tricks  and hacks are used to address the problem. However, these should be eliminated whenever possible.  In contrast to Internet Explorer  IE , updates of other browsers are released frequently, and this is   how they provide new features prior to IE  Figure 1-1 . Anti-IE developers often overlook this simple fact.      13    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS      Figure 1-1. Browser updates provide new features such as advanced support of the latest standards.   Supporting SVG can serve as a good example. The specification was published in 1999, and no one   cared for it until the growing popularity of HTML5, which natively supports the format. Browsers such as  Firefox, Opera, or Safari have adopted the standard lately, although before IE. However, this is not a big  achievement because none of them supported SVG for many years. In the early 2000s, one  if not the  only one  that did was Amaya. Until recently, most people used the Adobe SVG Viewer plug-in to display  SVG images in their browsers.   The implementation of elements and attributes does not necessarily mean proper, full support for a   markup language. For example, some browser vendors claimed for years that their product supported  MathML; however, MathML could not be rendered in many cases because of the lack of support for  embedding mechanisms and external files. Even the appropriate MIME type was missing from the  implementation.   Standards support, especially of CSS, has been incorrect and or incomplete in most browsers for   years. Moreover, the latest version of CSS, CSS3, was introduced before the previous one, CSS 2.1, could  have gained complete support in browsers.   Trident  Used by Internet Explorer  since version 4  and IE shells, Outlook Express, Maxthon, and various media  players, Trident is one of the most widely used rendering engines. Windows Internet Explorer  formerly  Microsoft Internet Explorer  is a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft. IE has been  implemented in the Microsoft Windows operating systems since 1995.   14    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Although Internet Explorer has been continuously improved in each version, even the most   important standards, that is, the ones that describe the markup and style sheets, are implemented in an  incomplete fashion. The limited standards support, incorrect floating positions, the expanding box  problem, and especially the implementation of the individual box model of Internet Explorer 6, have  caused serious problems in web design for years.   The standard-compliant mode was introduced in version 6; however, it did not solve the problem.  Even some of the well-known HTML 4.01 elements  for example, abbr  were not supported prior to IE8.  Several DHTML objects did not comply with standards. When web pages are rendered in IE8 mode,  however, the methods and attributes updated in IE8 might cause problems with web sites that expect  the rendering functionality of earlier IE versions [68].   For years Trident has supported HTML 4.01, XML 1.0, XSLT 1.0, and DOM Level 1 with minor   implementation gaps. CSS Level 2 and DOM Level 2 have been provided with major implementation  gaps and conformance issues. The CSS support in Windows Internet Explorer has constantly been  evolving. Internet Explorer 6 was the first version with full CSS Level 1 compliance. However, some  selectors such as min-height were missing. Internet Explorer 8 is the first IE version with nearly complete  CSS 2.1 and partial CSS3 support. It is important to keep in mind that the CSS features introduced in  Internet Explorer 8 will work only if the web pages are rendered in IE8 mode  or higher . This can be  ensured by adding the meta tag described in Listing 1-1 to the head section of web pages.   Listing 1-1. Version Targeting for Internet Explorer 8  Should not Be Used        However, avoiding version targeting is strongly recommended, as mentioned earlier.  Since Trident version 4  used by IE8 , a built-in RSS Atom news feed reader is also available through   a dedicated button with the RSS logo in gray, which changes to orange after activation  if applicable .   Microsoft recently recognized the importance of standards support and is beginning to take it   seriously. First, Microsoft became an active participant in standards development in the CSS3 and SVG  Working Groups at W3C. Second, it is a co-chair of the HTML5 Working Group and a leader in the  HTML5 Testing Task Force.   Trident 5 applied in Internet Explorer 9 introduced support for modern web standards, including   HTML5, CSS3, ECMAScript5, DOM Levels 2 and 3, ICC Color Profiles, and SVG [69]. In contrast to earlier  versions that can render only “HTML-compatible” XHTML documents served incorrectly with the  text html MIME-type, Trident 5 provides full XHTML support.   Gecko  Firefox, Camino, the Mozilla Application Suite, Netscape, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, and other software  apply the rendering engine Gecko  originally NGLayout  [70]. Netscape released the first version in 1997.  In 1998, the Mozilla project was launched, and the source code was released under an open source  license. Gecko is now developed by the Mozilla Foundation Corporation. It is written in C++6 as a cross- platform layout engine under three licenses: Mozilla Public License  MPL , GNU General Public License   GPL , and GNU Lesser General Public License  LGPL .   Gecko was originally designed to support web standards and is constantly improving. Beyond   conventional standards such as markup, CSS, JavaScript, ECMAScript 3 and 5, DOM Levels 1 2 3, and  XML 1.0; less commonly used standards such as MathML, RDF, XSLT, XPath, and SVG; and Animated  PNG  APNG  images with alpha transparency are also supported. Firefox, which applies Gecko, supports                                                     6 The Mozilla Firefox browser has parts written in C C++, JavaScript, CSS, XUL, and XBL.   15    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   not only W3C Recommendations but also proposals and standards from other standardization bodies,  such as WHATWG.   To provide wide interoperability, Gecko supports DOCTYPE switching, which makes it possible to   render correctly nonstandard web sites designed for older browsers and their variants  such as Netscape  Communicator 4.x . Nonstandard Internet Explorer features such as the incorrect implementation of the  document.all property or the marquee element are also supported to some extent. The Quirks Mode of  Firefox is not perfect, but it’s similar to other browsers.   Firefox also provides the Google protocol Safebrowsing to improve the security of data exchange.  Firefox does not support ActiveX controls by default. Although third-party plug-ins are available,   they do not work safely in all versions or on all platforms.   KHTML  KHTML is the layout engine used by Konqueror. It supports HTML 4.01 and partially supports HTML 5.  Both screen and paged media support is provided for CSS 2.1. Beyond the full implementation of CSS 3  selectors  from KDE 3.5.6 [71] , KHTML supports other CSS3 features, for example, multiple  backgrounds, box-sizing, and text-shadow. KHTML supports DOM 1 and 2 fully and DOM 3 partially.  ECMA-262  JavaScript 1.5  can be used in KHTML, along with the graphic formats PNG, MNG, JPEG,  GIF, and SVG  partial support .   WebKit  The forked  adopted  version of KHTML is the open source WebKit layout engine. The most well-known  browsers that use WebKit are Apple Safari and Google Chrome. However, there are other browsers that  apply WebKit, for example, Arora, Midori, OmniWeb, Shiira, iCab  4+ , Epiphany, SRWare Iron, and  Maxthon  3+ . WebKit is used on several mobile devices such as the Apple iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch,  as well as the browser on Android, Palm webOS, and Symbian S60. The desktop version of Safari is  available for Mac and Windows computers.   Being one of the first implementers of the latest standards  which have also been proved by the   Acid2 and Acid3 tests , Safari has always been considered as one of the most innovative web browsers.  Safari 5, for example, supports not only HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 but also several features of HTML5  such as Media Support, full-screen playback for the video element, canvas, Geolocation, structuring  elements, Ajax history, the draggable attribute, forms validation, the sandbox attribute, and Ruby  annotation. Safari 5 handles CSS animations, CSS effects, and Web Fonts. Moreover, it provides  JavaScript support  ECMAScript 262 version 3 , JSON, XML 1.0, and SVG 1.1. Advanced accessibility  features are also provided in Safari 5 such as VoiceOver Screen Reader, ARIA Support, enhanced  keyboard navigation, full-page zoom, content zoom, closed captions for HTML5 video, custom style  sheets, and minimum font size. It also has a built-in news feed reader [72].   The first version of the other popular browser that use the WebKit rendering engine, Google   Chrome, passed the Acid1 and Acid2 tests. Chrome passes the Acid3 test from version 4. Chrome is a  leader in HTML5 implementation, which is constantly evolving because of the continuing development  of the HTML5 specifications. Chrome also provides an impressive CSS3 selector support and fast  JavaScript execution.   Presto  Presto is the rendering engine used primarily by the Opera Desktop browser  from version 7 , the Opera  Devices SDK, and the Opera Mobile and Mini variants. Opera is used as the basis for other browsers such  as Nintendo DS and DSi, Nokia 770, and Wii Internet Channel, as well as the browser for Sony Mylo  COM-1.   16    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Similar to the developer of Trident  Microsoft , the developer of Presto, Opera Software, is a W3C   member [73]. As a consequence, Opera has a high level of standard support. Opera 11, for example,  supports HTML5 elements such as video, audio, web forms, contentEditable, and the input attribute or  the input type. CSS 2.1 and CSS3 selectors have been completely implemented, along with SVG, SMIL,  and canvas. Web Workers, Geolocation, Selectors API, Touch Events, the Viewport meta element, and  other technologies and standards are also available in Presto [74].   Amaya  Unlike other browsers that are typically used exclusively to display web documents, Amaya is a free,  open source web browser and a WYSIWYG web developer environment in one. Managed by W3C,  Amaya supports HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, XHTML Basic, XHTML 1.1, HTTP 1.1, MathML 2.0, CSS2   partially , and SVG [75]. Distributions are available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.   Testing the Standard Support of Browsers  Web browsers can be tested from two different aspects: supported standards and supported  technologies. The development of browser tests depends on the approach and aim.   Automatic layout tests are difficult to perform on mobile devices. Typically, layout tests apply a   screenshot-based approach that compares a screenshot to a reference.   An imperative feature should be a test format that can be run on as many platforms and browsers as   possible. For example, the browser tests developed by Mozilla are not cross-browser tests.   Two different versions of the same web page supposed to result in exactly the same rendering can  be compared using ref-tests [76]. Mozilla also provides an automated testing framework using MochiKit  JavaScript libraries [77]. The test applies JavaScript function calls. These browser-specific tests cannot be  used for general browser comparisons.   The World Wide Web Consortium provides HTML tests [78], CSS test suites [79], mobile tests [80], a   MathML test suite [81], SVG test suites [82], and internationalization tests [83]. W3C is open to  contributions as well [84].   Most browser tests require human evaluation to identify bugs with full certainty. Incomplete or   incorrect standard support is usually tested with complex tests, many of which are public.   Standard Compliance Tests  The most well-known browser tests for standard compliance are the Acid tests. This name refers to the  acid tests used for gold assessment. Instead of gold purity, however, these Acid tests provide a fast and  easy-to-understand indication of the standard compliance of rendering engines. In spite of that, the Acid  tests have always been criticized for testing a set of rarely used features, along with those without a  finalized specification.   The first version of the Acid test, Acid1, was written in HTML 4.0 Strict in late 1998 to check  interoperability issues between earlier web browsers. Acid1 tests several features with stress on  compliance with the CSS1 specification on a page against a reference image [85]. According to the  document title, Acid1 is a “display box float clear test.”   Acid2 is a test page published by the Web Standards Project in 2005. Again, a reference image is   provided that should be compared with the rendered version. Note that the nose should change to blue  when the mouse hovers over the face [86]. Beyond this hovering effect, Acid2 tests the paint order, the  object element, data URIs, alpha transparency of PNG images, and several CSS features  absolute,  relative, and fixed positioning, the CSS box model, CSS table formatting, CSS generated content, and CSS   17    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   parsing . Safari was the first among the widely used browsers that passed Acid2 in late 2005. Others  followed two to three years later. For example, Firefox passed the test from version 3.0.   Acid3 has been launched in 2008. The 100 subtests grouped in 6 “buckets” cover various parts of the   following standards: data URI scheme, HTTP 1.1 Protocol, HTTP status codes, Unicode 5.0 UTF-8 and  UTF-16, the image png and text plain content types, the HTML 4.0 Transitional, HTML 4.01 Strict, and  XHTML 1.0 Strict markup languages, DOM Level 2  Core, HTML, Events, Style, Views, Traversal, Range ,  the object element, ECMAScript  including garbage collection , CSS selectors, SVG 1.1  including fonts ,  and SMIL 2.1. Not only those browsers fail the test that cannot achieve the score 100 100, but also the  ones that cannot render the animation smoothly or render it differently than what is presented in the  reference  Figure 1-2 [87] .   Figure 1-2. The Acid3 test in a browser that failed to pass      The following were the first stable, public browser releases that passed the Acid3 test:   Epiphany 2.28.0 [91]      Apple Safari 4.0  the very first web browser to pass Acid3 [88]      Opera 10.6 [89]     Google Chrome 4.0.249.78 [90]              Bolt browser7 1.6 [92]     Opera Mobile7 9.7 [93]   Iris Browser7 1.1.4   iPhone7 3.1                                                     7 Mobile browsers   18    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Comprehensive Tests  There are several other considerations in rendering engines beyond standard compliance, for example,  security or CSS Selectors API94 support.   Layout tests, Mochi tests, and RefTests can be performed by BrowserTests, a repository of browser   test cases and test suites [95].   A comprehensive comparison and evaluation of overall browser functionality are provided by   BrowserScope. It is a “community-driven project for profiling Web browsers” [96]. The site provides up- to-date information on recent tests performed on the latest browser versions. Browsers can be  compared, and tests can be run on the browser used for rendering the site.   Standards vs. Quirks Modes, DOCTYPE Switching  Standard-compliance problems of web browsers are not recent. The situation has been constantly  improved, however. After partially supporting the W3C Recommendations, browser users and web site  developers faced a serious problem. Millions of web sites developed earlier for older browsers looked  fine in obsolete rendering engines but had serious issues in the latest ones. In other words, compliance  with W3C Recommendations became a problem.   Todd Fahrner from the Web Standards Project invented the solution known as DOCTYPE switching in   1998 [97]. Older, nonstandard documents with a missing DOCTYPE might produce different results in  various rendering engines. Modern browsers check the DOCTYPE, and if the expected behavior follows  W3C standards, the document is rendered in Standards Mode  Strict Mode . If the Document Type  Definition is missing, browsers switch to a mode known as Quirks Mode [98] that can deal with the  nonstandard, unexpected behavior of older browsers  Figure 1-3 .   Figure 1-3. W3C test file in Standards Mode [99] and Quirks Mode [100]   19    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   One of the most famous browser bugs was the Internet Explorer box model bug that made identical  pixel-by-pixel rendering in various browsers impossible. It occurred as its own implementation of a box  model instead of the W3C CSS box model [101] in earlier versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer.  Some  web developers, however, think that the box model implemented in IE5 was more logical than that of  W3C’s [102]; still, it was not standard.  IE6 and newer versions eliminate the problem in Standards  Mode. For the sake of compatibility, however, the bug is still present in Quirks Mode.  Internet Explorer  for Mac, which was discontinued in 2006, was not affected.  According to the W3C CSS1 specification,  released in 1996  revised later several times , determining the width and height attributes of all block- level elements should affect the width and height of visible elements only while the padding, borders,  and margins should be applied later. Internet Explorer 5 wrapped the content, padding, and borders  within a predetermined width height. As a result, the rendering box was different from what was  expected. The box model is present in newer versions of the Cascading Style Sheets specification too,  including CSS 2.1 [103] and CSS3 [104].   Standard-compliant web pages can be opened faster since browsers can use Standards Mode   instead of figuring out nonstandard markup in Quirks Mode.   Modern browsers render all pages providing a DOCTYPE in Standards Mode, whether they are served   with or without an XML declaration. However, Internet Explorer 6 renders all pages in Quirks Mode if  anything other than a byte-order mark appears before the DOCTYPE declaration.      Problem Statement  Most people think that web standardization is a well-regulated, exact process. In fact, there is no clear  set of rules to follow. Those who are slightly familiar with web standards might believe that the World  Wide Web Consortium provides standards for the Web. Although W3C develops web technologies for  markup, annotation, styles, and so on, that will sooner or later obtain an official mandate, their  implementation is an expectation only. Because of the lack of official status, these developments are  recommendations instead of standards. Unlike the standards announced by standardization  organizations, for example, the ISO, web recommendations are applied rather seldom because of the  lack of an official status [105]. Individual vendors and web site developers might decide to follow some of  the recommendations, but there is no enforcement. This is definitely not the way they should be treated.  Efforts should be made to make the recommendations widely adopted; in fact, 99.9 percent of web sites  are obsolete from the technology point of view [106]. The situation is not much better in standardization  either: a large share of web sites provide invalid code.   A comprehensive validation test series was conducted in 2011 on the 350 most popular web sites in   the world  selected by Alexa index8 [107] . The test found 94 percent of those web sites failed the web  standards validation tests that covered character encoding, markup, and styles.   There is no reason at all to apply 13 different character encodings, namely, UTF-8, ISO-8859-1,   GB2312, Shift_JIS, GBK, Windows 1251, EUC-JP, Windows 1256, ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-7,  ISO-8859-9, and Windows 874. The same holds for markup languages. Nine  X HTML versions and  variants have been identified. At the time of the test, 14 percent of web sites had applied HTML5 before  the specification had been finalized, 23 percent used the obsolete HTML 4.01 Transitional, 45 percent  the XHTML 1.0 Transitional, 8 percent the XHTML 1.0 Strict, 5 percent the HTML 4.01 Strict, and 5  percent other languages such as HTML 4.0 Transitional, HTML 4.0 Strict, and XHTML 1.1  Figure 1-4 .  Although two versions, XHTML 1.0 Strict and HTML5, can be considered modern markup languages,  they are applied incorrectly: the markup is full of errors in most cases. This situation is clearly indicated  by the average number of markup errors, which was 6. The number of style sheet errors was even higher,  with an incredible high maximum of 738 errors  !  in a single CSS file. The average number of CSS errors                                                   8 Naturally, the list of web sites changes constantly, but it does not have any impact on the conclusion.   20    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   was 45. And these numbers represent the index files only; a similar order of magnitude can be expected  for all other pages as well.   Figure 1-4. Share of character encodings and markup languages      Evidently, not all content authors are web developers, and the share of Web standardistas is even   lower. The majority of web content authors do not even know the underlying technologies and  standards, not to mention their application. Expectations do not force people to implement web  technologies and standards correctly. The lack of consensus makes the Web chaotic. Compared to  programming languages such as C, the Web is a very error-tolerant environment. This feature makes it  possible for millions to create web pages without proper knowledge, but at the same time this is the  reason for the incorrect markup Internet users face every day [108].   Companies desire a professional appearance to sell their products and often focus on design and   marketing exclusively. In most cases, designers know little if anything about web standardization.  Everyone should know at least the potential inherent in web standards.   Inadequate and incomplete standard implementations of web browsers also contribute to the   problem of standardization and recommendations. Then again, even standardized web sites might look  inadequate in browsers that are created with the lack of full standard support. Reasonable rendering can  be expected only if standards are followed on both the user agents’ and the web developers’ sites.   Web publishing is often oversimplified, and only a very limited number of developers become hand   coders, which is a major key to standardized web development. Since content authors need content  management via graphical interfaces and dynamic content, proper standards implementations in  authoring tools could also contribute to web standardization significantly. However, standards  compliance has not been a major concern in content management systems and bloggers until recently.   After a certain point, web documents full of errors should not and cannot be tolerated. Such   documents contain several improperly nested elements, malformed tags, and other errors often referred  to as tag soup. Tables should be used for organizing data, not for layout or design. Missing tags should  not be tolerated. Bad markup extends download time, not to mention rendering time. Efficiency can be  boosted by reduced markup. It is evident that source code full of errors is much more complicated to  render than error-free, standard code. Accessibility can also be increased, along with cross-browser  compatibility and forward compatibility.   Server-Side Technologies and Content Management  Server-side technologies, such as PHP, ASP, or Ruby on Rails, are popular because of their powerful  assistance in creating dynamic web sites.   21    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Although server-side technologies and content management systems provide more dynamic web  sites than static markup, they generally come with a lack of structure and semantics that would make  web sites work better [109]. Thus, the most advanced, standard, accessible markup that also provides  semantic content can still be generated manually. However, a slight improvement is noticeable in this  area. The popular open source content management system Drupal, for example, supports some  standards, such as semantic annotations with RDFa9 [110].   Limited Standards Support in Development Tools  Nonprofessional authors using WYSIWYG software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, produce a large share  of web sites. Until recently, many of them provided nonstandard output. Modern versions of web  development authoring tools support W3C standards. The same is true for open source environments  providing dynamic content such as social networking sites, blog portals, and so on.   Still, these software tools are responsible for billions of web sites published on the Net without   considering standard compliance. In most cases, complex web sites differ from the ones that are stored  in the templates of authoring environments. To achieve this, users often try to modify or extend some  parts of the source code, also leading to nonstandard code.   The standard compliance of markup and styles provided by WYSIWYG authoring tools is extremely   important because of the large number of authors applying them. However, many aspects of  standardization cannot be used fully without understanding the source code.   Major Concerns  Similar to documents, books, or movies, perfect web sites that meet every criteria and all user  requirements cannot be created—what’s suitable for one audience might not be for another, and even if  you try to adhere absolutely to every standard published, you will find that certain standards cannot be  used in combination with others. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t strive to adhere to the most  important standards. Several features contribute to a certain level of quality assurance. Most of them are  basic requirements for standard compliance and lead to proper development practices. Moreover, they  provide adequate and more expectable functionality and behavior, usability, and stability, as well as  faster downloading and rendering.   Bad Practices  While proper coding practice is widely applied in programming, web developers and people without  proper background do not take markup practices seriously. “It also works this way—why bother with  standard compliance?” This is the approach serious web developers would be best to forget. Bad markup  including, but not limited to, browser-specific code fragments, heavily nested table layouts, structure  mixed with layout, locally applied style attributes, attribute minimization, missing attribute values, and  other anomalies significantly increase code length, complexity, download, and rendering time.   Lack of Support  Web standards support is not adequate. There are no ultimate practical guidelines on web standards for  the less experienced. Although free access is provided to standard specifications, most people find them  too difficult to understand and apply in practice.                                                     9 From version 7   22    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Where standard compliance is an official requirement, such as on government portals or EU project   web sites, the best solution is to hire web standardistas to develop suitable web sites. Many web  designers are not really interested in markup or style sheets. Their only concern is appearance; for  example, with creative Flash animations, the focus is usually fully on the SWF itself, and very little  thought is given to how it is to be embedded in the web page. Company leaders focus mainly on the  content. It is extremely difficult for people to realize that standard compliance could be the solution for  many of their problems, such as browser-dependent web pages, incorrect rendering, or poor  functionality.   Unconcern  One of the major problems with web standards is that free access to them is not sufficient to convince  people to use them. Standard implementations of authoring tools are limited, and the web sites  produced by them seldom follow standards. Standard support of web browsers is partial only, although  they are constantly evolving.   Many people “develop” web sites without a proper IT background. For some it is just a hobby; for   others it is profit source. Unless the importance of web standards is emphasized by the most influential  companies throughout the world, they will not catch on. On the other hand, some developers do not  even know these technologies. The trends are forced by business and marketing to achieve popularity or  to fulfill business requirements. For example, because of the lack of support for Flash on Apple iPhone,  early HTML5 implementations appeared that applied unfinished specifications but at the same time  expedited standards evolution and application. Everyone interested in web site design development,  whether a professional or not, should become familiar with web standards, because they are vital in web  development and worth learning  instead of copying bad practices from others .   Without several years of expertise, no one can understand the choices. Which markup language is  the most modern one? It is not possible to answer the question without knowing HTML, XHTML, XML,  the Semantic Web, and the maturity levels of web standards.   Fortunately, there is a recent trend to apply web standards more frequently; however, this trend is  far from worldwide use. There are very few hand coders, and only some of them develop web sites the  standard way. Thus, there is a potential in content management systems to help web developers comply  with standards. If they could reliably generate standard-compliant markup, it would be ensured by  default. Most advanced markup codes are written by hand coders; however, they should take the  responsibility of standards compliance completely by themselves. Even if there are many useful tools  that might help them, hand coders cannot rely on automatic error checking  see Chapter 11 . Since web  standardistas manipulate not only the content but also the entire markup and style sheets character by  character, along with all files of a web site, they should ensure standard compliance through frequent  revision and tests.   Influential Sites  Developers often have the logical idea to follow the practices of the most popular and widely used web  sites in the world. However, these web sites cannot serve as references in standardization simply  because they often have serious problems with standard compliance.   It might be even more disappointing that top web designers also make serious mistakes. Believe it or   not, the personal web sites of the most famous web standardistas in the world might also suffer from  markup errors. Most of them are also afraid to provide W3C conformance icons on their pages linking to  W3C validators.   It might be a good starting point to find modern web sites that are also standard-compliant at the  same time. However, it can be very confusing for beginner standardistas. Evidently, it is impossible to  fulfill all user requirements, but web sites that focus on standards adherence and are labeled with the   23    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   logo “Valid XHTML” or “Valid CSS” often come with a lack of design and exhibit limited use of  technologies. Good examples are the web sites of web standardization bodies or web accessibility  designers. Even if the source code is valid and free of errors, the code often has other issues. Expected  components such as news feeds or favorites icons  favicons  are missing, semantic markup is not  present, and so on. These features do not affect the validity of such web documents, which cannot be  used exclusively as starting points for developing modern, standard-compliant web sites. Not only  personal web sites and blogs but also precise technical documents can be presented beautifully.  Remember, web standardization is not a sacrifice! Some of the largest and most popular web sites in the  world apply standards successfully.   But not all. Take a closer look at a code fragment from one of the largest web sites in the world    Listing 1-2 .   Listing 1-2. High-Traffic Web Sites Do Not Necessarily Apply Standard Code      <input type="hidden" id="post_form_id" name="post_form_id"  value="b053066a05f482d5739d31c033b5fd90" autocomplete="off"  ><div  id="pagelet_presence"> <div id="FB_HiddenContainer" style="position:absolute; top:- 10000px; width:0px; height:0px;" >   <div  id="globalContainer">   <div  class="ptm clearfix" id="pageHead">    Evidently, this is a software-generated markup, and even the most experienced hand-coder web  standardista could hardly interpret such codes. There are problems with virtually every element and  attribute. The class attribute has an empty value. Identifiers are unreasonably long and not descriptive  at all, such as c4d06220d5f2c97d20912236. There is inline style in the source, which should be in an  external style sheet. Obviously, the layer positioning with -10.000 pixels is a trick  probably used for a  technique such as image replacement  that could be eliminated by proper implementation of standards.  Empty attributes should be eliminated, especially if they are intended to be used for identification  a  class without a name cannot be used to identify an element class . Even for these few lines, the error list  is long.   The Popularity of Flash  Design is one of the major concerns in web site production. Adobe Flash is an ideal technology to  provide a stunning appearance and catch attention. Full Flash sites, however, have several  disadvantages. Unless the web document is a single-page, brochure-style home page that provides  contact data, it is far better to develop  X HTML content, because textual markup has several benefits  over binary files. It is especially true with the exploitation of the new, interactive HTML5 elements and  CSS3 properties, which are good alternatives for Flash content.   Graphic designers are not necessarily web developers. As a consequence, Flash movies are often  embedded incorrectly. Although Flash files can theoretically work in any browser with an appropriate  plug-in, markup codes controlling them can be browser-dependent, which should be eliminated.   There is nothing wrong with Flash, but it is probably better used for headers and inline animations  only. The combination of XHTML and CSS can provide a similar, if not more advanced, user experience,  but without the need to download large files in full before showing the content of the index page. While  it is not a problem for fast connections, there are millions of users around the world who might wait for  half a minute to download such content. Even if the Flash files are streamed in certain browsers, the  menus and content are unusable until downloading is completed. Furthermore, they can be  indexed searched more effectively, are smaller in size, and have full control over the browser window by  default. Text content is much more robust to render than any other format. Even if some images fail to   24    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   download or there are some styling problems, the content is still there  if not absolutely positioned  outside the window or written in the color identical to the background . Unlike that of Flash contents,10   X HTML text sharpness, font size, and other features can be changed upon user request directly from  the browser.   Some software companies recognized the advantages of markup languages over Flash and released   tools to convert Flash files to HTML  for example, FlashKeeper [111] . Even Adobe has an FLA-HTML  converter called Wallaby [112]. However, similar to other automated markup generators, extended care  must be taken with them because the result is often invalid and, therefore, not optimal.   Well-formedness  A basic requirement for XML documents and a desired one for all web documents is well-formedness. It  is vital in standardization, because it guarantees that the list of syntax rules defined in the corresponding  specifications are satisfied.   To achieve well-formedness in SGML languages such as HTML, elements should be opened and   closed properly. Empty elements must also be terminated. Elements should be nested properly so that  overlapping does not occur. The root element of the document should contain all other elements.  Since SGML parsers are extremely error-tolerant, these rules are rarely followed completely by   HTML developers, which results in markup errors. Thus, the lack of well-formedness leads directly to  incorrect, nonstandard markup.   In XML languages such as XHTML, well-formedness has additional requirements. The element tags   are case sensitive; that is, start and end tags must match exactly. Well-formed XML documents should  contain properly encoded and legal Unicode characters only. These characters, however, can also be  used directly in element names and attributes, not just in character data  document text . Characters  with special meaning in XML can be used for markup instructions only, for example,  , or &. If they are  intended to be represented as text, their entity codes should be applied  see the section “Entity  references” .   Characters that go against well-formedness rules can cause certain XML parsers to be unable to  process XML files  XHTML documents, RDF metadata, RSS feed channels, and so on . Such special  characters might also result in error messages. A single  not well-formed  character can make the whole  file impossible to process. For example, the XML file of a valid RSS feed opened locally in Internet  Explorer 8 is presented as a tree structure. The same file retrieved from a server is represented as a news  feed. If the file, however, contains one illegal character, IE8 gives the error message The XML page cannot  be displayed. Similar error messages exist in all browsers  Figure 1-5 .                                                        10 Although there are advanced font manipulation possibilities in Flash Player from version 10, too.   25    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS      Figure 1-5. An XML parsing error in Opera   Interoperability  There is an endless variety of platforms, operating systems, and browsers available on the market. Every  manufacturer and developer tries to provide additional features; thus, products are constantly  competing with each other. This diversity results in different operations and functionalities. The  functionality and behavior of web sites across the different systems are not guaranteed by default but  can be achieved by the proper application of the latest standards. Naturally, users want to apply various  systems in a combination that allows communication with each other and that exchanges data  adequately. Data access cannot be restricted, and implementation-specific solutions should be avoided.   Web interoperability ensures that standard-compliant web pages can be viewed in any browser   under various operating systems, from Windows to Mac OS and Linux, and not only on desktop  computers but also on mobile devices, including tablet PCs and smartphones such as the Samsung  Galaxy Tab, the Apple iPhone, or the HTC Sensation.   Several technologies support interoperability and should be used in web development, including,  but not limited to, UTF-8 character encoding, XML documents, structural and semantic markup with  XHTML or HTML5 [113], DOM scripting, ECMAScript, CSS-based layout, separated structure,  presentation and behavior, equations described in MathML, and semantic metadata.   Browser Independence  “One page, many views” has always been a nightmare for web developers. Although it is a natural  expectation from users for all web sites to look and behave the same way in various browsers, it is far  from straightforward to fulfill.   26    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Anyone  who  slaps  a  “this  page  is  best  viewed  with  Browser  X”  label  on  a  Web  page  appears to be yearning for the bad old days, before the Web, when you had very little  chance of reading a document written on another computer, another word processor,  or another network.   —Tim Berners-Lee [114]   Nowadays the freedom of browser choice is more real than ever. People use a wide variety of   software for browsing the Internet. However, the majority uses only a few browsers, namely, Internet  Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari. Hence, focusing on these flagships is  sufficient in most cases. The four major rendering engines behind these desktop browsers—Trident,  Gecko, Presto, and WebKit—are also used in mobile browsing  Internet Explorer Mobile, Firefox for  mobile, Opera Mobile, and Safari . WebKit is also used by a variety of other mobile browsers  Android  Browser, BlackBerry Browser, Iris Browser, Myriad Browser, Nokia Series 40 and Series 60 browsers,  Obigo Browser, Polaris Browser, Skyfire Mobile Browser, and HP webOS Browser . In the mobile  browsing scene, NetFront is also worth mentioning; it is used by Kindle Basic Web, NetFront, and the  Sony PlayStation Portable Web Browser. Statistics show that only very few visitors use browsers powered  by other rendering engines.   No one wants to drive potential customers away, so it is very important to avoid browser-specific   web site development. Probably the best solution is to create pages that are best viewed with any  browser. Sometimes this web site feature is also indicated clearly by a logo of the “Viewable with any  browser” campaign [115].   The major problem for developers creating web sites to be identical in all browsers is that various   tricks need to be applied in many cases to ensure functionality. However, these codes do not work under  all browsers, so more and more different hacks have to be added for different browsers  and older  versions of those browsers , resulting in a mass of extra code. The only option is to create standard- based web sites. Even if some standards are not completely supported by today’s browsers  which is  actually a headache for developers , these codes are at least ready for the future [116]. Moreover, they  serve as excellent starting points for development.   A very bad practice associated with the problem of the different rendering behavior of browsers is   code forking. Code forking is the development of multiple versions of the same content for various  browsers. Code forking should not be applied because the resulting code cannot be used in the long  term.   Web standardistas also agree that web sites cannot be expected to look exactly the same way in  every browser, but the information published on web pages should be legible and all functionalities  should be available in all major browsers [117, 118].   Eliminated Version Targeting  Since rendering engines are constantly evolving, even the various versions of the same browser support  standards differently. To avoid losing users and potential customers who use older browser versions,  web developers often apply various browser- and version-specific solutions in the markup or style  sheets. In other words, version targeting means a considerable amount of additional work for developers,  and the result works only in a certain version of a certain browser.   Furthermore, because of the improved standard support of current browser versions, these codes   are actually threats to either functionality or code optimality, or both. Thus, version targeting should be  eliminated, which, on the other hand, can cause problems with backward compatibility [119]. Although  there are some techniques that can be used together with standard compliance to maximize version   27    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   independence  for example, resetting the style sheets of the browser , creating web pages that work  properly under all browsers and browser versions is unfeasible.   Standard-compliant web development should be adequate, and browsers ought to have full   standard compliance by now. However, this is still not the case.   Browsers to be used for rendering version targeted web documents can be easily defined by a simple   meta declaration in the document head  Listing 1-3 .   Listing 1-3. Version Targeting Example  Should Not Be Used        The most up-to-date Internet Explorer version can be targeted by adding the IE=edge attribute value   to the content attribute of the meta element [120]  Listing 1-4 .   Listing 1-4. Version Targeting for the Latest IE Version  Should Not Be Used        Although targeted browsers might decide more quickly between old, backward-compatible and  new, standard-compliant rendering modes when such data are provided, version targeting should be  totally eliminated. Creating multiple versions of nonstandard markup for the same web page is not only  costly but also unsustainable. Moreover, version targeting and browser detection scripts are not reliable  and cannot target the correct browsers in many cases, because browsers often identify themselves as  other browsers or other versions of the same browser.   Backward Compatibility  Standard-compliant web sites that work well under the currently used browser versions are also ready  for the future but might be rendered incorrectly in older browsers because of the incorrect standards  implementations of their rendering engines. Consequently, even with proper implementation, web  standards do not work under all browsers. The support for old rendering engines, backward  compatibility, should be within reasonable limits. Why bother with browsers that are no longer in use or  the “very old” versions of major browsers? Netscape, for example, is “not widely used anymore” just like  Internet Explorer 1.0 or Mozilla Firefox 0.9. The major problem with this question is how to define  browser obsoletion. Can IE5.5 be labeled as “very old” and IE6 as “old”? The choice of supported  browsers has a large impact on the traffic and popularity of a web site, and the lack of support for older— even obsolete—browsers can lead to loss of visitors. In fact, there is no ultimate decision regarding  backward compatibility.    One of the biggest agonies regarding backward compatibility is the support for IE6. Its market share   decreased slowly up to 2007 when it lost its popularity considerably, probably because of the new  versions of Windows, Vista, and later Windows 7, and their new Explorer versions, 7, and later versions 8,  9, and 10,11 as well as the growing popularity of competitors such as Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and  Google Chrome. Upgraders have taken several major concerns into account. First, serious security holes  have been pointed out during the years that have been partially covered by later patches. However,  thanks to growing needs, new functions have been introduced in other browsers and in Internet  Explorer overtaking the market. All modern browsers support XML technologies, RSS feeds, and tabbed  browsing, for example. IE8 and especially IE9 were big steps toward standard compliance and modern  functions. Even Microsoft has recommended IE6 users to upgrade [121, 122]. Software giants like Google                                                    11 Internet Explorer 6 was shipped with Windows XP. Versions 7 and 8 can be used on XP, too, while IE9  requires Windows Vista or Windows 7. IE10 will run exclusively under Windows 7.   28    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   have started to reduce support for older browsers, which is another reason to do so [123]. Last but not  least, it will be a great relief for developers when users stop using Internet Explorer 6.    The major drawback of backward compatibility is that it hinders the widespread use of new   technologies at some point. Still, web standardistas should maximize backward compatibility whenever  possible. Satisfied users cannot be pushed to upgrade their browsers every time a new version is  released.    Because of the incomplete or deficient standard support of older browsers, backward compatibility   is often equal to the application of browser-targeted hacks and code fragments, as well as to  nonstandard and even deprecated markup that should be eliminated. A useful tool to achieve or  maximize backward compatibility is the JavaScript library “Modernizr,” which detects browser support  for the latest web standards, such as HTML5 or CSS3 modules [124]. This software determines whether a  currently used browser has implemented a given feature, which makes it possible for developers to  apply new features in the browsers that support them and create a fallback mechanism for those  browsers that do not.   Forward Compatibility  While a new browser release can be a problem for developers of nonstandard and especially browser- specific web sites, web standardistas do not have to worry. Forward compatibility accompanies standard  compliance. Standardized web documents can be easily turned into newer ones that apply the most up- to-date markup language, style sheet, and other technologies.   Functionality  Beyond content, functionality is one of the most important web site features. Without it, all other efforts  would be useless, including even popular design.   Standards should be supported on both the developers’ and browsers’ sides. For web standardistas,   development the standard way often seems like some kind of sacrifice. For example, certain CSS  selectors, which can be used for various web site features, are not supported by some rendering engines   generally either Trident or Gecko . In such cases, the developer should make a decision: either follow  the guidelines of recommendations and standards and do not support some browsers  which cannot be  tolerated  or provide nonstandard, fully functional code. It is unfortunate that developers sometimes  face these choices.   Device Independence  Internet access is no longer restricted to desktop computers. Mobile devices such as laptops, netbooks,  PDAs, smartphones, and e-book readers are also connected to browse web sites. However, some  devices—especially the handheld ones—have limited screen size, scrollability, and computing power.  Care must be taken to provide code that works on a variety of devices. The concept also contributes to  web site accessibility and partly overlaps with internationalization.   There is a wide choice of computer monitors, screens, TVs, and projectors. All of them come with   different sizes, aspect ratios, resolutions, contrast ratios, and color fidelity, for example. One of the basic  requirements in this respect is resolution independence. Functionality should be available on a variety of  devices regardless of different hardware controls, such as keyboards, touchscreens, or customizable  control buttons of mobile devices. Device independence provides support for different access  mechanisms and different modes of use  for example, visual and auditory modes of use . The aim of  device independence is to “match Web content to the needs, capabilities, and limitations of the delivery  environment” [125]. Especially the increasing interest in mobile browsing makes device independence a  major concern in web site development.   29    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Markup languages such as HTML and XHTML are good examples for device independence   standards. CSS can be used to provide device independence through additional style sheets for devices  other than desktop computers including but not limited to mobile phones, projectors, and printers.12  Java applets can be executed on a variety of devices under different platforms, because Java is a cross- platform programming language. Image file formats such as JPEG, TIFF, or GIF are also device- independent files. In document publishing and sharing, PDF is a classic example for device  independence.   Separating Content from Presentation  In the early period of the Web, the only concern about web publishing was the web presence itself. At  that time, web documents were limited mainly to the mixture of lightly formatted text content and  images. When the possibilities widened, the Web soon became a full multimedia platform.   Since more and more people  not just web developers  tried to publish on the Web, there was a need  to make the process easier. As a result, nearly everyone became capable of publishing on the Web even if  they were not competent to do so. To maintain the functions of the Web, browser developers made their  products foolproof and error-tolerant. People began to think that what was beneath the surface did not  matter.   It has been proved over the years that formatting should be separated from structure. This is one of   the major concepts of Cascading Style Sheets. This approach leads to centralized style control, which  makes it possible to change the styles of the entire web site from a single location. Moreover, the markup  becomes shorter, less redundant, clearer, less complicated, and easier to interpret and render. Beyond  syntax, semantic annotations can also be provided in web documents. In contrast to styling rules,  semantics are logically related to the markup and the content.    Usability  Usability can be defined as “setting clear and concise goals for a web site, determining a correct and  exhaustive set of user requirements, ensuring that the web site meets user’s expectations, setting  usability goals, and providing useful content” [126]. It is a measure of how easily a system can be used.  Usability can be achieved by optimizing the user experience, providing browser independence and  accessibility, providing an appropriate home page and site structure, and providing reliable layout.  Usability should not be confused with accessibility, which means access to all, regardless of user  disabilities or device limitations.   Web sites should provide useful content that is relevant and appropriate to the audience. Web   content should be written properly. There are numerous requirements for the appearance of texts, links,  lists, controls, graphics, and multimedia. Beyond content, the navigation and site structure should be  organized in a way that meets user expectations. This can be achieved by involving users in testing sites.  The primary goals of any web site should precede the designing and developing processes. User  interface issues as well as multiple designs should be considered during design.   Solutions that are highly likely to confuse or disturb users should be avoided. Pop-up windows   should be eliminated. Web sites should be developed in accordance with standards so that users can  perform tasks in the sequence and manner in which they are accustomed.                                                    12 The same web site without background image, ensured width that does not exceed US Letter paper  width, and so on.   30    CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION TO WEB STANDARDS   Reliable Layouts  Reliable positioning of web site elements has always been a major concern in web site development.  Because of the enormous number of factors to consider, some elements should be positioned absolutely  while others relatively. There are elements that are meant to be fixed, even if the content exceeds the  browser window and the content is scrolled  see the section “Reliable Positioning” .   In CSS there are several measurement units for defining element dimensions, lengths, and   distances. Units can be relative to the relevant font or the viewing device  em, ex, px  as well as absolute   in, cm, mm, pt, pc . Percentages can also be applied. However, units should be chosen reasonably  see the  section “Sizes and Proportions” . Unreliable or browser-dependent positioning and improperly  combined units can result in unreadable content or limited functionality. The overlapping order of  layers might also be a problem since the order can cause unreadable content in various environments.   Layout is in strong correlation with device, resolution, and browser independence.   Code Optimality  Web standards provide a way to develop reliable, fully functional, interoperable, device-independent  web sites. However, they cannot guarantee optimal code length by default. Even if each character in the  source code has its meaning, that is, none of them is unnecessary, code length might still be far from  optimal. Long identifiers in the markup and especially the ignored inheritance in CSS  see the section  “Ignored Inheritance”  can increase complexity and length, resulting in larger file size, slower  downloads, and longer rendering time  see the section “Nonoptimal Code Length” .   Summary  In this chapter, you learned that web standards are not fixed sets of rules but a constantly evolving list of  finalized specifications. You are well aware by now that there are several web sites where open standards  are published and that web standardization also involves best practices. Proper standards  implementation is independent from site popularity and the trends content authors and developers try  to pursue. There is no best way to design and develop web sites; however, following standards is highly  beneficial, and it is the only way to provide the highest level of interoperability and secure your web sites  for the future.   In the next chapter, I will discuss language and character settings on servers and in markup to   ensure proper character representation and provide advanced hints for software agents that search and  process web documents. The internationalization settings of web documents typically precede the  development process and thus are described as one of the first steps in standard web site development.

Accessed 12 February 2011   37    C H A P T E R  2              Internationalization   Web authors publish in all languages of the world, and several technologies support this multilingual  Web. A key factor of correct character representation on the Web is applying the appropriate character  encoding. Although this depends on server settings as well, web developers can effectively contribute to  proper internationalization of the physical and syntactic structures of web documents. One of the very  first steps in standard web site development is to apply national settings on both the file and document  content level. Unicode can be considered as the ultimate encoding and is described from the  standardistas’ point of view. The use of Unicode byte-order marks, which provide information about the  ordering of individually addressable subcomponents within the representation of this multibyte  character encoding, can be confusing. Special characters and symbols can often be provided in various  ways, including entity sets, escape codes, and hexadecimal notation.    In this chapter, you will learn how to secure character rendering on web sites that makes it possible   to properly display any character or ideogram of natural languages. Characters can be represented in  several ways, determined by the character encoding being chosen. Although there is a variety of  character encoding systems, Unicode can be used for almost all scenarios. The character encoding can  be set in many ways, from meta tags to the HTTP header. Most characters can be added directly to the  markup; however, there are some exceptions you should keep in mind. You will also learn the proper  application of character entities and whitespace characters that can be used to add special characters to  web sites, such as invisible, unprintable control characters.   The Importance of Character Encoding  Until the 1990s, computers mainly supported the characters of the English alphabet only  partly because  of the American dominance on the computer market , and the need for international characters has  been satisfied with hardware code pages, such as CP852 or CP1252, supported by the then-used  operating systems  for example, DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95 . The proper display of Central- European characters, for example, was dependent on the hardware configuration, the operating system,  and its settings. A few years later, with the introduction of the Web, such limitations could not be  accepted any longer. In 1997, HTML 4.0 introduced advanced support for international characters.   The American Standard Code for Information Interchange  ASCII  has been the most widely   supported character encoding scheme, which stores 128 characters on 7 bits. Additional characters have  been provided by 8-bit character sets, such as the ISO IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character  encodings  informally referred to as Latin-1 . They were first published in 1987 and supported most  Western European languages and partly supported some other languages.   Most modern character encoding systems are based on ASCII; however, they support many more   characters.   If anything other than the most basic Latin characters is needed, text on your web site might be   unreadable unless an appropriate character encoding is specified. These standards define not only the   39    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   identification of each character and the associated numeric value  codepoint1  but also the way this value  is represented in the bits of the file being encoded.   If the character encoding is declared properly, browsers can use the appropriate encoding to render  web documents. Consequently, all special characters will be displayed correctly. Browsers usually have  an automatic character encoding recognition feature as well, which is activated in case the character  encoding of a document is not declared. Based on the setting of the file, the browser might identify the  character encoding being used. Users can also select an encoding scheme manually in most browsers,  which is a forced method and should not be used if all server and document settings are correct.

The correct rendering of such characters is not as natural as one might think. It could  easily happen that undesirable characters, such as squares  □  or question marks  � , appear instead of  the correct form of nonbasic characters. Inappropriate character encoding  or its declaration  can cause  additional problems too; for example, text might become impossible to search. Even if there might be  legible characters from the overlapping part of the appropriate and the inadequate character encoding, a  large share of the text would contain meaningless characters. Wrong encoding causes not just  inappropriate rendering but also further processing problems; for example, databases might become  inaccessible.   Beyond inadequate encoding information, other reasons can spoil text readability, too. Missing   fonts are only one of them.    used.   The possibility of encoding special characters depends on the character encoding and character set   There are a variety of character sets. The most well-known ones can be grouped as follows:      UTF: UTF-8 UTF-16 UTF-32  Unicode, worldwide       ISO standards: ISO-8859-1  Western Europe , ISO-8859-2  Central Europe , ISO- 8859-3  Southern Europe , ISO-8859-4  Northern Europe , ISO-8859-5  Cyrillic ,  ISO-8859-6-i  Arabic , ISO-8859-7  Greek , ISO-8859-8  Hebrew, visual , ISO-8859- 8-i  Hebrew, logical , ISO-8859-9  Turkish , ISO-8859-10  Latin 6 , ISO-8859-11   Latin Thai , ISO-8859-13  Latin 7, Balic Rim , ISO-8859-14  Latin 8, Celtic , ISO- 8859-15  Latin 9 , ISO-8859-16  Latin 10 , ISO-2022-jp  Japanese, e-mail , ISO-ir- 111  Cyrillic KOI-8       US-ASCII  basic English      Windows: Windows-1250  Central Europe , Windows-1251  Cyrillic , Windows-  1252  Western Europe , Windows-1253  Greek , Windows-1254  Turkish ,  Windows-1255  Hebrew , Windows-1256  Arabic , Windows-1257  Baltic Rim        Encodings for eastern languages: EUC-JP  Japanese, Unix , Shift_JIS  Japanese,  Win Mac , EUC-kr  Korean , gb2312  Chinese, simplified , gb18030  Chinese,  simplified , big5  Chinese, traditional , Big5-HKSCS  Chinese, Hong Kong , tis-620   Thai       Other: koi8-r  Russian , koi8-u  Ukrainian , Macintosh  MacRoman , and so on.   In spite of this wide variety, only the variants of a single character encoding—Unicode—should be used  unless there is a very good reason not to do so. The following section describes that character encoding.   Unicode  Unicode is a standard for universal character encoding. It provides the capacity to encode all characters  used for the written languages of the world [1]. Beyond the characters of natural languages and widely  used notations, all historic scripts of the world are also covered. Unicode provides codes for  approximately 109,000 characters covering 93 scripts  even historic ones such as Egyptian hieroglyphs ,  including alphabets, ideograph sets, and symbols. Moreover, the Unicode codespace supports more  than a million codepoints. The Unicode Character Code Charts provide quick access to any characters  and their codepoints [2]. These classifications also give an insight into the wonderful richness of  languages and fields supported by Unicode:   41    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION       Scripts      European scripts: Armenian  including ligatures , Coptic  including Coptic  in Greek block , Cypriot syllabary, Cyrillic, Georgian, Glagolitic, Gothic,  Greek, Latin  extended, including ligatures and fullwidth Latin letters ,  Linear B  with syllabary and ideograms , Ogham, Old Italic, Phaistos Disc,  Runic, and Shavian   Phonetic symbols: IPA extensions, phonetic extensions, modifier tone  letters, spacing modifier letters, superscripts and subscripts   Combining diacritics: Combining diacritical marks and combining half  marks   African scripts: Bamum, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Ethiopic, N’Ko, Osmanya,  Tifinagh, and Vai      Middle Eastern scripts: Arabic, Imperial Aramaic, Avestan, Carian,   Cuneiform  including numbers and punctuation, Old Persian, and Ugaritic ,  Hebrew, Lycian, Lydian, Mandaic, Old South Arabian, inscriptional Pahlavi,  inscriptional Parthian, Phoenician, Samaritan, and Syriac   Central Asian scripts: Mongolian, Old Turkic, Phags-Pa, and Tibetan   South Asian scripts: Bengali, Brahmi, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,  Kaithi, Kannada, Kharoshthi, Lepcha, Limbu, Malayalam, Meetei Mayek, Ol  Chiki, Oriya, Saurashtra, Sinhala, Syloti Nagri, Tamil, Telugu, Thaana, and  Vedic extensions   Southeast Asian scripts: Batak, Balinese, Buginese, Cham, Javanese, Kayah  Li, Khmer  with symbols , Lao, Myanmar  extended , New Tai Lue, Rejang,  Sundanese, Tai Le, Tai Tham, Tai Viet, and Thai   Philippine scripts: Buhid, Hanunoo, Tagalog, and Tagbanwa   East Asian scripts: Bopomofo  extended , CJK unified ideographs  Han,  extended , CJK compatibility ideographs  with supplement , CJK   KangXi  radicals, Hangul Jamo  extended  and syllables, Hiragana, Katakana  with  phonetic extensions, Kana supplement, and half-width Katakana , Kanbun,  Lisu, and Yi  with syllables and radicals    American scripts: Cherokee, Deseret, and Unified Canadian Aboriginal  Syllabics   Other scripts: Alphabetic presentation forms, half-width and full-width  forms, and ASCII characters                                             Symbols and punctuation      Punctuation: General punctuation  ASCII punctuation, Latin-1  punctuation, small form variants , supplemental punctuation  CJK symbols  and punctuation, CJK compatibility forms, full-width ASCII punctuation,  and vertical forms    42    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION                   Alphanumeric symbols: Letterlike symbols  including Roman symbols ,  mathematical alphanumeric symbols, enclosed alphanumerics, enclosed  CJK letters and months, CJK compatibility symbols  including additional  squared symbols    Numbers and digits: Aegean numbers, Ancient Greek numbers, ASCII digits   including fullwidth ASCII digits , common Indic number forms, counting  Rod numerals, Cuneiform numbers and punctuation, number forms, Rumi  numeral symbols, superscripts, and subscripts      Mathematical symbols: Arrows, mathematical alphanumeric symbols,   mathematical operators, and geometric shapes   Other symbols: Alchemical symbols, ancient symbols, Braille patterns, and  currency symbols, dingbats, emoticons, game symbols, miscellaneous  symbols, musical symbols  including Ancient Greek musical notation and  Byzantine musical symbols , transport and map symbols, and Yijing  symbols   Special characters: Layout controls, invisible operators, tags, and variation  selectors   The standard supports three encoding forms  UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32  that use a common   repertoire of characters. They support the same data transmission but in 8, 16, or 32 bits per code unit  format, respectively  byte, word, or double word . They can even be transformed into one another. All  three encoding forms need a maximum of 4 bytes  32 bits  of data for each character. Depending on the  encoding form chosen  UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 , each character is represented as a sequence of  either one to four 8-bit bytes, one or two 16-bit code units, or a single 32-bit code unit. Since UTF-8 and  UTF-16 are variable-width encodings, UTF-8 results in smaller file size for English text. However, UTF-8  requires 3 bytes for an Asian character for which UTF-16 requires only 2 bytes. UTF-32 codepoint  calculations can be performed quickly, but all codepoints require 4 bytes  fixed-width encoding .   For web content, UTF-8 is recommended, which provides interoperability and backward   compatibility with US-ASCII2 and has further advantageous characteristics [3]. UTF-8 supports  internationalized resource identifiers  IRIs, multilingual web addresses  [4, 5]. UTF-8 uses one byte at the  minimum in encoding the characters, while UTF-16 uses two, so a UTF-8 encoded file tends to be  smaller than a UTF-16 encoded file. UTF-8 is byte oriented, while UTF-16 and UTF-32 are not; in other  words, the byte order should be declared for UTF-16 and UTF-32 files by the byte-order mark  BOM— will be described in the corresponding section under “Special Characters” . UTF-8 is better in recovering  from errors than the other Unicode flavors.   There are further variants of UTF-16 and UTF-32, depending on the endianness, which is the order  of individually addressable subcomponents within the character set. If the most significant byte is the  first byte  lowest address  and the least significant byte is the last byte  highest address , the file is called  big-endian  UTF-16BE, UTF-32BE . If these bytes are reversed, the file is referred to as little-endian   UTF-16LE, UTF-32LE . Table 2-2 summarizes the differences between UTF-8 and the variants of UTF- 16 and UTF-32.                                                     2 All US-ASCII characters use exactly the same bytes in UTF-8 as in US-ASCII; i.e., a UTF-8 file that  contains only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file.   43    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   Table 2-2.

Conformance   checkers may advise authors against using legacy encodings [6]. Authoring tools should default to using  UTF-8 for newly-created documents [7].”   Characters That Should Be Avoided in Markup Contexts  Some Unicode characters should not be applied in the context of markup in HTML or XML documents   Table 2-3  because of one or more of the following reasons:   They are deprecated in the Unicode standard.   They cannot be supported without additional data.   They are difficult to handle because they are stateful.3   They can be handled more efficiently with markup.                   They should be avoided because of the potential conflict they could cause with  equivalent markup.                                                     3 A character represented by a particular value in the text depends on values provided earlier in the text  stream, e.g., escape sequences or bidirectional embedding controls.   44    Table 2-3.

Use only at the start of a file, not  as part of markup.   Markup should be used instead,  e.g.,  ,  .   An appropriate markup  language should be used  instead.   xhtml:lang or xml:lang should  be used instead.   45    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   Formatting Characters Suitable Also for Markup  There are special formatting characters in Unicode that can also be used for markup  Table 2-4 . They  affect text and can be applied for markup simultaneously. These formatting characters are interpreted  by rendering engines.   Table 2-4.

This  codepoint is the U+FEFF  Zero-width non-breaking space, ZWNBSP . As mentioned earlier, the byte order  of UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoded files should be declared, and the BOM provides this information.   In UTF-16, the 2 or 4 bytes of characters can be ordered in two ways  little-endian or big-endian— essentially just defining the direction the bytes should be read in . To choose from the two, documents  encoded in UTF-16 should always start with the BOM. In UTF-8, it is optional since there are no  alternate byte sequences in characters. If the BOM is still provided in UTF-8, it is called the UTF-8  signature. According to the I18N Activity Group at W3C, the byte-order mark should be omitted in UTF-8  [10]. This byte-order mark can cause display problems in some browsers. For example, it produces an  extra line or unwanted characters at the top of the page [11]. An advanced text editor or Richard Ishida’s  UTF-8 BOM tester [12] can be used to check the presence of UTF-8 signatures.   Whitespace Characters  A small subset of Unicode characters are considered whitespace characters that have different line- breaking properties, different ligating properties, and different widths. These characters are used to  separate different parts of the document with line breaks, tabulators, and spaces. They represent  horizontal or vertical spaces on web pages and thus contribute to the appearance and layout of blocks of  content or the entire page. Whitespace characters are typically nonvisual marks but reserve some space  when rendered. The list of whitespace characters varies from context to context. For example, the form  feed control character is considered as whitespace in HTML but not in XML. Moreover, each markup  language defines those few whitespace characters that can be applied as part of the markup syntax. The  XML specification defines whitespace as a combination of one or more of the following characters: space   U+0020 , carriage return  U+000D , line feed  U+000A , or tab  U+0009 . HTML 4.01 also supports the form  feed character  U+000C ; however, that character cannot be used in XHTML.   Not all whitespace characters can be typed in from the keyboard, although the most common ones,   such as a blank space  the basic word divider in Western languages  or a single tabulator, can be typed  using the spacebar and the Tab key, respectively. Advanced text editors usually provide inserting options  for all the others  see the later section “Development Tools” .   A very bad practice from the 1990s is to provide whitespaces by embedding blank images, such as   spacer.gif files, instead of whitespace characters. This approach still exists, although it has only  disadvantages. For example, the content of a web page using space-holder images loses its structure and  provides elements without semantic or structural meaning. As a result, the length of the source code of  such documents is not optimal. Even the slightest modification in the content might result in disrupted  layout. Such images might also have a negative effect on searchability. Moreover, the page content of  such documents is not accessible for text browsers and screen readers  that would read aloud  “spacer.gif” repeatedly .   NFC Normalization Is Recommended  In Unicode the same text can be provided with different character sequences. The accentuated a  in  other words, á , for example, can be represented either as the pre-composed U+00E1  Latin small letter a  with acute  or as the decomposed sequence of U+0061  Latin small letter a  and U+0301  Combining acute  accent .   Unicode Standard supports four normalization forms: NFC, NFD, NFKC, and NFKD. The C stands   for composed  precomposed , D for decomposed, while K represents compatibility.   47    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   The normalization form being used is especially important when accents or other diacritics are used  in  X HTML identifiers or CSS selectors and class names. If such a word is used in precomposed form in  the HTML  for example,   , but in decomposed form in the CSS  for example,  hangsúlyos { color: red; } , then the selector won’t match the class name. This problem can be  eliminated by avoiding accented characters in markup attributes and CSS properties, which is strongly  recommended.   W3C recommends NFC normalization—which is supported by advanced text editors by default—on   the Web to improve interoperability [13].   Unicode Should Be Preferred  Web documents should use one character encoding at a time. Different parts of the same document  should not be encoded with different encoding schemes.   UTF-8 character encoding can significantly reduce the complexity of multilingual sites. Unicode   allows more languages to be used on a single page than any other encoding system. In most cases, it is  ideal for content, forms, scripts, and databases. Consequently, Unicode should be used wherever  possible [14]. Fortunately, there is a good tendency toward this use on the Web. According to a Google  report released in August 2010, approximately 50 percent of web sites apply UTF-8. The universal use of  an ultimate character encoding can eliminate incorrect assumptions made by user agents while  rendering documents that contain special characters.   However, the application of Unicode does not guarantee that texts will be displayed correctly in   browsers. Several scripting languages such as Arabic require additional techniques to ensure the  appropriate character sequence of glyphs.   Declaring Character Encoding for the Markup  Character encoding of web documents can be determined in many ways:      Using the HTTP header     Using in-document declarations             Using the pragma directive  HTML 4, XHTML,  X HTML5    Using the meta charset attribute  HTML5    Using the XML declaration4  XHTML    The last three options are used in the markup, but not the first one, which is applied by the web   server to indicate the character encoding. As indicated earlier, not all in-document declarations can be  used in any markup languages, but the pragma directive can be used in most. Since all of these  techniques provide information about the encoding to rendering engines on how to interpret the file, it  is vital to ensure that these declarations correspond to the actual character encoding of the file.   If multiple encoding declarations are inconsistent or contradictory, the following precedence rules   determine which declaration to apply:  1.  HTTP Content-Type header  2.  Byte-order mark5                                                     4 The character encoding declaration, if provided exclusively using the XML declaration, is ignored by  some rendering engines.   48    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   Encoding Declaration in the HTTP Header  One of the options for declaring character encoding is to provide the appropriate data in the HTTP  header. Listing 2-1 shows an example.   Listing 2-1. Setting the Character Encoding in the HTTP Header   3.  XML declaration  4.  The meta element  5.  The link charset attribute   HTTP 1.1 200 OK  Date: Tue, 02 Aug 2011 14:18:05 GMT  Server: Apache 2.2.3  Oracle   …  Content-Type: text html; charset=UTF-8  Content-Language: en   As mentioned earlier, these declarations have the highest precedence. They should be consistent   with in-document declarations.   provide a byte-order mark in the file.   Chapter 4.   Documents using UTF-16 should be declared as UTF-16 rather than UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE and   HTTP headers are used for other purposes too. For more information on the HTTP header, see   In-Document Declarations  In HTML 4, the pragma directive should be used at the top of the head element in the form shown in  Listing 2-2.   Listing 2-2. Declaring the Character Encoding with the Pragma Directive       The previous declaration can be used in HTML5 as well, which also provides a newly specified meta  charset attribute  Listing 2-3 . Either of them could be used but only one at a time. The whole  declaration must fit within the first 512 bytes of the page.   Listing 2-3. HTML5 meta charset       The encoding declaration of XHTML documents depends on which MIME type they are served with.   If they are served as text html, the pragma directive in Listing 2-2 can be used at the top of the head  element.   XHTML documents served as XML can use the encoding declaration of the XML declaration  Listing   2-4  in the first line of the document  see Chapter 3 .                                                                                                                                                  5 The BOM has been added to the hierarchy by the HTML5 specification, but this is not implemented in  all browsers yet.   49    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   Listing 2-4. Setting the Character Encoding in XML Documents       An XML declaration is required for any XML documents that use character encoding other than UTF-8  or UTF-16 as well as in case the encoding is not provided by the HTTP header  see later in Chapter 3 .   Declaring Character Encoding for CSS  Generally, there is no need to declare character encoding for style sheets. However, the encoding of  external CSS files should always be declared if and only if any non-ASCII content is provided within the  CSS. Alternatively, descriptive names of selectors or other CSS content written in languages requiring  non-Latin characters can be provided without accents, totally eliminating the need for CSS encoding  declarations.   HTTP Header Declarations  CSS encoding can also be declared in the HTTP Content-Type header. For example, if the character  encoding is UTF-8, the HTTP declaration looks like Listing 2-5.   Listing 2-5. Declaring the Character Encoding for CSS  Rarely Used    Content-Type: text css; charset=UTF-8   Beyond the HTTP declaration, it is always recommended to use an in-document declaration as well    see the next section . This can guarantee that the encoding of the external CSS file can be determined  even if the file is moved or used locally.   The character encoding declared in the HTTP header should coincide with the one declared in the   CSS file. Naturally, the first one has higher precedence.   In-Document Declarations  Character encoding can be set by the @charset at-rule with the syntax shown in Listing 2-6.   Listing 2-6. Syntax of the @charset At-Rule   @charset " ";   Only one @charset rule can be used per CSS file. It should be declared at the very beginning of the   file. No characters should precede the declaration  only BOM if the CSS file is Unicode encoded6 .  The charset-name can be one of the character sets defined by IANA [15]. Some encodings have   multiple names in the IANA registry  in these cases the one denoted as preferred should be applied .  Listing 2-7 shows a typical example for character encoding declaration of external CSS files.   Listing 2-7. Setting the Character Encoding of CSS with an At-Rule   @charset "UTF-8";                                                     6 External CSS files are usually encoded in US-ASCII.   50    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   These rules can be used exclusively for external style sheets. In-document style sheet declarations   should avoid @charset rules.   The HTML 4.01 specification defines a charset attribute to the link element, which could be used  for identifying the character encoding of the target document. In HTML5, however, this attribute of the  link element is considered obsolete  partly because it is not supported fully by browsers ; thus, it should  be avoided.   Escape Codes, Special Characters, and Symbols  In HTML and XHTML documents, each character can be represented directly or by a character sequence   also known as a character reference . Two types of character sequences exist: numeric character  references and character entity references.   Assume a document fragment contains an a character with an accent. It can be declared by either   the &xE1; or &225; numeric character references or by the &aacute; entity reference in  X HTML  documents  see the following sections for details . However, the direct use of the character á should be  applied instead. The same is true for the copyright sign    instead of &copy; , the registered trademark  sign  ® instead of &reg; , and so on.   Characters should always be preferred to escape codes except when those characters that should be  represented have syntactic meaning in  X HTML or XML are invisible or ambiguous. However, in those  cases, using entities is mandatory [16]. In other words, markup characters used in text or attribute values  must be escaped. For example, when an  X HTML source code should be represented as document  content without processing, the   characters should be provided by their entity names in the  source code. Analogously, if an & character is needed as text within an RSS feed or an RDF file, the &amp;  entity should be used instead  see the “Entity References” section for more information .   Numeric References  Numeric character references identify characters by Universal Character Set or Unicode codepoints in  the form &nnnn; where nnnn is the codepoint in decimal form.   Both HTML and XHTML support hexadecimal references as well. In HTML, they can be applied in  either the &Xhhhh; or &xhhhh; form. Since XML is case sensitive, in XHTML they must be in lowercase   &xhhhh;  [17].   The nnnn or hhhh can be any number of digits and may include leading zeros.  Numeric references should be eliminated in favor of direct character use. In most cases, there is no   reason to insert a single apostrophe in the markup as &8217; rather than the ’ character itself. The same  holds true for other characters too. If a character, such as a Japanese ideograph, cannot be typed in with  the keyboard, the corresponding character can be inserted with advanced software tools or copy and  pasted from other applications, codecharts, or web sites via the clipboard. Note that even advanced text  editors display many of these directly inserted characters incorrectly during development; however,  browsers will display them correctly if the character encoding of the containing file has been set properly  and the file is being served correctly.   Entity References  Character entity references refer to characters by the name of the appropriate entity that has the desired  character as its replacement text in the form &name;.   HTML supports 252 character entities [18]. In XHTML, there are 253 entities  including the 5   predefined entities of XML 1.0  [19]; however, their application is affected by the way XHTML  documents are processed. It should be kept in mind that XHTML documents, if served correctly, are   51    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   processed by XML parsers instead of SGML parsers that interpret HTML documents. Those characters  that have a meaning in XML, such as the less-than sign  < , cause parsing errors if they are provided  directly rather than using entities. There are only four character entities whose processing is guaranteed  in all XML environments: &amp;, &gt;, &lt;, and &quot;  &, >, <, and " respectively . Fortunately, this short  list contains those very important character entities that can be used for syntactic notation  ampersand,  greater than, less than . W3C recommends the use of ampersand characters in href attributes of XHTML  documents [20]. Particular attention should be paid to URIs that include parameters. Single ampersand  characters in these URIs should be replaced by the &amp; entity [21].   Although the &apos; entity  apostrophe, U+0027  is among the five predefined entities of XML, it   should not be used in XHTML [22].   Since virtually all characters can be represented directly in Unicode including, but not limited to, all  letters and ideograms of natural languages, accentuated letters, special characters, mathematical signs,  and symbols, character references should be eliminated [23]. Direct character use is easier to interpret,  maintain, and modify than numeric or entity references  Listing 2-8 . Texts with references are more  difficult to extend and almost impossible to search. Many characters cannot be represented by  references, which often resulted in incorrect characters on web pages in the 1990s. For example, the  small o with tilde, õ, has been displayed instead of o with the double acute accent  also known as the  Hungarumlaut , ő, which is a different character.   Listing 2-8. Three Versions of the Same Central-European Text with Characters, Numeric and Entity  References    Áttekintés      A HTML5 a HTML teljes megújulása, új funkciókkal felvértezve.        &193;ttekint&233;s      A HTML5 a HTML teljes meg&250;jul&225;sa, &250;j funkci&243;kkal felv&233;rtezve.        &Aacute;ttekint&eacute;s      A HTML5 a HTML teljes meg&uacute;jul&aacute;sa, &uacute;j funkci&oacute;kkal  felv&eacute;rtezve.      Checking I18N  Those settings and content that support internationalization can be checked by the W3C  Internationalization Checker [24]. It can determine whether the HTML XHTML documents contain non- NFC class names and identifiers, the language settings of pages, and so on. The validator is described in  detail in the “Validating I18N” section in Chapter 14.   Summary  In this chapter, you learned the importance of internationalization settings that enable properly  displayed characters to be rendered on web sites or processed in databases. You know by now that there   52    CHAPTER 2  INTERNATIONALIZATION   is a wide choice of character encoding systems, many of which have been used for decades but became  obsolete in recent years. There is an ultimate variable-width character encoding, called UTF-8, which is  a flavor of Unicode, omits the BOM, and is backward compatible with the once most widely used  encoding scheme, ASCII.   The next chapter will describe the markup, where most standardization efforts take place. The   markup not only provides the document structure and content but also serves as the basis for  accessibility support and semantic annotations. As you will see, there is a wide choice of markup  languages, not just HTML5, the one most developers talk about these days. You will learn the HTML and  XHTML elements and attributes that can be safely applied in a variety of documents while maintaining  standard compliance. The chapter will also make you understand why strict markup should always be  preferred.   References    1.    The Unicode Consortium  2010  The Unicode Standard: A Technical Introduction.

The popularity of HTML has not decreased since the birth of the Web; thus, becoming familiar with the  versions and variants of that language is important. On the other hand, the application of XML  languages has been increasing significantly. The differences between HTML and XHTML are crucial for  understanding the techniques for migrating from one document type to another. The general structure  of all web documents follows the same logic; however, HTML5 introduced new structuring elements that  can be used to create rather sophisticated document structures. By examining well-structured  document examples with limited content, you will be able to create well-structured web documents on  your own. To achieve well-structuredness, the block-line and inline-level elements should be  differentiated, which is also important in understanding how to embed elements into each other   element nesting . You should also know how to use Formal Public Identifiers and Document Type  Definitions for creating standard-compliant documents. The strict rules of XML declarations are vital for  XHTML authoring.    In this chapter, you will learn about the most important standards in web site development. This  chapter covers the most advanced markup languages along with mixed-namespace document types. I  provide sample HTML and XHTML documents for the sake of easier understanding. You will understand  how to distinguish deprecated elements and attributes that should not be used from the ones that can  be used in almost all versions and variants of markup languages available on the Web today. Beyond the  most popular versions of markup languages, you will learn the power of XML through mixed-namespace  documents where not only general-purpose texts but also vector graphics and mathematical  annotations can be provided by textual markup. After reading the chapter, you will be able to apply  semantically meaningful markup elements and attributes, eliminate obsolete markup, and create web  documents with proper element nesting and DOM structure.    55    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5    Note  The detailed description of markup basics is beyond the scope of this book. Several resources are  available for both beginner and intermediate developers. One of them is “Getting started with HTML,” a very short  overview written by the author editor of HTML specifications, Dave Raggett [1]. Another—strongly  recommended—W3C document is the “HTML: The Markup Language Reference” by Michael Smith [2]. There are  also many books on HTML5 [e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6] and XHTML.1 However, extended care must be taken to consider  changes and obsoletion of documents about HTML5. If a short summary is required for a certain element during  development, the W3C Cheatsheet can be more than helpful too [7].   SGML Languages  Standard Generalized Markup Language  SGML  is a markup language family. It has been used since the  mid-1980s. One of the major features of SGML is flexibility.   The most important SGML language for web developers is HTML, which has been the core language   of the World Wide Web from the very beginning.    Caution  Despite the similarities in the markup syntax of earlier HTML versions and HTML5, the latest version is  no longer based on SGML; however, it is backward-compatible with conventional HTML parsing.    HTML   The idea behind Hypertext Markup Language  HTML  was born at the European Laboratory for High- Energy Physics  CERN  in Geneva, Switzerland, as early as 1989 [8]. One year later, the World Wide Web  project was also started there. In the beginning, HTML was used to share information between  scientists. The major elements of the language were formed at that time, including headings,  paragraphs, and hyperlinks. However, the semantics of these documents were limited [9]. New elements  and multimedia capabilities were also added later that caused interoperability problems for documents  across different platforms.   The relatively simple syntax and vocabulary of the language made rapid and wide distribution  possible. However, it is also the reason for invalid markup found in more than 90 percent of HTML  documents. The error tolerance of browsers is constantly being misused. People should appreciate the  value of quality web documents, accessibility, good presentation, and functionality in various browsers.                                                     1 XHTML hand coders can write HTML markup with ease.   56    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   XML Languages  Extensible Markup Language  XML  is a universal format for structured documents and data on the  World Wide Web. Since XML has been extended from SGML, it can also be considered as a restricted,  machine-readable form of SGML. In this context, it removes those features of SGML that might result in  loose source code.   In contrast to most computer languages, XML has no fixed, predefined set of tags. With XML,   individual markup formats can be defined. Some of the most well-known and frequently used XML  formats and or XML serializations on the Web are XML, XHTML, SVG, MathML, XSL, RDF, Atom, and  RSS.   Many markup languages have primarily been designed for text documents; however, the need for  representing other types of information is constantly growing. Music, video, playlists, vector graphics,  content syndication, and various web services are some typical examples. One of the big advantages of  XML is that it is strict, well-defined, and extensible. XML also makes it possible to combine multiple  markup languages into single profiles, such as XHTML + MathML + SVG or XHTML + SMIL. The  additional vocabularies  elements, attributes, and further components  of other XML applications can  be used through the namespace mechanism declared by the xmlns attribute. This is one of the major  advantages of XHTML over HTML.   XHTML   Extensible Hypertext Markup Language  XHTML  is an XML language family that can be used as an  alternative to HTML. XHTML is an application of XML and thus more restrictive than HTML. In contrast  to HTML, for XHTML documents it must be ensured that they are properly written; otherwise, rendering  engines give error messages instead of rendering the content. They require an XML parser rather than an  SGML parser.   Documents served with an XML MIME type, such as application xhtml+xml, are treated as XML   documents by browsers; in other words, they are parsed by an XML processor. Consequently, XML and  HTML are processed differently. In fact, even minor syntactic errors will prevent an XML document  or  the ones that claimed to be XML  from being rendered correctly. In contrast, the errors of such  documents would be ignored in the HTML syntax. A parsing error of XML documents can easily result in  the “Yellow Screen of Death.”   Version Overview  Understanding the major differences and capabilities of the different markup language versions and  variants and analyzing sample documents with minimum content known as skeleton documents is  useful. They will be provided throughout the following sections. These documents can serve as the basis  for hand-coder development from scratch. Note that indentation is used for providing clear, easy-to- understand code. Naturally, tabulators can be omitted to obtain complete code optimality.  Furthermore, all provided documents are valid from character to character on an as-is basis, so they  must be extended with valid markup only to maintain validity. All these documents can be downloaded  from the book’s web page at www.apress.com, as well as from the companion web site of the book at  www.masteringhtml5css3.com.     57    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   HTML Versions and Variants  This section will highlight certain versions of HTML for two reasons. First, some have made a significant  impact on the evolution of the Web and are used as the basis of future standards. Second, some are still  in use more than 10 years after their introduction.   Although most of the early HTML versions are not used any longer, their milestones and the   evolution of HTML are important to know.   The formal specification of HTML was created in 1992, and this specification has evolved constantly   in the form of an SGML Document Type Definition. HTML soon became the lingua franca of web  publishing. HTML documents can be created manually in plain-text editors as well as in WYSIWYG  environments.2   HTML 2.0 was created by the HTML Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force in 1995.  It is also denoted as RFC 1866 [10]. HTML 2.0 is the first standardized form of the core HTML elements.  HTML 2.0 was used for platform-independent hypertext documents. The document type is obsolete and  currently stated as historic. More details can be found in the W3C archives [11].    HTML 3.2 is the first HTML Recommendation of W3C. This is the version in which new elements  have been introduced for creating tables, applets, superscripts, and subscripts, as well as for text flows  around images [12]. HTML 3.2 was backward-compatible with version 2.0. The code in Listing 3-1 is a  fragment of an HTML 3.2 document.   Listing 3-1. Bad Practices in an Old HTML Document  Just Demonstration, Should Not Be Used        An HTML 3.2 example   <body bgcolor="FFF6F0"   text="000000"   link="C00000">   Example header         <img align=left border=0 alt="Example:"  width=102 height=52  src=http:  www.example.com images author.jpg>   The Author        You can see that this markup is not case-sensitive. The previous example is loose code; in fact, it is a  bad example for web developers, because some of the attributes are not quoted  for example, width=102  instead of width="102" , strictly presentational attributes  bgcolor, align  are used that should be  eliminated by using CSS, the paragraph is not closed  the   tag is missing , and so forth.        Tip  Although HTML allows both capitalized and lowercase letters in element and attribute names, it is better to  become accustomed to using lowercase letters, which are allowed in every markup  including XHTML, which is  case-sensitive .                                                     2 For web standardistas the first one is the real choice.   58    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   HTML 4 is an ISO-conforming version  ISO 8879  that was the de facto standard, the “publishing   language of the World Wide Web,” for many years [13]. The specification was released in 1997 and  revised in 1998. HTML 4 was superseded by HTML 4.01.   Listing 3-2 shows a fragment of a typical HTML 4.0 document.   Listing 3-2. A Typical HTML 4 Document  Obsolete              An HTML 4.0 example          …         Undoubtedly, similarity can be noticed between the structure of this document and the previous   one. Markup languages are constantly evolving, and most versions rely on earlier versions and variants.   One of the most well-known previously used HTML versions was HTML 4.01. It was the primary  markup language of the Web for more than a decade. The W3C Recommendation was released in late  1999. It has three variations: the Strict, the Transitional, and the Frameset [14]. In the HTML 4 era, the  real choice was the Strict flavor, because it contained those elements only that had been selected for  inclusion in future versions. The Transitional variant was created to make it easier for developers to stop  using deprecated tags and provided time to learn how to write markup without these obsolete tags   hence the name . Since frames have been considered obsolete for many years now, Frameset  documents should not be used at all. There were many problems with frames. If you accessed a web site  with a broken frameset, for example, missing contents would take up the whole window. If a visitor  arrived through a direct link to a framed page, the context would be missed. Search engines could not  index frameset documents effectively. There were linking and bookmarking issues, and further problems  such as the Back button did not work in browsers. Frames also reduced the amount of usable space on a  web page and caused problems with printing.   XHTML Versions and Variants  XHTML is a document type family that is the reformulation of HTML in XML rather than SGML. Typical  XHTML file extensions are .html, .htm, .xhtml, .xht, and .xml. XHTML documents generally apply the  application xhtml+xml Internet media type; however, there are occasional exceptions  as you’ll see in  the next chapter .   Table 3-1.

The additional mechanisms allow  XHTML subsets or supersets. XHTML 1.1 + MathML 2.0 + SVG 1.1 and XHTML+RDFa documents are  typical examples of supersets of XHTML. Because of the additional  external  element sets applied in  them, they have a wider variety of markup elements than simple XHTML documents.   Table 3-2.

The selected language is the host language  see the “XHTML +  MathML + SVG” section later in the chapter .   XHTML 1.0  According to the subtitle of its specification released in 2000  and revised in 2002 , XHTML 1.0 is “a  reformulation of HTML 4 in XML 1.0” [18]. Similar to the three flavors of HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 also  defines the Strict, Transitional, and Frameset variants, respectively. XHTML 1.0 Strict includes those                                                     3 It has been suspended.  4 Defined by Open Mobile Alliance not W3C.   60    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   elements and attributes only that have not been deprecated in HTML 4.01. Every “missing” element and  attribute can be substituted by their CSS equivalents.    XHTML 1.0 Transitional provides the presentational elements such as center or font that are not   allowed in the Strict variant. Listings 3-3 and 3-4 show an example.   Listing 3-3. An Element Deprecated a Long Time Ago Is Still Used in XHTML 1.0 Transitional Documents   Listing 3-4.

XHTML 1.0 also has a Frameset variant, although, as we saw earlier, eliminating framesets is   strongly recommended even if they were a common feature of web documents in the first decade of the  Web.   Listing 3-5 presents an XHTML 1.0 Strict skeleton document.   Listing 3-5. An XHTML 1.0 Strict Skeleton Document      <!DOCTYPE html    PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">               Minimal XHTML 1.0 Document                               This is a minimal XHTML 1.0 document.                  61    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5    Tip  This is the best starting point for any kind of XHTML documents, because this document type contains  fundamental markup elements only that have been derived from HTML and are still current in most markup  languages. This markup also serves as the basis to be extended using external vocabularies  doing so, the  document type will change . If you want to use new markup elements introduced in HTML5 and migrate from  XHTML 1.0 Strict, minimal changes are needed  such as removing the DTD, changing the character encoding  declaration to the new one, and adding new elements .   XHTML 1.1  Over the years it has been realized that there are presentational components in markup languages that  can be handled more efficiently with style sheets. Moreover, web documents developed for handheld  devices can use limited resources more effectively if a subset of selected elements is applied in a  document rather than the whole set of elements. This is the basic idea behind XHTML modularization,  and these element subsets are called element modules.   XHTML 1.1, the “module-based XHTML,” contains exclusively those elements that are defined by  the “Modularization of XHTML” [19]. Consequently, elements deprecated in HTML 4 and XHTML 1.0  cannot be used in XHTML 1.1. The modules of XHTML 1.1 are the following [20]:   Structure Module: body, head, html, title          Text Module: abbr, acronym, address, blockquote, br, cite, code, dfn, div, em, h1, h2,  h3, h4, h5, h6, kbd, p, pre, q, samp, span, strong, var   List Module: dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li      Hypertext Module: a        Object Module: object, param           Bi-directional Text Module: bdo      Edit Module: del, ins   Presentation Module: b, big, hr, i, small, sub, sup, tt   Forms Module: button, fieldset, form, input, label, legend, select, optgroup,  option, textarea   Table Module: caption, col, colgroup, table, tbody, td, tfoot, th, thead, tr   Image Module: img            Client-side Image Map Module: area, map           Metainformation Module: meta   Intrinsic Events Module: event attributes   Server-side Image Map Module: ismap attribute on img   62    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Scripting Module: noscript, script   Stylesheet Module: style element               Link Module: link     Base Module: base   Style Attribute Module  deprecated : style attribute   The description of the previous modules, their elements and attributes, and their minimal content are  defined by the “Modularization of XHTML” [19].   Listing 3-6 presents an XHTML 1.1 skeleton document.   Listing 3-6. An XHTML 1.1 Skeleton Document      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.1  EN"      "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml11 DTD xhtml11.dtd">               XHTML 1.1 sample document title                               XHTML 1.1 sample document body                  XHTML 1.1 can also be used in mixed-namespace documents to support mathematical markup and   vector graphics  see “XTHML+MathML+SVG” .   XHTML 2.0  XHTML 2.0  also denoted as XHTML2  could have been the next-generation markup language and the  successor of XHTML 1.0 and 1.1. However, it remained on the Working Draft level and never became a  Recommendation.   Although XHTML 2.0 has several elements from earlier versions of markup languages, it has issues   with backward compatibility. In spite of that, coders familiar with XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 can easily develop  XHTML 2.0 documents.   The “Modularization of XHTML” refers to XHTML 2.0 as not just another markup language but as an   XHTML host language [19]. It consists of modules with elements and attributes. However, there are  several updated modules in XHTML 2.0 compared to the “Modularization of XHTML.”   After its suspension, several features  beyond the vital text and hyperlinking modules  that were   originally intended to be enclosed in XHTML 2.0 are being developed by independent working groups  within W3C. Such technologies are Access, RDFa, Role, XForms, or XML Events.   63    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   HTML5  HTML5 was initially proposed by individuals from Apple, Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software,  known as the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group  WHATWG  [21]. Later, W3C took  notice of the WHATWG proposal and announced a restart of an HTML specification effort [22].  WHATWG found XHTML 2.0 too document-centric and thus inappropriate for blogs, forums, web  stores, and multimedia sites. Their major concern was to create a platform for dynamic web applications  [23].   In spite of the tricky name, HTML5 is not just another HTML language. It is often used in the context   of web applications. It is the complete reformulation of HTML with new capabilities. Still, HTML5 is  designed to be backward-compatible with older browsers. Moreover, HTML5 uses an HTML syntax that  is compatible with both HTML and XHTML documents. However, processing instructions are not  supported. Beyond the well-known text html media type, a new media type called text html-sandboxed  can also be used, which makes it possible to interpret a file without giving the content access to the rest  of the web site. Because of a new approach that separates authoring and rendering conformance  requirements, deprecated tags are not needed anymore.   During the upcoming years when earlier browser versions will still be present, HTML5 support can  be critical. There are services such as the “HTML5 test” that checks HTML5 support in the browser they  are opened [24]. As for the markup contributors, several tests are available on the W3C testing web page,  where current tests can be reviewed, and new tests submitted [25].   HTML5 focuses strongly not only on structural and multimedia elements in the markup but also on   application programming interfaces  APIs ; thus, web developers with some programming knowledge  can develop applications for their web sites. HTML5 applications are accessible and device- independent, and codes can be reused easily. Additionally, these web applications need declarative  programming  and thus much less coding  compared to traditional procedural programming [26].  However, a large share of HTML5 functionalities can be achieved through the use of additional  technologies, including CSS3, server-side scripts, JavaScript transformations, Java, or XSLT.   Listing 3-7 shows an HTML5 skeleton document.   Listing 3-7.

All rights reserved.                   HTML5 also supports external vocabularies, such as Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG  and MathML,   both of which can be embedded directly into the HTML5 markup. For example, an SVG image can be  embedded between the   and   tags such as in Listing 3-8.   Listing 3-8. Directly Embedded SVG in HTML5       width="2">       complex content [27].   <rect stroke="black" fill="blue" x="50px" y="50px" width="300px" height="150px" stroke-  MathML equations can be embedded similarly. These elements can also be nested for more    Caution  In contrast to the common misconception, HTML5 is not a standard yet! The different modules of the  specification are in various stages of development, and you might see misleading labels such as “living standard,”  most of which refer to the corresponding module only. According to the W3C expectation, HTML5 will probably  become a W3C Recommendation in 2014 [28].   XHTML5  In HTML5 developers have the freedom of choice of flavor since HTML5 can be written either in HTML  or in XML syntax. In the latter case, the markup is called XHTML5. XHTML5 is the XML serialization of  HTML5. The syntax is described by the HTML5 specification. However, one should not be confused  since XHTML5 is an application of XML. In other words, HTML5 and XHTML5 have identical vocabulary  but different parsing rules.   Documents using elements and attributes defined by the HTML5 specification might be written as   valid XML documents. This markup is often referred as a polyglot language, which is the overlap  language of documents that are HTML5 and XML documents at the same time. Markup of a web  document can be considered polyglot markup if the document is a valid HTML document and a well- formed XML document and if it produces an identical DOM when processed as HTML and when parsed  as XML5 [29]. HTML5 and XHTML5 serializations are cross-compatible. However, XHTML5 has a stricter  syntax. Furthermore, some parts of XHTML5 such as processing instructions are not valid in HTML5.   Listing 3-9 shows an XHTML5 skeleton document.                                                     5 Except for those xml, xmlns, and xlink attributes for which HTML and XML parsers generate different  DOMs, e.g., xml:lang, xml:space, xml:base, xmlns="", xmlns:xlink="", and xlink:href.   65    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Listing 3-9.

Markup Syntaxes  Although similar, there are some considerable differences in the markup of HTML  until version 5  and  XHTML. We’ll examine the major ones here.   The HTML Syntax  The individual markup components are called elements. In HTML, keywords provided in angle brackets  called tags delimit document fragments to which they are applied. Elements should have a starting tag  and an ending tag in the form shown in Listing 3-10.   Listing 3-10. Pseudocode of Starting and Closing Tags     element_content     The start tag contains the name of the element, surrounded by angle brackets  in the form     . Element features such as appearance, behavior, or functioning are determined by the  optional attributes specified on the start tag  Figure 3-1 . They are separated by spaces.      66    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Figure 3-1. HTML element structure      To distinguish the end tag from the start tag, the end tag has a slash after the opening angle bracket    in the form   . For example, a simple HTML paragraph looks like Listing 3-11.   Listing 3-11. A Simple Paragraph in HTML    A simple paragraph.    The elements can provide the structure and meaning to web documents through the indication of   coherent sections such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, image embeddings, forms, and so on.   The default style sheet of the browser used to render the document determines the default   appearance. However, the default appearance can be arbitrarily overridden by external style sheets as  will be discussed later when we look at Cascading Style Sheets  CSS .   Two special tags in HTML are different from all the others. Comments can be added by the <!-- … - -> tag. The document type can be defined by the   tag  see the “Document Type Declaration”  section later in the chapter .   The XHTML Syntax and Restrictions  The element and attribute sets of the HTML and XHTML languages largely overlap, and most HTML  elements can be used in the corresponding XHTML 1.0 flavor  HTML 4.01 Transitional elements in  XHTML 1.0 Transitional, and HTML 4.01 Strict elements in XHTML 1.0 Strict . However, some elements  introduced in the XHTML specifications can be applied in XHTML exclusively  compare the elements of  the various markup language versions in Table 3-7 . The major difference between earlier HTML and  XHTML versions is that XHTML is stricter than HTML and it is extensible while HTML is not.6 The  difference between the HTML and XHTML vocabularies completely disappeared with the introduction  of the latest markup versions, HTML5 and XHTML5, since HTML5 has exactly the same elements and  attributes as XHTML5.   By understanding the difference between valid HTML and XHTML markup, you take the first major  step toward web site standardization. In fact, these are vital points that can serve as the basis for not just  valid XHTML markup but also accessibility and semantic notations. These rules are the keys for  authoring web documents that are both backward- and forward-compatible at the same time.                                                     6 Up to version 4.01. From HTML5, external vocabularies, such as SVG and MathML, can be used in  HTML, too, as you will see later.   67    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Well-formedness  Well-formedness is a basic concept in XHTML. All elements must be closed. Nesting should be done in  the proper order  Listing 3-12 . Overlapping elements are incorrect in XHTML  Listing 3-13 .   Listing 3-12. Properly Nested Elements    Part of this  bold text should be  italic as well  .     Listing 3-13. Overlapping Elements  Incorrect     Part of this  bold text should be  italic as well  .    Names Are in Lowercase  Since XML is case-sensitive, all XHTML element and attribute names must be in lowercase.   Required End Tags  In HTML, the end tag of several elements can be omitted, which is not allowed in XHTML  Listings 3-14  and 3-15 .   Listing 3-14. Properly Closed Elements    This is the first paragraph.    This is the second one.    Listing 3-15. Unterminated Elements Are Incorrect in XHTML    This is the first paragraph.  This is the second one.   All elements that are declared in the DTD as empty elements  meta, link, br, hr, img, input  can be   closed either by an end tag  similar to nonempty elements  or by the shorthand notation; in other words,  a space and a slash character are inserted prior to the end of the declaration, as shown in Listing 3-16   Listing 3-16. Pseudocode of Element Closing with Shorthand Notation  Self-closing        which provides shorter code. Although the space is optional, it should be preferred because the result is  easier to read  Listing 3-17 . Tags without a closing tag are also known as self-closing tags.   Listing 3-17. Terminated Empty Element        Listing 3-18 .   In XHTML, all unterminated elements are incorrect, including unterminated empty elements   68    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Listing 3-18. Unterminated Empty Elements Are Incorrect in XHTML     unterminated elements are incorrect in XHTML     The script element applies either to the full form  with the end tag  or to the shorthand notation,   depending on the number of parameters and the behavior of the element.   Quoted Attribute Values  All attributes must include values in XHTML. All attribute values must be quoted  Listing 3-19 .  Unquoted attribute values are not allowed in XHTML  Listing 3-20 .   Listing 3-19. Defining XHTML Attributes Correctly       Listing 3-20. Unquoted and Minimized Attributes  Incorrect in XHTML        No Attribute Minimization  Attribute-value pairs must be written in full  Listing 3-21 . Attribute minimization is not supported by  XHTML  Listing 3-22 . Attribute names such as compact and checked cannot be used in elements without  specifying their values  Table 3-3 .   Listing 3-21. Attributes Should Be Written in Full    English    Listing 3-22. Minimized Attribute  Incorrect in XHTML     English    Table 3-3. Attributes That Can Be Minimized in HTML, but Not in XHTML.   Minimized Attribute  HTML    Full Form  HTML XHTML    compact   checked   declare   readonly   disabled   compact="compact"   checked="checked"   declare="declare"   readonly="readonly"   disabled="disabled"   69    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Minimized Attribute  HTML    selected   defer   ismap   nohref   noshade   nowrap   multiple   noresize   Full Form  HTML XHTML    selected="selected"   defer="defer"   ismap="ismap"   nohref="nohref"   noshade="noshade"   nowrap="nowrap"   multiple="multiple"   noresize="noresize"   Whitespace Handling  Leading and trailing whitespace characters are stripped in XHTML.   In contrast to HTML, whitespace characters in XHTML attribute values are normalized to single   spaces. According to the XML specification, a single interword space  x20  is appended to whitespace  character sequences  x20, xD, xA, x9  [30].   Using Script and Style Elements  While the content type of the script and style HTML elements is character DATA  CDATA , it is  processed character DATA  PCDATA  in XHTML. The script and style elements are defined with  PCDATA content; in other words, < is handled as the beginning of markup code, while &lt; is  recognized as an entity  Listing 3-23 .   Listing 3-23. Unescaped Script Content        <![CDATA[    unescaped script content    ]]>      XML processors recognize these CDATA sections. They are represented as nodes in the Document   Alternatively, external script files styles sheet files can be used, eliminating the need for unescaped   Object Model.   script or style contents.   70    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Identifiers  Instead of the name attribute defined in HTML 4, the id attribute should be used in XHTML for  identifiers.   XHTML documents must use the id attribute when defining fragment identifiers on the elements a,   applet, form, frame, iframe, img, and map. This ensures the well-structuredness required by XML.   Element Prohibitions  In XHTML, elements cannot be nested arbitrarily. Those who are not familiar with XHTML often commit  nesting errors. The nesting rules should not be confused with overlapping, which is strictly forbidden in  XHTML. The nesting rules of XHTML 1.0 are similar to those of HTML 4.01. However, there are some  differences. The table element can contain a tr element directly in XHTML, which is not allowed in  HTML. In such cases, a tbody element is implied in HTML but not in XHTML. This behavior is important  in some cases, such as if tbody is used as a selector in the CSS of the web page. Table 3-4 summarizes  those parent-child element relationships that are not allowed in XHTML.   Table 3-4. XHTML Elements with Prohibitions   Element   Prohibition s    Cannot contain other a elements   Cannot contain img, object, big, small, sub, or sup elements   Cannot contain input, select, textarea, label, button, form, fieldset, iframe, or  isindex elements   Cannot contain other label elements   Cannot contain other form elements   a   pre   button   label   form      Additionally, some nesting restrictions are defined by descriptions in the XHTML specifications. As a  result, some nesting violations are not recognized by validators when applying XHTML document types,  while errors can be clearly identified when using HTML.   Unlike in HTML, texts cannot be provided directly in the XHTML body without wrapping them in  container elements  such as p . Such attempts usually lead to the error message “character data is not  allowed here” in the W3C Markup Validator  Chapter 14 .   Invalid Characters  Older HTML documents, especially the ones that were written in the first decade of the Web, are often  full of character entities. This holds true not only for those documents that used to represent non-Latin  characters but also for the ones containing special characters such as the copyright sign     or the  registered trademark sign  ® . These entities should be eliminated in XHTML  except in the case of a few   71    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   special characters, as discussed earlier . Using characters directly with UTF-8 encoding is strongly  recommended.   Dashes in Comments Are Limited  Double dashes can be provided only at the beginning and end of XHTML comments  Listing 3-24 .   Listing 3-24. A Comment in XHTML       Avoid Using Deprecated Elements  Although a large set of HTML elements can also be used in certain XHTML versions and variants  as  discussed earlier , the blackface, blockquote, embed, layer, noembed, and shadow deprecated elements  cannot. All of them can be replaced by style sheets except embed and noembed whose contents can be  provided with object. Moreover, there are elements that are allowed in XHTML 1.0 Transitional and  XHTML 1.0 Frameset but cannot be used in XHTML 1.0 Strict  Table 3-5 .   Table 3-5. Elements Not Allowed in XHTML 1.0 Strict Must Be Avoided   Deprecated in Favor of   object   Style sheets   Style sheets   ul   Style sheets   ul, nl   Style sheets   Style sheets   input element, CGI forms   Element   applet   basefont   center   dir   font   isindex   menu   s   u      72   Although menu elements are replaced by ul elements in XHTML 1.0 Strict and XHTML 1.1  or nl in   XHTML2 , they can be used again in XHTML5.   The most arguable elements are i and b that are not deprecated and can be used in every XHTML  version to create italic and bold texts, respectively. However, they are purely presentational elements  without structural meaning. Although most user agents render the appropriate structural elements  em    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   and strong  similarly if not identically to the basic character formatting elements i and b, em and strong  are preferred.   Applying the strictest set of XHTML elements supported by most or all XHTML versions and variants   is a good practice. Certainly, new elements introduced in newer versions such as XHTML5 can also be  used, but only if the browser support becomes adequate and proved.   As a general rule, XHTML 1.0 Strict hand coders can easily learn and apply other XHTML document   types too, simply because they eliminate obsolete elements.   Avoid Deprecated Attributes  Several HTML attributes have been deprecated in XHTML in favor of other attributes or style sheets   Table 3-6 .    Table 3-6. Attributes Deprecated in XHTML   Deprecated in Favor of   Attribute   alink   align   background   border   color   compact   face   height   language   link   name   noshade   nowrap   size   start   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   id attribute   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   type attribute   73    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Attribute   text   type   value   version   vlink   width7   Deprecated in Favor of   Style sheets   Style sheets   Style sheets   DTDs   Style sheets   Style sheets   Data Types   The data types that can be used in element contents and attribute values are defined by DTDs and  specifications of the markup language being used. While many elements and attributes allow most  Unicode characters  such as the p, div, and section elements , there are elements and attributes that  have specific restrictions. Evidently, a link in the href attribute of an a element must contain a valid URL  or file path  Listing 3-25 . Knowing the allowed values is important to provide valid attribute values. For  example, the width attribute of an img element should be a value expressed by a number, with or without  the unit px or %, and cannot be in any unit  Listing 3-26 .   Listing 3-25. Correct and Incorrect URLs in the href Attribute Value                    Listing 3-26. Correct and Incorrect Width Attribute Values               <!-- incorrect  not  allowed unit  -->   Characters might be illegal in certain data types because of many reasons, such as if they are reserved or  unsafe.   HTML elements and attributes can contain a variety of data types, such as case information, SGML  basic data types, text strings, URIs, colors, lengths, content types, language codes, character encodings,  single characters, dates and times, link types, media descriptors, script data, and style sheet data [31].   The syntax of the core markup element content values and attribute values are derived from SGML   tokens such as the following:       PCDATA: Parsed Character Data. Mixed content; in other words, an element can  contain any number of character data and or child elements in arbitrary order.                                                     7 It is deprecated on certain elements only  e.g., cannot be used on td, but allowed on img .   74    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5      CDATA: Character data. A sequence of characters from the document character   set and may include character entities. CDATA attribute values should not contain  leading or trailing whitespace characters. User agents replace character entities  with characters, replace carriage returns and tabs with a single space, and ignore  line feeds when interpreting CDATA attribute values. For script and style  elements, CDATA sections are treated as raw text and passed forward as is. The  end tag open delimiter <  is considered as the terminator of the element content.      NAME, ID: Identifier tokens that must begin with a letter  A–Z, a–z  and may be   followed by any number of letters, digits  0–9 , hyphens  - , underscores  _ ,  colons  : , and periods  .       NUMBER: Tokens containing a minimum of one digit  0–9 .   They have been introduced in the ISO 8879 standard [32], and they determine the allowed values of   the data types to be used in markup attributes such as URLs, text, numbers, and so on.   The PCDATA and CDATA data types are used mainly in XML applications and serialization,   including XHTML, RSS, Atom, and so on  Chapter 7 . SGML and XML Document Type Definition files  also use PCDATA and CDATA for markup declarations.    Caution  In HTML,   is a bogus comment; that is, the sequence of characters ]]> is  considered as regular character data. In XHTML,   is a CDATA section; in other words, the  sequence of characters ]]> should be the mark for the end of the CDATA section. Otherwise, it will result in a  well-formedness error.    Naturally, there are many more data types in modern markup languages. The fundamental data   types of HTML5 are the following:       Text: A sequence of Unicode characters that does not contain U+0000 characters,  control characters other than space characters, or any permanently undefined  Unicode characters.    String: An arbitrary mixture of text and character references.            Browsing-context name: A string that does not start with an underline  _  character   Token: A string without space characters.   and is at least one character long.      Browsing-context name or keyword: A string that is either a browsing-context   name or one of the following literal strings: _blank, _self, _parent, or _top.    ID: A string without space characters that is at least one character long.         Name: A string without space characters that is at least one character long.     Hash-name reference: A string that starts with a  character.   75    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5      Number: Integer, positive integer, non-negative integer, floating-point number,   positive floating-point number, or non-negative floating-point number.      Date and time: A date-time as defined in RFC 3339, with the additional constraints   that the literal letters T and Z must always be uppercase and that the date + full  year is described as four or more digits representing a number greater than 0.       URL: A valid IRI reference as defined in RFC 3987.     MIME type: A string identifying a valid MIME media type defined by RFC 2046.     Character encoding name: A character encoding a name or alias from the IANA   registry.      Meta-charset string: A string with the following parts  in that order : the literal   string text html;, one or more optional space characters, the literal string  charset=, and a character encoding name  HTML5  or the string UTF-8  XHTML5 .     Refresh value: Either a non-negative integer or a string containing a non-negative  integer, a ; character, one or more space characters, the string url=, and finally a  URL  in that order .      Default-style name: A string.     Media-query list: A media query list as defined in the W3C specification “Media   Queries” [33].   Language tag: A language tag as defined in BCP 47 [34].   List of key labels: An ordered set of unique space-separated tokens, each of which  is exactly one Unicode codepoint in length.      Dropzone value: An unordered set of unique space-separated tokens, each of  which is one of the values copy, move, or link, or any string with a minimum of  three characters, beginning with the literal string s:  Plain Unicode string  or f:   File items . The default value is copy.   Functionbody: Any JavaScript code that is a FunctionBody production according  to ECMA 262.      Coordinates: Rectangle coordinates  four integers , circle coordinates  two   integers and a non-negative integer number , or polygon coordinates  minimum  six integers .   Sandbox allow keywords list: An unordered set of unique space-separated tokens  that can be the literal string allow-forms, allow-scripts, allow-top-navigation, or  allow-same-origin.   Pattern: A regular expression that is a JavaScript pattern production according to  ECMA 262.   E-mail address: Any string that matches the ABNF production 1*  atext   "."    "@" ldh-str 1*  "." ldh-str  , where atext is as defined in RFC 5322, and ldh- str is as defined in RFC 1034.                          76    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5      Color: A string exactly seven characters long, starting with a  character, followed   by six characters in the range 0–9, a–f, and A–F.   Markup Elements  The various versions and variants of HTML provide a different set of elements; in other words, they have  different vocabularies, although there is a large degree of overlapping  Table 3-7, historic versions not  included .    Fundamental markup elements have been introduced in the early versions of HTML, and later  versions gradually extended the set of elements. Some elements become obsolete over time and are  deprecated,8 removed, or replaced. Additionally, new specifications often introduce new elements. There  are 70 elements listed in the HTML 3.2 specification [35], 91 in HTML 4.01 [36], and more than 100 in  HTML5 [37].   There is a large similarity between the elements of the Transitional, Frameset, and Strict flavors of   HTML and that of their XHTML counterparts. XHTML 1.0 Frameset is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01  Frameset, the document type that provides the definition of frameset documents, which was a common  web feature of the late 1990s. XHTML 1.0 Transitional is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Transitional,  the document type that includes the presentational elements, such as center and font, that are excluded  from the Strict variant. XHTML 1.0 Strict is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Strict, which includes  strictly those elements that have not been deprecated.   The various XHTML versions and variants provide a different set of elements. There are 89 elements   in XHTML 1.0 Transitional, 92 in XHTML 1.0 Frameset, 78 in XHTML 1.0 Strict, 83 in XHTML 1.1, 99 in  XHTML 2.0, and more than 100 in XHTML5  the same as in HTML5  [38]. The applet, basefont, center,  dir, font, isindex, menu, s, strike, and u elements have been deprecated in XHTML 1.0. Consequently,  they can be used in XHTML 1.0 Transitional or XHTML 1.0 Frameset but not in XHTML 1.0 Strict or  above.9 This important fact has not been understood by many developers who applied the Transitional  variant of HTML4 or XHTML 1.0 for more than a decade. A Transitional variant, even if it is written free  of errors, is allowed to contain obsolete elements that have been deprecated in the specification with the  intention to indicate that these elements will be removed from future markup versions and thus should  not be used. In other words, millions of web sites have used a markup until recently that allowed  elements already obsoleted in HTML 4.01!   XHTML 1.0 Strict and XHTML 1.1 have a very similar set of elements. The most important   differences are that XHTML 1.1 introduced the Ruby elements and removed the access element. Prior to  XHTML 1.1, the lang attribute was used  instead of xml:lang, which is preferred today . The name  attribute for anchors and client-side maps was used until XHTML 1.0, which should be replaced by the  id attribute from XHTML 1.1. The essence of XHTML 1.1 is that elements are collected to modules,  making it possible to apply subsets of the full element set in environments with limited resources  for  example, mobile devices , known as XHTML modularization  as mentioned earlier in the chapter .    XHTML 2.0 has several elements that are not found in any other markup language, namely, action,   delete, di, dispatch, ev:listener, group, h, handler, insert, l, load, message, model, nl, output, range,  rebuild, recalculate, refresh, repeat, reset, revalidate, secret, section, select1, send, bseparator,  setfocus, setindex, setvalue, standby, submit, summary, switch, trigger, and upload. These elements  have been introduced in XHTML 2.0 but discontinued in  X HTML5. A few XHTML 2.0 elements have  been defined in XHTML 1.1, some of which have been included in  X HTML5, such as ruby, while others  have been excluded, such as rtc. The fundamental elements have been derived from earlier versions.                                                     8 Prior to HTML5  9 The only exception is menu that has become allowed again in HTML5 although with a new meaning.   77    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   The latest version of XHTML, XHTML5, has the same set of elements as HTML5, as mentioned   earlier. The most significant extension of markup elements and attributes in the past decade have been  realized in  X HTML5, especially because of the new structuring and multimedia elements that cannot  be used in any earlier versions.

Underlined text style   Unordered list   Variable   Video   +   +   Conditional line break   Preformatted text   Block vs. Inline Elements  To provide full control over different document sections, HTML elements are on different levels. Similar  to the character, paragraph, and document formatting levels used in word processors, HTML provides  tags with different scopes. Certain elements, known as inline elements, can be applied both on individual  characters and on strings, such as font features, italic or bold texts, subscripts, and superscripts.10 They  are usually placed in paragraphs  p  or divisions  div  that contain text and or inline elements. These  containers are the block elements that form the basic structure of web documents. These elements can  also be the containers of other block elements. Block-level elements have their own block margins,  width, and height properties that can be set independently from other parts of the document  see  Chapter 5 . Block-level elements are usually rendered on a new line. In contrast, inline elements are  treated as parts of the text flow and cannot have margins, cannot have width or height properties, and do  break across lines.   In Listing 3-27, the paragraph below the heading begins in a new line, because both h1 and p are   block-level elements. The emphasized text in the paragraph  between   and    is rendered  continuously and does not begin in a new line, because em is an inline element. While the div might have  margins  set from CSS , the em cannot.   Listing 3-27. Block vs. Inline Elements         Attention      View our  special offers  now!       Most HTML elements that can be used within the document body are classified as either block-level   elements or inline elements. There are some elements that can be used in both contexts  such as  buttons, objects, and scripts .                                                    10 Obsolete HTML elements used exclusively for character formatting should be substituted by CSS.   These styling elements have been removed from the Strict variants, and later from all other versions.    86    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Block-Level Elements  The following elements are handled as block-level elements in HTML5: article, aside, blockcode,  blockquote, body, button, canvas, caption, col, colgroup, dd, div, dl, dt, embed, fieldset, figcaption,  figure, footer, form, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, header, hgroup, hr, li, map, object, ol, output, p, pre, progress,  section, table, tbody, textarea, td, tfoot, th, thead, tr, ul, and video.   Inline Elements  Generally, inline elements can contain text or other inline elements only. They are usually rendered  within the current line. The inline elements of HTML5 are a, abbr, address, area, b, cite, code, del,  details, dfn, command, datalist, em, font, i, iframe, img, input, ins, kbd, label, legend, link, mark, meter,  nav, optgroup, option, q, samp, small, select, source, span, strong, sub, summary, sup, textarea, tt, u, time,  and var.   Elements That Can Be Either Block or Inline Elements  Elements such as button, del, iframe, ins, map, object, and script can be used as either block-level  elements or inline elements. If used as inline elements  e.g., within another inline element or a  paragraph , these elements should not contain any block-level elements.   Attributes  The HTML5 element attributes are summarized in Table 3-8 [39].   Table 3-8.

Window Event Attributes  HTML5 added several attributes to the body element that are used to perform an action on the browser  window. They are summarized in Table 3-10. In HTML 4, only the attributes onblur, onfocus, and onload  can be applied.   Table 3-10.

This model provides dynamic content access and updates as well as document styling for scripts [41].  The DOM can be considered a mechanism that makes web pages behave like applications [42]. The  DOM can be visualized as a tree structure for the hierarchy of markup elements within a document   Listing 3-28, Figure 3-2 .   Listing 3-28. A Well-Structured HTML Document                   A DOM example       <link rel="stylesheet"        type="text css"        href="main.css">   102    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5                  Paragraph content              Figure 3-2. The DOM tree of Listing 3-28      Improperly closed elements—and in many cases the missing closing tags—destroy the DOM   structure, which might have serious consequences, from disrupted layout to incorrect styling. Thanks to  the built-in error-handling feature of web browsers, many of such errors might be corrected on-the-fly  while rendering, but the intended structure can be presumed only. Developers should not rely on this  error-handling feature!   An HTML document usually consists of a document type declaration, a Formal Public Identifier,   and a link associating the document with the appropriate DTD in that order at the very beginning of the  file  except HTML5 documents that usually omit the last one . All HTML documents must have an html  root element11 that contains the document head and the document body, respectively [43].   The document head provides processing information and metadata relating to the whole  document. Background, font styles, margins, and other styles are generally defined here too.   The document body holds the content of the document. This can contain simple text, formatted   text, images, videos, applets, or dynamic content, for example. Block elements can be grouped with div  elements  Figure 3-3 , while inline contents can be delimited with span. A text that has the semantic  meaning of a paragraph should be provided by the p element.   In older versions of HTML, the usual structure looked like Listing 3-29.   Listing 3-29.

Overview                      HTML5 adds more semantics to the document stucture. Instead of using general purpose  divisions, it provides meaningful elements.                                                   Copyright   2011 John Smith. All rights reserved.                              Figure 3-4. Document structure in HTML5      The new structuring elements of HTML5 can be summarized as follows:       article: Articles, blog posts, forum posts, and so on   105    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5                       aside: Sidebars, such as cross-references to an article   section: Group of elements  typically with a header and a footer    header: The header of a section  usually with a title and maybe a short overview    hgroup:  Heading group of h1–h6 elements for subtitles, alternate titles, or taglines   footer: Footer information of the entire page or a part of it  consequently, there  might be more footer tags in a page    nav: Navigation elements   Naturally, not all these structuring elements can be used on all web pages, and they should be   applied accordingly.   Document Type Declaration  Since there are various versions of markup languages with different features, they should be handled  differently. As discussed earlier, elements of one document type are not necessarily allowed in others.  Thus, the appropriate rendering strongly relies on the identification of the document type being used.  A straightforward solution is the declaration of the document type in the top of the document that  associates it with a formally defined specification. The document type declaration can be defined by a  Formal Public Identifier  FPI  and the URI of the so-called Document Type Definition  DTD . These URIs  are used for identification, and they are not hyperlinks. This is a machine-readable way to express “this  document is HTML” or “this document is XHTML.” Most DTD driver files are provided by the World  Wide Web Consortium.   An FPI is a human-readable, descriptive name that identifies the HTML version, while the DTD   defines the location of the .dtd file  machine-readable grammar  on the W3C server  this file specifies  the rules the document type should follow .   You can see the general syntax of the HTML document type declaration in Listing 3-31. Note that   HTML5 has a streamlined DOCTYPE, as you will see.   Listing 3-31. General Syntax of Document Type Declaration   <!DOCTYPE root-element PUBLIC "FPI"    SYSTEM "URI"   >   The root element is html since it is the element opened first and closed last in HTML files  see “Core  Structure Elements” .   The various versions of HTML use similar syntax  except HTML5 :      HTML 2.0  historical, not used anymore           HTML 3.2  historical, not used anymore        106    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5      HTML 4.0 Transitional  should not be used    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR REC-html40 loose.dtd">     HTML 4.0 Frameset  obsolete, should not be used    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.0 Frameset  EN"   "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.0 Frameset  EN">      HTML 4.0 Strict   <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.0  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR REC-html40 strict.dtd">      HTML 4.01 Transitional  should not be used    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd">      HTML 4.01 Frameset  obsolete, should not be used    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 frameset.dtd">      HTML 4.01 Strict      HTML 4.01+RDFa   <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 strict.dtd">   <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01+RDFa 1.1  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org MarkUp DTD html401-rdfa11-1.dtd">      HTML5  DOCTYPE without DTD . Unlike the former, SGML-based HTML versions,  HTML5 requires neither an FPI nor a reference to a DTD. The document type can  be defined by the DOCTYPE declaration  . Since the text html  serialization of HTML5 is not SGML-based, HTML5 applies the document type for  mode selection only.       Core Structure Elements  HTML documents must contain one element that is the parent of all other elements, that is, the html  element. This element is called the root element. It has been standardized in the HTML 2.0 specification,  along with the other two fundamental structure elements, head and body.   The html root element contains all other elements within the document; in other words, the     starting tag and the   closing tag delimit the document.   107    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   The HTML Head  The head section of HTML documents is the container of processing information and metadata. The  document head should be provided between the   and   tags and precede the document  body.   Common elements in the HTML head  with one example for each  include the following:                   title element  required     Document title    meta elements12  optional, one or more    <meta name="keywords" content="web standardization, valid XHTML5, valid   XHTML+RDFa, tableless CSS layout, W3C validation, WCAG, semantic web,   accessibility">   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" media="all" href="alt2.css"    link elements  optional, one or more    title="Alternate style 2">   script elements  optional, one or more         The document body is the main content of a web document. It might contain both block and inline   elements including, but not limited to, plain and formatted text, lists, headers, paragraphs, divisions,  images, objects, forms, and tables. Certain prohibitions, however, determine which elements can be  included in other elements.   Element Nesting  To maintain a logical document structure, certain HTML elements cannot contain all types of data or  elements. For example, elements of a table such as table body and data cells should be within a table; the  ins element cannot contain block-level content when it is used as an inline element, and so on. Some  elements cannot contain other enclosed elements of the same kind  e.g., form, label . The content  delimited by some elements can be a certain type of data only  e.g., script, style .    Certain nesting rules require the knowledge of content categories. In HTML5, the following kinds of   content are differentiated [44]:      Metadata content: Content that determines the presentation or behavior of the   page content, sets up the relationship of the document with other documents, or  provides additional information.   base, command, link, meta, noscript, script, style, title       Flow content: Most elements that are used in the document and application body  are referred to as flow content.                                                     12 See Chapter 7 for details.   108    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   a, abbr, address, area  as a descendant of a map element , article, aside, audio, b,  bdi, bdo, blockquote, br, button, canvas, cite, code, command, datalist, del, details,  dfn, div, dl, em, embed, fieldset, figure, footer, form, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, header,  hgroup, hr, i, iframe, img, input, ins, kbd, keygen, label, map, mark, math, menu, meter,  nav, noscript, object, ol, output, p, pre, progress, q, ruby, s, samp, script, section,  select, small, span, strong, style  only with the scoped attribute , sub, sup, svg,  table, textarea, time, u, ul, var, video, wbr, and text   Sectioning content: Content that defines the scope of headings and footers.

Empty elements, such as img or hr, cannot contain other elements. Some  elements have restrictions for not only the elements but also the data types they can contain  for  example, the contents of script elements should be CDATA . Violating the nesting order of element  might destroy the DOM structure of the document, which makes rendering unreliable, risking the  usability of the web page.   XHTML Document Structure  XHTML document structure is similar to that of HTML in the sense that there is a head and a body  section; however, additional restrictions apply. Since XHTML documents are XML documents too, they  begin with an XML declaration not known in HTML. Moreover, there are several document types and  profiles to choose from, depending on the main purpose of the web document being developed.   112    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   XML Declaration  The very first line in XHTML documents is usually the optional XML prolog  its application is  recommended by W3C . The most commonly used XML declaration looks like Listing 3-32.   Listing 3-32. The Most Commonly Used XML Declaration       No content is allowed to precede the declaration  except an optional byte-order mark .  Although the character encoding is optional only, it is highly recommended.  Some older browsers cannot handle the XML declaration. The web page might become invisible, or   the content is rendered incorrectly  for example, in IE6 . IE7 ignores the XML prolog and correctly  renders the content in Strict Mode  discussed in Chapter1 .   Document Type Declaration  Similar to HTML, XHTML documents use a specific document type declaration13 to identify the  document type being used.   Generally, transforming an XHTML document into another XHTML document type is   straightforward, especially if XHTML 1.0 Strict elements are applied exclusively. However, care must be  taken when performing such an action because of the differences between the specifications. XHTML  1.0 Transitional is much more permissive, and changing the document type declaration of these  documents will probably result in numerous errors that should be justified in order to obtain a valid  XHTML 1.0 Strict, XHTML 1.1, or XHTML5 document.   Until recently, the former Quality Assurance Interest Group at W3C maintained a “Recommended   list of Doctype declarations” [45]. Although it could be considered a “list of valid DTDs,” it is not  complete; thus, some of the newer as well as the most up-to-date document types are not listed  e.g.,  Mobile Profile, XHTML 2.0, or XHTML+RDFa , partly because the group closed in 2007. This does not  affect the application or validation of such documents. Some non-W3C validators use the previous list  and give warnings if a document type missing from that list is used.    Such warnings can be considered as false positives in many cases, because some of the less used,   earlier DTDs as well as the latest document types are not on the list.   The document type declaration of the various XHTML versions and variants are summarized here:      General documents   XHTML Basic 1.0           <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML Basic 1.0  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml-basic xhtml-basic10.dtd">   XHTML Basic 1.1   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC   "-  W3C  DTD XHTML Basic 1.1  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml-basic xhtml-basic11.dtd">                                                     13 Prior to XHTML5   113    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   XHTML 1.0 Transitional  should not be used    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">   XHTML 1.0 Frameset  obsolete, should not be used    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-frameset.dtd">   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML Basic 1.1  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml-basic xhtml-basic11.dtd">   XHTML 1.0 Strict   XHTML Basic 1.1   XHTML 1.1   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.1  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml11 DTD xhtml11.dtd">   XHTML 2.0  XHTML2   suspended [46]    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 2.0  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org MarkUp DTD xhtml2.dtd">   XHTML5  DOCTYPE without DTD        XHTML+RDFa   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org MarkUp DTD xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd">      Mobile profiles   XHTML Mobile Profile 1.0   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  WAPFORUM  DTD XHTML Mobile 1.0  EN"   "http:  www.wapforum.org DTD xhtml-mobile10.dtd">   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  WAPFORUM  DTD XHTML Mobile 1.1  EN"  "http:  www.openmobilealliance.org tech DTD xhtml-mobile11.dtd">   XHTML Mobile Profile 1.1   XHTML Mobile Profile 1.2   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  WAPFORUM  DTD XHTML Mobile 1.2  EN"  "http:  www.openmobilealliance.org tech DTD xhtml-mobile12.dtd">                                                      Mathematical markup   MathML 1.01   114    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5                                   <!DOCTYPE math SYSTEM   "http:  www.w3.org Math DTD mathml1 mathml.dtd">   <!DOCTYPE math PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD MathML 2.0  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR MathML2 dtd mathml2.dtd">   MathML 2.0   MathML 3.0   <!DOCTYPE math PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD MathML 3.0  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org Math DTD mathml3 mathml3.dtd">      Graphical markup   SVG 1.0   <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD SVG 1.0  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org TR 2001 REC-SVG-20010904 DTD svg10.dtd">   <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD SVG 1.1 Tiny  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org Graphics SVG 1.1 DTD svg11-tiny.dtd">   <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD SVG 1.1 Basic  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org Graphics SVG 1.1 DTD svg11-basic.dtd">   SVG 1.1 Tiny   SVG 1.1 Basic   SVG 1.1 Full   <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD SVG 1.1  EN"   "http:  www.w3.org Graphics SVG 1.1 DTD svg11.dtd">      Compound documents   XHTML + MathML + SVG  using XHTML as the host    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC    "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org 2002 04 xhtml-math-svg xhtml-math-svg.dtd">   XHTML + MathML + SVG  using SVG as the host    <!DOCTYPE svg:svg PUBLIC   "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org 2002 04 xhtml-math-svg xhtml-math-svg.dtd">   The Root Element in XHTML  All XML documents must contain a root element with the syntax shown in Listing 3-33.   115    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Listing 3-33. Pseudocode of the Root Element                .....            The root element of XHTML documents must be html. Furthermore, the root element must contain an  xmlns attribute to associate it with the XHTML namespace. The namespace URI is  http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml for XHTML 1.0 and XHTML5 documents, and it is  http:  www.w3.org 2002 06 xhtml2  for XHTML2 documents. Consequently, the most common XHTML  namespace declaration looks like Listing 3-34.   Listing 3-34. The Most Common XHTML Namespace Declaration       The natural language of XML documents is often identified by the xml:lang attribute of the html  element14  Listing 3-35 .   Listing 3-35. Common Use of the xml:lang Attribute       Namespace Declaration  Beyond the default XHTML namespace http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml, additional ones can also be used  in XHTML documents. For example, XHTML+RDFa documents often use additional namespaces for  semantic markup  for more details, see Chapter 7 . In the example shown in Listing 3-36, the namespace  of the FOAF Vocabulary Specification follows the default namespace declaration.   Listing 3-36.

Listing 3-37 shows an example.   Listing 3-37.

Listing 3-43. A Link to the Author     href="http:  www.example.com "  >   The favorites icon  favicon15 , a 16x16 pixel square icon by default, can be determined by the   shortcut icon or icon link  Listing 3-44 . The first one is supported in all browsers; however, it is not  declared in HTML specifications.   Listing 3-44. A Link to the Web Site Icon       Although the default image format is ICO, modern browsers support other formats too such as PNG,   animated PNG, JPEG, GIF, animated GIF, and SVG. They can be used in the form shown in Listing 3-45.   Listing 3-45. Link Examples for rel="icon"     href="http:  www.example.com image.ico"  >      href="http:  www.example.com image.pgn"  >      href="http:  www.example.com image.gif"  >    Tip  Since the attribute value icon was not standardized until HTML5 and browser support varies, it is a  common practice to declare the same icon file with both the shortcut icon and icon attribute values.   The files can also be 32x32 or 48x48 pixels in size with 8-, 24-, or 32-bit color depth. However,   because of the different browser support, the preferred format for favicons is the de facto file name and  type  favicon.ico  provided in the root directory of the web site. Note that the larger the resolution and  color depth, the longer the download time. File size should be kept within reasonable limits  see Chapter  9 for more on this .   The rel attribute is often used in other contexts as well. The microformats rel="license",   rel="nofollow", and rel="tag", for example, provide various metadata on  X HTML elements, most  commonly on the a element. Generally they are parts of the document body but are used for specific  purposes; thus, they are described later in Chapter 7.   In the head section of XHTML documents, further attribute values can also be used from   namespaces other than the default XHTML namespace. Listing 3-46 shows an example for that.                                                     15 Also known as bookmark icon, URL icon, shortcut icon, or web site icon   119    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Listing 3-46. Linking to an Additional Namespace   <link rel="foaf:primaryTopic" type="application rdf+xml" title="FOAF"   href="http:  www.example.com metadata foaf.rdf"  >   In this case, the FOAF namespace is also required to make the foaf:primaryTopic meaningful. The   declaration of the additional namespace should be provided on the html element, as discussed in the  previous section  Listing 3-36 .   The XHTML Body  The XHTML document body is similar to the HTML body from the document structuring point of view.  However, XHTML is case-sensitive. Consequently, the JavaScript event handler onload cannot be written  with the same camel case notation onLoad used in HTML. It should be in lowercase  Listing 3-47 .   Listing 3-47. Case-Sensitive Event Handler in XHTML       Moving from HTML to XHTML  A common task for web standardistas is to convert HTML documents into XHTML. However, with the  release of a brand new line of HTML, more and more web developers intend to use HTML5.16 There are  several reasons to use stricter markup. Although some changes to be made on HTML documents while  upgrading to XHTML are straightforward, there are significant differences between the two formats in  features and behavior that need to be considered. Since XHTML is the reformulation of HTML 4 as an  application of XML, it can be used as an XML-conforming language with all of its attendant benefits:               Strict markup: Unlike HTML, XHTML complies with strict conventions. As a  result, there are no missing end tags, overlapping elements, or unnecessary  attributes, just pure code. XHTML is well-formed and easy to write, interpret, and  read. Content and styles are separated.   Easy introduction of new markup: New elements and attributes can be added  quite easily through XHTML modules.      XML conformance: As such, they are readily viewed, edited, and validated with   standard XML tools.      DOM choice: Applets and scripts, and other applications can apply either the   HTML Document Object Model or the XML Document Object Model.   Interoperability: As web markup languages evolve, documents that conform to  XHTML conventions will be more likely to interoperate within different user  agents of the future.   Additionally, backward- as well as forward-compatibility can be ensured with appropriate markup.                                                     16 It is important to keep in mind that HTML5 can also be written in XML-style syntax, known as  XHTML5, that use the same vocabulary, and provides well-formed XML files.   120    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Specific Markup Languages  Beyond the general-purpose HTML and XHTML markup languages, there are more specific languages  such as the ones that represent vector graphics  SVG , mathematical annotations  MathML , multimedia  presentations  SMIL , or textual information synchronized with other media  TTML [47] . The  vocabulary of such languages is used either in a specific file type or embedded in general-purpose  markup. The following sections provide an overview of SVG and MathML.   SVG  In contrast to raster graphic formats such as GIF, PNG, or JPEG that have been handled by browsers for  years, native support of vector graphics did not appear until the introduction of HTML5. Although the  Vector Markup Language  VML  and the Precision Graphics Markup Language  PGML  appeared in 1998,  they were soon followed by Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG  in 1999; however, implementers had to wait  for a decade.   SVG is an XML-based markup for describing two-dimensional static and dynamic  animated or  interactive  vector graphics [48]. The first version, SVG 1.0, became a W3C Recommendation in 2001,  followed by SVG 1.1 in 2003. Beyond the full version, SVG also has a Tiny specification and a Basic  specification optimized for mobile devices [49]. They are described as profiles of SVG 1.1. SVG Tiny 1.2  became a W3C Recommendation in 2008. The full version of SVG 1.2 has been stalled in the Working  Draft stage and dropped in favor of SVG 2.0, which is a completely new version with advanced support  for HTML5, CSS3, and Web Fonts  Chapter 9 . Because of the native SVG support in  X HTML5 along  with the increasing browser support, the SVG format has gradually gained popularity.17 Internet Explorer  9+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.1+, and Opera 9.5+ have native SVG rendering and embedding support and do  not require a plugin for SVG images.    Caution  The browser support for SVG in modern browsers, which do not require a plug-in for displaying SVG, is  different for each embedding method  inline, via img, via object  and feature  SVG effects, SVG in SMIL animation,  SVG filters, SVG in CSS background, and SVG fonts .    Most browsers that support SVG do not render SVG ﬁles unless they are served as image svg+xml.  The most common rendering error with embedded SVG files is that they are served with an incorrect  MIME type.   SVG is suitable for logos, graphs, geographical information systems, and so on. The major benefits   of the SVG format can be summarized as follows:       Accessibility: Images are often magnified by mobile users as well as for the visually  impaired. SVG images are scalable without distortions or quality loss. Moreover, in  SVG, text is rendered as text. Textual equivalents of objects can also be developed.     Optimal file size: Although it depends on  image content complexity, SVG files are   generally smaller in size than their bitmap equivalents.                                                    17 Although it can be used in XHTML 1.x 2.0 too.   121    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5           Scriptability:  All feat ures  of  SVG i mages  can  be mani pulated  through  JavaScript  and the DOM.   Animation: SVG elements and element groups can also be animated without  scripting. This can be achieved by using Synchronized Multimedia Integration  Language  SMIL  together with SVG.    Note  SMIL is an XML markup language that defines markup for media synchronization, layout, animations,  visual transitions, and media embedding. It supports presentations with text, images, audio, video, and links to  other SMIL presentations. SMIL is a W3C Recommendation [50].   Syntax  The root element of both embedded and inline SVG images is svg. Listing 3-48 shows an example.   Listing 3-48. The svg Root Element               The namespace prefix can also be specified on the xmlns attribute. Doing so, the corresponding   namespace is not the default namespace. Consequently, an explicit namespace prefix must be assigned  to all elements such as in Listing 3-49.   Listing 3-49. Explicit Namespace Prefix               Both examples draw a rectangle using the rect element with a top-left positioning  x, y , dimensions   width, height , and optional horizontal and vertical corner radii  rx, ry . If length units are omitted, they  are assumed to be in pixels. The default ﬁll color for such objects is black, which can be overridden by  the fill attribute.   Other geometrical shapes can be drawn in SVG similarly. Circles, for example, can be declared by a   horizontal and vertical center and a radius  Listing 3-50 .   Listing 3-50. A Circle in SVG       For ellipses, a horizontal and a vertical center, as well as a horizontal and a vertical radius, are   required  Listing 3-51 .   122    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Listing 3-51. An Ellipsis in SVG       The svg element can contain any of the following elements, in any order [51]: animation elements    animate, animateColor, animateMotion, animateTransform, set , descriptive elements  desc, metadata,  title , shape elements  circle, ellipse, line, path, polygon, polyline, rect , structural elements  defs,  g, svg, symbol, use , gradient elements  linearGradient, radialGradient , a, altGlyphDef, clipPath,  color-profile, cursor, filter, font, font-face, foreignObject, image, marker, mask, pattern, script,  style, switch, text, and view.   Embedding  SVG images can be embedded in the markup by using the img or object element or by writing the SVG  code directly into the markup  inline SVG .   The first approach applies the markup element img, which is used for other images such as JPEG or   PNG  Listing 3-52 .   Listing 3-52. Embedding SVG with the img Element       However, this embedding type has become supported in browsers with native SVG support only   recently. In browsers and browser versions that do not support SVG embedding via the img element, the  object element can be used  it cannot be ensured that users have an SVG plug-in installed . Listing 3-53  shows an example.   Listing 3-53. Embedding SVG Using object               The disadvantage of the technique is that an image is provided as a general object rather than an   image, which is not optimal from the semantic point of view: the meaning of an element representing an  image is logically provided by the img element with more specific information about the content. The  major advantage is that it displays the alternate  in this case PNG  version of the image in browsers that  cannot display SVG. Moreover, object elements are included in the DOM, which allows the SVG image to  be scripted.   The third option for providing SVG content is to write it directly into the XHTML or HTML5 markup.   The major risk associated with the direct SVG embedding in XHTML is that XHTML documents  containing inline SVG files should be valid, served as application xml or application xml+xhtml, and  have an XHTML DOCTYPE. Otherwise, the SVG images are not displayed in the browser. Moreover, if  XHTML documents are served correctly for browsers with a real XML parsing, Internet Explorer does not  render the document at all  not only the SVG images .18 This problem does not exist in HTML5, where  direct SVG embedding is a native feature.                                                     18 This problem can be eliminated by specifying the MIME type text html for Internet Explorer and  application xml for other browsers on the server.   123    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Because of these issues, providing external SVG ﬁles is generally a better solution especially if the   same file  such as a logo  is used throughout the site.   There are nonstandardized approaches called SVG Support Libraries such as the JavaScript API   “Raphaël” [52]. It supports SVG and VML in a manner that all graphical objects are also DOM objects,  with the potential to attach JavaScript event handlers. Raphaël provides a cross-browser solution;  however, it requires JavaScript to be enabled and applies a programmer interface via JavaScript rather  than SVG markup. The advantage of Raphaël is that it provides VML for IE8 or earlier and provides SVG  for all browsers with SVG support.   MathML  The Mathematical Markup Language  MathML  is an XML application for describing mathematical  annotations on the Web. It provides both content and structure, making it possible to index and process  equations.   The first version of the Mathematical Markup Language, MathML 1.0, has become a W3C   Recommendation in 1998 [53] and slightly modified in 1999 as MathML 1.01 [54]. After three years of  development, MathML2 has obtained the Recommendation status in 2001, which has been further  improved as the second edition until 2003 [55]. After recognizing the limitations of the second version,  several new features have been introduced in MathML3, such as advanced line breaking and  indentation, elementary math notation, alignment of Content MathML with OpenMath, support for bi- directional languages, new attributes for the math tag, semantic annotations, interaction with the host  environment, linking, and new elements such as mglyph and mpadded [56].   MathML is supported by a variety of applications including web pages, e-books, screen readers,   Braille displays, equation editors, ink input devices, and e-learning and computational software tools.  However, the rendering engine implementation for MathML varies, and no browser provides full  MathML support.   Internet Explorer has no native MathML support, and the MathPlayer plug-in has been used for  versions up to IE8. Unfortunately, MathPlayer does not work under IE9. Native rendering support for  MathML is available in Gecko-based browsers such as Firefox and Camino from the first versions and in  Safari from version 5.1. Opera supports MathML since version 9.5. As of 2011, Chrome has no support  for MathML, but WebKit support is in development.    Syntax  MathML has presentational, content, and mixing markup elements. There are two types of flavor for  MathML markup. The first one focuses on the display of equations, known as Presentation MathML. The  second, Content MathML, stresses the semantic meaning of the mathematical annotation.   Similar to XHTML, there are two types of elements in MathML: the ones with the start and end tags   and the empty elements that are self-closing. However, the ratio of empty elements is much higher in  MathML than in XHTML. Elements can have optional attributes that consist of a name and a value  the  latter one is quoted in double or single quotes . The majority of MathML attribute values must be in a  predetermined format such as a positive integer or the keyword true.   In MathML there are container elements such as mrow  a group of subexpressions  and token   elements such as mi  identifier; i.e., a name of a constant, a variable, or a function . The element mo  represents an operator  e.g., + , a fence  e.g., { , or a separator  e.g., , . Numeric literals are specified by  mn. The proper use of mi, mo, and mn is vital to provide adequate information for rendering engines to  apply the correct typographic rules. Containers can contain other elements only while token elements  delimit plain-text characters, special entity references, or symbols  the smallest units with meaning .  Listing 3-54 shows an example.   124    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Listing 3-54. A Simple Example for Container and Token Elements in MathML         a      +      b       Entity references begin with an ampersand  &  and end with a semicolon  ; . Beyond keywords such   as &alpha;, a numeric format referring to the Unicode codepoint of the symbol is also allowed. More  than 1,800 symbols are supported.   The MathML namespace is http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML. It can be declared in two ways:   using the xmlns attribute or an attribute with an xmlns prefix. In the first case, the default namespace  applies to the element on which it is provided, as well as all child elements  Listing 3-55 .   Listing 3-55. A Presentation MathML Document Fragment Applying the MathML Namespace              x      =                                 -            b                   &xB1;                                                  b                2                           -                             4                &x2062;                 a                &x2062;                 c                                                         2          &x2062;           a           125    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   This is identical to the Content notation in Listing 3-56.

For example, the namespace and the prefix are declared on the body element, as shown in Listing 3-57.   Listing 3-57. Namespace and Prefix Declaration on the body       which adds meaning to mathematical notations such as the ones in Listing 3-58.   Listing 3-58. An Example for Using the MathML Prefix                x         +         y            Embedding  Since MathML is an XML language, it can be directly embedded into XML files, including XHTML  see  the next section . Because of the lack of support for namespaces, MathML embedding was not  supported by HTML versions up to 4.01. HTML5 is the first version of HTML that supports MathML.   Combinations, Profiles, and Mixed-Namespace Documents  Several newly developed web site features are very useful but not required for basic documents. These  technologies are defined by various specifications that can be used as the extensions of certain versions  of  X HTML. One of them combines markup and additional semantics, while another supports  mathematical markup and vector graphics within  X HTML documents. Some of these compound  documents have their own DTDs they can be validated against and namespaces19 that provide  containers for the context of identifiers, including uniquely named elements and attributes.     X HTML+RDFa  The need for publishing semantically meaningful structured data, such as metadata in RDFa, is not  recent. RDFa in XHTML became a World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  Recommendation on 14  October, 2008 [57]. XHTML+RDFa  Extensible Hypertext Markup Language + Resource Description  Framework in attributes  is an extended version of the XHTML markup language for supporting RDF  through a collection of attributes and processing rules in the form of well-formed XML documents. This                                                    19 By utilizing namespaces, XHTML documents can provide extensibility by including fragments from  other XML-based languages such as SVG and MathML. This option was the privilege of XHTML  languages, and was not supported by HTML before HTML5.   127    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   combination is one of the most advanced markup codes available today. XHTML+RDFa provides the  option to develop Semantic Web content by embedding rich semantic markup. Version 1.1 of the  language is a superset of XHTML 1.1, integrating the attributes according to RDFa Core 1.1. In other  words, it is RDFa support through XHTML Modularization. The RDFa Core 1.1 specification describes  how attributes can be used to express structured data in any markup language, with an emphasis on  HTML  instead of XHTML , SVG, the Open Document Format, and other web-enabled document  formats [58]. If the host language is XHTML, it is called XHTML+RDFa 1.1 [59].   The RDFa markup in XHTML+RDFa reuses the markup code, thus eliminating the need for   unnecessary duplications. XHTML+RDFa can provide machine-readable metadata within the markup  code, which makes additional user functionalities available. Most important of all, actions can be  performed automatically that enable up-to-date publishing, structured searches, and sharing [60].   XHTML+RDFa is not widely distributed yet, probably because of the lack of support in authoring  tools and content management systems [61]. However, there is a good tendency, especially because of  the introduction of native RDFa support in  X HTML5. Although the specification HTML+RDFa 1.1 is  primarily an extension of HTML5, it describes rules and guidelines for applying RDFa, not only in  HTML5 but also in HTML 4.01 and XHTML5 [62].   Listing 3-59 presents an XHTML+RDFa skeleton document.   Listing 3-59.

It was written by         John Smith .                  The RDFa notation is described in Chapter 7.   XHTML-Print  XHTML-Print is defined in the W3C Recommendation “Modularization of XHTML” [19]. This profile can  be used in printing environments without installing printer-specific drivers. XHTML-Print can also be  useful for mobile devices and low-cost printers that often come with a lack of large  full-page  buffers  and that generally print from top-to-bottom and left-to-right with portrait orientation.   The XHTML-Print document structure is based on the XHTML 1.0 specification. However,   application and usage restrictions apply for images, styles, and forms.   128    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   XHTML + MathML + SVG  One of the easiest ways to demonstrate the power of XML is to create mixed-namespace documents.  General and mathematical markup as well as vector graphics can be described within the same  document by the XHTML + MathML + SVG profile. This profile combines XHTML 1.1, MathML 2.0, and  SVG 1.1.    The host language of XHTML + MathML + SVG documents can be either XHTML or SVG.

Even if there are thousands of resources on the latest markup language and the browser  support for its features are gradually growing, rendering web pages written in the most up-to-date  markup always involves some risks.   The Transitional variants of HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 have been developed to ease the work of   web developers by providing features whose replacements have already been planned  tagged as  deprecated elements . Their purpose was to give developers time to change obsolete markup, not to  maintain them. The Traditional variants intended to provide a way to make the transition to modern  web standards. Frameset documents are contradictory with the philosophy of XHTML. Consequently,  the Frameset variant of XHTML 1.0 had a purpose similar to that of the Transitional variant. Both  variants have been designed with backward compatibility in mind. In other words, XHTML 1.0 Strict  should have been used exclusively after its introduction wherever possible. Although many content  authors have done so, error-free markup has always been very rare. But what is the point of applying a  strictly regulated markup in implementations full of errors? In fact, web developers are not entirely to  blame. Web developers often have to deal with incorrect markup in the form of third-party and CMS- generated dynamic content based on templates that are not standard-compliant.   The potential for modularization in XHTML 1.1 has not been exploited either. XHTML 2.0 has been   criticized by web developers, and W3C has been pushed to suspend the development of the  specification.   Because of the new, advanced features introduced in  X HTML5, HTML5 can be recommended but  with the extended attention of gradually improving browser support. For conventional web documents,  there is no reason to change a valid XHTML 1.0 Strict markup to HTML5 unless some new features  introduced in the latter one would be essential for the content.   The Benefits of XHTML 1.x over HTML 4.x  In spite of the advantages of strict XML codes, it took several years for developers to realize the power of  XHTML and to implement XHTML instead of HTML. Both HTML and XHTML have their advantages and  disadvantages  Table 3-17 .   Table 3-17. HTML vs. XHTML   Benefits of HTML   Benefits of XHTML      Backward compatibility     Well-known syntax     Error-tolerance     “Loose” syntax that might be convenient for   some developers  permissive nesting, omission  of certain tags and attributes       Strict XML syntax, well-formed markup     Easier maintenance     Direct integration with other XML vocabularies,   e.g., SVG, MathML      XML processing     Forced elimination of presentational markup      It is easy to see that some HTML features that claimed to be advantageous are not necessarily real   benefits because precise, strict markup should always be considered better than loose markup.    131    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   The Benefits of HTML5 over HTML 4.x and XHTML  The latest version of HTML overcomes several limitations and inconsistencies of earlier HTML versions  and XHTML. The new parsing rules of HTML5 are not based on SGML, which makes parsing more  flexible and improves compatibility. The new elements provide more sophisticated document  structuring  article, aside, audio, bdo, canvas, command, datalist, details, embed, figcaption, figure,  footer, header, hgroup, keygen, mark, meter, nav, output, progress, rp, rt, ruby, section, source, summary,  time, video, wbr  and new types of form controls  datetime, email, url, search, number, range, tel, color .  Obsolete markup elements have been dropped, including acronym, applet, basefont, big, center, dir,  font, frame, frameset, isindex, noframes, strike, and tt. New attributes have been introduced, such as  the id, tabindex, and hidden global attributes, and the custom data attribute data-*. The charset  attribute on the meta element and the async attribute on the script element have been improved. Inline  SVG and MathML can be embedded in text html documents.   HTML5 is recommended by a large share of developers as well as W3C since it fulfills all common   user requirements and supports modern media that is suitable for most applications.   Alternatives to Web Markup  Although the lion’s share of web documents are published in  X HTML files, forms, brochures, flyers,  posters, animations, source codes, presentations, and office documents are often provided in other  formats such as in the ones indexed by Google [63]:      Adobe Flash  .swf      Adobe Portable Document Format  .pdf      Adobe PostScript  .ps      Autodesk Design Web Format  .dwf      Basic source code  .bas      C C++ source code  .c, .cc, .cpp, .cxx, .h, .hpp      Google Earth  .kml, .kmz      GPS eXchange Format  .gpx      Hancom Hanword  .hwp         Microsoft Excel  .xls, .xlsx      Microsoft PowerPoint  .ppt, .pptx      Microsoft Word  .doc, .docx      OpenOffice presentations  .odp      OpenOffice spreadsheet  .ods      OpenOffice text  .odt       Java source code  .java    Perl source code  .pl    132    CHAPTER 3  MARKUP LANGUAGES: MORE THAN HTML5   Python source code  .py          Rich Text Format  .rtf, .wri       Text  .ans, .asc, .cas, .txt, .text    Always use the appropriate file type for web publishing.  X HTML documents are preferred for   general contents and should be used whenever possible. With the introduction of HTML5, the share of  documents published as markup has become larger. HTML5—especially empowered by CSS3 style  sheets—has all the features to create animations instead of Flash, presentations instead of PowerPoint  presentations, and so forth. Still, editable documents should not be converted into markup.  Downloading a Word document and modifying it to fit your needs can be very convenient. Printable  documents that need to be signed only are frequently provided in PDF. Special file types are confusing  and cannot be processed by user agents.20 It is the web author’s responsibility to provide documents in  the right file format.   Summary  In this chapter, you learned about the versions and variants of markup languages, which is beneficial for  many reasons. First, it is required to know the history of markup languages to become capable of  choosing the most suitable markup for your projects. Second, the relationship between these markup  languages is vital when moving from one document type to another. Third, becoming familiar with the  vocabulary of HTML and XHTML languages can be useful not only for comparison but also to ensure  that you use only those elements and attributes that are allowed in the chosen document type.   Error-free markup code is among the most important features of standard-compliant web sites, but   its full potential can be used only if it is served with proper settings. The next chapter will discuss the  basics of server configuration, the most common content types, and the URIs used to query and link web  sites.    References  1.

Web server configuration has a significant impact on web site appearance,  operation, and behavior. Documents should be served with the proper media type and character  encoding. Content negotiation can be used to serve various document versions to browsers supporting  the corresponding media types. XHTML documents can be served as either HTML or XML, but there is a  huge difference in processing. XML files are processed by XML parsers that are far more error sensitive  than SGML parsers. XHTML served as XML involves the risk that the document cannot be rendered at  all. On the other hand, backward-compatible serving cannot use the benefits of strict XML markup.  There are several aspects of sending HTML and XHTML from the server to the rendering engine, all of  which should be considered to achieve proper settings.   In this chapter, you will learn how to configure your web site, browser, and server in order to serve   web documents correctly. Becoming familiar with the most important MIME types is crucial for properly  serving web documents and the files used by them, for example, style sheets, images, audio and video  files, ZIP archives, and office documents. Beyond Internet media types, you will also learn domain  configuration; the difference between URIs, URLs, and URNs; the application of base directories; and  practices to eliminate file extensions.   The HTTP Header  The foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol   HTTP . It is a networking protocol that functions as a request-response protocol in a client-server  computing model. In this model, a typical client is a web browser, while an application that runs on the  host of a web site is a server. During each query, the client submits an HTTP request message to the  server. In return, the server sends a response message to the client that contains additional data, such as  completion status information about the request, which is sent along with web documents from the  server to the user agent. These header fields form the HTTP header. The header fields determine the  parameters of the HTTP communication. HTTP requests are used to indicate which content types and  character sets are acceptable  Accept, Accept-Charset , the date and time the message was sent  Date ,  the domain name  Host , a string representing a user agent  User-Agent , and so on.   As you can see in Listing 4-1, HTTP responses provide the name of the server  Server , an alternate   location for the returned data  Content-Location , and the date and time after which the response  expires  Expires . The Vary field confirms whether the cached response can be used rather than repeat  the request. The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project  P3P  policy can be set by the P3P field. An  identifier of a specific version of the resource is provided by ETag. These are the most common HTTP  header fields, but there are many more, all of which are described by RFC 4229 [1].    139    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   Listing 4-1. HTTP Header Example   HTTP 1.1 200 OK  Date: Fri, 10 Sep 2010 10:05:08 GMT  Server: Apache 2.2.16  Unix  PHP 5.3.3  Content-Location: index.html  Vary: negotiate,accept-language,accept-charset  TCN: choice  P3P: policyref=http:  example.com p3p.xml  Cache-Control: max-age=21600  Expires: Fri, 10 Sep 2010 16:05:08 GMT  Last-Modified: Fri, 21 Aug 2009 22:18:49 GMT  ETag: "3668bab8;37e77d1c"  Accept-Ranges: bytes  Content-Length: 11537  Connection: close  Content-Type: text html; charset=UTF-8  Content-Language: en   Internet Media Types  MIME   Internet media types  also known as MIME types or content-types  determine the way browsers handle  web documents. They are the file format identifiers of the Web. Thus, it is crucial to set the right media  type for web site components and web pages.   The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions  MIME  specification was introduced in 1992 by the   Internet Engineering Task Force  see Chapter 1 for more information on the IETF . Most specifications  are available as an IETF ISOC Request for Comments  RFCs . Although the original MIME concept was  designed to format non-ASCII messages,1 it is used in web browsers to make it possible to render or  process files other than  X HTML. The Internet media types are standardized by IANA registration   again, see Chapter 1 for more information on the IANA  [2]. Nonstandard MIME types and subtypes can  be recognized by their prefix, since they all begin with x-. Vendor-specific subtypes begin with vnd.,  while personal subtypes begin with prs..   Media types consist of a minimum of two parts: a type, a subtype, and optional parameters.  XML data can be assigned to two MIME media types: application xml and text xml. They are   defined by RFC 3023 [3]. Further, MIME types can be identified by the suffix +xml. The most important  media type from a web standardista’s point of view is the XML media type registered for XHTML,  namely, application xhtml+xml, which is defined in RFC 3236 [4]. Although XHTML documents could be  served with the application xhtml+xml, application xml, or text xml media type, W3C recommends  serving XHTML as XML with its dedicated MIME type application xhtml+xml [5]. However, using this  media type cannot guarantee proper XML handling without a correct XML header  see Chapter 3 for  more on XML headers . Furthermore, Internet Explorer 6 and earlier IE versions do not render the  contents of documents served as application xhtml+xml; instead, users are prompted to download the  file.                                                     1 The advanced version, S MIME, supports message encryption too.   140    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION    Caution  If the media type for an XHTML web page is set to text html, it will be parsed as HTML. If the media  type is set to application xhtml+xml, browsers will parse the document as XML. This is a huge difference!  XHTML files served with the proper MIME cannot contain a single error; otherwise, the document will not be  rendered, and the XML parser will give an error, as already mentioned earlier in Chapters 1 and 3.   Another registered XML media type is application atom+xml, which is used for the Atom   Syndication Format  see Chapter 8  defined by the proposed standard RFC 4287 [6]. Other frequently  used XML media types of this kind are application rss+xml  RSS; see Chapter 8 ,  application mathml+xml  MathML; see Chapter 3 , image svg+xml  SVG; see Chapter 3 , and  application xslt+xml  XSLT; see Chapter 5 . The full list of MIME types is published on the IANA web  site [7].   The Content-Type field of the HTTP header describes the data format as a MIME media type  Listing   4-2 . Additionally, this entry can also provide the character encoding of the document  as discussed  earlier in Chapter 2 .   Listing 4-2. A Content-Type Example   Content-Type: application xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8   The MIME type of web pages can also be set on the document level with the meta element such as in   Listing 4-3.   Listing 4-3. MIME Type Declaration with the meta Element       Generally, the MIME type text html is used for HTML documents, and the application xhtml+xml  is used for XHTML documents. However, XHTML documents can be served with both  as we’ll see later  in the chapter .   The wide variety of Internet media types is not fixed. Custom MIME types can also be registered at   IANA [8].   Common Media Types  The most common media types are listed in the next sections. Note that this is not a full list by any  means.

They are described in the following sections.   Serving XHTML as HTML   In the early days of the Web, HTML was the exclusive markup language. After several years, new  innovations appeared that could not have been covered by HTML. XML rules have been added to it,  creating XHTML, a new line of markup languages. These rules are the ones that should also be applied  when converting HTML documents to XHTML, as discussed earlier in Chapter 3.   However, the vocabulary of HTML 4.01 has been more or less preserved; thus, it is similar to that of   XHTML 1.0. Consequently, XHTML documents can be served as HTML to rendering engines. This  approach provides backward compatibility. Media types can be used to request browsers to handle  XHTML as HTML instead of XML. If the media type of an XHTML document is defined as text html, the  rendering engine will parse the web page as if it were HTML. If the media type is given as  application xhtml+xml, browsers will process the document as XML.   Several server and server-side scripting platforms  PHP, ASP, and so on  apply the text html media  type for web content by default. The “dirty secret” of XHTML is that several browsers with an XML parser  treat documents served as text html with XHTML syntax and DOCTYPE as HTML.3 But backward  compatibility comes at a price: the impressive features of XML cannot be used at all in XHTML served  this way. And what is the point of applying strict rules if documents cannot use their full potential?  Where backward compatibility is not a major concern, the solution is to serve XHTML as XML.   Serving XHTML as XML   Errors are not accepted at all in many environments such as programming languages. Code reliability  strongly depends on markup structure and correctness. The browsers’ behavior of refusing to render  invalid XHTML markup might seem annoying; however, the browsers have a really good reason to do so.  HTML documents full of errors are being processed by guessing the intentions of the developers.  Browsers cannot succeed with this task each time, and the results cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore,  the error tolerance of rendering engines provides various results.   There are scenarios where errors cannot be tolerated. In scientific publishing, for example, the   representation of mathematical equations should be reliable. If such documents are published on the  Web with MathML embedded in XHTML, errors cannot be tolerated because the consequences can cost  millions or be fatal. This is the main reason for the extreme error sensitivity of XML parsers.   Being an XML language family, XHTML was intended to be served as XML. This approach enjoys all   the benefits of XML. However, it also involves a serious risk. Web documents served as  application xhtml+xml request browsers to process them according to the rules of XML. Since invalid  XHTML markup is not rendered at all in web browsers, extended care should be taken when serving  XHTML as XML. One simple character at the wrong location in the source code results in an XML  parsing error message instead of the web page content  as already hinted in Chapter 1 . Probably this is  one of the reasons why HTML has always been preferred by a large share of content authors and  developers. However, real web standardistas should not be afraid of authoring pure XHTML code. If you                                                     3 Real XML parsers such as that of Firefox or Safari consider the MIME type of documents  as sent by the  server  rather than file syntax and DOCTYPE only.   147    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   learn how to use the practices described in the previous chapter, you will be able to create not only  error-free XHTML documents but also any kind of structured markup.    Although modern browsers support the application xhtml+xml MIME type, some older browsers do   not. One of the options to preserve backward compatibility with older browsers and support advanced  XML applications for modern ones is the technique called content negotiation. It can be done through  .htaccess4 settings or using server-side scripting languages.   The HTTP specification defines the mechanism for serving different versions of the same resource   [60]. Document types, document languages, and image types are some examples [61]. The preferred and  acceptable document format s —in our case, the preference between HTML and XHTML files—can be  defined in the HTTP header, as shown in Listing 4-4.   Listing 4-4. Content Negotiation in the HTTP Header   Accept: text html, application xhtml+xml, application xml; q=0.9, * *; q=0.8   Using the previous example, the browser can specify that HTML and XHTML are preferred to XML.  The “relative quality parameter”  q  and its value  qvalue  are considered as follows. All items without a  specified preference value get the default value 1  in this case text html and application xhtml+xml .  The specified value for application xml is 0.9, and all the other formats 0.8. The precedence values  ordered in descending order reveal the actual precedence, in other words, 1 for text html and  application xhtml+xml, 0.9 for application xml, and 0.8 for any other content types.   On Apache servers, the directive shown in Listing 4-5 should be added to your .htaccess  or   httpd.conf  file to set the HTTP headers required for the correct MIME type.   Listing 4-5. Preference Between text html and application xhtml+xml   Options +Multiviews  AddType application xhtml+xml;qs=0.8  AddType text html;qs=0.9   The “quality of source” parameter  qs , set to 0.8 in our example, determines whether the AddType  directive applies the specified MIME type. Since the qs value for application xhtml+xml is smaller than  that of text html, application xhtml+xml will be used by compliant browsers only; otherwise, the  preferred version will be the MIME type text html.   Content negotiation can also be implemented in server-side scripting languages. The most common   implementations are summarized in Listing 4-6, 4-7, and 4-8.   Listing 4-6. Content Negotiation in PHP   $accept = $_SERVER["HTTP_ACCEPT"];  $ua = $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"];  if  isset $accept  && isset $ua   {    if  stristr $accept, "application xhtml+xml"   stristr $ua, "W3C_Validator"   {      header "Content-Type: application xhtml+xml" ;    }  }                                                     4 A common configuration file on web servers  note that it begins with a period and has no extension .   148    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   Listing 4-7. Content Negotiation in ASP   Dim strAccept, strUA  strAccept = Request.ServerVariables "HTTP_ACCEPT" .Item  strUA = Request.ServerVariables "HTTP_USER_AGENT" .Item  If InStr 1, strAccept, "application xhtml+xml"  > 0 Or InStr 1, strUA, "W3C_Validator"  > 0     Then Response.ContentType = "application xhtml+xml"  End If   Listing 4-8. Content Negotiation in C in ASP .NET   string accept = Request.ServerVariables["HTTP_ACCEPT"];  string ua = Request.ServerVariables["HTTP_USER_AGENT"];  if  accept != null && ua != null  {    if  accept.IndexOf "application xhtml+xml"  >=0  ua.IndexOf "W3C_Validator"  >= 0  {      Response.ContentType = "application xhtml+xml";    }  }   The previous codes perform content negotiation with their own syntax. In PHP, for example, the   server variables contained in the $_SERVER array are used to evaluate the HTTP Accept header of the user  agent and set the appropriate MIME type via the header function  Listing 4-6 .   URIs, URLs, and URNs  A Uniform Resource Identifier  URI  is a character string that identifies a name or a resource on the  Internet  RFC 2396 [62] . URIs can be classified as Uniform Resource Locators  URLs; RFC 1738 [63] ,  Uniform Resource Names  URNs , or both. A URN defines the identity of a resource, while the URL  provides a method for finding it  including protocol and path . URIs are often used incorrectly as the  synonym for URL, although URI is a wider term  RFC 3305 [64] . Both the URN and the URL are subsets  of URI, but they are generally disjoint sets.   The best-known examples for URLs are the web site addresses on the World Wide Web. Listing 4-9   shows the general URL syntax.   Listing 4-9. URL Syntax   protocol:  domain:port path?query_stringfragment_identifier   The protocol  scheme name  is followed by a colon. The other parts of URLs depend on the scheme  being used. Usually there is a domain name or an IP address, an optional port number, and an optional  path to the resource or script. Programs such as PHP or CGI scripts might have a query string. The end of  the URL can be an optional fragment identifier.   Since many of these sections are optional, one or more of them are omitted. Listing 4-10 shows an  example, where http is the protocol, www.masteringhtml5css3.com is the domain, and the path leads to  the shop directory.   Listing 4-10. A Typical URL   http:  www.masteringhtml5css3.com shop    149    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   URI references are widely used in markup languages, for example, as the attribute value of the href  attribute on the a element in HTML or as the system identifier after the SYSTEM keyword in an XML DTD.   Persistent URIs  All web users know how it looks when a web site address typed into the address bar of the browser  cannot be retrieved. The same might happen when a user clicks a hyperlink of a web page.   There are many reasons for URIs to become disconnected. The simplest reasons are that files have   been moved to another folder or they have removed from the server. Another reason is that technologies  applied on the server have been changed. For example, a company used to apply CGI scripts but recently  changed to Perl. In that case, the URIs of the files located in the cgi-bin directory have become obsolete.  There are only a few cases when discontinuing the maintenance of URIs is acceptable, such as if the   company or organization have been closed. However, causeless changes should be eliminated.   Poorly designed URIs are responsible for a large share of dead links on the Web. It is a rather   complex task to design URIs in a way that they will be usable in the next few decades.    Designing URIs  URIs can be designed persistently by minimizing the information provided in them [65]. The author of  an updated document can be different from that of the original one, and thus the author should not be  included. The subject should also be eliminated since it changes very fast. For example, a web  technology blog should apply the directory name markup instead of the names of exact technologies that  are currently the most up-to-date ones  XHTML11, HTML5 . Directory names that indicate the status of  documents such as draft or latest should not be used in URIs simply because document status changes  over time. A persistent URI is required for the latest version of each document.   Some parts of a web site might be restricted to members only. The access should also be eliminated  from URIs because documents might be moved from the private section to the public one, or vice versa.  The most frequently provided needless information in URIs is the file extension. Technologies and  tools that are currently considered as the most advanced will probably change in the near future, or the  developer might change the applied technologies. Changed URIs can affect not only the findability of  web pages or web page components but also your maintenance tasks. Carefully selected directory  names are logical and seldom should be changed in the references in the markup.    Tip  Use the name script or scripts for the directory where you store the script files of a web site instead of  php or javascript, because if you adopt further scripting languages later, the URIs in the files of the site will  reflect a specific language rather than a common name. Similarly, the directory name style or styles is more  practical than css or xsl, and the name news or feed is more fortunate than rss or atom. The name images is  better than jpg, and a doc or docs directory can hold a variety of documents from PDF to Word documents, not  just a certain type.   Directory names that indicate software mechanisms such as cgi-bin should also be eliminated from   URIs. They might change. Topic names, company sections, access levels, or security levels are also  inappropriate for URIs. Classifications can change. The creation date is constant so it can be provided.   150    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   Keep in mind that multiple web servers can be hidden inside an apparent server with proxying and  redirection.   Beyond providing descriptive names for users and machines, URIs should be simple, stable, and   manageable. Properly designed URIs are fundamental parts of the Semantic Web [66].   Domain Names  Web resources can be located by unique IP addresses. However, they are hard to remember.  Consequently, domain names are used instead in most cases. Figure 4-1 shows the relationship between  a domain name and a URL; www.example.com is a subdomain of the node example.com, which is the  subdomain of the com domain. The domain name syntax rules are defined by RFC 1035 [67], RFC 1123  [68], and RFC 2181 [69].   Figure 4-1. The domain within the URL      The tree of subdomains can contain a maximum of 127 levels. Each label may contain up to 63   characters. According to RFC 2181, the full length of a domain name is 253 characters.   Conventional domain names cannot contain Latin alphabet-based characters with diacritics, non-  Latin characters, or scripts. With the introduction of Internationalized Domain Names  IDN , it is  possible to represent names and words in several languages in native alphabets and scripts.   Domain names should be thought over before they are registered. They should be easy to remember   and easy to spell [70]. There are also SEO considerations. While the name of a person generally remains  the same over the years, a product or technology name can change. For example, the owner of a DVD  store has probably changed from DVD sales to Blu-ray sales with the beginning of the HD era. However,  the domain name containing the word DVD still represents the old technology. If the word movie or  films would have been used, the domain name would not have become obsolete. Finding an appropriate  domain name, which is still free and contains popular keywords, can be a real challenge, though.   No WWW  Although the www. subdomain is very common on the Web, some webmasters consider it outdated or  inappropriate [71]. Similar to mail servers that do not use the request@mail.example.com format, web  servers can allow access to web pages though the main domain.   On Apache servers, the www. can be removed from the URIs within the domain by adding the code in   Listing 4-11 to the .htaccess file. Its name stands for hypertext access. This file provides directory-level   151    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   access control that can be used for authorization, authentication, redirection, blocking, customized  error response, and cache control.   Listing 4-11. Removing www. from URIs with .htaccess Configuration   RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.example\.com$ [NC]  RewriteRule ^ .* $ http:  example.com $1 [R=301,L]   This code makes it unnecessary to remove the www. from every hyperlink of the web site one by one.   However, a large share of webmasters disagrees with removing the www. from URIs [72]. According to  their reasoning, www. is a reminder that the World Wide Web  WWW  is just one of the many services on  the internet.    Tip  The previous code is not really required since an unlimited number of subdomains are generally included in  the domain registration price. It is a common practice that domain owners point both the main domain and the www  subdomain to the same directory of the web server. In other words, www.domain.com is the preferred URI, and  users retrieving domain.com are redirected to www.domain.com. Doing so, users can access the same content with  and without www.   Base href  The previous sections discussed absolute URLs. Since many web page components are located in the  subdirectories of the root directory associated with the domain, relative URLs can also be used. They are  shorter, however, and not always convenient. For example, if the hierarchy is too deep and the style  sheets are located in a styles directory three directories above a web page, the path becomes rather long   Listing 4-12 .   Listing 4-12. A Long Path in a Complex Web Site       The situation would be different if all locations were declared according to the root directory    Listing 4-13 .   Listing 4-13. Setting a Base Directory for a Web Site       The specified URL is used as the base for all relative URLs in the document. By adding the base   element to the document head, the original example can be simplified  Listing 4-14 .   Listing 4-14. A Short Path According to the Base Directory       152    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   Eliminating File Extensions  One of the key techniques for creating permanent URIs is to remove file extensions. On a file-based web  server such as Apache, it can be done by content negotiation [73]. We used content negotiation earlier in  the chapter to set the precedence between MIME types; now we will use it for creating a precedence  order for file types. As a result, file extensions can be kept on the files but can safely be removed from  links [74].    Using a type map file, Apache servers can check the directory for all files with the given name and   any extension and select the appropriate one  the one with the highest precedence . A type map file  takes precedence over the extension of the file  even if the special search for implicit file name pattern  match, Multiviews, is enabled . The precedence of a higher-quality image file variant can be set by the qs  parameter. In Listing 4-15, the file logo.svg will be used for all URIs that refer to the file without  extension. If there is no SVG version of that file in the directory, the PNG version will be used.   Listing 4-15. Precedence Order of File Types Set by the qs Parameter   URI: logo    URI: logo.svg  Content-type: image svg+xml; qs=0.8    URI: logo.png  Content-type: image jpeg; qs=0.5   The qs value varies from 0.000 to 1.000. Variants with a qs value of 0.000 will never be chosen.   Entries of the different variants are separated by blank lines that cannot be used within entries.    Explicitly setting paths to specific file variants is not feasible for larger sites with hundreds or   thousands of files. The second option for content negotiation on Apache servers is to use the MultiViews  search feature, where the server performs an implicit file name pattern match within directories and  chooses from the results. MultiViews is a fine option for eliminating file extensions that contributes to  easy maintenance  in case new file versions will be used  and optimal markup  because of shorter links .  MultiViews can be enabled in the server configuration or .htaccess file  Listing 4-16 .   Listing 4-16. MultiViews Enabled      Options + MultiViews      Now when the server receives a request for  images logo and  images logo does not exist, the server   searches inside the images directory looking for all files named logo.*, assigning MIME types based on  the extension of each file. The server then chooses the best match based on the preferences and delivers  that resource. For example, let’s assume that the images directory contains the following file variants:  logo.svg, logo.png, and logo.gif. When there is a query for  images logo, the precedence order will be  considered in the answer to the query  Listing 4-17 .   Listing 4-17. The Precedence Order of Image File Formats   Accept: image svg+xml; q=.8, image png; q=.5, image gif;q=0.2, * *;q=0.1   When MultiViews is enabled, the server would search the referenced directory and deliver the image  with the highest quality  thanks to the highest precedence , in other words, logo.svg. This is achieved in   153    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   a way that URIs in HTML XHTML files do not need to contain the file extension, which makes  maintenance easier and reduces file size. URIs can now omit the technology behind the resource. Since  example.com images logo.svg becomes example.com images logo, the logo embedding used throughout  the site becomes   instead of <img src="logo.svg" alt="Company  logo">.   While a URI ending in .html or .php will probably remain the same in the near future, even widely   used file types might soon become obsolete or less frequently used within a few years. A Flash animation   .swf  might be changed to HTML5 markup  .html , a PNG image  .png  to its SVG version  .svg , and so  on. As a consequence, all currently created internal links of the site as well as the external links on other  sites will be invalid.   The World Wide Web Consortium has mastered eliminating extensions in links. Even images of the  site are provided without extension in links  the files have extensions , so the links pointing to the file in  hundreds of web documents should not be modified if the image will be changed, as, for example, from  logo.png to logo.svg.   References with extensions remain usable; however, they do not allow the server to select the best of   currently available and future formats. With a type map declaration or with enabled MultiViews search  [75], on the other hand, raster images used for ages can be updated to their new, SVG versions in no  time. The file name without the extension is content-type generic, while file names with extensions are  content-type specific.   There is a special file supported by all web servers, called index.html. When users do not specify a   file in the address bar, browsers open this file by default  with content negotiation, the extension can be  not only .html but also .php, .jsp, .aspx, and so on . This is the reason why web sites can be opened  without typing the file name and extension to the end of the domain name such as  www.example.com index.html. This server behavior can also be used for creating permanent access to  web pages within a site. Instead of adding the about.html, services.html, portfolio.html, and  contact.html files to the root directory of the domain, they can be provided as index.html files within  their own subdirectories. As a result, the pages of the site can be accessed as www.example.com about ,  www.example.com services , and so on, without file extensions. Naturally, original file names can also be  kept if the default file of each directory is set on the server. However, in that case, server settings should  also be migrated if the hosting provider of the web site is changed.   Namespace URIs  Namespace URIs are used to uniquely identify an XML application and separate it from other XML  languages. The prefixes associated with a namespace URI are handy when you want to associate an  element or an attribute with a particular XML namespace. Although a namespace URI does not  necessarily point to a particular document, many do, such as the http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml  namespace used by XHTML 1.x 5  discussed earlier in Chapter 3 . The previous namespace URI will let  the XML parser know that the elements and attributes used in the document are from the XHTML  vocabulary.    Note  Namespace URIs might reveal the corresponding specification or standard, but many are placeholders  only.   154    CHAPTER 4  SERVING AND CONFIGURATION   Even if they are generally designed stable, namespaces might evolve over time [76]. To eliminate the  problem, namespaces are often registered as Persistent Uniform Resource Locators at purl.org[77]. If the  resource they point to changes, the URI can be modified in the profile settings on purl.org, which will  provide the up-to-date URI with the persistent address.   The XML namespaces should be controlled by the corresponding W3C Recommendation [78].   Summary  In this chapter, you learned about the general structure of an HTTP header, which provides information  about web documents sent by the server. You know the most common MIME types and their declaration  by now, which can be used to ensure that browsers will properly handle your web site components. You  also know how to use content negotiation on the server to eliminate file extensions, which makes future  maintenance easier. Furthermore, you learned how to serve XHTML properly, which makes all the  difference, because XHTML documents served as application xhtml+xml will be parsed by an XML  parser rather than a much less error-sensitive HTML parser. You know how to design URIs in order to  maximize their persistence.   By now you are ready to create standard-compliant markup and use the proper settings for serving  the files of your web sites. In the next chapter, you will learn techniques for separating web site content  from its presentation by using Cascading Style Sheets  CSS .

XHTML elements  eliminate style attributes. Style sheets should be provided in external files. Style definitions provided in  CSS have similar features to the ones applied in older HTML documents as inline styles. However,  naming conventions and additional mechanisms are often confusing. Beyond code validity, there are  other features such as scope, property value inheritance, and the order of separators, which should also  be considered to obtain optimized CSS files.   In this chapter, you will learn frequently used standards for styling web sites, including general CSS   grammar rules and selector syntaxes that are vital for every web site. After examining the differences  between properties of different CSS versions, you will gain a solid understanding of standardization  issues and the challenges of providing backward-compatibility. You will also become familiar with  fundamental principles in CSS ruleset optimization. Furthermore, you will analyze the methods used by  rendering engines for determining the styles to apply.   Cascading Style Sheets  Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  is a style sheets language  style language  introduced by W3C. Cascading  refers to the process of determining the priority of styling rules. CSS is used to define the presentational  semantics of structured documents. It provides control over visual as well as aural1 characteristics of  HTML and XHTML documents and their elements. Some typical features are, for example, fonts, colors,  backgrounds, margins, borders, and layers. CSS provides a powerful feature to support more than just  visual media and target special browsers running on different types of devices: media types. CSS  supports not only the most commonly used visual media type but also other media types that can be  grouped as follows:           Aural: Properties for aural browsers. Examples: pitch, pitch-range, play-during,  richness, voice-family.   Interactive: Properties for devices that allow user interaction. Examples: nav-down,  nav-index, nav-left, nav-right, nav-up.                                                     1 Although most styles associated with web documents are visual, CSS supports aural properties as well,  including volume, speaking, pause, cue, spatial properties, and voice characteristics. They are used for  aural presentation, such as when a document is converted to plain text and fed to a screen reader.  Beyond improved accessibility, aural style sheets also have a potential in online education,  entertainment, in-car use, and so on.    161    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS           Paged and noncontinuous: Properties for the content of documents split into one  or more discrete pages, such as the pages of documents to print. Examples: image- orientation, page, page-break-before, page-break-inside, page-policy, size.   Speech: Properties for styling speech. Examples: cue, cue-after, cue-before, mark,  mark-after, mark-before, pause, speak-header, speak-numeral, speak-punctuation,  speech-rate, stress.   As you will see later in the chapter, most CSS properties are visual properties or can be applied to all   media, but there are many properties designed for a specific media type.   One of the major concepts of CSS is to separate HTML XHTML content from appearance, in other   words, to distinguish style from structure. Another aim is centralization, which means providing full  control over the styles of multiple documents from a single location.   Although CSS is used primarily for styling  X HTML web documents, it can also be applied to all   kinds of XML documents, for example XUL or SVG [1]. In SVG, many CSS properties are reused for  styling, such as font properties, text properties, and other visual properties. SVG also uses CSS features  such as the CSS syntax, selectors, external style sheets, cascading, inheritance, and at-rules, each of  which will be described later in detail. Since SVG is an XML application, internal CSS style sheets can be  provided as CDATA sections  Listing 5-1 .   Listing 5-1. Embedded CSS in SVG      <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD SVG August 1999  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org Graphics SVG SVG-19990812.dtd">                                         Here is my title       CSS can even be used for mathematical notations with or without MathML, the markup language   discussed in Chapter 3, which is especially designed for publishing equations and mathematical symbols  on the Web [2, 3].   Levels, Profiles, and Modules  The various versions of CSS are often referred as CSS levels. Each CSS level is based on the previous level  and adds new properties and features. The three most significant versions are CSS1, CSS 2.1, and CSS3.  Subsets of at least one level of CSS created for a particular device are called CSS profiles, such as the   CSS Print Profile [4], the CSS TV Profile [5], and the CSS Mobile Profile [6].   The specifications that form CSS3 are called CSS modules.    Caution  Profiles are not equal to media types, which were introduced in CSS2.    162    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   The three major CSS versions are described in the following sections.   CSS1  CSS Level 1, the first Cascading Style Sheet specification, was published in 1996. It is a W3C  Recommendation, but its development has been closed by W3C [7]. CSS1 introduced styles for font  properties, element color, alignment, tables, margin, border, padding, and positioning. CSS1 properties  can be applied to uniquely identified elements or element groups.   CSS2 and CSS 2.1  CSS Level 2 was developed as a superset of CSS1 and has been extended with several new features. The  most important ones are layer order  z-index , three types of element positioning  absolute, relative,  and fixed , the aural media type, and bidirectional text.   CSS Level 2 Revision 1, often abbreviated as CSS 2.1 [8], has been the ultimate styling solution on the   Web for many years. CSS 2.1 became a W3C Recommendation in 2011.   CSS3  The development of CSS Level 3  CSS3  started in 2005. In contrast to further CSS specifications, CSS3 is  modularized [9]. It is described by separate documents such as the modules Selectors, Media Queries,  Text, Backgrounds and Borders, Colors, 2D Transformations, 3D Transformations, Transitions,  Animations, and Multi-Columns. The modules are in different stages of development and browser  implementation. Until recently, only a few modules had been standardized, such as the Color module  [10].   A variety of new functions and features have been introduced in CSS3 such as border-radius, box-  shadow, background-origin; color declaration in HSL, HSLA, and RGBA; text-shadow; text-overflow;  word-wrap; box-sizing; attribute selectors; multicolumn layout; Web Fonts; and speech.   Grammar and Conventions  Parsing errors caused by nonexisting properties, incorrect values, malformed declarations, and so on,  can be eliminated by following the proper CSS syntax. The grammar ensures syntactically correct CSS,  which makes it possible for browsers to handle parsing rules, selector, property, value, and unit  notations correctly. Although the fundamental rules are similar, each CSS version has its own syntax  [11]. Being a superset of CSS 2.1, CSS3 introduced additional semantic constraints.   Identifiers and Classes  The ID and class identifiers should always start with a letter. Since these identifiers correspond to the id  and class markup attributes and since an element with an id attribute is unique within a web page, ID  identifiers can be used to style a unique element of a page. If the same styles are applied to multiple  elements, class identifiers should be used. Identifier names are case sensitive. Using the letters a–z and  the numbers 0–9 is highly recommended, although underscores and hyphens are also allowed. Names  should be meaningful and semantic. Unique names should be applied.   163    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Units  CSS supports several measurement values, which are summarized in Table 5-1.   Table5-1. CSS Units   Description   Percentage.   Inch.   Centimeter.   Millimeter.   1 point is equal to 1 72 inch.   1 pica is equal to 12 points.   1 pixel is a dot on the screen.   1 em is equal to the current font size, which can be used to automatically adapt the  font size proportions to the font size chosen by the user in the browser. The em unit  defines the proportion of the width and height of a given letter with respect to the point  size of a given font. This unit originates in typography.   1 ex is the x-height of a font  approximately half the font size .    Note  In spite of this variety, only three of these units are used most of the time: %, em, and px.   Color Declarations  There are several notations in CSS for declaring colors. A brief overview is provided in the following  sections, which is important because color declaration examples will be used intensively in the  demonstrational rulesets throughout the chapter.   Hexadecimal Notation  Hexadecimal notation is by far the most commonly used notation for declaring colors in CSS. In the RGB  color space used on the Web, any color can be represented by additive color mixing, using the different  intensity variants of three colors: Red, Green, and Blue  RGB . Two hundred and fifty-six shades of the  three base colors are adequate to mix any color, because any two adjacent shades of red, green, or blue  with an intensity difference of 1 256 cannot be distinguished by the human eye. Since there are 256   Unit    %    in    cm    mm    em    ex    pt    pc    px    164    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   shades for each channel, the values vary from 0 to 255  00 to ff in hexadecimal notation  per channel; 0  is the darkest shade of the channel, and 255 is the lightest.    The hexadecimal numeral system applies the positional  also known as place-value  notation. In   contrast to the 10 digits of the decimal numeral system, in the hexadecimal system there are 16 symbols  from 0 to 9 and a to f  the letters represent the values from 10 to 15 . The latest symbol corresponds to  the value multiplied by the 0th power2 of 16, the symbol preceding the last symbol represents the value  multiplied by the 1st power of 16, and so forth.    Consequently, the symbols 0–9 in hexadecimal notation correspond to the identical numbers in   decimal notation, while a in hex is equal to 10 in the decimal system, b to 11, c to 12, d to 13, e to 14, and f  to 15. Further numbers can be computed by the place-value  starting from 0 . For example, the  hexadecimal value e8 corresponds to the decimal value 232, because  1 14 16 similarly, but with the reverse computation. For example, 86 in decimal notation is 56 in hexadecimal  = notation, because 86 16 = 5.375, so the first digit is 5. 5 16 80 second digit, because  .   5 16 + 6 1 = 80 + 6 = 86  . Conversion from decimal to hexadecimal can be performed   , and the remainder is 6, which is the   14 16 8 1 224 8 232  + ⋅ =  6 16  + =  8 16  + ⋅  ⋅ 1 5 16  + ⋅  = ⋅  =  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  0  0  In CSS, hexadecimal color declarations begin with a number sign   , followed by six hexadecimal    hex  values, two for each channel. They are used to mix colors arbitrarily. For example, pure red can be  set by ff0000. In other words, the intensity of the red channel is maximal  ff , while the intensity of  green and blue are minimal  00 . Similarly, pure green is 00ff00, while pure blue is 0000ff. If the values  of each channel are set to 00, the result is black  000000 . If all values are maximal, you get white   ffffff . If the values for each channel are identical, the result is a shade of gray  Listing 5-2 .   Listing 5-2. A Gray Font Color Declared for All Paragraphs   p {    color: 898989;  }    Tip  If the two digits of each channel are identical, they can be abbreviated by omitting the second digit. For  example, f00 represents red, 0f0 represents green, 00f represents blue, 000 represents black, fff  represents white, and so on.   The RGB and RGB a  Notations  The saturation of each color channel in the RGB model can also be declared by either decimal numbers  or percentages  Listing 5-3 .   Listing 5-3. Simple RGB Notation   p {    color: rgb 0, 255, 0   *  equivalent to rgb 0, 100%, 0 , 00ff00 and 0f0 *   }                                                     2 Any nonzero number raised to the power 0 is 1.   165    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   The previous notation is supported by CSS 2.1 but has been extended in CSS3 with the transparency    alpha channel  of the color. This notation is known as RGB a . For example, the pure green with 75  percent transparency  which corresponds to 25 percent opacity  can be declared as shown in Listing 5-4.  Note that the alpha is always a percentage  a value from 0 to 1  rather than running from 0–255 as the  other colors do.   Listing 5-4. An RGB a  Notation in CSS3   p {    color: rgb 0, 255, 0, 0.25 ;  }   The HSL a  Notation  In CSS, colors can also be denoted by the HSL a  notation, where the colors are represented by their hue,  saturation, and lightness. The first value can be a number from 0 to 360, while the second and third  values can be declared as a percentage. The alpha channel works the same way as in RGB a   Listing 5- 5 .   Listing 5-5. A Transparent Color in HSL a  Notation   warning {    background-color: hsl 240, 78%, 50%, 0.25 ;  }     Tip  If you want to use a color seen on a photograph or on a web site, you can obtain the code in many ways.  First, you can check the style sheet of the page or site for the color code. If it is not convenient, there are other  techniques to get the color code. If there are no advanced image-processing applications installed on your  computer, you should simply create a screenshot using the Print Screen button and copy and paste it to a basic  image manipulation application, such as Microsoft Paint. Select the Color Picker tool, and click the color of your  choice. Choose the Edit Colors option from the Color menu, and click Define custom colors.3 You get the hue,  lightness, and saturation of the color, along with the red, green, and blue components. Since they are provided in  decimal, they need to be converted into hexadecimal with an application such as the Windows Calculator  in  Scientific Mode . If you have a more advanced image manipulator than Paint, such as Adobe Photoshop, you can  use the Color Picker tool on the pasted image to get the color code in different color spaces and notations,  including decimal and hexadecimal.                                                     3 The version of Paint in Windows 7 has a ribbon interface instead of the conventional menu found in  earlier versions.   166    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Web-Safe Colors  In the first years of color computer screens, computers supported 256 different colors only. In that era, a  list of 216 colors was referred to as web-safe colors. This cross-browser color palette was used to ensure  that all computers, including the ones using a 256-color palette, would display the colors correctly. Web- safe colors consist of 00, 33, 66, cc, and ff values for each channel  for example, 00ff00, 663300, 993300,  cc6600, and ff9966 .    Note  Web-safe colors are not interesting from the presentational point of view anymore, since all modern  screens, monitors, and projectors are capable of representing any colors from the RGB color space.   Color Names  CSS supports the names of 16 basic colors. These keywords are easier to read than their corresponding  hexadecimal values4  Table 5-2 . Using hexadecimal notation, however, is strictly recommended  see  Chapter 13 .   Table 5-2. CSS Color Names Handled by All Browsers   Hexadecimal Equivalent   aqua  = cyan    magenta  = fuchsia    Color   black   blue   gray   green   lime   maroon   navy   olive   purple   00ffff   000000   0000ff   ff00ff   808080   008000   00ff00   800000   000080   808000   800080                                                     4 After learning color mixing with hexadecimal notation, using values becomes a routine task.   167    Hexadecimal Equivalent   ff0000   c0c0c0   008080   ffffff   ffff00   Selector Syntaxes  A CSS selector identifies those markup elements to which the CSS style s  will be applied. Specific  element groups are styled by various types of selectors. The general structure of a CSS rule  or CSS ruleset  for multiple declarations , as shown in Figure 5-1, can be written with the pseudocode shown in Listing  5-6.   Figure5-1. CSS rule structure      Listing 5-6. Pseudocode of CSS Rulesets  selector [, selector2, …, selectorn] [:pseudo-class] {    property: value;    [property2: value2;     …    propertym: valuem;]  }   Multiple declarations of the same selector can be organized into groups separated by semicolons   CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Color   red   silver   teal   white   yellow       ; .   168    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS    Tip  Although it is legal to omit the semicolon after the last declaration in a ruleset, it is strongly recommended  to always provide it. It makes maintenance and modifications easier and becomes handy when a declaration is  moved to another location in the CSS.   For example, the rules in Listing 5-7 can be written as shown in Listing 5-8.   Listing 5-7. It Is Not Optimal to Declare Rules of the Same Element Separately   Listing 5-8. Rules of the Same Element Should Be Grouped   h1 { font-weight: bold }  h1 { font-size: 1.6em }  h1 { font-family: Verdana }   h1 {     font-weight: bold;    font-size: 1.6em;    font-family: Verdana;  }   Although they are equivalent, the second version should be preferred for many reasons. First, it is  shorter and thus contributes to code length optimality. Second, further declarations of other selectors  might accidentally be inserted between the single lines, making the CSS file much harder to maintain.  Finally, the second arrangement is easier to read, which makes development easier.   Element Selectors  If all paragraphs of a web site are intended to be written in Garamond with 1.2em font size, the ruleset  looks like Listing 5-9.   This applies to all paragraphs in the markup such as the ones in Listing 5-10.   Listing 5-10. Paragraphs to Be Styled by the Ruleset of Listing 5-9   Listing 5-9. A Ruleset for All Paragraphs   p {     font-size: 1.2em;    font-family: Garamond;  }       A paragraph.         Another paragraph.      169    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Naturally, a subset of paragraphs might have a different ruleset that partially or fully overrides the   general rules  see the “Cascading” section later in the chapter .   In the previous example, the selector selects a markup element. Such selectors are called element   selectors and apply the corresponding element names themselves. The curly braces contain the  properties of the element to style, along with the values to which they should be changed. The curly  braces and the content between them is the declaration block. The property-value pairs are separated  from each other by semicolons. The properties are separated from their values by colons. Each line is  called a declaration or statement.   The selectors are separated by combinators, that is, whitespace, > or +. Further whitespace   characters might be present between the combinators and the simple selectors around them [12].   Selectors can also be grouped if the same CSS rules apply to them. The comma  ,  should be used as   the combinator. Grouping common rules contributes to CSS code optimality. For example, Listing 5-11  changes the color and font size of both div elements with the id attribute articles and relatedlinks,  respectively.   Listing 5-11. Common Rules Can Be Grouped to Avoid Duplication   articles, relatedlinks {    color: white;    font-size: 1.8em;  }   Class Selectors  Class selectors, which begin with a period  . , select all elements with a class attribute identical to the  value specified in them. Since the class attribute can be applied multiple times in a web page, class  selectors can style any element within the document with the same class identifier. For example, the rule  in Listing 5-12 is referred in the markup, as shown in Listing 5-13 and Listing 5-14.   Listing 5-12. Class Selector Example   .abstract {     font-size: 1.1em;   }   Listing 5-13. The Class Selector in Listing 5-12 Can Be Applied to Headings    Abstract    Listing 5-14. The Same Class Selector Can Also Be Applied to Paragraphs       The abstract of the first Chapter      If the ruleset should be applied for certain types of elements with the specified class name, a more   specific rule can be written by providing the element name before the period. For example, if the  previous rule should be valid exclusively for paragraphs, it should be extended by declaring the desired  element type  Listing 5-15 .   170    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Listing 5-15. A Rule for All Paragraphs with the Class Name abstract   p.abstract {    font-size: 1.1em;   }   ID Selectors  Certain markup elements are intended to be unique throughout a web document; that is, they can occur  only once per web page. They are identified by the identifier attribute id. Those selectors that select the  unique element on the web page with the id attribute equal to the value specified in them are called ID  selectors and begin with a hash mark   . Listing 5-16 shows an example.   Listing 5-16. An ID Selector Example   main {    margin-left: 120px;  }   Listing 5-17 shows a markup example where the previous rule is applied.   Listing 5-17. Example Content for Which the ID Selector main Can Be Applied        The main content has a left margin of 120 pixels.      Universal Selectors  A universal selector matches the name of any element type on a web page  any elements regardless of the  type . The universal selector is referred to with an asterisk  * . Listing 5-18 shows an example.   Listing 5-18. A Universal Selector Example   *.caution {    color: ff2318;  }    Listing 5-19 .   .caution {    color: ff2318;  }   The asterisk can be omitted if the universal selector is not the only component of a simple selector   Listing 5-19. A Rule from Which the Asterisk Can Be Safely Omitted   Considering the markup shown in Listing 5-20, the selector div * em will match most em elements  and apply to the content of the em element in h1  favorite , p  impressive , the first li element  hybrid  electric , and the second li  fuel efficient . In the last two cases, the * matches the ul or the li.   171    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Listing 5-20. A Demonstration Markup for the Universal Selector                My  favorite  car        The Lexus CT 200h is  impressive  due to the following reasons:                 It is a  hybrid electric  car.          It is a  fuel efficient  car.              That’s why it is a nice  entry-level luxury  hatchback.           Since the em element with the content entry-level luxury is an immediate child of the div element,   there is nothing for the * to match between div and em.    Caution  The implementation of universal selectors is imperfect in Internet Explorer 7 and earlier.    Attribute Selectors  Attribute selectors select every element with the attribute specified within square brackets. An attribute  type or an attribute with a specific value can be styled with them. For example, all img elements with the  title attribute within the document can have a yellow border by applying the rule shown in Listing 5-21.   Listing 5-21. An Attribute Selector Example with an Attribute   Attribute selectors can be used not only for attributes but also for attribute-attribute value pairs. For   example, a 10-pixel border can be added to all logo.png images within the web page with the CSS rule  shown in Listing 5-22.   Listing 5-22. An Attribute Selector with an Attribute and an Attribute Value   This applies to multiple instances of the markup in Listing 5-23 throughout the web page.   Listing 5-23. A Markup Code Where Listing 5-22 Is Applied       img[title] {    border-color: ff0;  }   img[src="logo.png"] {    border: 10px;  }   172    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Child Selectors  Child selectors select the right-hand element in the selector if and only if it is a direct child of the left- hand element. The greater-than sign  >  is used between the child and the ancestor. Listing 5-24 shows  an example.   Listing 5-24. Child Selector Example   td > a {    font-weight: bold;  }   This is applied to all hyperlinks within table data cells, such as in Listing 5-25, but does not affect   hyperlinks in general such as in Listing 5-26.   Listing 5-25. A Hyperlink Example for the Child Selector in Listing 5-24     Nairobi, Kenya     Listing 5-26.The Child Selector Example Is Not Applied to Anchors That Are Not Children of a Data Cell    São Paulo, Brazil     Caution  Child selectors are not supported in Internet Explorer 6 and earlier.    Descendant Selectors  Styles of elements that are lower on the DOM tree can be provided by descendant selectors that use the  element names separated by spaces. In contrast to child selectors, descendant selectors do not require  the child element to be a direct child of the ancestor. Listing 5-27 shows an example.   Listing 5-27. Descendant Selector Example   td a {    font-weight: bold;  }   This is applied to all hyperlinks within table data cells, for example to Listing 5-25  similar to the   child selector shown previously  or Listing 5-28. This rule does not affect hyperlinks in general, however.   Listing 5-28. An Anchor Example Where Listing 5-27 Is Applied     One of the unique attractions of  Nairobi,  Kenya  is the Nairobi National Park.     Note the difference between the child selector and the descendant selector.   173   4   CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   h2 + p {    color: 0f0;  }    Heading    A paragraph     A paragraph     Heading    A paragraph    Adjacent Sibling Selectors  Adjacent sibling selectors select the element on the right-hand side of the selector if and only if it has an  instance of the element on the left-hand side next to it. The + sign is applied as the combinator. Sibling  elements are on the same level within the DOM hierarchy. Listing 5-29 shows an example.   Listing 5-29. Adjacent Sibling Selector Example   This selector applies to Listing 5-30, but neither to Listing 5-31 nor Listing 5-32.   Listing 5-30. Elements That Apply the Green Color from Listing 5-29   Listing 5-31. A Paragraph That Does Not Apply the Rule Shown in Listing 5-29   Listing 5-32. Because of the Missing Level 2 Heading Preceding the Paragraph, the Style Is Not Applied  Here Either    Caution  Adjacent sibling selectors are not supported in IE6 or earlier.   Pseudoclasses  Pseudoclasses, which use colons to separate an element from its state, are more sophisticated selectors.  They are frequently used to determine the style of hyperlinks, depending on their states. For example,  Listing 5-33 applies to all a elements but only when the mouse hovers over the link.   Listing 5-33. Link Color to Be Applied in Case an Anchor Is Being Hovered Over   Another example is Listing 5-34, which changes the color of all hyperlinks that have already been   a:hover {     color: 000080;   }   visited5 to green.                                                     5 According to the current browser history   174    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Listing 5-34. Link Color Set to Visited Hyperlinks   a:visited {     color: 0f0;   }   Pseudoelements  Pseudoelements can be used to add style to specific element parts instead of whole elements. They can  also be applied for inserting content before or after certain elements. The combinator is a colon  : . For  example, the CSS rule in Listing 5-35 changes the font size of the first letter of all paragraphs within the  web page to 2 em.   Listing 5-35. A Rule for the First Letter of Paragraphs   p:first-letter {     font-size: 2em;   }   Property Value Types  CSS property values can be the following:     Keywords  for example, auto      Basic data types  for example, %      Combination of keyword and custom data  for example,   url 'http:  example.com images book.png'    Shorthand Notation  Certain CSS properties can be grouped into a single property declaration. The most common shorthand  notations are described in the following sections.   Shorthand Notation for Font Properties  Font properties can be written either in the full form shown in Listing 5-36 or with the shorthand  notation of Listing 5-37.   Listing 5-36. If Several Font Properties Should Be Set for the Same Element, the Ruleset Becomes Too Long   p {     font-weight: bold;     font-size: 1em;    line-height: 1.2em;     font-family: Garamond;   175    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS     font-style: normal;   }   Listing 5-37. Shorthand Notation for Font Properties   p { font: bold 1em 1.2em Garamond }    Note  In the second case, the font-style property is not set and thus takes the value defined as the default  value for that property in the CSS specification, which is normal.   Shorthand Notation for Background Properties  Separate background properties  Listing 5-38  have the shorthand property background  Listing 5-39 .   Listing 5-38. Separate Background Properties That Can Be Shortened   body {    background-color: 232323;    background-image: url 'images bg.jpg' ;    background-repeat: no-repeat;     background-position: 100% 0%;     background-attachment: fixed;  }   Listing 5-39. Background Properties Combined into a Single Background Property   body {    background: 232323 url 'images bg.jpg'  no-repeat 100% 0% fixed;  }   Shorthand Notation for List Properties  List styles, such as the ones in Listing 5-40, can also be shortened by the enumeration of the individual  property values for the list-style shorthand property  Listing 5-41 .   Listing 5-40. List Styles That Can Be Shortened   ul.tick {    list-style-image: url 'tick.png' ;    list-style-type: none;    list-style-position: inside;  }   176    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Listing 5-41. A One-Line Rule for Three List Styling Property Values   ul.tick {    list-style: url 'tick.png'  none inside;  }   Shorthand Notation for Padding, Border, and Margin Properties  There are five properties for setting the top, right, bottom, and left padding  padding-top, padding-right,  padding-bottom, padding-left, respectively  or all of them together with the shorthand property padding.  Similar conventions exist for borders  border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left, border   and margins  margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, margin . There are various options  for shortening the enumeration of property values in a certain order:       Four values set the padding of each side: the top, the right, the bottom, and finally  the left padding  clockwise, starting from top   Listing 5-42 .    Tip  This order is worth memorizing, because it can be used not only for padding but also for borders and  margins.   Listing 5-42. Padding Shorthand Property with Four Values   decor {    padding: 10px 5px 20px 30px;  }   Three values set the top, right, and left  equally , and the bottom padding  Listing  5-43 .   Listing 5-43. Padding Shorthand Property with Three Values   decor {    padding: 10px 20px 15px;  }   Two values set an equal padding for the top and bottom sides, and then an equal  padding for the right and left sides  Listing 5-44 .   Listing 5-44. Padding Shorthand Property with Two Values           decor {    padding: 30px 20px;  }      One value sets an equal padding for all sides  Listing 5-45 .   Listing 5-45. Padding Shorthand Property with One Value   177    Similar shorthand notations can be used for setting border and margin property values with the  border and margin shorthand properties. Further padding, border, and margin properties can also be  written in shorthand notation. Listing 5-46 shows an example.   Listing 5-46. Border Properties That Can Be Shortened   CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   decor {    padding: 10px;  }   .book {    border-width: 1px;    border-style: solid;    border-top-color: 000;    border-right-color: 000;    border-bottom-color: 000;    border-left-color: 000;  }   .book {    border-width: 1px;    border-style: solid;    border-color: 000;  }   .book {    border: 1px solid 000;  }   Since the border color of each side is the same in this example, the properties in the third, fourth,   fifth, and sixth lines can be written as border-color  Listing 5-47 .   Listing 5-47. The border-color Shorthand Property Sets the Border Color of Each Side of the Element   Even if the border colors are different, they can be declared by the border-color shorthand property   by simply enumerating the desired colors in the top, right, bottom, left order  clockwise, starting from  top .   All the previous properties can still be shortened to a single line, as shown in Listing 5-48.   Listing 5-48. The Shortest Border Declaration for Multiple Properties   Implementation  There are three ways to implement CSS. The chosen method determines the scope of styling.       Inline style: Styling with the most limited scope. An inline style is embedded in an   X HTML tag to which it exclusively applies. This CSS fragment is defined by the  style attribute that can be provided on most markup elements. The attribute  value has the same syntax as the contents of a CSS declaration block except that  the delimiting braces are omitted [13]. Listing 5-49 shows an example.   Listing 5-49. Inline Style Declaration Example   178    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS       Embedded  internal  style: A code block usually located in the document head.  Embedded styles are used for styling rules unique to that web page  the element to  style does not occur in other pages on the site . Listing 5-50 shows an example.   Listing 5-50. An Example for Embedded Styles                …           disclaimer {        text-align: center;        margin-top: 30px;        margin-bottom: 60px;      }          …      External style sheet: An external style sheet is a separate file with the .css  extension that contains style rules for multiple web documents, such as an entire  web site. This is a plain-text file usually encoded in US-ASCII. CSS files cannot  contain the style element, just the CSS style rules themselves. Each page refers to  that file with the link element in the  X HTML head section. Listing 5-51 shows an  example.   Listing 5-51. Link to an External Style Sheet File in XHTML       In XML documents  XML, XUL, SVG, and so on , external style sheets can be  provided by the XML processing instruction xml-stylesheet in the first document  section [14]  Listing 5-52 .   Listing 5-52. Link to an External Style Sheet File in XML       Embedded styles override the corresponding styles declared in an external CSS file, which makes it  possible to use the main styling rules of the web site while declaring some specific ones for a single web  page. Inline styles are even more specific and locally override the styles of the external style sheet as well  as the embedded styles  if any .   Style sheets can also import CSS rules from other style sheet files with the @import rule. It should be   provided after the @charset rules  if any  but before all other rules. If the additional CSS files are in the  same directory structure, the path is adequate  Listing 5-53 .    179    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Listing 5-53. Reusing an External Style Sheet   @import "styles alter.css";   The rulesets of the file containing this rule will override the corresponding rules of the imported  styles  if any . For example, if different pages of a site have the same styles except background-color,  which is modified as part of the design, then all the styles can be imported and the background-color  property is overwritten  alter.css in Listing 5-54 . Similarly, a style sheet designed for mobile devices  can reuse the main styles but remove the background image6 and set the maximum width of the  document body to the largest screen width available on smartphones today  mobile.css in Listing 5-54 .  All other styles are imported, including the color and the font-family.   Listing 5-54. Reusing and Extending Styles of the Main CSS File of a Site   main.css   body {   alter.css   mobile.css   @import  "main.css" ;   @import  "main.css" ;   body {   body {     background-color:00254c;     background-image: none;     max-width: 640px;      }     background:  url 'http:  example.com  images bg.jpg'  no-repeat  100% 0% fixed;       background-color:004c25;     color: fff;     font-family: Garamond,  serif;      }   }   …   example.   A more robust declaration provides not the path but the URL of the file. Listing 5-55 shows an   Listing 5-55. Importing a Style Sheet File by Providing a Full URL   @import url "http:  www.example.com alter.css" ;   One of the applications of importing style sheets is to provide alternate styles for web sites that can   serve several purposes. For example, accessibility can be improved by providing different style sheets for  different media. The media-specific CSS files of a site can be controlled in the markup by the media  attribute on the link element, as discussed earlier in Chapter 3. The rulesets of such CSS files have an  intersection defined by the main CSS file of the site. The files of media-specific rules rely on each other  and often import rules from each other  Listing 5-56 . Multiple CSS files can also be used for site design.                                                     6 In the example, the background-image property is set using the shorthand property background in the  main.css file.   180    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Listing 5-56. Importing Media-Specific Styles   @import url "print.css"  print;  @import url "mobile.css"  handheld and  max-width: 480px ;   Display and Visibility  The element levels of HTML and XHTML documents have already been discussed. In CSS,  X HTML  elements can generally be displayed in the following ways:      Block: Uses the full width available, along with a new line before and after  Listing   Listing 5-57. Rule for Elements to Be Displayed As Block   5-57    display: block;       Inline: Uses only as much width as needed without breaking the row  Listing 5-58    Listing 5-58. Rule for Elements to Be Displayed Inline   display: inline;      Not displayed: Removes the element completely from the document so it does not   take up any space, even though its corresponding markup is still in the source  code  Listing 5-59    Listing 5-59. Rule for Elements to Hide Without Spaceholder   display: none;      Hidden: Hides the element but still takes up space in the layout  Listing 5-60    Listing 5-60. Rule for Elements to Hide with Spaceholder   visibility: hidden;   Cascading  The C in CSS stands for Cascading. It is a mechanism that determines one declaration among a set of  styling rules that should be applied for a certain element-property pair. Browsers consider three features  in the following order to choose that declaration [15]:   1.  Weight: The declaration with the highest weight is chosen. In CSS3, the weight   of a declaration is based on the origin of the declaration and its level of  importance. The origin can be of three kinds: author, user, and user agent. CSS  declarations have two levels of importance: normal and important  the first  one is the default level; the second one is optional and should be marked . An  important declaration looks like Listing 5-61.   181    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Listing 5-61. A Rule with the Highest Level of Importance   menu {    margin-top: 12px !important;  }    Tip  The proper exploitation of the cascading mechanism eliminates the need for !important rules.    The weight of style sheets derived from the different origins, in descending  order, is as follows:  a.  User style sheets  important   b.  Author style sheets  important   c.  Author style sheets  normal   d.  User style sheets  normal   e.  Default style sheets of rendering engines  As a result, declarations written by developers generally have more weight  than that of user style sheets, which have more weight than the default styles  of the browser. This is the reason why links are generally rendered in the font  color defined by the web site developer rather than the default anchor color   Listing 5-62 .   Listing 5-62. A Rule in a CSS File That Has More Weight Than the Corresponding Rule in the  Default Style Sheet of Browsers   a {   }                   font-color: 12ee12;   2.  Specificity: The declaration with the highest specificity is chosen. The   specificity of selectors can be calculated as follows [16]:         The number of ID attributes in the selector is counted.   The number of other attributes and pseudoclasses in the selector is  counted.   The number of element names in the selector is counted.   The concatenation of these numbers is the specificity.    Negative selectors are counted similar to their simple selectors argument.   Pseudoelements are ignored.   182    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   In Listing 5-63, the specificity of the first declaration is the lowest, and the specificity of   the last one is the largest. The font color of all paragraphs is the same  black , except those  paragraphs that are included in a division, which have a different font color  green . The div  elements with the tip value declared for the class attribute have an even more specific rule,  which makes their font color distinctive  red, which is different from the color of any other  paragraphs .    Listing 5-63. Declarations with Increasing Specificity   p {   }     color: 000;   div p {     color: 0f0;   .tip p {     color: 00f;   }   }   3. Declaration order: If two declarations have the same weight, origin, and   specificity, the last declaration is chosen  imported style sheets should also be  considered . Imported style rules are processed prior to the rules of the style  sheet. The rules of further imported style sheets are taken into account in the  order of the @import rules.   Inheritance  In web markup languages and style sheets, certain codes are automatically reused. In CSS, property  values of parent elements can be set to their children. The specified value of an element-property  combination is copied from the corresponding computed value of the parent element. This procedure is  called inheritance. It eliminates the need for defining properties that are straightforward. If, for example,  the background color of a web document is defined, all container elements, divisions, and paragraphs  within the document will inherit that property. Certainly, any of them can be arbitrarily overridden.   Certain CSS property values are defined as inherited. Unless a value is specified for these element-  property combinations, the value is determined by inheritance.   The inherit value can be used for all properties to be determined by inheritance. For example, color   is an inheritable property. However, the color of anchor elements is commonly set to blue by the user  agent style sheet. By using the value inherit, the declaration of the user agent style sheet can be  overridden: all child anchor elements inherit the value of the foreground color from the parent element   Listing 5-64 .   183    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Listing 5-64. Inherited Property Value    warning {    color: 000;  }  warning a:link {    color: inherit;  }    Note  It should be taken into account that the more specific a property, the fewer elements it can be applied to.  As you will see in the overview of CSS properties, a large share of CSS properties are not inherited at all.   Scopes and Structure  In contrast with the underlined blue hyperlinks used in the first years of the Web, modern web sites  often apply different colors and decorations to accommodate the overall design. When using a dotted  underline for hyperlinks, however, it is rather frustrating that linking images share the same style. To  solve the problem, image borders should be removed and more specific styles set. Listing 5-65 shows an  example.   Listing 5-65. Specific Rules to Eliminate the Underline for Links Declared by General Rules   img {    border: 0;  }    a.nounder {    border-bottom: none;  }   body {    font-size: 0.8em;  }   184   The scope of rules has a large impact on their application. The rules that apply to more  most    elements within the same category should be identified in an early stage of web site development. For  example, if the vast majority of paragraphs have the same indent, that value should be applied as a  general CSS rule to all p elements  for example, p { text-indent: 3em; }  , and another rule should be  written to the class of paragraphs that are different  for example, p.morein { text-indent: 5em; } .   In the optimal case, both the scope and the inheritance are considered for those properties that can   be used as the basis for the entire web site, such as the default font size  Listing 5-66 .   Listing 5-66. The Default Font Size of the Entire Web Site Can Be Inherited from the Document Body   For those elements that require a different font size, such as headings, the property can be set   specifically  Listing 5-67 , and all the other elements inherit the default font size set for the document    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   body. Consequently, there is no need to declare the font size for, say, all p and div elements, if the  desired font size for them is the default one, because the property is inherited from the body element.   Listing 5-67. Specific Declarations That Override the Default Font Size Set in the Previous Listing   h1 {    font-size: 1.4em;  }  h2 {    font-size: 1.2em;  }  h3 {    font-size: 1em;  }   The Box Model  The actual markup content of block elements is wrapped around by optional paddings, borders, and  margins, called the CSS box model  Figure 5-2  [17]. These rectangular boxes are generated for certain  markup elements in the document tree.   Figure5-2. The CSS box model      Text and images appear in the content. The padding clears the area around the content. The   padding is affected by the background color of the box similar to the border area around the padding.  The margin is the outermost area around the border. It has no background color and is transparent. The  size of each area can be determined by CSS properties. Since they are optional, they can also be  collapsed to 0  that is, totally eliminated .   The margins of two vertically adjacent block elements normally collapse into one another; that is, a  margin is rendered according to the size of the larger bottom margin of the first box and that of the top  margin of the other below it.   185    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   The IE Box Model Bug  From the first version of CSS, the width and height of all block-level elements specified explicitly  determine only the width or height of the visible element, and the padding, borders, and margins are  applied afterward. In earlier versions of Internet Explorer, the CSS specifications were implemented  incorrectly, which is often referred to as the Internet Explorer box model bug. For example, Internet  Explorer 5 included the content, padding, and borders within a specified width or height, resulting in a  narrower or shorter rendering of the box [18]  Figure 5-3 .   Figure 5-3. Comparison of the W3C and the IE5 box model. Note the different interpretation of the width.      186    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS   Internet Explorer 6 and newer IE versions7 apply the correct implementation in their standards- compliant mode, but for compatibility reasons, the bug still exists when a page is rendered in Quirks  Mode.

However, even the CSS 2.1  properties gained a more or less complete and correct implementation only recently. Consequently, old  browsers do not support all properties and have incorrect implementation for many properties. This was  the major reason for the huge difference in rendering the same site under different browsers for years.  With the proper, if not full, implementation of CSS properties in modern browsers, this difference has  been decreased to a minimum.   203    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS    Tip  It is highly recommended to apply CSS3 rules with caution, because most modules of CSS3 are not  standardized yet, and browser support varies. Styling is not an “everything or nothing” proposition. For example,  fundamental CSS properties—that are also supported by CSS 2.1 and thus most browsers—can be used to  position a div element and provide styles such as background color, font size, and margins for it. Although the  rounded corners declared by using the CSS3 property border-radius are not rendered by older browsers, the  general layout and styling provide a similar appearance in old browsers as with modern browsers with CSS3  support. Similarly, if Web Fonts embedding—that is not supported by older browsers—is used on a site, a  common font and at least a generic font family should be declared as a fallback mechanism  see Chapter 9 for  details .   Initial Property Values  All CSS properties have their initial values that are applied when the property values are set neither by  cascading nor by inheritance. The initial value of each property is defined by the CSS specifications. An  initial value is one of the allowed values of the corresponding CSS property. For example, a color  declaration  in any of the allowed formats, typically in hexadecimal notation , transparent, and inherit  are all legal values of the background-color property, from which transparent is the initial value that can  be easily overridden by declaring the desired value in your CSS file  Listing 5-68 .   Listing 5-68. The Declared Value Overrides the Initial Value Defined by the CSS Specification   body {    background-color: 198c00;  }   This is the reason why the background of all paragraphs, divisions, and other elements is   transparent. Another example is the bullet type of lists, which is often used without override. If the value  of the property list-style-type is not set by the developer, the initial value is used for rendering, which  is disc. However, it can be overridden by any other allowed values of that property, including circle,  square, decimal, decimal-leading-zero, lower-roman, upper-roman, lower-greek, lower-latin, upper- latin, armenian, georgian, lower-alpha, upper-alpha, none, and inherit. The last value, inherit, can be  applied not only to list-style-type but also to any other CSS property in order to explicitly apply the  initial value of the corresponding property.    Since the root element has no parent element, its value is set to the initial property value by default.   Default Styles of Rendering Engines  Since the default style sheet of rendering engines contains different property values for certain  properties, the property values that are not declared by the web site developer might look different  under various browsers. Because of the different line heights, margins, font sizes, and other properties,  the overall appearance of a web site is typically not uniform. Although some of the default property  values differ slightly only, developers cannot rely on the default styles of rendering engines.   204    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS    Tip  The inconsistencies between the CSS implementations of browsers can be minimized by overriding the CSS  property values of the default style sheet of rendering engines. This technique is called CSS reset. One of the most  well-known CSS reset files was written and maintained by Eric A. Meyer  Listing 5-69  and can be used on your  web site for free [19].

Extensible  Stylesheet Language  XSL  is a language family that can be used for styling, manipulation, and  transformation of XML files. There are three XSL languages; however, only one of them is a style sheet  language:      XSL Transformations  XSLT : An XML style sheet language that can be used for   transforming XML documents into other XML documents or other formats such as  HTML or plain text. The original document remains unchanged, and a new  document is created based on the existing one.      XSL Formatting Objects  XSL-FO : An XML markup language applied for specifying   the visual formatting of XML documents. Several software support XSL-FO that  can provide various output formats, including plain text, PDF, PS, SVG, PCL, and  MIF.      XML Path Language  XPath : A non-XML query language that can also be used by   XSLT.   XSLT Style Sheets  XSLT style sheets consist of one or more style sheet modules that are part of XML documents or form  entire XML documents by themselves. The typical file extensions of XSLT are .xsl and .xslt. XSLT style  sheets use the media type application xslt+xml.   Namespaces  The XSLT namespace is http:  www.w3.org 1999 XSL Transform. However, further  reserved   namespaces are also recognized by XSLT processors [21], including the following:   The standard function namespace, http:  www.w3.org 2005 xpath-functions   The XML namespace, http:  www.w3.org XML 1998 namespace   The schema namespace, http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema   The schema instance namespace, http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance                Structure  The structure of XSLT style sheets looks like Listing 5-70.   Listing 5-70. XSLT Style Sheet Structure   <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"  xmlns:xsl="http:  www.w3.org 1999 XSL Transform">             206    CHAPTER 5  STYLE SHEETS                                          …          …      …            …                …           Note that the previous example shows all allowed element types; however, style sheets might   contain zero or more of these elements.   Elements  XSLT style sheets are represented by the xsl:stylesheet or xsl:transform element in XML documents.  An xsl:stylesheet element must have a version attribute. The xsl:stylesheet element may contain the  following types of elements: xsl:import, xsl:include, xsl:strip-space, xsl:preserve-space, xsl:output,  xsl:key, xsl:decimal-format, xsl:attribute-set, xsl:param, xsl:variable, xsl:namespace-alias, and  xsl:template. Table 5-4 provides an overview of XSLT 1.0 elements.   Table 5-4.

Listing 5-71 shows an example.   Listing 5-71. XSLT Elements and Attributes Correspond to XML Guidelines    20px    Standard Attributes  Several standard attributes are associated with XSLT elements, including version, exclude-result- prefixes, extension-element-prefixes, xpath-default-namespace, default-collation, and use-when. To  distinguish them from attributes defined by authors, they should be written with the namespace  notation as xsl:version, xsl:exclude-result-prefixes, xsl:extension-element-prefixes, xsl:xpath- default-namespace, xsl:default-collation, and xsl:use-when.   Combining CSS and XSL  XSL can also be used as a bridge between complex XML-based documents and the CSS formatting  model. Since CSS has no XML syntax, CSS properties become XML attributes in the XSL syntax. The  main CSS object is chunk. Additional objects might also be required. Usually they are other chunk objects  with functionality such as anchor, or further objects such as switch. For example, the CSS ruleset in  Listing 5-72 can be written in XSL syntax, as shown in Listing 5-73.   Listing 5-72. CSS Ruleset Example to Be Converted into XSL   {    font-size: 1.2em;    text-indent: 1em;  }   <css:chunk   Listing 5-73.

You know the syntax of Cascading Style Sheets, the language used by virtually every  web site. You have mastered the use of CSS selectors and can apply them in your daily work to control  the appearance of exactly those elements or sets of elements that need to be styled. By now you know  how to use the cascading feature of CSS with confidence, which makes it possible to create CSS files that  are optimal in length and easy to maintain. You also know how to ensure backward-compatibility by  applying a fallback mechanism and properties supported even by older browsers. You learned that XML  files can be styled not only by CSS but also by using XSL.   In the next chapter, you will learn about the standardization issues of server-side scripting and web   applications.   References   1.   2.    3.    4.   5.   6.   7.   8.   9.   10.   11.   12.

They have much more than just syntactic structure  and semantics. Various web site sections can behave differently and might react to user interactions.  Larger sites require databases that need to be handled. Small pieces of programs can be run on remote  servers or local computers. However, content generated by server-side languages is often incorrect.  Although content authors cannot affect the hard-coded parts of content management systems,  templates often provide hand-coding options that involve standardization potential.   In this chapter, you will learn why the standardization of dynamic content is more challenging than   that of static pages. Becoming familiar with the basic syntax of the most widely used client-side and  server-side scripting languages is crucial, because small programs written in these languages are often  embedded into the markup. Consequently, script embedding might have an impact on the standards  compliance of a whole web page. You will also learn how to provide alternate content for scripts.  Although the standard compliance of the markup generated on the server side using web programming  languages, frameworks, and development platforms to provide web applications is constantly  improving, there are still many cases when the resulting pages contain errors. Many of these  development technologies are not standardized yet but still are in worldwide use. As a consequence,  some of them are considered de facto standards. Many technologies rely on a number of other  technologies and some on standards. This chapter provides a quick overview of some of the most  common scripting and application development technologies; however, the list is not complete by any  means.   Client-Server Architectures  The distributed application structure that divides tasks and or workloads between resource or service  providers, called servers, and service requesters, called clients, is known as the client-server model.  Clients and servers communicate over the Web to exchange data and perform tasks.   The client-server architecture represents relationships between cooperating programs in a web   application. For example, a contact form can be evaluated on the client side and processed on the server  side.   The general syntax and grammar conventions of the most popular client-side and server-side   scripting and programming languages, technologies, and frameworks are discussed in the following  sections. Note that a detailed description of scripts and applications is beyond the scope of the book.  Web programming is analyzed from the standardization point of view. The scripts directly embedded  into the markup have a considerable effect on standard compliance, so standardistas should focus on  valid embedding. Although the core of content management systems  CMSs  are in many cases hard- coded, their templates can be modified by their users, which makes it possible to provide standard- compliant code fragments.    213    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Scripting and Standards Implementation  A script is program code that does not require preprocessing  such as compiling  before being run [1].  Small dynamic components of web documents such as the current date or interactive content and  behavior can be added by scripting languages. Modifications can be performed on the web page content  without reloading the new version of the page. Content can be added to or sent from a web page with  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  Ajax , also without reloading the new page version.   Client-side scripts have constant content that, if provided carefully, can produce valid markup.   Server-side scripting, on the other hand, provides content generated on the fly. The source code of the  program serving as the basis for this task is quite complicated when checking for markup errors.  Moreover, the templates used in the markup generated by server-side scripting technologies are hard- coded in many cases and cannot be modified by content authors. Validating and standardizing large  web sites with hundreds of thousands of web pages can be practically impossible.   The major problem with web sites relying on data stored in databases and processed by server-side   scripts is the higher complexity and the lack of full control. Templates used by CMSs are not always  standards-compliant. As a consequence, all errors of such templates are present in thousands of sites  applying the templates. Moreover, a single problem of either the script or the database can result in an  error message instead of the web page content  Figure 6-1 .    Figure 6-1. Content replaced by error message      There is a huge difference between small programs running on web pages and programs created for  generating web pages. Server-side scripting languages are powerful and provide features that cannot be  achieved by static content. There is nothing wrong with small contact forms, for example. However,  server-side scripts should be used wherever appropriate. Large web sites with a database requirement  should definitely apply these technologies. Furthermore, server-side scripts can provide the same  headers, footers, and so on, as templates for identical markup fragments throughout the web site that  can be easily maintained from a single location  in contrast to static web pages . However, the  application of server-side scripting should be minimized on web sites that do not rely on databases and  dynamically generated content, such as small-scale, brochure-style web sites. This is the most direct way  to obtain and ensure full standards compliance. Undoubtedly, a large share of invalid markup code on  the Web is generated by server-side scripting languages. In many cases, additional practices are required  to obtain valid markup, such as to handle the ampersand characters used as an argument separator in  URLs of PHP sessions [2].   214    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Client-Side Development  Client-side development refers to those web programs that run on the client side, generally a web  browser, instead of being executed on the server side  on a web server . Client-side programs can be  used to provide different and changing content on a web page, depending on user input and other  variables. For example, “dynamic” greetings can be added to a web page according to the current time of  day.   Ajax  Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is not a programming language but a group  of web development technologies related to each other, such as HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, XML, and  XSLT. Ajax can be used on the client side to create interactive web applications. Web site applications  empowered with Ajax can send data to and retrieve data from servers asynchronously  which is the  reason for the name . Ajax is suitable for avoiding full-page reloads when exchanging data  asynchronously. This approach ensures that the display and behavior of the current page won’t be  interfered with. Despite the name, Ajax does not require XML; the JavaScript Object Notation  JSON , a  lightweight text-based open standard [3], is often used instead. The requests are not necessarily  asynchronous either. Ajax usually retrieves data using the XMLHttpRequest object [4]. The DOM is used  along with JavaScript to dynamically display information and allow the user to interact with the  information presented. The data interchanged using Ajax can be manipulated using XSLT.    Note  Modern browsers have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object. Before IE7, Internet Explorer provided an object  called ActiveXObject.   To demonstrate Ajax, the code in Listing 6-1 creates a link that will replace the content of a div   element with the content of a text file. The Document Object Model is used to manipulate the object.  The XMLHTTPRequest object is used to make the HTTP request load the file ajaxdemo.txt and display its  content.   Listing 6-1. Ajax Demonstration        var http = false;    if  navigator.appName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer"  {      http = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ;      } else {        http = new XMLHttpRequest  ;      }        function replace   {        http.open "GET", "ajaxdemo.txt", true ;        http.onreadystatechange=function   {          if  http.readyState == 4  {            document.getElementById 'repdiv' .innerHTML = http.responseText;          }   215    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS         }        http.send null ;      }        In the document body, we need a function call and a div with the text to replace  Listing 6-2 .    Listing 6-2. The Function Call and the div with the Original Text         Click here to replace text             Original text in the markup      The http.open   argument is the asynchronous argument that sends the request in the background.   Flex  Adobe Flex is a software development kit  SDK  for cross-platform, rich Internet applications based on  the Adobe Flash technology [5]. The user interface layout and behavior are described by a declarative  XML-based language, MXML, while the client logic is created by using the ActionScript 3.0 programming  language.    Note  ActionScript is an object-oriented language and a dialect of ECMAScript. Consequently, ActionScript is a  superset of the syntax and semantics of JavaScript. Most frequently, ActionScript is embedded in SWF files.   As an example, let’s create a simple RSS news feed reader! First, we need to write a common XML   declaration, followed by an MXML declaration  Listing 6-3 .   Listing 6-3. The XML and MXML Declaration               Within the mx:Application, our HTTPService should be defined, and the custom controls  DataGrid,   TextArea, and Button  are prepared for the panel  Listing 6-4 .   Listing 6-4. The HTTPService and the Panel for the Custom Controls                  216    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS            Now it is time to define the DataGrid. The horizontal dimension of the panel should be set by the   width parameter. Each item tag of the RSS file is bound to a DataGrid row by the dataProvider attribute.  Next we create an event handler to display the contents of the description tags inside the RSS items  selected by the user. The entries.selectedIndex variable is used to determine which item was clicked.  The description of the corresponding item is retrieved by  httpRSS.result.rss.channel.item[entries.selectedIndex].description. The value of the RSS  description is assigned to the htmlText property of the TextArea  Listing 6-5 .   Listing 6-5. Creating the DataGrid for the RSS Reader   <mx:DataGrid id="entries" width="{reader.width-15}"   dataProvider="{httpRSS.result.rss.channel.item}"  cellPress=     "{body.htmlText=httpRSS.result.rss.channel.item[entries.selectedIndex].description}">                                                 Finally, a TextArea needs to be created using the mx:TextArea tag, and a button needs to be created   with a click event handler to call the send   method on the HTTPService object  Listing 6-6 .   Listing 6-6. The TextArea and the Button      <mx:Button label="Load   RSS channel items" click="{httpRSS.send  }"  >   HTML5 APIs  HTML5 provides much more than just new structuring elements. HTML5 supports many features that  were available originally through plug-ins or sophisticated code only [6]. Beyond markup elements and  attributes, HTML5 specifies scripting application programming interfaces  APIs  as well [7]. A native  drawing API, native sockets, and so on, eliminate the problems associated with plug-ins, such as missing  or disabled support to vulnerability issues.   Some HTML5 APIs are under W3C standardization, while others are under WHATWG development.   Some of the most frequently used APIs are discussed in the following sections.   The HTML5 Canvas API  The canvas markup element has been introduced in HTML5. It allows dynamic, scriptable rendering of  2D shapes and bitmap images.    217    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS    Note  The HTML5 canvas has no built-in scene graph, which is a general data structure to arrange the logical   and often spatial  representation of a graphical scene. The scene graph is commonly used by vector-based  graphical systems, including SVG. In SVG, all drawn shapes are stored as an object in the scene graph or the DOM  and then rendered as bitmap graphics. Consequently, if the SVG object attributes are changed, the browser can  automatically rerender the scene, which is not possible on the canvas. From this point of view, SVG graphics are  more advanced than shapes on the HTML5 canvas.   In Listing 6-7, you can see how to draw a simple triangle on the HTML5 canvas. First, a custom-size   canvas is declared with alternate textual content for older browsers that do not support the HTML5  canvas. Second, a script element specifies two variables to shorten the code, a two-dimensional canvas,  an emerald fill color, the coordinates of the three corners of a triangle, and the triangle with the fill color.    Listing 6-7. Drawing on the HTML5 Canvas        A triangle  requires HTML5 Canvas support           var mycanvas = document.getElementById "samplecanvas" ,    context2d = mycanvas.getContext "2d" ;    context2d.fillStyle = "2ad3a8";    context2d.beginPath  ;    context2d.moveTo 100, 0 ;    context2d.lineTo 0, 55 ;    context2d.lineTo 165, 100 ;    context2d.fill  ;      The HTML5 canvas is supported by IE9+, Firefox 3.0+, Chrome 1.0+, Safari 3.0+, and Opera 9.5+.   The HTML5 File and DnD APIs  The HTML5 File API provides easy-to-use file control in web browsers. The File API is being  standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium [8]. The Drag & Drop  DnD  API specification defines  an event-based mechanism that adds additional markup for declaring elements to be draggable on web  pages. The DnD API is being developed by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group  [9].   The code in Listing 6-8 creates an interface to choose files either through browsing the directories   on your computer or by using drag and drop. The name, size, and MIME type of the selected files will be  retrieved using the HTML5 File API.   Listing 6-8. File API Demonstration    Choose file s        218    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS                You can also drag and drop your files here      Retrieved file information         &lt;no files uploaded yet&gt;            function    {      var filesUpload = document.getElementById "upload" ,      dropArea = document.getElementById "drop" ,      fileList = document.getElementById "fileList" ;      function fileTransfer  files  {        var li,        file,        fileInfo;        fileList.innerHTML = "";        for  var i = 0, fl = files.length; i < fl; i++  {          li = document.createElement "li" ;          file = files[i];          fileInfo = file.name;    Name          fileInfo += "  " + file.type + " , ";    Type          fileInfo += file.size + " bytes";    Size          li.innerHTML = fileInfo;          fileList.appendChild li ;        };      };        filesUpload.onchange = function    {          fileTransfer this.files ;        };        dropArea.ondragenter = function    {          return false;        };        dropArea.ondragover = function    {          return false;        };        dropArea.ondrop = function  evt  {          fileTransfer evt.dataTransfer.files ;        return false;      };    }   ;      Listing 6-9. CSS Ruleset for the Previous Example   drop {    border: 2px dashed f00;   The division representing the drop area in the previous example     should be styled   either with a border or with a background color to make it visible  Listing 6-9 .   219    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS     padding: 10px;  }    Next, create a very simple drag-and-drop example with five words that can be dragged from one   division to another and back. First, declare the div items and make them draggable with the draggable  attribute. Then, put them into a container div and create the second div  the target   Listing 6-10 .   Listing 6-10. The Markup for the DnD Example                Drag the word “DnD” to the other box and back                <div id="word1" class="dragbox" draggable="true" ondragstart="return  dragDefine event " ondragend="dragEnd event ">My      <div id="word2" class="dragbox" draggable="true" ondragstart="return       dragDefine event " ondragend="dragEnd event ">dog      <div id="word3" class="dragbox" draggable="true" ondragstart="return  dragDefine event " ondragend="dragEnd event ">is      <div id="word4" class="dragbox" draggable="true" ondragstart="return  dragDefine event " ondragend="dragEnd event ">called      <div id="word5" class="dragbox" draggable="true" ondragstart="return  dragDefine event " ondragend="dragEnd event ">Bobby                      In the document head, declare a script element, and create the functions to be called  Listing 6-11    when the following happens:                The item starts to be dragged   The item being dragged is over another item   The drag is complete   The item being dragged is dropped    Listing 6-11.

Listing 6-12. The Styles for the Boxes   body {     width: 800px;     margin: 100px auto;   }    leftDiv, rightDiv {     float: left;    width: 200px;     height: 100px;     margin: 50px;    background-color: bbdeee;    border: 1px solid 000;  }    .word {    width: 60px;     height: 20px;     margin: 5px;     text-align: center;     font-weight: bold;    background-color: ff6;    display: inline-block;    cursor: move;  }   The File API is supported by Firefox 3.6+ and Chrome 6.0+. Opera 11.5 supports the File API but not  the Drag & Drop API. IE9 supports the Drag & Drop API but not the File API. Safari partially supports the  File API from version 4.0 and will support fully in version 6.   221    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   The HTML5 Forms API  HTML5 introduced new attributes for the input element  autocomplete, autofocus, form, formaction,  formenctype, formmethod, formnovalidate, formtarget, height, list, max, min, multiple, pattern,  placeholder, required, step, and width  and new attribute values for the type attribute of the input  element  including email, url, number, range , search, color, and date pickers  date, month, week, time,  datetime, and datetime-local , as well as form validation [10].   As an example, create an  X HTML5 form for a registration page of a web site  Listing 6-13 .   Listing 6-13. A Registration Form                         E-mail address:         <input id="mailadd" type="email" required="required" name="mail"          placeholder="email@example.com"  >                       Password:                                 Confirm password:                                 Website:                                  Number:                                  Range:                                                    The HTML5 Geolocation API  The Geolocation API provides an interface to retrieve information on the geographical location for a  client-side device. In other words, it can be used in web browsers to find the current position of the user.  The location of the user is not shared until the user confirms the request. The Geolocation API is being  standardized by the W3C [11].   222    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Listing 6-14 shows an example for the application of the Geolocation API. In the example, the   setOnLoadCallback function is used to create a map. The if-then construct is used to check whether the  Geolocation API is supported, get the current position, and, in case it is successfully retrieved, mark it on  the map. If necessary, we inform the user to accept the Geolocation request, or the location cannot be  determined.

In the previous example, we get a marker that does not necessarily mark  the exact location of the user. More sophisticated interfaces, such the “Location-Aware Browsing” test page of  Firefox [12], provide a semitransparent circle above the map rather than a marker pointing to an exact position.   The HTML5 Geolocation API is supported by IE9+, Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 5.0+, Opera 10.6+, and   Safari running on the iPhone.   The HTML5 Web Storage API  Web Storage is an API for persistent data storage of key-value pair data  similar to cookies  in browsers   sessionStorage  and window-local storage saved between sessions  localStorage . The Web Storage  API is being standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium [13].   Table 6-1 summarizes the methods of localStorage and sessionStorage.   Table 6-1.

Display the name-value pairs in a table. Create  a text field where the user can add the item to remove from the stored pairs after clicking the associated  button. Add a push button that can be used to clear the stored items. Provide another text field where  the item name can be typed to retrieve its value. Since the table is created by the displayItems function,  that function should be loaded by the onload attribute on the body element as <body  onload="displayItems  ">.   Listing 6-15.

The HTML5 Web Workers API  Web Workers is an API that can be used to execute scripts in the background independent from any user  interface scripts. Consequently, the user interface is not affected, and all browser tasks are performed  without any delay.   The “worker” in Web Workers refers to a script stored in an external file, which is loaded and   executed in the background  Listing 6-16 .   Listing 6-16. Creating a “Worker”   new Worker "worker.js" ;   While complex JavaScript codes might hang your browser  such as giving an “unresponsive script”   warning , the Web Workers API makes it possible to avoid user interruption, while the browser performs  tasks such as event handling, DOM manipulations, queries, and processes.     Note  Since JavaScript was originally designed to run in a single-threaded environment—that is, multiple  scripts cannot be run simultaneously—Web Workers can be considered as an API that brings threading to  JavaScript.   In our example, we create a “worker” that counts up from 0 to 10,000 in the background. First, two   push buttons are needed in the document body to start and stop counting  two input elements with  unique identifiers , and a paragraph is needed with an identifier     where the result will  be displayed  Listing 6-17 .   Listing 6-17. Markup of a Web Worker Example       Start Stop the Worker                    226    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS    The results    Click Start to start the Worker         function    {      function createWorker    {        worker = new Worker "webworker.js" ;      }      document.getElementById "start" .onclick = function    {        createWorker  ;        worker.postMessage 0 ;     initial value        worker.onmessage = function  evt  {          document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML = evt.data;        };        worker.onerror = function  evt  {          document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML = "Error";        };      };      document.getElementById "stop" .onclick = function    {        if  worker  {          worker.terminate  ;        }      };    }   ;      Listing 6-18. The webworker.js File   onmessage = function  evt  {    for  var i = evt.data, t = 10000; i < t; i++  {      postMessage i ;    };  };   We also need a function for the Start button, an error event handler, and a function for the Stop   button. The function that actually performs the counting takes place in an external .js file  Listing 6-18 .   The Web Workers API is supported by IE10+, Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 5.0+, Safari 4.0+, and Opera   10.6+.   The HTML5 WebSocket API  The WebSocket API can be used for bidirectional, full-duplex communication over a Transmission  Control Protocol  TCP  socket.   The WebSocket API is being standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium [14].  After building a WebSocket connection with the web server, data can be retrieved from the server  using the onmessage event handler and can be sent from the client to the server by the send   method.   A new WebSocket object can be created as shown in Listing 6-19.   Listing 6-19. A New WebSocket Object   var Socket = new WebSocket http:  example.com ws  ;   227    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Optionally, the protocol can also be specified after the URI.  The WebSocket object has two read-only attributes: Socket.readyState and Socket.bufferedAmount.  The first one represents the connection state  0 is no connection yet, 1 is connection has been built, 2 is  closing handshake, 3 is connection closed or cannot be established . The second attribute gives the  number of bytes queued using the send   method.   The WebSocket API supports four events: open  socket connection established , message  client   receives data from server , error  error in communication , and close  the connection is closed . They  can be handled by the Socket.onopen, Socket.onmessage, Socket.onerror, and Socket.onclose event  handlers, respectively.   The two methods of WebSocket are Socket.send    the send   method transmits data through the   connection , and Socket.close    the close   method is used to terminate the existing connection .   As an example, we create a bidirectional TCP socket between the client and the server in the   document head  Listing 6-20 .   Listing 6-20. Creating a WebSocket        function myWS   {      if  "WebSocket" in window  {        alert "WebSocket is supported by your Browser!" ;        var ws = new WebSocket "ws:  localhost:9998 echo" ;        ws.onopen = function   {          ws.send "Message to send" ;          alert "Message sent…" ;        };        ws.onmessage = function  evt  {           var received_msg = evt.data;          alert "Message received…" ;        };        ws.onclose = function   {           alert "Connection closed…" ;         };      }      else {        alert "WebSocket is not supported by your browser!" ;      }    }      Listing 6-21. An Anchor to Start the WebSocket         Start WebSocket       In the document body, the myWS   function should be called to start the WebSocket  Listing 6-21 .   The client program is now ready, but we also need a server with WebSocket support to test it. For   example, pywebsocket, which can be used as a WebSocket stand-alone server and a WebSocket  extension for Apache HTTP servers, is suitable for testing [15].   After the HTTP handshake, the TCP socket is ready for use, and the connection is live; both the   server and the client can send data.   228    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   On the client side, the WebSocket API is supported by Firefox 4+, Google Chrome 4+, Safari 5+, and   Opera 11+.   Offline Web Applications  The offline web application feature in HTML5 allows online applications to work without interruption  even when the Internet connection is not available. For example, users can compose a message in their  webmail client when they cannot find a Wi-Fi hotspot.   Since the browser has no access to web site files when it is offline, the first step is to specify the  required resources  a simple list of fundamental files  for caching in a file called offline.manifest   Listing 6-22 .   Listing 6-22. An offline.manifest File   CACHE MANIFEST  index.html  styles.css  main.js   Listing 6-23. Using the Manifest File       This file should be provided as the attribute value of the manifest attribute on the html element    Listing 6-23 . The file should be served with the MIME type text cache-manifest.   Users will be requested to allow caching on their computer.  The online offline state of the browser can be determined by JavaScript using navigator.onLine.  When the browser is offline, the data can be easily stored locally using the Web Storage API   discussed earlier, that is, the sessionStorage to retrieve data during a session or the localStorage to  retain values for longer periods.   Offline web applications are supported by Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 1.0+, Safari 4.0+, and Opera 10.6+.   Java Applets  Java is an object-oriented, structured, imperative, cross-platform programming language. Java was  originally developed by Sun Microsystems, which is now owned by Oracle Corporation. Java can be used  in a variety of contexts on the client side as well as the server side, including applets, servlets, Swing  applications, and JavaServer Pages  JSP .   Java applets are small applications for performing a specific task and are provided on web sites in a   format called Java bytecode, which can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine  JVM . Although Java  applets can be substituted by alternate technologies such as Flash, Curl, or Microsoft Silverlight, they are  still present on the Web.   A Java applet should be provided by two object elements and self-closing parameters. The inner   object is used by Trident and the outer object by Gecko. Listing 6-24 shows an example.   Listing 6-24. Java Applet Embedding with object   <object classid="java:bookflip.class"   type="application x-java-applet"   229    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS    archive="bookflip.jar"    height="120" width="120">                                                                                                                               Objects must be rendered only once per page. As you will see, a similar approach exists for Flash   objects too  Chapter 9 .   ECMAScript and JavaScript  A widely used scripting language is ECMAScript, which is standardized by Ecma International  ECMA- 262 [16], ECMA-290 [17], ECMA-327 [18], ECMA-357 [19]  and the International Organization for  Standardization  ISO IEC 16262 [20] . The Internet media type of ECMAScript is  application ecmascript, and the file extension is .es.   The three best-known dialects of ECMAScript are JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript. The first one,  JavaScript, is the primary client-side scripting language on the Web. It is used by millions of web sites to  add interaction and functionality.    Caution  JavaScript should not be confused with Java. Although both languages have a C-like syntax,  JavaScript is a scripting language, while Java is general programming language. JavaScript has dynamic typing,  while Java has static typing. JavaScript is a weakly typed language, while Java is strongly typed. JavaScript is  loaded from human-readable source code, while Java is retrieved from a compiled bytecode. In contrast to  JavaScript objects, which are prototype-based, Java objects are class-based.   JScript is the Microsoft implementation of ECMAScript [21]. The major implementations of JScript  are Windows Script, and JScript .NET. The typical file extensions of JScript are .js, .jse, .wsf, .wsc, and,  if embedded, .htm, .html, and .asp.   230    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   ActionScript is an object-oriented language originally developed by Macromedia, which is now   owned by Adobe Systems. It is implemented in Adobe Flash and, as mentioned earlier, Adobe Flex. The  typical file extension of external ActionScript files is .as. ActionScript reuses the MIME type of  ECMAScript.   Embedding and Loading JavaScript  JavaScript codes applied to a whole web page are usually declared in the  X HTML head. JavaScript can  also be used locally in the body section of web documents. Those JavaScript codes that are used  throughout the entire web site are written in external files.   Generally, there are three ways to use JavaScript on web sites. They are discussed in the following   sections.   Loading JavaScript from an External File  This technique is used when the same script applies to multiple documents. The file extension of  external JavaScript files is .js. The character encoding of these files is usually US-ASCII. JavaScript files  encoded in other encoding schemes might have interoperability problems. While UTF-8 is the perfect  choice for  X HTML web documents and can be applied as the default character encoding in the text  editor of any developer, care must be taken to encode JavaScript files  similar to CSS files  in US-ASCII  whenever possible.   External JavaScript files should contain JavaScript code exclusively  Listing 6-25 . The script tags   must also be avoided  Listing 6-26 !   Listing 6-25. JavaScript Code in the Markup        document.write "Nice coding" ;      Listing 6-26. The Same Code in an External .js File   document.write "Nice coding" ;     shows an example.   Listing 6-27. Loading JavaScript from an External File   External JavaScript files can be loaded with the src attribute on the script element.1 Listing 6-27        This embedding is commonly used for the scripts loaded in the document head and any scripts that   are too long to write directly into the markup. Alternate style selectors, font resizers, and hidden layer  controller scripts are some examples for this approach.                                                     1 In the early days of Web, the language="javascript" attribute-value pair was used on the script  element and later was deprecated in favor of type="text javascript".   231    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Inline JavaScript  JavaScript can also be written directly in the markup as the content of the script element. Assume we  have the JavaScript function shown in Listing 6-28 and variables in Listing 6-29 either in the document  head or in an external .js file.   Listing 6-28. A Short JavaScript Function   function fourdigits number  {     return  number < 1000  ? number + 1900 : number;   }   Listing 6-29. Variables   var now = new Date  ;  var year = fourdigits now.getYear   ;   6-30.   Listing 6-30. Inline JavaScript Example   This code provides the current year, which can be used for a “dynamic” copyright content as Listing   Copyright    document.write year ;  John Smith   This is an inline JavaScript code. In this case, it will represent the current year between the copyright   sign and the name, as shown in Listing 6-31.   Listing 6-31. The result of Listings 6-28, 6-29, and 6-30   Note that if the JavaScript code cannot run for whatever reasons, the other parts of the document   Listing 6-32. The Result of the Same Code with JavaScript Disabled or Without JavaScript Support   Copyright   2011 John Smith   are still rendered  Listing 6-32 .   Copyright   John Smith   Event Handlers  JavaScript is often used to provide control over document elements or the browser window according to  user interaction such as clicking an element with the mouse.   Assume three images on a web page intended to modify the font size of the layer main when the user   clicks them. Listing 6-33 shows a possible solution.   Listing 6-33. Functions to Manipulate the Font Size   function normal   {    var esize = document.getElementById 'main' .style;    esize.fontSize = "1.1em";  }   232    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   function larger   {    var esize = document.getElementById 'main' .style;    esize.fontSize  = "1.4em";  }    function huge   {    var esize = document.getElementById 'main' .style;    esize.fontSize = "1.8em";  }   These three functions can be written either within the script tags in the document or in the external   file font.js. In the latter case, they can be loaded with the src attribute of the script element as  discussed earlier in Listing 6-27  the file path and name can be arbitrarily modified .   Now the appropriate event handler function can be loaded with the onclick attribute  Listing 6-34 .   Listing 6-34. Event Handlers That Load the Appropriate Function Upon User Click                                     Which function will be run depends on which image link the user clicks.   Determining JavaScript Support  JavaScript support can be easily determined by a script with an alternate content such as in Listing 6-35.   Listing 6-35. JavaScript with Alternate Content        document.write "If this text is displayed, your browser supports scripting, and      JavaScript is enabled!"       JavaScript is NOT enabled!    Browsers that do not support JavaScript will show the content of the noscript element.   Silverlight  Silverlight is a freeware application framework created by Microsoft Corporation for developing rich  Internet applications [22]. The runtime environment for Silverlight is available as a web browser plug-in.  Silverlight provides many features similar to those of Adobe Flash, such as animations, drawing objects,  reflection effects, glyphs, and so on.   233    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Silverlight uses the Extensible Application Markup Language  XAML  instead of Scalable Vector   Graphics  SVG . XAML is a declarative, XML-based user interface markup language developed by  Microsoft and used extensively in .NET.   Similar to Flash, a common embedding option for Silverlight is using the object tag  Listing 6-36 .   Listing 6-36. Silverlight Embedding with Alternate Content  Determining Support    <object id="SilverlightPlugin1" width="300" height="300"    data="data:application x-silverlight-2,"    type="application x-silverlight-2" >                            Silverlight can be written not only in your text editor but also in the Microsoft Visual Studio software   development platform, which makes it easier to create graphical interfaces displayed simultaneously  with the source code.   Server-Side Development  Although static content is adequate for many web site components, advanced web site features, such as  web applications, content management, online banking, form submission, database management, and  so on, require server-side programming.     Note  The main difference between client-side and server-side programming is that client-side scripts are  downloaded, interpreted, and executed by the browser, while server-side scripts and applications run on the  server.    Tip  In contrast to client-side technologies, where the support either is embedded in most browsers  such as for  JavaScript  or can be set easily by installing a free plug-in  such as for SilverLight , the support for server-side  technologies should be provided by the hosting service provider. While widely adopted technologies such as PHP  and MySQL are supported by most hosting services, it is strongly recommended that you ask the provider about  the support for special technologies before selecting and paying for a service, because hosting companies usually  refuse to install any software components not included in, or supported by, one of their packages  for example,  FFMPEG, ionCube PHP Loader, Apache Ant, Ivy, JTA, JAXP . Some technologies rely on others, and there might be  a prerequisite to install certain software components.   There is a wide variety of server-side scripting and programming languages used to create server-  side applications. Some of the most widely adopted ones are described in the following sections.   234    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   ColdFusion  ColdFusion is an application server offered by Adobe [23] to process the ColdFusion Markup Language   CFML . CFML is a scripting language that uses tags with a structure similar to that of HTML  which is  the reason for the name  [24]; it has a functionality similar to that of PHP. CFML has several  implementations beyond Adobe ColdFusion, such as the .NET Framework, the Java Virtual Machine,  and the Google App Engine. Because of its scalability, ColdFusion is ideal not only for desktop  environments but also for the increasingly popular mobile web applications.   The most significant technologies that compete with ColdFusion are BlueDragon [25], Coral Web   Builder [26], IgniteFusion [27], Railo [28], and SmithProject [29].   Java  The Java programming language was already mentioned earlier in the chapter regarding Java applets.  However, Java is also used on the server side.   JavaServer Pages  JSP  is a Java technology for dynamically generated web pages. The syntax of JSP   combines scriptlet elements and markup  typically HTML or XML  [30]. The content of scriptlet  elements is Java code that might be mixed with the markup.   The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition  Java EE  is a popular platform for server-side programming in   Java. The platform and the associated APIs are defined in separate specifications [31, 32].   WebObjects is a Java web application server and web application framework for Mac OS X   developed by Apple. WebObjects is described by Apple specifications [33, 34, 35].   The .NET Framework  Microsoft .NET is a popular software framework with a wide-ranging library [36]. The .NET Framework  supports several programming languages  C, J, VB .NET, and so on . Any of these languages can use  code written in other languages, which provides a high level of interoperability. A fundamental part of  the framework architecture is the application virtual machine called Common Language Runtime  CLR ,  which is Microsoft's implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure  CLI . CLI is an ECMA  standard  ECMA 335 [37] .    Some applications of the .NET Framework, such as ADO.NET, ASP.NET, and Windows Forms, are   not parts of the previously mentioned standards.   ASP.NET  Active Server Pages, often referred to as ASP or ASP Classic, was a web application framework developed  by Microsoft for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It has been superseded by ASP.NET, which  provides powerful features for web applications and services [38]. The typical file extensions are .asp for  ASP and .aspx for ASP.NET files.   As you can see in Listing 6-37, an ASP script can be embedded in the document body of a web page   by delimiting the script with  .   Listing 6-37. ASP Script in the Markup                    Simple ASP embedding example    235    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS                        <%      response.write "Hello, World!"       %>           Before introducing HTML5 support in Visual Studio and ASP.NET in 2011, ASP.NET generated  error-free XHTML markup in most cases. Since ASP.NET does not modify static text and nonserver  markup elements, however, the final markup was not necessarily standards-compliant per XHTML 1.0  Strict. According to Microsoft, some markup controls providing optional functionality, especially those  with a target attribute for specifying their client-side behavior  AdRotator, BulletedList, HyperLink,  HyperLinkColumn, ImageMap, MenuItem, TreeNode , might result in markup code that is not standard  compliant [39].    C  A popular programming language often used in .NET is C  pronounced See Sharp , which has been  standardized by ECMA [40] and ISO [41, 42]. C is a multiparadigm programming language, which is  declarative, generic, functional, and imperative, and it has strong typing. C applies object-oriented   class-based  as well as component-oriented disciplines.   Perl  Perl is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose, dynamic programming language. The specification of  the language is available at Perl.org [43]. In the late 1990s, Perl became popular as a CGI scripting  language because of its parsing abilities. The core syntax of Perl is summarized in the “Perl style guide”  [44]. A very impressive text-processing feature of Perl is that it can handle text files of arbitrary length if  enough memory is available.   PHP  PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is one of the most popular open source server-side scripting languages. It is  a cross-platform, general-purpose language originally designed for generating dynamic web pages.  Some programmers have tried to introduce “standardized” best practices for PHP over the years [e.g., 45,  46, 47, 48], none of which gained an official status yet. The major specification of PHP is being  maintained by the PHP Group [49], which is considered as the de facto standard of the language, because  there is no formal specification.   PHP is the widely used, free, and efficient alternative to competitors such as ASP.NET.   Embedding and Loading PHP  While some PHP code is embedded in  X HTML documents and mixed with markup elements, complex  PHP applications are provided in external files.   236    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   PHP in the Markup  PHP code is usually delimited by   or   and  . The less  portable short tags <? and <?= and ASP-style tags such as <% and <%= should not be used. PHP parsers  parse code only within the delimiters. In XML documents  thus also in XHTML , the first embedding  method provides well-formed XML processing instructions. Since they are not part of the character data  in the document, there is the potential that the combination of markup and PHP code provides valid  markup on the server before PHP parsing.   The simplest example for embedding PHP in the markup is a “Hello World” script such as hello.php    Listing 6-38 .   Listing 6-38. “Hello World” in PHP                   Hello World in PHP                         Hello World '; ?>            Listing 6-39 will be sent to the browser.   Listing 6-39. The Output with Parsed PHP                   Hello World in PHP                         Hello World!            Depending on the proper server configuration, the PHP code should be parsed, and the output in   The resulting markup validates as HTML5. Note that structural elements and additional contents   are omitted for the sake of understanding.   PHP in External Files  The typical file extensions of external PHP files are .php, .phtml, .php5, and .phps. External PHP files  usually contain the PHP code between the opening and closing delimiters. In other words, they start  with  . However, many PHP files, such as the ones used for settings, do not  necessarily have a closing delimiter.   The include command can be used to insert the content of a specified external PHP file into the   markup  Listing 6-40 .   237    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Listing 6-40. Embedding a PHP File       An external PHP file might contain PHP code, markup, or a combination of the two.    Tip  It is a common practice to collect the markup fragment of common—frequently repeated—web page  contents, such as menus and legal information, and embed them from an external PHP file. This approach  eliminates the redundancy of common scripting requirements of a site.   Python  Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language [50]. Python, similar to other dynamic  languages, is often used as a scripting language as well. Multiple programming paradigms are supported  by Python. Although Python is mainly object-oriented, it also involves functional programming styles.  The capabilities of the language can be extended by third-party tools; for example, Python code can be  provided as stand-alone executables. Python interpreters are available for a variety of operating systems,  which makes Python a cross-platform language.   Ruby  Ruby is a general-purpose, dynamic, and reflective object-oriented programming language. One of the  most common Ruby implementations is the open source web application framework called Ruby on  Rails. The major documentation of Ruby includes the Ruby Core Reference [51], the Ruby Standard  Library Reference [52], the Ruby C API Reference [53], and the document on Rails Searchable APIs [54].   SSJS  Although JavaScript is used primarily on the client side, it has server-side implementations as well.  Server-side JavaScript  SSJS  was first implemented in 1996 in the Netscape Enterprise Server 2.0 and  Netscape LiveWire. The common specifications for SSJS development are provided by the CommonJS  community [55]. The Server-Side JavaScript Google Group makes efforts to create cross-platform SSJS  standard APIs [56].   Combinations of Client-Side and Server-Side Technologies  Not all programming environments are purely client-side or server-side technologies. For example, the  Google Web Toolkit has tools for programming JavaScript front-end applications in Java. Ajax  applications and rich Internet applications can be developed in Python using the development tool and  framework Pyjamas. An open source platform for developing rich Internet applications with client-side  functionality and server-side processing is Tersus.   238    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Database Technologies  A large share of server-side applications and services rely on data stored in databases. One of the most  commonly used databases on the Web is the cross-platform relational database management system  MySQL [57]. It is considered as a de facto standard and also used by the highest-traffic web sites in the  world. Although it is very popular, languages such Ruby and Python often apply database servers other  than MySQL. Some other frequently used database technologies on the Web are Apache Derby [58], IBM  DB2 [59], Firebird [60], Microsoft SQL Server [61], Oracle [62], PostgreSQL [63], SQLite [64], and Sybase  [65].   Alternate Content and Fallback Mechanism for Scripts  In web site standardization, it is vital to provide alternate content for scripts and also design web  documents for user agents that do not support scripting. You can provide the alternate content by using  the noscript element. A script is not executed, and user agents render the content of noscript elements  only if the browser configuration eliminates scripting or in rare cases when the scripting language used  in the script element is not supported. Browsers without client-side scripting support must render the  contents of noscript elements.   For example, if dynamically created data is provided by the script element, a direct link to the   resource can be used if scripting is not supported  Listing 6-41 .   Listing 6-41. Useful Alternate Content          Latest News        There is a practice of commenting out script written in the markup to eliminate rendering element  content by browsers that cannot handle the script element. Advanced rendering engines recognize that  scripts in comments should be executed. This could eliminate the need for comments if external script  files are used.   As you learned earlier in the chapter, a properly embedded script does not break page layout or  content flow when JavaScript is not supported. Still, this approach usually cannot provide the same  functionality or behavior as the script would  the provided information should be similar . The  importance of alternate content or fallback mechanism for JavaScript code can be best demonstrated by  “dynamic” menus that should not rely on JavaScript alone, since the functionality of the site will be lost  if JavaScript is disabled or the script cannot be loaded.   Let’s assume that you have a special Help screen, contained by a layer, that is hidden by default    Listing 6-42  and displayed only when the user clicks the menu “Help”.   Listing 6-42. A Help div Hidden by Default   help {      display: none;  }   disabled or not supported.   Since the help is displayed using JavaScript  Listing 6-43 , it will be not available if JavaScript is   239    CHAPTER 6  SCRIPTING AND APPLICATIONS   Listing 6-43. The Function That Displays the Hidden div   function display_help   {    document.getElementById "help" .style.display = 'block';  }   A good fallback mechanism is to provide a conventional hyperlink—which looks the same as the   link calling the JavaScript code that displays the special Help layer above the page—as an alternate  content  Listing 6-44 . If the layer cannot be displayed because of the lack of JavaScript support, the link  opens another web document with the same content the Help div would provide. Although the visual  appearance of the “Help screen” and the Help document is different, the content is the same. One of  them is always available.   Listing 6-44. An Advanced Menu Item with Fallback Mechanism               <a href="javascript:display_help  ;" title="Guide and access keys" accesskey="h"           tabindex="22">Help                 <a href="http:  example.com help " title="Guide and access keys" accesskey="h"  tabindex="22">Help            Summary  In this chapter, you learned about client-side and server-side scripting and programming languages  used to create scripts, applets, and web applications. Using these technologies on a daily basis is  inevitable, and you know by now that they are vital in web application and service development.  However, many of them are vendor-specific and have not been standardized yet. You also know that a  large share of incorrect markup is generated by server-side applications, even though more and more  provide standard-compliant web documents.   In the next chapter, you will learn about emerging Semantic Web technologies and machine-  readable metadata annotations.   References  1.   Dominique Hazaël-Massieux D  2010  What is scripting?

By default,  however, the content is human-readable only. You can use additional technologies to provide meaning  to web documents, making them machine-readable and part of the Semantic Web. Many terms have  been recently introduced for emerging Semantic Web technologies, but because of the lack of formal  definitions, many of the definitions are somewhat fuzzy. For example, because of the potential to  perform actions automatically, a new era of the Web has begun, which is denoted as Web 2.0. After  gaining popularity on online community portals, some features of the Semantic Web, together with  personalization, are now referred to as Web 3.0. There is a wide choice of metadata available, along with  microformats and various annotations that can significantly extend the possibilities of web documents.  They can also considerably improve the effectiveness of web searches. RDF should be used to add  structure to the Web and change conventional search engines that apply brute-force approaches.   In this chapter, you will learn machine-readable metadata annotations and semantically   meaningful attributes. You will also become familiar with the Resource Description Framework, the  fundamental standard behind Semantic Web technologies. After reading the chapter, you will be able  not only to apply a variety of metadata annotations but also to create new vocabularies, schemes, and  ontologies, including but not limited to the following:   General metadata in the markup: Conventional meta tags       Microformats: Metadata provided as attribute values of markup elements    Microdata: A metadata annotation for general metadata embedding in HTML5       RDF: A standardized framework for Semantic Web data models   OWL: A knowledge representation language for describing and sharing web  ontologies that formally represent knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain  and the relationships between those concepts         FOAF and DOAC: Machine-readable ontologies for people and their professional  capabilities   XMP, Rich Snippets, SearchMonkey RDFa: Metadata formats for images and video  clips   The Semantic Web  Until recently, software agents could not handle many kinds of information that could have been  associated with files. Although file structure and extensions provided some information about files,   245    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   much information could not be expressed. For example, a file with a .jpg extension has always  represented a JPEG image but provided no information about the shutter speed, exposure program, f- stop, aperture, ISO speed rating, or focal length until the introduction of metadata formats such as Exif  and XMP  see Chapter 9 . However, sharing metadata stored in binary files is still not the most efficient  way to share metadata, especially if it is much more generic. In the digital era, electronic files are being  sold  e-books, MP3 files, and so on  that might be retrieved or played on many types of devices. A variety  of metadata technologies can be used to express arbitrary information and represent any kind of  knowledge associated with electronic documents in a machine-readable format. Machine-readable data   automated data  is data stored in a machine-readable format, making it possible for automated  software agents to access and process it without human intervention.   To browsers, web documents consisted of human-readable data only. In fact, information was   confused with the containers that contained them. In contrast to the conventional Web  the “Web of  documents” , the Semantic Web is the “Web of data” [1]. The Semantic Web provides machine- processable data, making it possible for software agents to “understand” the meaning of information  in  other words, semantics  presented by web documents. This feature can be used for a variety of services  [2], such as museums [3], community sites [4], or podcasting [5].     Caution  The word semantic is used on the Web in other contexts as well. For example, in HTML5 there are  semantic  in other words, meaningful  structuring elements, but this expression refers to the “meaning” of  elements. In this context, the word semantic contrasts the “meaning” of elements, such as that of section  a  thematic grouping , with the generic elements of older HTML versions, such as the “meaningless” div. The  semantics of markup elements should not be confused with the semantics  in other words, machine- processability  of metadata annotations and web ontologies used on the Semantic Web. The latter can provide far  more sophisticated data than the meaning of a markup element.   Conventional web documents can be extended with additional data that add meaning to them   rather than structure alone. Semantic Web is a new approach that is going to change the world of the  Web. Surprisingly, as early as 2001, Tim Berners-Lee described the reason for the existence of the  Semantic Web [6]. On the Semantic Web, data can be retrieved from seemingly unrelated fields  automatically in order to combine them, find relations, and make discoveries [7]. The Semantic Web  should be considered an extension of the conventional Web [8].   Two terms are frequently associated with the Semantic Web, although neither of them has a clear   definition: Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.   Web 2.0 is an umbrella term used for a collection of technologies that form the second generation of   the Web, such as Extensible Markup Language  XML , Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  Ajax , Really  Simple Syndication  RSS , and Session Initiation Protocol  SIP . They are the underlying technologies  and standards behind instant messaging, Voice over IP, wikis, blogs, forums, and syndication.   The next generation of web services is more and more frequently denoted as Web 3.0, which is an  umbrella term usually referring to customization and semantic contents and more sophisticated web  applications toward artificial intelligence, including computer-generated contents [9].   The Semantic Web is a major aspect of Web 2.0 [10] and Web 3.0 [11]. Web 3.0 can be considered a   superset of the Semantic Web that features social connections and personalization.   Several technologies contribute to the sharing of such information instead of web pages alone, and   the number of Semantic Web applications is constantly increasing.   246    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   All data controlled by conventional web applications are kept by the applications themselves,   making a significant share of data and their relationships virtually unavailable for automated processing.  Semantic Web applications, on the other hand, can access this data through the general web  architecture and transfer structured data between applications and web sites [12]. Semantic web  technologies can be widely applied in a variety of areas, such as data integration, resource discovery and  classification, cataloging, intelligent software agents, content rating, and intellectual property right  descriptions [13]. A much wider range of tasks can be performed on semantic web pages than on  conventional ones; for example, relationships between data and even sentences can be automatically  processed  see the next sections . Additionally, the efficiency is much higher. For example, a very  promising approach provides direct mapping of relational data to RDF, making it possible to share data  of relational databases on the Semantic Web [14]. Since relational databases are extremely popular in  computing, databases that have been stored on local hard drives up to now can be shared on the  Semantic Web. Commercial RDF database software packages are already available on the market   5Store, AllegroGraph, BigData, Oracle, OWLIM, Talis Platform, Virtuoso, and so on  [15]. Semantic tools  can also be used in a variety of other areas, including business process modeling or diagnostic  applications [16].   Along with these benefits, there are several open issues that need further investigation and, in some   cases, the development of new approaches. The largest challenge of Semantic Web applications is to  resolve semantic data quality problems and identify useful and meaningful information [17]. There are  more and more promising approaches; however, they have a common feature: all rely on standard  annotations, taxonomies, vocabularies, and ontologies. We analyze these essential technologies and  their features throughout the chapter from a standardization point of view.   Structured Data  Data should be structured to support advanced processability and searchability by data type. Structured  data is data organized in a structure to become identifiable. Such data has been used for decades in  computing, such as in the form of Access and SQL databases, where queries can be performed to retrieve  information  for example, a ZIP code . In contrast to relational databases, most data on the Web is  stored in  X HTML documents that contain unstructured data.   Conventional web documents contain large amounts of unstructured data that can be rendered in  web browsers. This approach works satisfactorily for publishing purposes; however, a large amount of  data stored in, or associated with, web documents cannot be processed this way. According to Berners- Lee, the data used to describe social connections between people is a good example for that kind of data  [18]: “The Web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect—to help  people work together—and not as a technical toy. The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and  improve our weblike existence in the world. We clump into families, associations, and companies. We  develop trust across the miles and distrust around the corner. What we believe, endorse, agree with, and  depend on is representable and, increasingly, represented on the Web. We all have to ensure that the  society we build with the Web is of the sort we intend.”   On the Semantic Web, there is a variety of structured data, usually expressed in, or based on, the   Resource Description Framework, which will be described later in detail. Similar to conventional  conceptual modeling approaches, such as class diagrams and entity relationships, the RDF data model is  based on statements that describe and feature resources, especially web resources, in the form of  subject-predicate-object expressions. The subject corresponds to the resource. The predicate expresses  a relationship between the subject and the object. Such expressions are called triples.    For example, the statement “The grass is green” can be expressed in an RDF triple as follows:          Subject: “The grass”   Predicate: “is”   247    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB      Object: “green”   RDF is an abstract model that has several serialization formats. Consequently, the syntax of the   triple varies from format to format  see later in the section “Resource Description Framework” .    Caution  RDF is a concept, not a syntax.    The authors of the “conventional” Web usually publish unstructured data, because they do not  know about the power of structured data, find RDF too complex, or do not know how to create and  publish RDF in any of its serialization formats. The following are solutions to the problem that add  structured data to conventional  X HTML markup, which can be extracted by appropriate software and  converted to RDF:      Microformats, which reuse markup attributes     Microdata, which extends HTML5 markup with structured metadata     RDFa, which expresses RDF in markup attributes that are not part of  X HTML   vocabularies    Linked Open Data  Linked Data  also known as Linking Data  can be applied to improve the exploitation of the “Web of  data.” The expression refers to the publishing of structured data in a way that typed links are created  between data from different sources [19] to provide a higher level of usability. By using Linked Data, it is  possible to find other, related data. Structured data should meet four requirements to be called Linked  Data [20]:      URIs should be assigned to all entities of the dataset.     HTTP URIs are required to ensure that all entities can be referenced and cited by   users and user agents.          Entities should be described using standard formats such as RDF XML.   Links should be created to other, related entity URIs.   All data that fulfill these requirements and are released for the public are called Linked Open Data    LOD . The variety of datasets published as Linked Data is represented by the LOD cloud diagram   Figure 7-1  [21].   248    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB      Figure 7-1. The LOD cloud diagram  courtesy of Richard Cyganiak and Anja Jentzsch    The image collects the datasets published according to the Linked Data principles and represents   links between them. The size of the bubbles corresponds to the number of triples stored in each dataset.  Contributors include the Linking Open Data community project, individuals, and organizations.   Wide Variety of Annotations and Syntaxes  Metadata is structured data describing information about features and content of web sites. The meta  tags written in  X HTML head sections, which do not require additional technologies, can be used to  describe general data about web pages  as mentioned earlier in Chapter 3 and will be described in detail  in the next section . Semantic, machine-readable labels can be provided as attribute values of  X HTML  or XML elements by microdata, microformats, or RDFa.   There are several metadata technologies; many apply different annotations. For example, the  description of a person can be expressed in RDFa, microdata, the vCard microformat, and further  vocabularies such as FOAF or DOAC.   Special metadata such as licensing can be provided with different notations. Licensing information   of images and of the web pages containing them can be different. Providing license metadata can be  beneficial to every web site, especially the ones that have different copyright than the user content, such  as image-sharing portals like Flickr [22]. Image licenses can be provided in basic markup, microdata,  rel="license" microformat, and RDFa.   Several metadata technologies can be written in a variety of syntaxes. In the case of microformats,  for example, there are differences between the markup languages they can be embedded into. In other  cases, reducing complexity is desired  for example, RDF syntaxes .   249    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   The meta Tags  In the 1990s, meta elements had a large effect on web search results. Since then, their significance has  been decreasing, partly because of the unethical tricks that have been used to manipulate search engine  rankings. A good example is keyword stuffing, which was used to load a web page with popular keywords  that were not necessarily relevant to the page content, either in the meta tags or in the content. In the  latter case, the keywords were often hidden, but the web page that contained them was indexed by  search engines. Such tricks made it possible for developers to achieve higher ranking on search results  but significantly increased the number of irrelevant links on search result lists. Although they are less  important nowadays, meta tags still should be used to provide information on web page contents for  search engines.   The meta tags in HTML XHTML can define a variety of metadata, for example, content type, author,   publication date, keywords, page content description, character encoding, and so on. These tags were  introduced in HTML 2.0 and are still current.   Four attributes can be used on the meta element: content, http-equiv, name, and scheme. The first   one is the only required attribute. The meta element attributes can specify the following:       Alternatives to HTTP headers that are sent by web servers prior to the web page  content. Listing 7-1 shows an example.   Listing 7-1. Document Expiry Date Provided by the meta Tag          Names and associated content attributes describing aspects of  X HTML pages.   Listing 7-2 shows an example.   Listing 7-2. Keyword Declaration with the meta Tag       Schemes specify a semantic framework defining the meaning of the key and its  value. They can also prevent potential ambiguity. Listing 7-3 shows an example.   Listing 7-3. A Meta Scheme       In this case, the foo element in the meta element has the value bar from the Dublin  Core  DC  Resource Description Framework  RDF .   The language, keywords, description, and robots attributes contribute to more precise web searches   by defining document language, the most relevant keywords, and a short description. The value of the  last attribute, robots, provides control over search engine behavior for a limited extent [23]. Web pages  can be prevented from being indexed  noindex , crawled  nofollow , cached  noarchive , described   nosnippet , or described according to the Open Directory Project  noodp  [24]. The combination of the  noindex, nofollow values can be substituted by the value none [25]. This setting can be used, for  example, for confidential documents whose content and links should not be considered by search  engines.1 Web page descriptions retrieved from ODP used by search engines Google, Yahoo!, and Bing                                                    1 There are other techniques to achieve similar results. For example, web documents contained by a  directory that is disallowed in robots.txt will not be included in the search results.   250    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   can be disallowed specifically. The meta name to be applied is Googlebot for Google, Slurp for Yahoo!, and  msnbot for Bing  Listing 7-4 .   Listing 7-4. meta Tags for Different Crawlers             Listing 7-5. Using the noydir Attribute Value       If you want to prevent the descriptions and titles retrieved from the Yahoo! Directory from being   displayed in search results, you can use the noydir value [26]  Listing 7-5 .   It is important to keep in mind that in spite of the variety of attribute values, using meta tags for  preventing search engine indexing or crawling is not the best solution. The robots.txt file should be  used instead for this purpose.   The typical general metadata provided in the head section of web documents looks like Listing 7-6.    Listing 7-6. A Complete Example for meta Tags of a Web Document                  <meta name="keywords" content="My Darling, pet shop, pet accessories, dog, collar,  harness, dog lead, dog kennel, dog bowl, dog coats"  >  <meta name="description" content="The website of the pet shop My Darling in Tauranga,  New Zealand."  >   Since the attribute value of the name attribute on the meta element is robots, the value of the content   attribute  index, follow  is applied to all search engines rather than a specific one.   Schemas, Vocabularies, and Ontologies  Taxonomies or vocabularies are structured collections of terms that can be used as metadata element  values. They are parts of conceptual data schemas  conceptual data models  that map concepts and their  relationships. The namespaces reveal the meaning of tags and attributes and form vocabularies.  Formalized conceptual structures can be defined as ontologies, in other words, knowledge  representations of sets of concepts in a domain and the relationships between them. Web ontologies  make it possible to describe complex statements in any topic in a machine-readable format.    Namespaces provide a mechanism to extend the vocabulary of markup languages. To use external  vocabularies and ontologies of various metadata technologies, the XML namespace facility is applied in  order to associate all properties with the appropriate schema that defines them. Specific metadata can  be provided this way such as friends of the author, the nearest airport to the author, GPS coordinates of  the office, and so on. User-defined namespaces  schemas  can be created for additional classes and  instances of resources.   251    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB                                       Shorthand notations are used throughout the Semantic Web to reduce document length. A popular   mechanism is called the qualified name  Qname , which is applied in XML, XML Schema, RDF, RDF  Schema, OWL, Dublin Core, and so on. The following are the most common Qnames:   Refers to the namespace URI http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1    Refers to the namespace URI http:  www.w3.org 2002 07 owl   Refers to the namespace URI http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns   Refers to the namespace URI http:  www.w3.org 2000 01 rdf-schema   dc   owl   rdf   rdfs   xsd   Refers to the namespace URI http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema   The selection of Semantic Web applications is increasing. For example, OntosMiner runs ontology-  driven multilingual information extraction and provides the output in various formats, including  RDF S , XML, OWL, and N3 [27]. Clinical archetypes can be represented and managed as web ontologies  in OWL. OWL can also be applied for e-government representations. Web ontologies can be applied for  considering viewpoints of learning resources such as online programming courses [28]. Financial  headline news can also be represented by ontologies [29]. The following is a short list of some of the  more established ontologies:   Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, often abbreviated as FRBR,  can be used to express bibliographic records with properties such as creator, part,  embodiment, successor, and subject. FRBR has four classes: Work, Expression,  Manifestation, and Item [30].   Licenses of creative works can be denoted by Creative Commons. The Creative  Commons Rights Expression Language is ideal to describe copyright in RDF. It has  properties such as permits, requires, prohibits, jurisdiction, legalcode, and  deprecatedOn, as well as the classes Work, License, Jurisdiction, Permission,  Requirement, and Prohibition [31].   The Open Digital Rights Language is an open standard for policy expressions and  is being developed and promoted by the ODRL Initiative [32]. The digital  management of rights performed using ODRL has also caught attention, and  ODRL is also described as a W3C Note [33].   Thesauruses and taxonomies can be described by the W3C standard SKOS, the  Simple Knowledge Organization System. It has properties such as broader,  narrower, subject, and related [34], that correspond to the properties of  taxonomies, thesauri, classification schemes, and further structured, controlled  vocabularies.      Geographic positions can be precisely annotated in Geo. It has the lat, long, and   alt properties and the SpatialThing and Point classes [35].   252    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB      Biographical information can be expressed by the Bio vocabulary [36].        Math-Net can be applied to standardize the presentation of information on   In education, the IMS IEEE Learning Object Metadata  LOM  can do a service [37].    mathematical departments and research institutes [38].               People and their social networks can be precisely described in RDF XML or OWL  by Friend of a Friend  FOAF  properties such as name, homepage, knows, weblog, and  interest  see the section “FOAF”  [39]. FOAF should be used on all social  networking sites.   Professional capabilities and achievements can be described by Description of a  Career  DOAC   see the section “DOAC”  [40]. DOAC is compatible with the  European Curriculum  Europass  that can be generated from a FOAF+DOAC file.   Software projects, in particular open source ones, can be expressed in Description  of a Project  DOAP  [41].   These schemas, vocabularies, and ontologies are just demonstrations for the endless variety. The list   is not complete by any means. Schemaweb.info [42], vocab.org [43], and other libraries collect further  specific and sophisticated vocabularies, schemas, and ontologies such as the Beer Ontology [44], the  Music Vocabulary [45], or the VidOnt ontology [46]. You can also find many vocabularies with a Google  search.   Web ontologies have their limitations and open issues, however. For example, the verification of  OWL ontologies with rule extensions is rather complex. However, they can be verified at the symbolic  level by using a declarative approach  a new language called Datalog  [47]. The semantic differences  between various ontologies should be resolved. The effort to achieve that goal is known as ontology  alignment. Storing and retrieving data from large RDFs can be performed by advanced techniques only  [48].   Microformats  A special approach to metadata is a set of simple open data formats called microformats  µF . They are  highly correlated with the Semantic Web by applying and reusing features of existing technologies  for  example, the  X HTML rel attribute  and by introducing new ones with the simplest approaches  possible—based on Plain Old Semantic HTML  POSH   for example, hCard . They can be applied not  only in  X HTML markup but also in XML, RSS, Atom, and so on.   Microformats can express site structure, link weight, content type, and human relationships with   the class, rel, and rev attribute values [49]. They are very easy to write, and the number of software  supporting them is increasing  for example, the Operator [50] and Tails Export [51] add-ons for Firefox,  the Google Chrome extension Michromeformats [52], the microformats transformer Optimus [53], or the  Microformats Bookmarklet for Safari, Firefox, and IE [54] .   However, there are still some open issues. For example, applying various microformats as multiple   values on the a element should be avoided  for example, rel="nofollow" and rel="friend" . The rev  attribute used by the Vote Links microformat cannot be used in HTML5.   Profile URIs provided by the profile attribute cannot be used on the head element in HTML5, where   the profile attribute values can be declared for the rel attribute on anchors  a  or link elements  link .  As an example, a profile URI is presented for the hCalender microformat with all the three options. The  hCalendar microformat is based on the iCalendar standard  RFC 2445 [55] . All contents that use  hCalendar notation should refer to the hCalendar XMDP profile, in other words,   253    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   http:  microformats.org profile hcalendar, as shown in Listing 7-7 or Listing 7-8 for the document  head or in Listing 7-9 as part of the document body. These methods can also be combined.   Listing 7-7. Providing the hCalendar Head Profile in the Document Head  Cannot Be Used in HTML5        Listing 7-8. Linking to the hCalendar Profile in the Document Head       Listing 7-9. Using the hCalendar Profile in the Document Body    hCalendar    New structural elements introduced by HTML5, such as article, nav, and section, are not   recognized by certain microformat parsers.   In the next sections, we will give you an overview of some of the most popular microformats,   namely, hCalendar, hCard, rel="license", rel="nofollow", rel="tag", Vote Links, and XFN.   hCalendar  You can use the hCalendar microformat to create calendar entries for sport events, anniversaries,  reminders, meetings, workshops, conferences, and other events. The root class name for hCalendar is  vcalendar. The root class name for events is vevent, which is required for all event listings.   The properties are represented by the elements of hCalendar. The required properties are dtstart,   which should be provided in the ISO date format,2 and summary.   Listing 7-10 shows an hCalendar example.   Listing 7-10. A Three-Day Conference Represented in hCalendar         Semantic Web Conference '11      The Semantic Web Conference 2011 will take place in Pretoria,      South Africa.

The geo property has the subproperties latitude and longitude, while  attendee has the subproperties partstat and role. According to the specification, the property list is not  final and is being extended [56].   Those who have to publish new events regularly might find the hCalendar generator hCalendar-o-  matic useful [57].   hCard  The hCard microformat standard can be used to represent contact data of people, companies, and  organizations by semantic markup [58]. hCard metadata should be provided on the contact pages of web  sites. In summer 2010, hCard crossed the 2 billion mark according to Yahoo! Search Monkey, making it  the most popular metadata format for people and organizations on the Web.   hCard is based on the vCard standard  RFC 2426 [59] . In fact, existing vCards can be easily   converted to hCard.3    Tip  The vCard standard is widely used for storing electronic business cards. For example, Microsoft Outlook  uses this format for the business cards available under Contacts.   The hCard class names should be in lowercase.    Caution  The root class name for an hCard is vcard. An element with a class name vcard is itself called an  hCard.   The two required attributes in hCard are fn and n. However, the second one is optional if any   implied “N” optimization rules are in effect.4 The property n might have the subproperties family-name,  given-name, additional-name, honorific-prefix, and honorific-suffix.   All other properties are optional, including adr, agent, bday, category, class, email, geo, key, label,   logo, mailer, nickname, note, org, photo, rev, role, sort-string, sound, tel2, title, tz, uid, and url.  Allowed subproperties are post-office-box, extended-address, street-address, locality, region,  postal-code, country-name, type, and value for adr; type and value for email; latitude and longitude for  geo; organization-name and organization-unit for org; and type and value for tel2.   A typical hCard code looks like Listing 7-11.                                                    3 The vCard notation BEGIN:VCARD is class="vcard" in hCard, N: is class="n", FN: is class="fn", and so  on.  4 If n is omitted but fn is present, the value of n will be equal to the value of fn.   255    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Listing 7-11. A Typical hCard              John Smith      Smith and Sons      smith@example.com             123 Nice Street        Vancouver ,        BC ,        V5K        Canada           +12345678       The following hCard elements are singular and can be provided just once: fn, n, bday, tz, geo, sort-  string, uid, class, and rev. All other properties are allowed to have multiple instances.   Generally, the visible property values of markup elements represent the value of the hCard property.   However, there are some exceptions.   For hyperlinks that are represented by the a element for one or multiple hCard properties, the href  attribute provides the property value for all properties with a URL value  for example, photo . In case the  img element is used, the src attribute holds the property value for all properties with a URL value. For  object elements, the data attribute provides the property value. The content of the element is the  property value for all other properties.   If the title attribute is provided for abbr elements with hCard notation, its value is considered as   the hCard property instead of the element contents used otherwise.   Although it is easy to create it manually, hCard metadata can be generated by the hCard creator   hCard-o-matic on the web site of the authors of the specification [60]. You simply fill in a form about the  name, organization, country, e-mail, and other contact data, and the software generates the hCard.  To provide additional information, microformats can also be nested. For example, a sport event   review might contain not only the review but also personal information  hCard  at the same time  Listing  7-12 .   Listing 7-12. A Combination of hReview and hCard           The winner takes it all   Review           By  John Smith ,  Editor      at  Consumer Reviews          Rating:  4.5  out of 5.     A fascinating performance.       The review is described by the hReview microformat  class="hreview" . The name of the reviewer is  revealed by span class="reviewer". The hCard microformat is nested inside the hReview microformat in  order to provide additional information about him  a space-separated list of attribute values in <span   256    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   class="reviewer vcard"> . The hCard properties describe the name  fn , job title  title , and  organization  org  of the reviewer.   rel="license"  There are millions of web resources with some or all rights reserved. Many licenses associated with  documents and objects are sophisticated, and users cannot be expected to know them.   The rel="license" microformat can be added to hyperlinks that point to the description of the   license. This is especially useful for images but can be used for any resources.   Basic image embeddings apply only the src and alt attributes on the img element, such as in Listing   7-13.   Listing 7-13. A Basic Image Embedding       To declare the image license, the rel and href attributes should also be used. In the case of the   Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, for example, it should be in the form shown in Listing  7-14.   Listing 7-14. Declaring an Image License   <img src="hotel.jpg" alt="The Palace Hotel" rel="license"    ref="http:  creativecommons.org licenses by-sa 3.0 "  >   The value of the href attribute provides the associated URI of the resource where the license is   described. Some of the most commonly used license deeds are [61] as follows:      Creative Commons Attribution  cc by    http:  creativecommons.org licenses by 3.0       Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike  cc by-sa    http:  creativecommons.org licenses by-sa 3.0      Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives  cc by-nd    http:  creativecommons.org licenses by-nd 3.0      Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial  cc by-nc    http:  creativecommons.org licenses by-nc 3.0      Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike  cc by-nc-sa    http:  creativecommons.org licenses by-nc-sa 3.0      Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives  cc by-nc-nd    http:  creativecommons.org licenses by-nc-nd 3.0   You should select a license that matches what you let others do with your work  distribute  commercially or noncommercially, remix, tweak, share with proper crediting, alter, and so on .   257    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   The profile of this microformat is http:  microformats.org profile rel-license [62], which can be   specified on the head  X HTML tag as shown in Listing 7-15.   Listing 7-15. The Head Profile of "rel=license"       rel="nofollow"  One value of the rel attribute deserves extended attention, because it is often used in search engine  optimization  SEO . When rel="nofollow" is added to a hyperlink, the link destination should not be  considered for additional ranking by search engines. This attribute value can be applied if document  owners need hyperlinks without affecting the ranking of their web pages or links to external web sites.  For example, if a hyperlink is vital on the web page but its destination page has a very low PageRank, the  hyperlink should be provided with rel="nofollow" to avoid endorsement.    Note  PageRank  PR  is a link analysis algorithm used to assign a numerical weighting to each web document in  order to express its relative importance on a 0–10 scale.   For example, if lowprsite.com has a low PR but you have to link to it because of the content   presented there, you can use the rel="nofollow" microformat as shown in Listing 7-16.   Listing 7-16. A Link That Will Be Not Considered by Search Engines While Indexing a Page    Low PR site    Listing 7-17 shows the profile URI of this microformat.   Listing 7-17. The Profile URI of rel="nofollow"       Although it is widely used, there are several open issues about this microformat [63]. The   rel="nofollow" microformat indicates a behavior rather than a relationship, so the definition is illogical.  The name of the microformat does not reflect the real meaning. It is not a noun. It does not affect  spamming. Finally, many legitimate nonspam links might be ignored or given reduced weight, which is  an unfortunate side effect that should be eliminated [64].   rel="tag"  The rel="tag" is still a draft specification since 2005 [65]. Unlike other microformats and general meta  keywords, this microformat can be used for visible links. It can be applied on hyperlink elements to  indicate that the destination of the link is a general author-designated tag  keyword  for the current  page.   258    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Within this microformat, spaces can be provided either as + or as %20. Unicode characters are   encoded according to the generic syntax rules of URIs described by the Internet Society  RFC 3986 [66] .   Vote Links  Vote Links is an elemental microformat with three possible values on the rev attribute of the a element:  vote-for, vote-against, and vote-abstain. The values are mutually exclusive. Optionally, visible  rollovers can be provided by the title attribute. Listing 7-18 shows an example.   Listing 7-18. A Vote Links Example   <a rev="vote-for" href="http:  example.com thumbsup "    title="HTML should be the primary markup language">HTML5   <a rev="vote-against" href="http:  example.com thumbsdown "    title="XHTML should be the primary markup language">XHTML5    Initially, the draft specification applied Vote Links on the rel attribute, which is now deprecated   [67].   Listing 7-19 shows the URI profile reference.   Listing 7-19. The URI Profile for Vote Links       XFN  The very first HTML microformat, XHTML Friends Network  XFN , was introduced in December 2003  [68]. XFN was designed by Global Multimedia Protocols Group to express human relationships with  simple hyperlinks [69]. XFN is especially useful for brochure-style home pages and blog entries.   The name of the person should be provided as the text of the hyperlink  between   and   . The   personal web site is the target of the hyperlink, in other words, the value of the href attribute. All  relationship data can be provided by the rel attribute on a elements. Multiple values are allowed and  should be separated by spaces. The friendship type can be contact, acquaintance, or friend. If the  person is known personally, it can be expressed by the met attribute value of the rel attribute. For  example, a friend of Leslie Sikos whom he knows personally can publish that relationship on his web site  by XFN, as shown in Listing 7-20.   Listing 7-20. Link to the Web Site of a Friend   I am an old friend of  Leslie Sikos .   The distance between the residence of the person and that of his friend can be expressed by the co-  resident and neighbor values. Relatives can set to child, parent, sibling, spouse, or kin. The  professional relationships co-worker and colleague are also supported. Feelings can also be expressed   muse, crush, date, sweetheart  [70].   CSS styles can also be added to XFN metadata. For example, friends can be provided in bold and   colleagues in italic with the CSS rules shown in Listing 7-21.   259    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Listing 7-21. Styling XFN   a[rel~="friend"] {    font-weight: bold;  }    a[rel~="colleague "] {    font-style: italic;  }   Although it is easy to create XFN from scratch, XFN creators such as XFN Creator [71] or Exefen [72]   might speed up development.   XMDP  XHTML MetaData Profiles  XMDP  metadata is an XHTML-based format for defining metadata profiles  that are both machine- and human-readable. XMDP consists of a property definition list, an optional  description, and then, if applicable, one or more definition list items. The profile definition list is  identified by the class  Listing 7-22 .   Listing 7-22. XMDP Profile Definition       The definition term is identified by the id  Listing 7-23 .   Listing 7-23.

An XMDP Profile URI       260    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Drafts and Future Microformats  The number of newly developed microformats is increasing. You can apply them to provide specific  metadata on a wide variety of resources.   Address information can be described by adr [74]. Geographic coordinates  latitude-longitude pairs   can be provided according to the World Geodetic System  WGS  with the geo microformat [75]. hAtom can  be used for web syndication [76]. Information about audio recordings can be embedded by using the  hAudio microformat [77]. The hListing microformat can be applied for open, distributed listings [78].  Image, video, and audio media components can be described by hMedia [79]. hNews is a microformat to  provide news content on web sites [80]. Product descriptions can be expressed in hProduct [81]. Cooking  and baking recipes can be described on the Web with hRecipe [82]. Resumes and CVs can be published  with hResume [83]. Document reviews can be written in hReview [84]. The rel-directory microdata can  indicate that a link destination is a directory listing that refers to the current page [85]. File attachments  provided for downloading can be indicated by the rel-enclosure microformat [86]. rel-home provides a  hyperlink to the home page of the web site [87]. The rel-payment microformat is an online payment  mechanism [88]. The reworking of the robots meta tag is the robots-exclusion microformat [89]. The  xFolk microformat  stands for xFolksomony  was designed for publishing collections of bookmarks [90].   The Microformats Community welcomes metadata enthusiasts to create new microformats [91].   Microdata  The concept of microdata has been introduced in HTML5 for labeling content to describe a specific type  of information [92]. HTML5 microdata can be used for semantical descriptions of people, organizations,  events, products, reviews, and links.    Note  Many descriptions provided in HTML5 microdata can also be expressed in microformats  discussed  earlier , as well as in RDFa  as you will see later . However, each format has its strengths and weaknesses, as will  be described later in detail.   People  A variety of metadata can be used to describe a person on the Web. One of the options to express  properties such as name, job title, or address is microdata. A person can be described with microdata as  shown in Listing 7-26.   Listing 7-26. Describing a Person with Microdata           John Smith  lives in Adelaide, Australia and works as a      Senior Developer  at   LS Inc .      261    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Events  Events, such as workshops, conferences, sport events, and so on, can be described by the following  microdata properties:                                      description: A description of the event   duration: The duration date of the event in ISO duration format   endDate  dtend : The ending date and time of the event in ISO date format   eventType  category : The category of the event, for example, Concert, Festival,  Lecture   geo: Geographical coordinates of the location with two elements: latitude and  longitude   location: Location or venue of the event   photo: Hyperlink to a photo or image related to the event   startDate  dtstart : The starting date and time of the event in ISO date format   required    summary: The name of the event  required    url: Hyperlink of the web page describing the details of the event   For example, a sport event can be described as shown in Listing 7-27.

It is strongly recommended you publish photographs on the Web with licensing metadata. This can   eliminate copyright issues and licensing problems as well as contribute to advanced web searches.   FOAF  FOAF is a machine-readable ontology to describe people and their contact data, interests, and  relationships with other people. In 2007, Berners-Lee defined a new Semantic Web concept known as  the “Giant Global Graph” [93]. He stated that FOAF is an important part of the GGG: “I express my  network in a FOAF file, and that is a start of the revolution” [94].   Unlike conventional online social networks developed in PHP or JSP, FOAF networks can be built   without a centralized database. Additionally, FOAF content can be processed automatically. No one has  to search for friends in FOAF networks because the system itself describes the connections.5 According  to the original FOAF project started in 2000, these systems are open networks [95].   There are more and more FOAF search engines, for example, QDOS FOAFNet [96], netEstate Friend  Of A Friend  FOAF  Search Engine [97], the Semantic Web Search [98], or Quatuo [99]. The latter one, for  example, can also be used for creating FOAF files. However, there are dedicated FOAF generators as well.  The most well-known is FOAF-O-MATIC developed by Leigh Dodds. FOAF files can be generated by  filling in a form  Figure 7-2  [100].                                                      5 However, anybody can provide their own FOAF file and search for others’.   263   s   CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Figure 7-2. FOAF-a-matic in action      Some of the popular content management systems, such as Drupal, also support FOAF [101]. Prior  to these tools, the lack of a graphical user interface could have been the major reason why this powerful  technology has not come into general use until recently.   The FOAF vocabulary provides a variety of classes and properties to express personal data and   relationships [26]:      Basic information       Classes: Agent, Person   264    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB                      Properties: name, nick, title, homepage, mbox, mbox_sha1sum, img, depiction   depicts , surname, family_name, givenname, firstName       Personal information         Online accounts   Properties: weblog, knows, interest, currentProject, pastProject, plan,  based_near, workplaceHomepage, workInfoHomepage, schoolHomepage,  topic_interest, publications, geekcode, myersBriggs, dnaChecksum   Classes: OnlineAccount, OnlineChatAccount, OnlineEcommerceAccount,  OnlineGamingAccount   Properties: holdsAccount, accountServiceHomepage, accountName, icqChatID,  msnChatID, aimChatID, jabberID, yahooChatID       Projects and memberships            Documents and images   Classes: Project, Organization, Group   Properties: member, membershipClass, fundedBy, theme   Classes: Document, Image, PersonalProfileDocument   Properties: topic  page , primaryTopic, tipjar, sha1, made  maker ,  thumbnail, logo   A complete FOAF description looks like Listing 7-29.

Describing Personal Metadata with FOAF          Thomas Davis      Male      Mr      Thomas      Davis                 As you will see, such descriptions can be embedded in XML and RDF files. In contrast to the profiles   of conventional community portals, such as the ones driven by PHP and MySQL, the entire content of  such files can be automatically processed. Anyone who publishes a FOAF or DOAC file on their web site  can provide a machine-readable personal introduction, resources, and links to colleagues and friends.   DOAC  FOAF properties can be considered as the semantic equivalents of personal characteristics and  relationships described on Facebook, and DOAC properties are the semantic counterparts of LinkedIn  features. The DOAC vocabulary not only provides classes and properties to describe professional   265    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   capabilities but also reapplies FOAF properties from the foaf:Person domain, including doac:summary,  doac:experience, doac:education, doac:skill, doac:reference, and doac:publication [27].   Employment history and career experience can be described by the doac:title, doac:date-starts,   doac:date-ends, doac:position, doac:activity, and doac:location properties of the doac:Experience  class.   Education and training information can be provided by the doac:title, foaf:organization,   doac:date-starts, doac:date-ends, doac:subject, and doac:level properties of the doac:Education class.   The doac:Skill class has the subclasses doac:Skill, doac:LanguageSkill, doac:SocialSkill,   doac:OrganizationalSkill, doac:ComputerSkill, and doac:DrivingSkill.   A FOAF+DOAC file looks like Listing 7-30.   Listing 7-30. A Complete FOAF+DOAC Example         John Smith                                CEO          ABC Company          2010-04-06          2011-09-18                                  Information Management          Nanyang Technological University          2000-09-01          2005-06-15                                  en                                              Such metadata is especially beneficial when someone is looking for a job or wants to describe the   cornerstones of their career in a machine-processable format. Consequently, DOAC files could be used  to enable software agents to make automatic job offers according to their qualification and experience.   Dublin Core  Dublin Core is a fundamental group of metadata elements developed and distributed by the Dublin  Core Metadata Initiative  DCMI  and standardized by the International Organization for Standardization   266    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB    ISO 15836 [102] , the Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF   RFC 5013 [103] , and the American  National Standards Institute  ANSI NISO Z39.85-2007 [104] . Dublin Core metadata is often used in   X HTML document head sections  similar to general meta tags , in attributes of XHTML+RDFa  documents, and in other files such as feed channels. It can be expressed using meta and link  X HTML  elements, RDFa, RDF XML representation, and plain XML [105]. The Dublin Core syntax is provided in  the reference model defined by the Dublin Core Abstract Model specification [106].   The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set defines the 15 fundamental elements of Dublin Core,   including contributor, coverage, creator, date, description, format, identifier, language, publisher,  relation, rights, source, subject, title, and type [107]. If these elements are used exclusively, we are  talking about Simple Dublin Core. The extended set of elements is a higher level of Dublin Core called  Qualified Dublin Core, which provides more specific elements. In addition to the general rules of Simple  Dublin Core, further rules apply for Qualified Dublin Core. Qualified Dublin Core properties can be not  only the 15 Dublin Core elements but also other elements recommended by the Dublin Core Metadata  Initiative or DCMI element refinements. Optionally, Qualified Dublin Core values might have associated  encoding schemes, each of which is identified by a name. Element refinements are handled similarly to  properties  element refinement name associated with a Dublin Core namespace .    Dublin Core Namespaces  Dublin Core namespaces can be declared by the rel attribute on the  X HTML link element or with the  xmlns attribute in XML. The  X HTML declaration consists of a prefix and a namespace URI  see Listing  7-31 .   Listing 7-31. A Dublin Core Namespace Declaration       The namespace URIs of all DCMI properties, classes, and encoding schemes are defined by the   following DCMI namespace URIs [108]:   http:  purl.org dc dcmitype    Classes in the DCMI Type Vocabulary   http:  purl.org dc dcam    Terms used in the DCMI Abstract Model   http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1                    The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1  the 15 original elements    http:  purl.org dc terms    All other DCMI properties, classes, and encoding schemes   The DCMI Abstract Model also applies some semantic concepts of the Resource Description   Framework and RDF Schema  RDFS , including resource, property element, class, syntax encoding  scheme, some relationships  has domain, has range, sub-property of, sub-class of , and the concept of  plain and typed value strings [109].   267    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Simple Dublin Core  Dublin Core records consist of one or more properties and their associated property values  Listing   7-32 .    Listing 7-32. A DC Property  Creator  and a Value Associated with It  John Smith        Each property should be an element from the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. All properties are  optional and may be repeated [110]. The DC property values are considered as literal strings and might  have an associated language  for example, en-US . Dublin Core records and the resources they are  applied to are not linked; however, such a linkage can optionally be provided by the identifier element  with the resource URI as the property value  Listing 7-33 .   Listing 7-33. Dublin Core Metadata with identifier        Tutorials          HTML5 and CSS3 tutorials.          Dr. Leslie F. Sikos          http:  www.lesliesikos.com tutorials       The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative recommends three general rules for Dublin Core   implementation:   1.  Dublin Core properties should be provided as XML elements. Property values   should be the contents of those elements. Listing 7-34 shows an example.   Listing 7-34. Dublin Core Properties as XML Elements   2.   Dublin Core in XML element format   3.  All Dublin Core property names should be lowercase. Listing 7-35 shows an   example.   Listing 7-35. Dublin Core Property Names in Lowercase   4.   Dublin Core example   5.  Multiple property values should be declared by repeating the XML element for   that property  see Listing 7-36 .   268    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Listing 7-36. Repeated XML Elements for Multiple Dublin Core Property Values   6.   John Smith   7.   Robert Johnson    Qualified Dublin Core  Qualified Dublin Core makes more specific and advanced  meaningful  annotations possible than  Simple Dublin Core. Using Qualified Dublin Core metadata is similar to adding Simple Dublin Core,  except that Qualified Dublin Core properties can be not only from the set of the original 15 DC elements  but also from additional elements or element refinements defined by the DCMI Metadata Terms  recommendation [111]. Furthermore, all Qualified Dublin Core property values might have an  associated encoding scheme with a unique name listed as the Term name in the DCMI Metadata Terms  recommendation.   Beyond the general implementation guidelines, the following rules apply for Qualified Dublin Core:   1.  Similar to DC properties, the element refinement names should be XML   qualified names  QName  that link to the associated DCMI namespace name   Listing 7-37 .   Listing 7-37. XML QName with Dublin Core    2011-04    2.   In this example, the date or period when the resource became or will become  available is expressed with Qualified Dublin Core.   3.  Element refinements might have further embedded element refinements.  4.  Encoding schemes should be declared by the xsi:type attribute on the XML   element for the property. The name of the encoding scheme is provided as the  attribute value in the form of a QName. Listing 7-38 shows an example.   Listing 7-38. Encoding Scheme Declaration        http:  www.example.com       5.  The names of both the element refinements and the encoding schemes should   be those that are specified in the DCMI Metadata Terms recommendation.  The first letter of the element and element refinement names should always be  in lowercase. The first letter of encoding scheme names should be in  uppercase. Scheme names are often provided in all uppercase. Listing 7-39  shows an example.   Listing 7-39. Element Refinement and Encoding Scheme        http:  www.example.com       269    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   6.  The language of the property value can optionally be provided by using the   xml:lang attribute  Listing 7-40 .   Listing 7-40. Setting the Natural Language for Dublin Core        website standardization          weblap-szabványosítás      Dublin Core Expressed by  X HTML Meta and Link Elements  A URI reference can be either a URI or a relative reference expressed in the RFC 3986 format [112]. URI  references should be represented in full  Listing 7-41 .   Listing 7-41. A Full URI Reference for the subject Metadata       Relative references are allowed only if they can be resolved by the base URI  href attribute on the   base element or from the document URI . Listing 7-42 shows an example.   Listing 7-42. A Relative URI Reference for Dublin Core             A prefixed name is an abbreviation for a URI used in the DC-HTML format [113]. A DC-HTML   prefixed name consists of a prefix followed by a period  .  and a local name. For example, a DC-HTML  prefixed name is expressed as attribute value in the form shown in Listing 7-43.   Listing 7-43. A DC-HTML Prefixed Name          A Dublin Core statement is represented by either an  X HTML meta or a link element, depending on   the content of the statement  literal or nonliteral value surrogate . For example, the document title can  be provided by the meta element as presented in Listing 7-44, while the subject is represented by the link  element as in Listing 7-45.   Listing 7-44. Document Title Declared Using Dublin Core         270    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Listing 7-45. Document Subject Declared Using Dublin Core       Dublin Core metadata on the document language, author, and so on, can be declared in the head   section of XHTML documents, as shown in Listing 7-46.   Listing 7-46. Document Language and Creator Described with Dublin Core          Dublin Core Expressed in XML  Creating XML applications with Simple Dublin Core metadata according to XML schemas instead of  XML DTDs is recommended. XML namespaces should be applied to identify Dublin Core elements,  element refinements, or encoding schemes. Properties should be encoded as XML elements and values.  The names of these XML elements should be XML qualified names  QNames . Property names should be  all lowercase. The XML element should be repeated when providing multiple property values.   The xsi:type attribute of the XML element should be applied for implementing encoding schemes.  Element refinements and encoding schemes use the names specified by the DCMI Metadata Terms. The  xml:lang attribute should be applied to provide the language of Qualified Dublin Core values in XML  [114]. Listing 7-47 shows a complex example.   Listing 7-47. Dublin Core in XML      <metadata    xmlns="http:  example.org myapp "    xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"    xsi:schemaLocation="http:  example.com xmlapp  http:  example.com schemata schema.xsd"    xmlns:dc="http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ">           DC in XML sample document                The description of the XML application.                John Smith                http:  www.example.com           Dublin Core Description Sets  DC-DS-XML  can also be expressed in XML [115]. These sets consist   of one or more descriptions containing zero or one described resource URI, and one or more statements.  The statements contain one property URI and one value surrogate. Depending on the type of the value  surrogate, it can be one value string  in case of literal value surrogates  or zero or one value URIs, zero or   271    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   one vocabulary encoding scheme URI, and zero or more value strings  in case of nonliteral value  surrogates . A value string can be a plain value string or a typed value string. The first one can optionally  be associated with a value string language, while the latter one has a syntax encoding scheme URI.  Nonliteral values can also be described by other descriptions.   A description set element has an expanded name with the pair of the XML namespace name   http:  purl.org dc xmlns 2008 09 01 dc-ds-xml  and the local name descriptionSet  Listing 7-48 .   Listing 7-48.

A statement element is a single Dublin Core statement represented by a child XML element of a   description element. Statement elements have the name dcds:statement.   Value string elements are child elements of statement elements. Literal value surrogates, the value   surrogates for literal values containing one value string representing a literal, can be encoded by the  value string element dcds:literalValueString, which can be provided just once per statement element.   Nonliteral value surrogates optionally contain a value URI represented as the value of the XML   attribute dcds:valueURI of the statement element  Listing 7-49 .   Listing 7-49. Optional Value URI in a Nonliteral Value Surrogate   <dcds:statement    dcds:propertyURI="http:  purl.org dc terms publisher"    dcds:valueURI="http:  example.com">     Smith and Sons Inc       For nonliteral value surrogates, the vocabulary encoding scheme URI can optionally be provided by   the dcds:vesURI attribute.   The value string language of plain value strings can be provided by the xml:lang attribute of the   value string element. Language identifiers of IETF RFC 4646 or later [116] should be applied. Listing 7-50  shows an example.   Listing 7-50. Value String Language Declaration        <dcds:descriptionSet      xmlns:dcds="http:  purl.org dc xmlns 2008 09 01 dc-ds-xml ">   272    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB       <dcds:description        dcds:resourceURI="http:  example.com">      <dcds:statement         dcds:propertyURI="http:  purl.org dc terms title">                   Example document                           For typed value strings, the syntax encoding scheme URI attribute dcds:sesURI should be used.   Dublin Core Expressed in RDF  Simple Dublin Core can be expressed also in RDF, including RDF XML serialization6 [117]. Listing 7-51  shows an example that includes an XML declaration, a reference to the XML DTD, an RDF declaration,  and the resource descriptions.   Listing 7-51.

Optionally, the language of any element in these documents   can be provided by the xml:lang attribute.    Expressing Qualified Dublin Core in RDF is described by another DCMI specification [118]. In   contrast, properties such as dc:creator and dc:date are considered in this document as entities rather  than names. Listing 7-52 shows an example.   Listing 7-52. Qualified Dublin Core in RDF     dc:creator     The original specifications defining the RDF implementations of DC have been superseded by the   2008 specification [119] and notes [120]. For example, the RDF schemas for DCMI properties and classes  have been removed from the specification.                                                     6 RDF will be described in the next sections.   273    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Resource Description Framework  Although it was originally designed as a metadata data model, Resource Description Framework  RDF   has become a general web resource description and modeling language. It can be used for conceptual  description or modeling of information stored in web resources. RDF can be used to create a machine- readable description about any kind of resource, because RDF files can be extended with an arbitrary  number of external vocabularies. In contrast to many W3C standards, RDF has no single specification  but is defined by a set of documents [121].   The RDF data model can be used for describing any kind of resources that can be identified by a   URI. As mentioned earlier, an RDF document is a sequence of statements called RDF triples  resource– property–value or subject–predicate–object . The predicate  property  that denotes a relationship  between the subject and the object can be binary only. Any expression in RDF is a collection of triples. A  set of triples is called an RDF graph, which is a directed, labeled graph that represents information on  the Web. The nodes of the RDF graph are the resources and values [122].   As shown earlier, a person can be described using the FOAF vocabulary. Such descriptions can be   written either in XML or in RDF. Listing 7-53 shows how to write FOAF in RDF.   Listing 7-53. Describing a Person in RDF   <rdf:RDF    xmlns:rdf="http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns"    xmlns:foaf="http:  xmlns.com foaf 0.1 "    xmlns="http:  www.example.com johnsmith contact.rdf">                          Smith        John            Figure 7-3 represents this file as an RDF graph.   274    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Figure 7-3. A simple RDF graph   As you will see, RDF can be expressed in a variety of formats. For example, Listing 7-54 is another   notation of Listing 7-53. This notation, N3, will also be described later in detail.      Listing 7-54. The N3 Equivalent of the Previous Example   @prefix :       .  @prefix foaf:   .  @prefix rdf:    .          :joesmith a foaf:Person ;    foaf:givenname "Joe" ;    foaf:family_name "Smith" ;    foaf:homepage   ;    foaf:mbox   .   The RDF namespace is http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns, which is conventionally   associated with the namespace prefix rdf:.   The Unicode strings in URI references of RDF graphs cannot contain control characters  x00–x1F,   x7F–x9F . These URIs should be absolute URIs with optional fragment identifiers.   RDF literals are used to identify values such as numbers and dates. RDF literals are Unicode strings   containing one or two named components. They should be written in UTF-8 normalized in  Normalization Form C  Canonical Decomposition followed by Canonical Composition [123] . RDF  literals can be either plain or typed. Plain literals are strings combined with an optional language tag   275    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB    normalized to lowercase . They correspond to plain text in a natural language. Typed literals are strings  combined with a datatype URI for applying the lexical-to-value mapping to the literal string.   The Formal Grammar of the Resource Description Framework was introduced in 1999 [124]. RDF   has the following vocabulary:   rdf:Alt, rdf:Bag, rdf:Seq   Containers of alternatives, unordered containers, and ordered containers   rdfs:Container is a superclass of the three                                rdf:List   The class of RDF lists   rdf:nil   rdf:Property   The class of properties   Reification   rdf:type   rdf:XMLLiteral    The class of typed literals   An empty list  an instance of rdf:List    rdf:Statement, rdf:subject, rdf:predicate, rdf:object   A predicate that identifies the class that the resource is an instance of   This vocabulary is also used as the basis for the extensible knowledge representation language RDF   Schema  see the section “RDF Schema” .   There is a query language called SPARQL  pronounced “Sparkle”  that can be used to retrieve and  manipulate information stored in RDF or in any format that can be retrieved as RDF  [125]. The output  can be a results set or an RDF graph. It is also possible to update RDF graphs through a protocol known  as the SPARQL 1.1 Uniform HTTP Protocol [126].   The Resource Description Framework technology is important from the standardization point of   view for many reasons. First, the basic data model of RDF is a standard graph. Second, the naming  system applies standard URLs. The data retrieval and composition mechanisms used by RDF are also  standard technologies.   RDF can be provided in a variety of syntaxes serialization formats, for example, RDF XML   serialization  RDF XML , RDFa, Turtle, Notation3, JSON-LD, N-Triples [127], TRiG [128], and TRiX [129].  The most common ones are described in the next sections.   RDF in XML Serialization Syntax  The recommended and most frequently used syntax for RDF applications is the XML serialization  format, RDF XML [130]. Although there are other notations of RDF that are easier to read and write  see  the next sections , RDF XML provides widely accepted XML documents. However, the fundamental  problem with RDF XML is the contradiction of representing a graph with a tree structure.   276    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   The Internet media type for RDF XML is application rdf+xml. The recommended file extension is   The XML serialization of RDF provides well-formed XML documents  Chapter 1 .  A person’s Wikipedia page, for example, can be described in a machine-readable form in RDF XML,   .rdf.   as shown in Listing 7-55.   Listing 7-55. A Wikipedia Page Described in RDF XML   <rdf:RDF    xmlns:rdf="http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns"    xmlns:dc="http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ">            Rowan Atkinson        Wikipedia            RDF in N3 Syntax  Notation 3, often abbreviated as N3, is a shorthand non-XML serialization of RDF. It is a superset of RDF  and is more compact than the XML serialization of RDF. The grammar of N3 is defined by W3C in many  formats [131], for example, in Extended Backus-Naur Form  EBNF 7 [132].   The MIME type and character encoding of N3 should be declared as text n3; charset=utf-8. The   typical file extension is .n3. Tokenizing and whitespace handling are not specified in the grammar.   Base URIs to be used for the parsing of relative URIs can be set with the @base directive in the form   @base  .    A prefix can be associated to a namespace URI by the @prefix directive.  Several rules for string escaping are derived from Python, namely, stringliteral, stringprefix,   shortstring, shortstringitem, longstring, longstringitem, shortstringchar, and longstringchar.  Additionally, the \U extension, also used in another RDF serialization  N-Triples , can be applied. Legal  escape sequences are \newline, \\  backslash, \ , \'  single quote, ' , \"  double quote, " , \n  ASCII  Linefeed, LF , \r  ASCII Carriage Return, CR , \t  ASCII Horizontal Tab, TAB , \uhhhh  Unicode character  in BMP , and \U00hhhhhh  Unicode character in plane 1–16 notation . The escapes \a, \b, \f, and \v  cannot be used because the corresponding characters are not allowed in RDF.   Shorthand notation can be used for the following common predicates:                a  stands for      =  stand for      =>  stands for           New classes and new properties can be defined in new vocabularies [133]. A class can be defined as   Listing 7-56 because the rdf:type property is abbreviated as a in N3.                                                     7 EBNF is a family of metasyntax notations that can be used to express context-free grammars.   277    Objects can be in multiple classes. Relationships between classes can be written as shown in Listing   CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Listing 7-56. An RDF Class in N3   :Sport a rdfs:Class.   An object of the class can be defined as shown in Listing 7-57.   Listing 7-57. Declare an Object of a Class in N3   :Kayak a :Sport.   7-58.   Listing 7-58.

Relationships between classes are not necessarily hierarchical relationships. You can see an   The person’s Wikipedia page described in the previous section can be written in N3 as shown in   Notation3 has several subsets, including Turtle, N-Triples, N3 RDF, and N3 Rules. The most popular   of them is discussed in the next section.   RDF in Turtle Syntax  A subset of N3 is the Terse RDF Triple Language, often referred to as Turtle. Turtle provides a syntax to  describe RDF graphs in a compact textual form, which is easy to develop. It is a subset of Notation 3  N3   and a superset of N-Triples. Turtle is popular among Semantic Web developers and considered as an  easy-to-read alternative to RDF XML. Turtle is being standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium  [134]. The typical file extension of Turtle files is .ttl. The character encoding of Turtle files should be   278    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   UTF-8. The MIME type of Turtle is text turtle. Turtle is supported by many software frameworks that  can be used for querying and analyzing RDF data, such as Jena [135], Redland [136], and Sesame [137].   Turtle files consist of a sequence of directives, statements representing triples, and blank lines.   Triples can be written in Turtle as a sequence of subject – predicate – object terms, separated by  whitespace, and terminated by a period  . . URIs should be written in angle brackets    . Literals are  delimited by double quotes  "" . Listing 7-62 shows an example.   Listing 7-62. A Basic Example for the Turtle Syntax       "Text content" .   URI length can be reduced by the @PREFIX  Listing 7-63 .   Listing 7-63. A URI Prefix Declaration   @PREFIX ex:   .   Listing 7-64. Using a Prefix   ex:shop ex:contact "Text content" .   In that case, the first example can be written as in Listing 7-64.   where ex:shop declares the concatenation of http:  example.com  with shop, revealing the original URI  http:  example.com shop.   RDFa  The power of RDF, which was demonstrated earlier, can be exploited through external files written in  rather complex syntax. However, there is a nice exception: RDFa. RDFa  RDF in attributes  adds  attribute-level extensions to any markup language  from this point of view, the host language, as  discussed earlier in Chapter 3  in order to describe structured data. In other words, RDFa notations can  be declared in attributes, rather than elements  which is the approach used by other RDF serialization  formats . Although many attributes are defined by RDFa, some markup attributes  such as href and rel   are reused. Wherever possible, the textual content is also reused. RDFa can serve as a bridge between the  “human and data Webs,” since RDFa makes it possible to write RDF triples in the  X HTML markup  [138]. Structured information can be extracted and utilized from web documents via an RDFa  application programming interface  RDFa API  [139]. The mechanism of the RDF data model mapping  allows RDF triples to be embedded within web documents as well as the extraction of RDF model triples  by compliant software.    RDFa provides the option to embed rich metadata within certain attributes of web documents [140].   The set of attributes to be used for this purpose is as follows:   The Unified Resource Identifier  URI  or compact URI  CURIE  [141] of the  resource that describes the metadata           about, src   rel, rev   Relationship with another resource   279    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   href, resource   The partner resource                       property   content   datatype   typeof   A property for the content of an element   Element content override when using the property attribute  optional    The datatype of text specified for use with the property attribute  optional    The RDF type s  of the subject  optional    RDFa makes it possible to arbitrarily mix multiple independently developed vocabularies. It can be   parsed without analyzing the specific vocabularies being applied. This is one of the most advanced  technologies to provide different types of machine-readable structured data in the markup.    Since the “a” in RDFa stands for attributes whose styles are provided most commonly in Cascading  Style Sheets, it is straightforward to use CSS selectors to style the code [142]. For example, if the name of  the creator and the book title of the previous example appear throughout the site, all instances can be  styled using universal selectors  Listing 7-65 .   Listing 7-65. Styling RDFa   * [property="dc:creator"]  {    color: 2a56d3;    font-style:italic;     }  * [property="dc:title"] {    font-size: 2em;    font-family:   Georgia;  }   The latest news on RDFa can be tracked on the web site of the RDFa Working Group of W3C at   www.w3.org 2010 02 rdfa  [143].   For example, let’s describe a person with RDFa notation using the FOAF vocabulary! First we need   to declare the FOAF namespace  either in the document head or on the body element . The about  attribute of RDFa can be used to express the subject, while the RDFa attribute property sets the  predicate  Listing 7-66 .   Listing 7-66. An RDFa Annotation Using FOAF          John Smith       280    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   The content of the p element is both a human- and machine-readable text that will be rendered on   the web page.   Now extend the previous example with another person and express a relationship between the two  persons  Listing 7-67 ! The class of the entity can be declared by the typeof attribute. In this case, we use  the Person class from the FOAF vocabulary to “let the browser know” that John Smith is a person. The  second person is declared exactly the same way. Finally, we use the term knows from the FOAF  vocabulary and pass it as the value of the rel attribute to express that John Smith knows Peter Johnson   declared by the resource attribute .   Listing 7-67. Two People and the Relationship Between Them Expressed Using FOAF in RDFa                John Smith  is       interested in smartphones. <span about="jane" typeof="foaf:Person"       property="foaf:name">Peter Johnson  is an Android developer. <span       about="john" rel="foaf:knows" resource="peter">John and Peter knows each other.                   Compare this machine-readable statement with MySQL database records displayed using PHP, and   you have a glimpse of the power of the Semantic Web!    Other vocabularies can be similarly used with RDFa. For example, Dublin Core metadata can be   embedded to the markup using RDFa, as shown in Listing 7-68.   Listing 7-68. An RDFa Annotation Using DC   <p xmlns:dc="http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 "    about="standardweb" property="dc:title">   Web standardista  Dr. Sikos  describes    Web standardization, accessibility, and Web semantics in his latest book     Web standards .

Microformats vs. Microdata vs. RDFa  You should have noticed that there are similar concepts defined by certain microformats and HTML5  microdata to describe people, events, or licenses. RDFa, on the other hand, is not limited to such  concepts and can be used to annotate any kind of resource.   As discussed earlier, microformats reuse HTML attributes  for example, class, title  and have   separate vocabularies that are difficult to combine, because microformats do not use the namespace  mechanism. Last but not least, microformats do not define an RDF representation.8   HTML5 microdata, as also presented earlier, provides news attributes for the HTML5 markup.   HTML5 microdata is easy to write and works well in documents that use a single external vocabulary.                                                    8 It is possible to transform microformats to RDF using technologies such as XSLT and GRDDL, but such  transformations depend on the vocabularies being used.   281    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Combining different vocabularies is rather complex in HTML5 microdata. Some vocabulary mappings,  such as that of Dublin Core elements, are supported by the technology by default. A missing feature is  the concept of data types and namespaces. Fortunately, however, HTML5 microdata defines a generic  mapping to RDF, so it can be used to express triples.   In contrast to microformats and microdata, RDFa is a complete serialization of RDF and hence   provides the most advanced annotation of them all. RDFa defines new markup attributes and uses URIs  and namespaces by default. Consequently, combining vocabularies is very easy  similar to RDF . RDFa is  completely flexible regarding literals and URI resources.   RDF Schema  According to the W3C Metadata Activity, RDF Schema  RDFS  is “a declarative representation language  influenced by ideas from knowledge representation” [144]. RDF Schema extends RDF with structure   classes, properties of properties, and so on . It can be used to formalize metadata exchange between  human-readable and machine-processable vocabularies. Beyond the basic RDF vocabulary discussed  earlier, RDFS has several additional constructs [145]:      Classes                          rdf:Property   rdf:XMLLiteral   rdfs:Class   rdfs:Datatype   rdfs:Literal   rdfs:Resource   Properties                              rdf:type   rdfs:comment   rdfs:domain   rdfs:isDefinedBy   rdfs:label   rdfs:range   rdfs:seeAlso   rdfs:subClassOf   rdfs:subPropertyOf   These classes and properties provide a more advanced level of knowledge representation than RDF  does and can be used for basic description of web ontologies. This is the reason why the more expressive  language Web Ontology Language  OWL  reuses many RDFS components  see next section .   282    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   For example, the resource “macaw” can be declared as a subclass of the class “birds,” as shown in   Listing 7-69.   Listing 7-69.

Web ontologies can be used for a variety of purposes, such as searching, query  formation, indexing, and agent or service metadata management, or to improve application and  database interoperability. Web ontologies are especially useful for knowledge-intensive applications,  where text extraction, decision support, or resource planning are common tasks, as well as in knowledge  repositories used for knowledge acquisition.   The abbreviation of the Web Ontology Language, OWL, is not straightforward on purpose [146].   OWL ontologies are RDF graphs, in other words, sets of RDF triples. Similar to RDF graphs, OWL  ontology graphs can be expressed in various syntactic notations. There are three variants of OWL: OWL  Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full [147]. OWL is a higher-level language than RDF; in fact, it is a vocabulary  extension of RDF. Consequently, RDF graphs are OWL Full ontologies.   The default OWL namespace is http:  www.w3.org 2002 07 owl, which defines the OWL   vocabulary. There is no MIME type defined specifically for OWL. Using the application rdf+xml or the   283    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   application xml MIME type for OWL documents is recommended. The recommended file extension is  either .rdf or .owl.   The development of the first version of OWL was started in 2002, and the second version, OWL2, in   2008. OWL became a W3C Recommendation in 2004 [148], and OWL2 became one in 2009 [149, 150].   Syntaxes  At the high level, the OWL abstract syntax [151] and the OWL2 functional syntax [152] can be used. OWL  also supports several exchange syntaxes, including RDF syntaxes [153]  RDF XML [154], RDF Turtle  [155] , the OWL2 XML syntax [156], and the Manchester syntax [157]. RDF XML is the normative syntax  [158].   For example, a class declaration for a smartphone ontology can be written in various syntaxes, as   shown in Listings 7-71 to 7-75.   Listing 7-71. OWL2 Functional Syntax Example   Ontology      Declaration  Class  :Smartphone          Listing 7-72. OWL2 XML Syntax Example                                      Listing 7-73.

Manchester Syntax Example   Ontology:    Class: Smartphone   Properties  In OWL, the following types of properties exist:   284    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB             Object properties that link individuals to other individuals   Datatype properties that link individuals to data values  subclasses of object  properties    Annotation property  owl:AnnotationProperty    Ontology property  owl:OntologyProperty    Property features are defined by the property axioms. The basic form expresses the existence only.   For example, in a smartphone ontology, the property hasKeyboard can be declared to express a major  feature of mobile phones  see Listing 7-76 . Most entry-level mobile phones have a phone keyboard,  while many smartphones have a touchscreen only, but some have a full QWERTY keyboard.   Listing 7-76. A Property Declaration in OWL       OWL property axioms can also define additional characteristics. OWL supports RDF Schema   constructs such as rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:domain, and rdfs:range. Relations to other properties can  be expressed by owl:equivalentProperty and owl:inverseOf  Listing 7-77 .    Listing 7-77. Two Equivalent Smartphone Properties  Accelerometer and G-sensor    Global cardinality constraints are defined by owl:FunctionalProperty and   owl:InverseFunctionalProperty. Logical property features are defined by owl:SymmetricProperty and  owl:TransitiveProperty [159]  Listing 7-78 .                           Listing 7-78. A Symmetric Property in OWL                    OWL provides precise declarations for expressing relationships, even if they are evident. For   example, the property hierarchy of two smartphone features can be expressed in functional syntax, as  presented in Listing 7-79.   Listing 7-79. Property Hierarchy in OWL   SubObjectPropertyOf  :hasGeotagging :hasCamera     Classes  Similar to RDF, OWL provides classes to group resources. There are six different class descriptions in  OWL:   285    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB      Class identifier  URI reference . A named instance of owl:Class, a subclass of   rdfs:Class.9 Listing 7-80 shows an example.   Listing 7-80. A Class Identifier in OWL       Set of individuals  instances of a class  defined by the owl:oneOf property. For  example, the class of smartphones can be declared in the RDF XML syntax with  the RDF construct rdf:parseType="Collection", as shown in Listing 7-81.   Listing 7-81. Class Instances in OWL                                                Property restriction: a value constraint or a cardinality constraint  for example,  Listing 7-82 .   Listing 7-82. Property Restrictions in OWL                    Intersection of two or more class descriptions. For example, the intersection of  two Brochures enumerations can be described by the statement  owl:intersectionOf, as presented in Listing 7-83.               Listing 7-83. Intersection in OWL                                                                                                                                                          9 In OWL Lite and OWL DL. In OWL Full they are equivalent.   286    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB                                                  1.  where the intersection is a class with the only common individual Guide.      Union of two or more class descriptions. For example, the union of the previous  example contains the individuals Manual, Guide, Prospectus, Specs, and Overview   if they are all different .      Complement of a class description. The class extension contains exactly those   individuals who do not belong to the class extension of the class description that  forms the object of the statement. The complement can be described by the  owl:complementOf property.   Class descriptions can be combined into class axioms. Class hierarchy can be expressed by subclass   axioms  Listing 7-84 .   Listing 7-84. Class Hierarchy in OWL   SubClassOf  :Slide :Smartphone     7-85 shows an example.   Listing 7-85. Equivalent Classes in OWL   Listing 7-86. Class Disjointness in OWL   DisjointClasses  :Bar :Slide     The equivalence of two classes express that the individuals contained by them are identical. Listing   EquivalentClasses  :Virtualkeyboard :Softquerty     Although individuals can be members of several classes in general, in many cases memberships are   exclusive. For example, a smartphone belongs to either the bar or the slide form factor. This class  disjointness can be expressed as shown in Listing 7-86.   Combining Metadata  Schemas are often combined on the Semantic Web in order to apply all those specific vocabularies that  are designed to express metadata on the topic of the web pages being described. The longest lists of  namespaces occur in web documents that provide a significant amount of additional metadata, most  commonly, in  X HTML+RDFa. Listing 7-87 shows an example.   Listing 7-87.

It is highly recommended to list only those namespaces that are actually used in the  document, which contributes to code optimality and easier maintenance. Although unnecessary  namespaces do not cause any error messages in the browser, they make the markup more complex.    Because of the different features of vocabularies, the combined application is not always   straightforward. For example, many terms are included in various vocabularies, and choosing one of  them is often driven by personal preference only. In fact, you should consider the specification of the  candidate properties in order to choose the most suitable one for a given scenario.   Combining Vocabularies in RDF  The easiest way to mix properties from any vocabulary is to create an RDF file. For example, a  completely machine-readable personal profile uses FOAF terms to describe the title, name, gender, IM  accounts, home page, phone number, and relationships of a person. The nearest airport to the office of  the person can be expressed with a term from the Contact vocabulary, the date when the file has been  created can be declared by Dublin Core, and so on  Listing 7-88 .    Listing 7-88.

Microformats can also be used simultaneously with  X HTML5  microdata. For example, hCard can be applied simultaneously with microdata, as shown in Listing 7-89.   289    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Listing 7-89.

Consequently, rich semantics can be added to  documents from a variety of vocabularies simultaneously  Listing 7-90 .    Listing 7-90.

Dublin Core, vCard, and Math-Net  The introduction of a person on a brochure-style home page can be described in many ways. One of  them is the combination of Dublin Core and vCard. Indexing and processing such data can be enhanced  by providing them in RDF. Listing 7-91 shows an example.   Listing 7-91. Combining DC and vCard with Math-Net      <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns"    xmlns:dc="http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 "    xmlns:rdfs="http:  www.w3.org 2000 01 rdf-schema"    xmlns:vCard="http:  www.w3.org 2001 vcard-rdf 3.0">         290    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB                             John Smith            John Smith                         Smith              John              Dr                       1976-05-12                             It is important to keep in mind that Dublin Core element name conventions and XML element   nestings do not consequently apply to all the other metadata schemas.   Some vocabulary from the Math-Net schemes can be used to extend descriptions of persons   expressed by other vocabularies, including Dublin Core and vCard [160].   DC, IMS, and ODRL  When using the XML or RDF XML syntax, Dublin Core can be used in combination with external  metadata vocabularies such as IEEE Learning Object Metadata  IMS  [161] or Open Digital Rights  Language  ODRL  metadata [162]. For example, the storage, preservation, and retrieval of digital  learning materials at universities can be properly provided by the combination of Dublin Core, LOM,  and local labels describing learning materials when using the Greenstone digital library software [163].  For example, an online educational system can be described accurately by three different types of   metadata  Listing 7-92 .   Listing 7-92.

Some of them are provided in the markup, while others are embedded into binary files  such as images.   Image Metadata and XMP  Digital photographs and custom images form integral parts of web sites. Various types of metadata can  be provided with them, including descriptive, technical, and administrative metadata.    An advanced approach is to provide image metadata by markup. The alt attribute is vital for   validity. Properly provided attribute values can improve accessibility too  see Chapter 10 . The longdesc  attribute, however, which could be used to provide a link to a long description for images and other  nontext contents, has poor software support and is obsoleted in  X HTML5.   Beyond the image descriptions provided in markup and the descriptions or image licensing written   in RDFa discussed earlier, advanced and professional image manipulation software such as Adobe  Photoshop can be used to add or modify metadata contained in the image files themselves  Figure 7-4 .  To a limited extent, file explorers of modern operating systems can also perform this task.   Depending on the image format, a wide variety of metadata can be applied, including, but not   limited to, title, author, copyright holder, keywords, orientation, point of view, color space,  photographer’s contact data, camera data, origin, advanced metadata, and more.    Note  Several types of metadata about the exposition are embedded in JPEG files taken by digital cameras that  can be retrieved in image viewer and processing applications.   292    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Figure 7-4. Manipulating image file metadata in Photoshop      Behind the scenes, Adobe Photoshop applies the Extensible Metadata Platform  XMP  standard   created by Adobe Systems. The serialization of XMP can be embedded into several popular file formats,  including GIF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, PNG, and TIFF images, as well as PDF files10 [164]. GIF supports XMP  embedding as an application extension with the identifier XMP Data and authentication code XMP. In JPEG  files, the XMP metadata is embedded at application segment 1  0xFFE1  with segment header  http:  ns.adobe.com xap 1.0 \x00. In JPEG 2000 images, the XMP metadata can be located at the uuid  atom identified by the UID 0xBE7ACFCB97A942E89C71999491E3AFAC. In PNG files, XMP is embedded inside  an iTXt text block with the keyword XML:com.adobe.xmp. XMP is located at Tag 700 in TIFF images. The  Portable Document Format supports XMP embedding in a metadata stream within a PDF object.      Figure 7-5. Textual RDF metadata in a binary JPEG image file   The major problem with images from this aspect is that they are binary files  Figure 7-5  that need  different approaches to be indexed or searched than text files do. For example, in Google Image Search  there are additional aspects, including the techniques applied for eliminating very small  for example,  1x1 pixel  images, scams, and so forth. Textual metadata used on top of the metadata stored in the image  files themselves always provides an advanced level of processing and sharing options.                                                    10 External .xmp sidecar files can be provided for all other file formats that do not support embedded XMP  metadata.      293    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Metadata for YouTube Videos  The popular video-sharing web site YouTube provides a convenient option to embed videos stored on  YouTube servers to custom web pages. RDFa notation can be used to improve the effectiveness of web  searches on such videos.   The details on how to create standard-compliant markup from the YouTube embedding code by   eliminating the embed tag and moving the required attributes to the object tag will be described later in  Chapter 13.   There are two video metadata formats to be written in the markup that are recognized by Google:   Facebook Share and Yahoo! SearchMonkey RDFa [165]. They can be used alternately or simultaneously.  They should be written directly into the markup in a way that they can be read without JavaScript or  Flash.   Facebook Share and RDFa Rich Snippets  The image and video resource URLs are required for Facebook Share  image_src and video_src . The  medium property supports the values audio, image, video, news, blog, and mult. Video size can be provided  using the video_width and video_height properties. The MIME type of videos can be identified by  video_type  with the value application x-shockwave-flash . A brief description of up to 200 characters  can be written by using the description property. The title of the video, which can be a maximum of 60  characters long, can be added by the title property. These properties are also recognized by Google.   A complete Facebook Share example looks like Listing 7-93.   Listing 7-93. A Facebook Share Example      <meta name="description" content="Organist John Smith plays Praeludium and Fuge in A minor    by J. S. Bach"  >                  Yahoo! SearchMonkey RDFa  Yahoo! SearchMonkey metadata can be provided on the object tag as demonstrated in Listing 7-94.   Listing 7-94. A Yahoo! SearchMonkey Example   <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385"    data="http:  www.youtube.com v a38-oj8VEXI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" rel="media:video"    resource="http:  www.youtube.com v a38-oj8VEXI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"    xmlns:media="http:  search.yahoo.com searchmonkey media "    xmlns:dc="http:  purl.org dc terms ">           294    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   The SearchMonkey media namespace xmlns:media is required, and the only acceptable value is  "http:  search.yahoo.com searchmonkey media ". The GIF, JPEG, or PNG image with a resolution of  105x93 pixels that previews the video before the user clicks the Play button should be defined by the URI  as the href attribute value of media:thumbnail. The video to be played when the user clicks the Play  button should be defined by the resource of media:video.   All other tags are optional, including the Dublin Core namespace  xmlns:dc  and Dublin Core   metadata  dc:contributor, dc:creator, dc:date, dc:description, dc:identifier, dc:license,  dc:subject , the media metadata  media:duration, media:height, media:player, media:region,  media:title, media:type, media:views, media:width , as well as review:rating [166].   Metadata in SEO  Although there is no strict correlation between higher page ranking or better search list positions and  standardized web sites, several technologies contribute to better, higher-quality web documents.  Semantic content adds meaning to web documents, making information indexing, searching, and  processing easier. Metadata annotations considerably extend the potential of web searches.   The potential in web documents enriched with RDFa is increasing since major search engines have   begun to process these annotations while indexing. More and more of this metadata is being indexed  and considered by search engines. Google, for example, started to apply the hCard, hProduct, and  hReview microformats as well as RDFa in 2009 on search result pages as what it calls Rich Snippets [167].  Yahoo! has indexed RDFa and microformats since 2008 [168]. Web site content enriched with RDFa or  microformats can enhance web searches by providing useful structured data [169].   Google indexes microdata, microformats, and RDFa contact properties derived from the hCard   microformat, including name, nickname, photo, title, role, url, affiliation, friend, contact,  acquaintance, and address. The microformats properties fn, org, and adr that stand for name, affiliation,  and address, respectively, are also displayed on web search pages.11 Additionally, Google recognizes the  XFN microformats friend, contact, and acquaintance [170]. Relationships and connections expressed in  XFN and FOAF are also processed by Google [171].   As discussed earlier, the nofollow attribute value of the rel attribute on anchor elements can be   used to ensure that the web page will gain no PageRank from the destination link. Such links are  followed by Google, but PageRank is not added. Bing does not follow the link, and the page is not  indexed. Yahoo! follows the link and indexes the page. Listing 7-95 shows an example.   Listing 7-95. Applying the nofollow Attribute on a Link    External site    Yahoo! SearchMonkey supports the following metadata [172]:     Microformats, including hCard, hCalendar, hReview, hAtom, hResume, adr, geo,   tag, and XFN   RDFa        eRDF  embedded RDF                                                    11 Google displays human-readable content only. Machine-readable metadata is not displayed. For  example, the date declared as the content of the span element <span class="value-title"  title="2011-12-06T20:00-08:00"  > 06 December, 8 PM  is the human-readable content, which  is specified independently from the machine-readable attribute value of the title attribute in the ISO  date format  2011-12-06T20:00-08:00 .   295    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   Microformat searches in Yahoo! can be performed easily with queries in the form shown in Listing   7-96.   Listing 7-96. Microformat Search Syntax used by Yahoo!   searchmonkeyid:com.yahoo.page.uf.metadata_name   where metadata_name is the name of the metadata in lowercase. RDFa and eRDF searches are similar.  The only difference is that the string uf should be changed to rdf. For example, the hCard microformat  can be searched with the query searchmonkeyid:com.yahoo.page.uf.hcard, RDF in attributes with  searchmonkeyid:com.yahoo.page.rdf.rdfa, and so on.   Metadata annotations such as RDFa can effectively contribute to better search results. The more   semantic content that is provided on the Web, the more reasonable and relevant search results that can  be expected from search engines.12 Properly set metadata can help search engines better process and  provide personal introductions, contact data, and full descriptions of persons and human relationships  in search results. The indexing of brochure-style business cards and personal information described in   X HTML markup, XML, RDF, FOAF, and DOAC is straightforward. However, semantic contents  embedded in conventional markup can be processed only if they are supported by the mechanisms used  by web crawlers. Fortunately, the number of metadata types with meaning processable by search  engines is constantly increasing.   In spite of the considerable potential of metadata applications in search engine optimization, there  are several limitations as well. For example, image metadata cannot be fully exploited since a large share  of social media and photo-sharing web sites either remove all embedded metadata during upload or  apply a new, on-the-fly generated file without them  even in another file format . Images uploaded to  the Internet by anonymous Wikipedia editors, on the other hand, can be found by their embedded  metadata indexed by Google  if available . It is arguable whether this feature is advantageous.   Similar to any other data, it is important to decide wisely what to publish on the Web. It is no   problem at all to publish the ISBN number of a book or a link to the DBpedia description of a web site  item; however, several types of metadata are risky to publish since they can be abused. Especially e-mail  addresses, phone numbers, and instant messenger screen names should be provided with extreme  precaution.   Metadata embedding goes hand in hand with accessibility. Accessibility guidelines can ensure that  alternate content is provided for objects and that the document structure is well organized  Chapter 10 .   It is also important to note that SEO and user experience  UX  do not necessarily coincide. For   example, frequently repeated keywords can decrease human readability [173].   Summary  In this chapter, you learned the fundamental concepts of the Semantic Web. You know by now how to  create machine-readable metadata annotations and external metadata files at the source level. You are  familiar with the most common schemas, vocabularies, and ontologies; the major serializations of the  Resource Description Framework; and the basics of creating ontologies with OWL. You know how to  combine annotations derived from different vocabularies, describe licenses and images in machine- readable formats, and use this metadata to boost the searchability of the files of your web site.    The next chapter will show you how to create standard-compliant news feed channels from scratch   and maximize their interoperability.                                                    12 It is important to keep in mind, however, that markup is only one thing considered by search engines.  For example, comprehensive and unique site content is becoming more and more important for gaining  better positions on search results.   296    CHAPTER 7  METADATA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB   References  1.

In: InterACT With Web Standards – A Holistic  Approach to Web Design. New Riders, Berkeley      305    C H A P T E R  8              Web Syndication   The amount of up-to-date information shared on the Internet is constantly growing. Web syndication  provides news feed channels in order to publish a summary of recently updated web site contents, latest  news, or forum posts. These web feeds make it possible for users to stay informed without browsing web  sites. Moreover, the same feed can also be shared among multiple web sites. Although the two popular  web syndication formats, RSS and Atom, have relatively easy vocabularies, news feed channels are  desired to conform to strict standards, first of all XML.   In this chapter, you will learn how to create standard-compliant news feed channels by hand and  update them frequently while maintaining standard compliance. You will be familiarized with the pros  and cons of the two major rivals, RSS and Atom. Moreover, you will learn about the data formats used for  news feed elements, along with the default and legal property values. You will also become familiar with  the required channel and item elements, as well as the ones that should be provided to maximize  interoperability.   News Feeds  Web syndication makes web site components available to multiple sites without logging in or  downloading irrelevant components of other sites. The phrase often refers to web news feeds  news  channels  that provide an up-to-date summary of recently added contents and the latest changes of web  sites. Most commonly news feeds are used for the latest news, news headlines, blog entries, and forum  posts.   The first technologies for web syndication appeared in 1997, including the Channel Definition   Format [1], Meta Content Framework [2], and scriptingNews [3]. The first version of Really Simple  Syndication  RSS , which later became the most widely used web feed format, was published by  Netscape in 1999 [4]. The first part of the specification of Atom, the other popular news feed, was  introduced in 2005.    Since feed readers and aggregators run on a variety of software platforms and devices including, but   not limited to, web browsers, Windows news feed reader gadget, Microsoft Outlook, and news feed  readers on smartphones, interoperability is vital.   Really Simple Syndication  Really Simple Syndication  RSS  is the most widely used web syndication format. Since RSS is an XML  application, it can be extended through XML namespaces. Beyond its conventional use of representing  news and press releases, RSS also has special applications such as providing up-to-date exchange rates  for banks [5].   The typical file extensions for RSS are .rss and .xml. The Internet media type associated with RSS is   application rss+xml, which is not standardized yet [6].   307    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   RSS describes lightweight syndication channels with the properties title, link, description,   channel, and item.   RSS has the following versions: RSS 0.90, RSS 0.91, RSS 0.92, and RSS 2.0. In 2000, the name RDF Site  Summary was in use, which referred to the extensibility with RDF-based modularization [7]. Version 0.91  was called Rich Site Summary, which dropped the RDF structure and imported elements from the  scriptingNews syndication format developed by Dave Winer for his news site “Scripting News.” The  current acronym is Really Simple Syndication. The latest version of the RSS Specification has a  permanent URI at the RSS Advisory Board web site [8].The most widely used and most advanced  version, RSS 2.0.11 [9], is discussed in the next sections.   Creating an RSS File  To create an RSS file, you first need an XML declaration and an rss element. The rss element is the root  element of RSS files and is the container of a channel element, which provides information about the file  and contains item elements  news feed entries . Listing 8-1 shows the general structure of an RSS file.  The version attribute on the rss element is required, and its value must be 2.0 for RSS 2.0.11  without  indicating the subversion .   Listing 8-1.

In CDATA sections,           markup code  can also be included. ]]>                   Naturally, RSS files generally contain many more item elements.    Tip  Theoretically, an RSS channel can contain an arbitrary number of items. However, some RSS readers  such  as the news feed reader gadget in Windows  do not support RSS files larger than approximately 150KB or 2,800  lines, which corresponds to approximately 7 months if you update your RSS file daily. It is recommended that you  keep the file size under this limit to maximize interoperability.   Some of the presented elements are required, while others are optional but highly recommended.   First we’ll examine the required elements.   Required Elements  As shown in the previous section, the rss element contains the channel element with all its contents. The  required elements of the channel element in RSS 2.0 are title, link, and description.   The title Element  The title element represents the name of the channel. It often coincides with the title of the web site it  is associated with. Listing 8-2 shows an example.   Listing 8-2. The Title of an RSS Channel   John Smith Headlines    The link Element  The link element is a URI representing the domain where the news feed is located. Listing 8-3 shows an  example.   309    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   Listing 8-3. A Link in RSS   http:  example.com     The description Element  The description element contains a sentence or sentence fragment that describes the channel, as  demonstrated in Listing 8-4.   Listing 8-4. A Channel Description in RSS    The latest news about rock star John Smith.    Optional Elements  In RSS 2.0 news feeds, the channel element has 16 optional subelements, including category, cloud,  copyright, docs, generator, image, language, lastBuildDate, managingEditor, pubDate, rating, skipDays,  skipHours, textInput, ttl, and webMaster. We’ll look at all of these subelements in more detail here.  A common feature of all RSS 2.0 elements providing a URL is that they should begin with a URI   scheme defined by IANA [10], for example, http:  , https:  , news:  , mailto:  , or ftp:  . Note that  the http:   and ftp:   schemes cannot be used in RSS versions before RSS 2.0.   The category Element  One or more categories can be specified for RSS channels, which can be used for classification and  filtering. For example, an RSS news feed of a web site dedicated to Semantic Web events might contain  categories such as conferences, workshops, specifications, and so on. Another example might be a  bookseller who uses categories to indicate the category of the latest book releases so that potential  customers can easily track the latest books of a certain category  for example, the ones who are  interested in Romans are not necessarily involved in technical books . The category element can be used  for not only the entire channel but also for each item separately. Listing 8-5 shows an example.   Listing 8-5. A category Element in RSS    Workshops    Listing 8-6. Category with Domain   The element has an optional domain attribute that is a URI identifying a taxonomy  Listing 8-6 .    WS    The value of the category element declared for the channel can be used by portals for classifying   RSS news feed channels, while the values of category elements specified for item elements are displayed  by certain news feed readers as hyperlinks, which can be used as filters  for example, in feed readers  implemented in modern browsers . By clicking one of these links, the feed reader hides news entries  from all other categories.   310    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   The cloud Element  To be immediately notified of updates of an RSS channel, a publish-subscribe protocol can be written  for RSS feeds with the cloud element. It specifies a web service that supports the rssCloud interface   which can be implemented in HTTP-POST, XML-RPC, or SOAP 1.1 . Two request methods are  supported: a client-to-cloud call to request notification and a cloud-to-client call to perform  notification. A client request has five required parameters, including the name of the remote procedure  to be called by the cloud when an update occurred, the TCP port of the client, the remote procedure call  path of the client, the string xml-rpc  in case the client uses XML-RPC  or soap  in case SOAP is used ,  and the URLs of RSS files. It is a prerequisite for the IP address used for the request for notification to  coincide with the IP address that will receive notifications. Listing 8-7 shows an example.   Listing 8-7. Using the cloud Element in RSS   <cloud domain="rpc.example.com" port="80" path=" RPC2" registerProcedure="pingMe"    protocol="soap" >   The update notification sent by the cloud to the client contains one parameter: the URL of the RSS   file that changed. As a response, the client must return the Boolean value TRUE.   The copyright Element  Copyright notice of RSS channels can be provided by the copyright element. Listing 8-8 shows an  example.   Listing 8-8. Providing Copyright Information in RSS    Copyright   2011 John Smith. All rights reserved.    The docs Element  A hyperlink to the documentation of the RSS format being used can be provided by the docs element.  The typical element value is http:  www.rssboard.org rss-specification.   The generator Element  RSS feeds generated by software tools can easily be recognized from the value of the generator element,  where the generator software usually identifies itself  Listing 8-9 .    Listing 8-9. An RSS News Feed Generated by Movable Type    Movable Type 4.34-en    If the element is omitted or contains a simple text editor, it usually shows that the feed is written by   a hand-coder at the source level  as we do in this chapter . In such cases, the author provides a text  editor such as Notepad++ and typically identifies himself or herself as the creator using the Dublin Core  vocabulary. However, most people apply feed generators.   311    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   The image Element  An optional subelement of the channel element is image, which can be used to provide an image for the  RSS feed. It has three required and three optional subelements:                           The URL of the image representing the channel is expressed by the url  subelement. The image format can be GIF, JPEG, or PNG. Required.   The alternate text of the image is defined by title. When the RSS is embedded  into  X HTML, this string is forwarded as the text for the alt attribute. The value of  the title subelement should coincide with the value of the title element of the  channel. Required.   The image hyperlink to the site of the channel is determined by the link  subelement. The value of the link subelement should coincide with the value of  the link element of the channel. Required.   The image width can be determined in pixels by the width subelement. The  default value is 88, and the maximum is 144. Optional.   The image height can be determined in pixels by the width subelement. The  default value is 31, and the maximum is 400. Optional.   The description of the image to be included in the title attribute of the hyperlink  of the image in  X HTML can be provided by the description subelement.  Optional.   Listing 8-10 shows an example.   Listing 8-10. A Logo Image Specified for an RSS File         http:  www. bigprofitconsulting.com images logo.png      Big Profit Consulting      http:  www.bigprofitconsulting.com        Note  The image declared for an RSS file is displayed in RSS readers such as the ones implemented in  browsers but not used by feed readers such as the feed reader in Outlook or the Windows feed reader gadget.   The language Element  The natural language of the news feed content can be declared by the language element. For example:    en    Table 8-1 summarizes the allowed values.   312    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   Table 8-1.

Two-letter subcodes are  ISO 3166 country codes [14].   The managingEditor Element  The managingEditor element can be used to provide the e-mail address of the news feed editor. Listing 8- 11 shows an example.   Listing 8-11. Declaring the RSS Editor    john@example.com  John Smith     The pubDate and lastBuildDate Elements  The publication date of the channel content can be provided by the pubDate element. The element value  changes every time the news feed is updated. RSS applies the date and time specification RFC 822 [15]  except that the year can be expressed either in two or four characters  the latter one is preferred . Offsets  should be provided according to the difference from Greenwich mean time  GMT  Coordinated  Universal Time  UTC . For example, an RSS channel updated on 24 November, 2010, at 08:04 a.m. in  London, England  in other words, in the GMT time zone , can state the publication date shown in Listing   317    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   8-12, while another news feed published in Suva, Fiji  time zone 1200 GMT or UTC+12 , at the same time  can be written as shown in Listing 8-13.

The date of the last modification of the news feed can be expressed by the lastBuildDate element in   the same format as pubDate.   The skipHours and skipDays Elements  Periods without updates can be provided by the skipHours element and days by the skipDays element.  Allowed values for skipHours are the integer numbers between 0 and 23  the time in GMT   Listing 8-14 .   Listing 8-14.

They can be used to   specify those days when the news feed channel is not updated and thus unnecessary to check for  updates  Listing 8-15 .    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   Listing 8-15. An RSS Feed That Is Not Updated on Weekends          Saturday      Sunday        Note  The declared hours or days are hints only. RSS feed readers may not read the channel during the listed  periods.   The textInput Element  Another optional subelement of the channel element is textInput, which can be used to specify a search  box. It has four required subelements:                The label of the Submit button is determined by the title subelement.   The text input area can be described by the description subelement.   The name subelement identifies the text object.   The link subelement provides the URL of the CGI script used for processing  requests.   The textInput element is ignored by many RSS readers.   The ttl Element  The duration of caching before refreshing from the source can be expressed in minutes with the ttl  element  which stands for “time to live” . In the case of three hours, for example, it can be written as  Listing 8-16.   Listing 8-16. 180-Minute Caching in RSS    180    The webmaster Element  The e-mail address of the webmaster responsible for the technical issues of the RSS channel can be  expressed with the webMaster element.   Subelements of the item Element  The item element has ten subelements: author, category, comments, description, enclosure, guid, link,  pubDate, source, and title. All subelements are optional; however, at least a title or a description should  be provided for each item element.   319    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   The author Subelement  The e-mail address of the author of the news feed item can be provided by the author subelement.  Listing 8-17 shows an example.   Listing 8-17. The RSS Author    info@example.com  John Smith     The category and pubDate Subelements  The syntax of the category and pubDate subelements of the item element is the same as that of the  corresponding subelements of the channel element  see the sections “0” and “0” .   The comments Subelement  If there is a forum or blog that is related to a news entry  item element , a link to that page can be  provided by the comments subelement of the item element. Listing 8-18 shows an example.   Listing 8-18. Comments of an RSS Item    http:  example.com blog 14352    The description Subelement  The texts of items  news summaries  are delimited by the description subelement, as shown in Listing  8-19.   Listing 8-19. An RSS Item Description           Reports from workshop sessions   The enclosure Subelement  The enclosure subelement of the item element can be used to describe files  usually audio or video   related to the news feed item. It has three required attributes: url  URL of the file , length  file size in  bytes , and type  media type , as demonstrated in Listing 8-20.   Listing 8-20. An Enclosure       320    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   The guid Subelement  Each RSS item might have a string that uniquely identifies it, called the globally unique identifier. The  guid subelement has no specific syntax rules, but its content is usually a URL  Listing 8-21 .    Listing 8-21. A guid Specifying a Permalink Related to the News Entry         New HTML5 and CSS3 tutorials      http:  www.lesliesikos.com tutorials       Mon, 06 Feb 2012 14:22:00 +0930      Dr. Leslie Sikos      Website      http:  www.lesliesikos.com tutorials       Tutorials on HTML5 video embedding and CSS3 transitions      Several tutorials have recently been published on emerging      technologies such as HTML5 video embedding and CSS3 transitions.       The guid subelement has an optional attribute, isPermaLink, that can be set to true or false. In the   first case  which is the default , the attribute value must be a URL that points to the full article or story  described by the item element . The false value is rarely used. In fact, the whole isPermaLink attribute is  often omitted.    Caution  The guid subelements, if provided, should be unique throughout the RSS file. This criterion might be  difficult to meet if the frequent updates of the same web site are described multiple times in the file.    The value of a guid subelement is considered a string by RSS readers.    Tip  Although the guid subelement is optional, it is recommended to provide it for all item elements in order to  maximize interoperability.   The link Subelement  The URL of an item can be provided by the link subelement. Listing 8-22 shows an example.   Listing 8-22. A Link Declared for an RSS Item    http:  example.com news    321    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   The source Subelement  If the item content comes from an external RSS channel, it can be provided by the source subelement.  The value is the title of the resource channel. The source element has one required attribute, url, which  is the URL of the resource  Listing 8-23 .   Listing 8-23. The Source of an RSS Item    John Smith Headlines    The title Subelement  The titles of RSS channel items can be declared by the title subelement of the item element. Listing 8- 24 shows an example.   Listing 8-24. The Title of an RSS Item    A new W3C standard    Namespaces  The default namespace for RSS is http:  purl.org rss 1.0 , which is the permanent URL form of the  RDF Site Summary  RSS  1.0 namespace, http:  web.resource.org rss 1.0 . The namespace can be  provided in the form presented in Listing 8-25.   Listing 8-25. Declaring the RSS Namespace       Additional data on channel updates can be provided by the web syndication namespace of RSS    http:  purl.org rss 1.0 modules syndication  . It extends the RSS channels with three elements:               The period over which the news channel is updated can be described by the  sy:updatePeriod element. Allowed values are hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and  yearly. If omitted, daily is assumed.   The frequency of updates can be expressed in relation to the update period with  the sy:updateFrequency element. Its value is a positive integer.   To calculate the publishing schedule, a base date can be defined by the  sy:updateBase element. It should be a PCDATA date in one of the W3C date and  time formats [16].   By default, news feed entries are plain-text contents. However, news aggregators often support    X HTML markup that are not allowed in XML. Entity-encoded and CDATA-escaped contents can be  provided with the content:encoded element defined by the http:  purl.org rss 1.0 modules content   namespace. The content:encoded element is especially useful if the hyperlink delimited by the link  element is not enough and additional hyperlinks are needed  in the news item content . Although text  formatting and other markup codes can also be written this way, they are ignored by many RSS readers.   322    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   There is an element, atom:link, that can be used from another syndication format  Atom1  to   provide the self-link of the news feed channel. To apply this element, the Atom namespace  http:  www.w3.org 2005 Atom should be declared.   Advanced news feeds typically contain at least the namespace declarations presented in Listing    8-26.   Doing so, elements can be used from these namespaces in the channel as shown in Listing 8-27 or in   item elements such as in the example in Listing 8-28.   Listing 8-26.

An Element from an External Namespace in an RSS Item    <![CDATA[ An escaped RSS item can contain markup elements such as     hyperlinks  that work in all major news feed    readers. ]]>    Styling RSS Feeds  The browsers that support news feeds usually provide a basic styling or no styling at all  rendering a tree  structure instead . Developers who are not satisfied with that or want to ensure an advanced look  which  is also similar in all browsers  can format RSS channels using CSS or XSLT.   In the first case, a CSS reference is required in the form presented in Listing 8-29.   Listing 8-29. Using a CSS File for Styling RSS             Writing the CSS rules is straightforward. For example, the font size of the main title can be increased   by the CSS rule presented in Listing 8-30.                                                     1 The Atom format will be described later in the chapter.   323    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   Listing 8-30. Setting the Font Size for the RSS Channel and Title    channel title {    font-size: 1.4em;  }   The font of the document can be set as shown in Listing 8-31.   Listing 8-31. A CSS Rule for the Entire RSS Document   rss {    font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;  }   Similarly, further styles can be set for other RSS elements. Much information is not necessarily   relevant and can be omitted, as for example in Listing 8-32.   Listing 8-32. Hiding RSS Elements with CSS   channel link, channel language, channel copyright, channel managingEditor,    channel webMaster, channel docs, channel lastBuildDate {    display: none;  }   The second approach applies XSL Transformation, which provides more control. For example,  hyperlinks can be activated, and node order can be changed. The XSL file can be linked as shown in  Listing 8-33.   Listing 8-33. Using XSLT for Styling RSS              Note  Additional functionality such as searching or category listings provided by the built-in RSS reader of  certain browsers are not available when custom style sheet are applied to a news feed.   Atom  The Atom news feed specification consists of two standards: the Atom Syndication Format and the Atom  Publishing Protocol  AtomPub or APP . The first one is a web feed format in XML syntax defined by an  IETF proposed standard  RFC 4287 [17] . The second one is an HTTP-based protocol that can be used for  creating and updating web resources. It is also a proposed standard  RFC 5023 [18] . This section focuses  on the Atom Syndication Format.   The file extensions of Atom feeds are .atom and .xml. The Internet media type of Atom is   application atom+xml.   The Atom namespace is http:  www.w3.org 2005 Atom.   324    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   Creating an Atom File  Atom files begin with an XML declaration. The root element of Atom files and the container of news feed  entries  entry elements  is the feed element. Listing 8-34 shows the general structure of an Atom file.   Listing 8-34. General Structure of an Atom File            An Atom news feed example                tag:www.example.com,2008-09-29:  4      2011-08-08T08:03:00Z             News item 2               tag:www.expl.com,2011:  4.9167        2011-08-08T08:03:00Z        2011-08-08T08:03:00Z        Summary of news entry 2                 John Smith                             The full content        of News 2.

In CDATA sections,           markup code  can also be included. ]]>                These elements and attributes are described in the following sections in detail.   325    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   Text Constructs  Text constructs of Atom contain language-sensitive, human-readable texts. An optional attribute of text  constructs is the type attribute. If provided, the attribute must have one of the following values: text,  html, or xhtml. If omitted, Atom feed readers consider text constructs as if they were specified with the  default value text. MIME types cannot be declared as attribute values for the type attribute.   Person Constructs  There are three person constructs in Atom that describe an entity such as a person or a corporation:  name, uri, and email.   Atom news feeds must contain exactly one name element that provides the name of the author. The   element content is language-sensitive.   The uri element is optional, and a maximum one can be provided to link to the web site of the  author. The content of the uri element is an Internationalized Resource Identifier  IRI  in the form  defined by RFC 3987 [19].   The e-mail address of the author can be declared by the optional email element of which no more  than one can be used in an Atom file. The content of the email element should conform to the standard  Internet Message Format defined by RFC 2822 [20].   Date Constructs  The contents of date construct elements should be declared according to the date-time format defined  in RFC 3339 [21]. Date and time should be separated by an uppercase T, while an uppercase Z should be  used when the numeric time zone offset is omitted  Listing 8-35 .   Listing 8-35. Some Valid Timestamps in Atom    2012-12-13T08:15:01Z    2012-12-13T08:15:01.25Z    2012-12-13T08:15:01+01:00    2012-12-13T08:15:01.25+01:00    All date values of Atom new feeds should comply with the ISO standard on date and time   representation  ISO 8601:2004 [22]  and the W3C date and time format [23] specifications, as well as the  ISO 8601 Conventions in the W3C Recommendation “XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition”  [24].   Containers  There are three container elements in Atom:   The feed element, which contains the entire feed   The entry element, which contains a simple news entry          The content element, which contains a full story  the content of a news entry    The next sections describe these containers in detail.   326    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   The feed Element  As mentioned earlier, the top-level element of Atom feeds is feed; it contains the news feed metadata  and contents  all other Atom elements . One or more author elements are required for feed elements,  except all child entry elements of the feed element contain at least one author element. Exactly one id  element must be provided for all feed elements. The feed elements must contain exactly one updated  element. Exactly one title element is required for all feed elements. The feed elements should contain  one link element with a rel attribute value set to self.   An arbitrary number of category as well as contributor elements can be included in feed elements.   Only one generator is allowed for each feed. The same is for icon and logo elements as well.    The feed elements can contain a maximum of one link element with a rel attribute value set to   alternate that has the same type and hreflang attribute values. Beyond such link elements, additional  link elements might be included in the feed elements.   Only one rights and subtitle element is allowed for each feed element.  All Atom elements are described in the next sections.    The entry Element  Atom news can be provided by the entry element. It can be a child of the feed element or a stand-alone,  top-level element within the feed. The entry elements must have a minimum of one author element  except when a source element is provided in the entry that has an author element or the feed element  contains an author element. Optionally, entry elements have any number of category elements. The  entry elements might have a maximum of one content element. Another optional subelement of the  entry element is the contributor. An arbitrary number of contributors can be provided.   The entry elements must have an id element.  The entry elements without content must provide a minimum of one link element with the rel   attribute and the alternate attribute value.   The entry elements cannot contain more than one link element with the rel attribute and the   alternate attribute value with exactly the same type and hreflang attribute values. Optionally, additional  link elements can also be provided for the entry elements.   The entry elements can contain a maximum of one published, rights, source, and summary element.  The summary subelement should be provided for entry elements if the entry contains a content   element with the src attribute or the entry content is Base64 encoded.2   The entry elements must contain exactly one title and one updated element.   The content Element  The Atom news content can be provided by the content element. The content of this element is  language-sensitive. The content element has two attributes: type and src.   The value of the type attribute on the content element might be text, html, or xhtml. If it is omitted,   text is considered the default value by Atom readers. Another option is to provide a MIME media type   but not a composite type .   The content element has an optional src attribute. The value of this attribute should be an   Internationalized Resource Identifier that conforms to RFC 3987. If the src attribute is provided, the                                                     2 Although the type attribute of the atom:content element is an Internet media type, it neither is an XML  media type nor begins with text  or ends in  xml or +xml.   327    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   content must be empty. The type attribute should also be provided with a MIME type along with the src  attribute.   Metadata and Content Elements  Similar to RSS, there are several elements in Atom to express metadata and describe the contents of  news entries, such as author, category, contributor, generator, icon, id, link, logo, published, rights,  source, subtitle, summary, title, and updated. Those elements whose specification assigns meaning to  the content and the ones with special restrictions are described in the following sections.   The author Element  The author in Atom feeds can be provided in three levels. If the author element is not provided as a  subelement of an entry element, the author is derived from the author subelement of the source  element. Otherwise, the author declared by the author of the feed element is considered  Listing 8-36 .   Listing 8-36. Declaring the Author of an Atom Feed          John Smith       The category Element  The category element has three attributes: the required term and the optional scheme and label  Listing  8-37 .   Listing 8-37. A Category Declaration in Atom       The value of the label attribute is language-sensitive. Character entities used in the attribute values   are considered characters instead of markup.   The contributor Element  The person or company that contributed to an entry or the whole feed can be indicated by the  contributor element  Listing 8-38 .   Listing 8-38. A Feed Contributor         Alex Sikos       328    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   The generator Element  If a software tool is used to generate the Atom news feed, it can be identified by the generator element.  The generator element has two optional attributes. The value of the uri attribute should be an  Internationalized Resource Identifier according to RFC 3987. The other optional attribute is version that  represents the version of the Atom generator  Listing 8-39 .   Listing 8-39. An Atom Generator Identified in the Feed    Movable Type    The icon Element  Similar to the contents of the uri element and that of the uri attribute of the generator element, the  content of the icon element should also be an IRI reference that conforms to RFC 3987. This element  specifies an image file for the Atom news feed. Image resolution should be provided  Listing 8-40 .   Listing 8-40. An Icon for the Atom Feed    http:  example.com images  icon.gif    The id Element  The id element is a permanent identifier provided in lowercase  Listing 8-41 . It is used as a subelement  of both the feed element and the entry elements.   Listing 8-41. An Atom Identifier    tag:example.org,2003:3    Percent-encoding , the mechanism that encodes certain characters of a URI using a string that  begins with a percent sign  % ,3 should be eliminated whenever possible.4 Dots should be avoided in  URIs. The Internationalized Resource Identifier should be NFC normalized, or NFKC normalized. Empty  fragment identifiers should be preserved. The URIs in id elements are case-sensitive. Identifiers that  apply percent-escaping are considered different from the ones that do not when comparing id  instances.   The link Element  External hyperlinks related to an Atom entry or the whole feed can be provided by the link element. This  element has six attributes: href, rel, type, hreflang, title, and length. The required href attribute  contains the Internationalized Resource Identifier of the link. The optional rel attribute must have a  nonempty string as a value according to either the IRI or the isegment-nz-nc syntax rules of RFC 3987.  Allowed values are alternate, related, self, enclosure, and via. The type attribute, which is optional,                                                    3 One of the most well-known examples for percent encoding is the %20 string that appears in place of  space characters in poorly designed URIs.  4 If percent encoding is essential and cannot be eliminated, letters should be uppercase characters A–F.   329    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   must have a MIME media type as its value. The hreflang attribute is also optional. When provided, it  must have an RFC 3066 language tag. The optional title attribute is language-sensitive. Character  entities used in the title are considered characters instead of markup. A hint on the advisory length of the  linked content can be provided by the optional length attribute in octets. Listing 8-42 shows a typical  link element.   Listing 8-42. A link Element in Atom       The logo Element  An image that visually identifies your Atom news feed can be provided by the logo element  Listing 8- 43 . Its content is an IRI reference  RFC 3987 . The aspect ratio of the logo image should be 2:1   horizontal to vertical .   Listing 8-43. A Logo Image of an Atom Feed    http:  example.com images  icon.gif    The published Element  The time when the first version of a news entry has been written can be specified by a date construct of  the published element  Listing 8-44 .   Listing 8-44. A published Element    2011-09-18T16:35:24Z    Such timestamps might coincide with the content of the updated element in the entry.   The rights Element  Custom copyright information can be written as a text construct and added to your Atom news feed  using the rights element  Listing 8-45 .   Listing 8-45. Copyright Information in Atom    Copyright   2012 John Smith. All rights reserved.    The source Element  If an entry is derived from an external Atom news feed, the metadata of the original entry can optionally  be used as the subelements of the source element. The elements author, contributor, rights, and  category should be preserved in all cases.   330    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   The subtitle Element  Atom feeds can be described by a string provided as the content of a subtitle element, which provides a  longer description than the title element  Listing 8-46 .   Listing 8-46. The Description of an Atom News Feed    Steven Johnson News       The news feed of poet Steven Johnson. New booklets, press releases, readings, and more.      The summary Element  A short description can be added to each Atom entry with the summary element  Listing 8-47 .   Listing 8-47. A Summary of an Atom Entry    The latest book of S. Johnson, “My Darling”, has been released.    RSS or Atom?  Both RSS and Atom are widely supported in all major consumer feed readers. RSS seems to be more  popular than Atom, though. From the standards points of view, however, the RSS 2.0 specification is  copyrighted by Harvard University and is considered finalized. Significant changes cannot be expected,  although the specification has been released under the Creative Commons license. In contrast, Atom 1.0  is a more feature-rich syndication format by default and can be extended.   The Internet media type application rss+xml is unregistered while application atom+xml is   registered by IANA.   In contrast to RSS 2.0, which supports the RSS document format only, the Atom Entry documents of  the Atom news feeds can apply any network protocol. As a result, the aggregation and extraction of Atom  news feeds have more possibilities.    Although the namespace of RSS 2.0 is not an XML namespace, it can optionally contain elements   from external XML namespaces  as discussed earlier . The namespace of Atom 1.0 is an XML namespace  itself and might also have elements and attributes from other XML namespaces. The implementation of  these external elements and attributes is clearly defined by specification guidelines. It can be concluded  that Atom is more extensible than RSS.   RSS does not support relative URIs, while Atom reuses the xml:base attribute, which allows relative   references.   There is no schema defined in RSS 2.0. Atom 1.0 applies the RelaxNG schema, which is the non-  normative ISO-standard ISO IEC 19757-2:2008 [25]. It can be used to validate the data provided in the  Atom news feed. Optionally, further schemas can be generated from RelaxNG.   Practically, both formats are supported by most news feed readers. Correctly written RSS and Atom   files are well-formed XML files that can be processed in many ways and can be extended using the  namespace mechanism. Users usually do not notice the difference between the two formats when using  a feed reader application.    331    CHAPTER 8  WEB SYNDICATION   Summary  This chapter took you through the RSS and Atom new feed formats with all the background information  and practices required to not only create standard-compliant feed channels but also maintain them  manually without interrupting the XML serialization format, the RSS or Atom format requirements, or  the highest level of interoperability.   In the next chapter, you will learn how to secure the layout of your web sites, use advanced   typography features on the Web, and optimize image files to maximize user experience. You will also  learn standard-compliant, cross-browser video and multimedia embedding techniques.   References   Ellerman C  1997  Channel Definition Format  CDF .

If the design of a web site catches the eye, it is more likely that  visitors will become customers or clients. Web typography has recently started to attract attention,  especially though proper whitespace handling and the introduction of web fonts. Images that are  fundamental parts of web sites should be optimized for web publishing in order to achieve a reasonable  quality to file size ratio and minimize download time. Since high-speed Internet connections have  become widespread, the need for sharing multimedia content has increased enormously. Until the new  elements introduced in HTML5, general objects have been used to embed audio and video content.  Although design and multimedia are extremely popular, the basic usability principle should always be  kept in mind: functionality over design.   In this chapter, you will learn how to create multiple-column layouts and fixed menus without the   now-obsolete approaches, such as the ones that applied tables and frames. This chapter also describes a  CSS property, called z-index, that provides full control over the appearance of layers above each other.   Until recently, most web sites used one or more fonts from a small list, resulting in a kind of   monotony. There have been many methods for using a greater variety of fonts over the years, but not  one was very satisfactory or dependable. You can now improve the appearance of text by declaring that  font files be used for rendering textual content, which makes it possible to display web pages with  carefully selected fonts in superior quality. However, web sites can contain not only text. You will learn  how to optimize images for web publishing and embed multimedia files such as Flash content, audio,  and video.   Layout  The layout of web content determines the overall appearance and has a large impact on functionality,  usability, accessibility, and design. Web layout should be reliable and browser- and resolution- independent.   Positioning and Floating  Some web page components are placed on the page in relation to a corner of the browser window, such  as the top-left corner  the 0, 0 position , while the position of others depends on the position of their  parent elements  containers . There are various options including relative, absolute, and fixed  positioning. Beyond the appropriate positioning, you must be careful to provide browser- and  resolution-independent solutions.   On your web site, perhaps certain components should “float” on the web page, and the content   should appear next to, rather than above or below, the main text. Typical examples are images, which  frequently apply the float property to wrap text around images.   335    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Absolute and Fixed Positions  Depending on the design and site structure, some page components  logo, menu, header, footer, and so  on  are intended to be fixed and should not move when the page is being scrolled.   The CSS rule position: fixed; is very similar to position: absolute;, but the first one prevents   element scrolling when the user scrolls the page while the second does not. The position: fixed; rule is  not supported by Internet Explorer 6 or earlier, which has been a major layout problem in web site  development for years. Instead of reverting it to position: absolute; to provide a similar effect,  position: fixed; has been considered as position: static;, which results in no positioning at all.  Consequently, a layer at the bottom of a web page with position: fixed;, which is intended to be a  footer that remains intact when the user scrolls the page, appears on the page according to the DOM  structure in older browsers, resulting in an unaesthetic or even unusable appearance. The problem does  not exist from IE7 and onward or in other browsers.   Tableless Web Layout  Until recently, a significant number of web sites applied presentational markup rather than semantic  code.  X HTML tables have been used for arranging web site elements and ensuring pixel-by-pixel  layout. This easy and quick “development” was also encouraged by WYSIWYG development tools.  However, it has many drawbacks. Web sites whose layout relies on tables waste bandwidth and take  longer to download and render. The document structure is illogical, making semantic data harder or  impossible to retrieve. These web sites are not accessible and are difficult to maintain.   Tableless web layout eliminates the use of tables for page layout and web page element positioning  [1]. This does not mean that tables are not allowed on web pages, but tables should be used exclusively  for tabular data.   The positioning and layout of web page components can be fully controlled by layers that are   represented as div elements in the markup.   The following sections describe two very common types of layout. Naturally, developers can create   other layouts, too, but the point is that arbitrary layouts can be described by div elements.    Multiple-Column Layouts  A typical web page arrangement is the multiple-column layout with floating divisions [2]. Multiple- column sites usually have a header at the top of each page. The menu is often provided on the left  or  right . Additionally, a footer is a frequently used component on the bottom of each page. The usual  number of columns is one, two, or three. Figure 9-1 shows a typical three-column layout.    336    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Figure 9-1. A three-column layout    You can see the main menu on the top of the page. Underneath the main menu there is the main   content. On the left there are submenus, while on the right there are additional functions, such as a  search box and blog entries.   Centralized-Column Layouts  Another typical arrangement applies a centralized column with a width of approximately 700–900  pixels—ideally not wider than 800 pixels to guarantee that the main content remains visible on small  resolutions back to 800×600  SVGA .1 Such sites usually have the header and the main menu on the top.                                                    1 The next standard resolution, 1024×768  XGA , is larger than many screen resolutions of modern mobile  devices with Internet browsing features such as netbooks or small laptops with wide-screen display. Since the  typical resolution is constantly growing, the latest models might support 1024×600  WSVGA , or higher,      337    Optionally, there might be a secondary or submenu on the left  or right  within the main column. If  required, there could be a footer at the bottom.   There are various possibilities to horizontally center page content. A frequently used method   applies the attribute value auto to the left and right margins of the container  Figure 9-2 . This technique  was introduced in the errata of the CSS2 specification [3]. Listing 9-1 shows an example.   Listing 9-1. Centralizing with Autowidth Margins   CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   content {    width: 720px;    margin: 0px auto;  }      Figure 9-2. Centralizing with autowidth margins      This method works on all browsers that support CSS2.  Another method for centralizing the content, introduced by Simon Coggins, is to use offsets and   negative margins. After declaring the width of the container element  similar to the previous method , its  left edge is horizontally centered within the page by the combination of absolute positioning and a 50  percent left offset. Since the content begins on the second half of the page, the left margin of the layer  should be set to the opposite of half the width of the layer. For example, if the width of the layer to be  centralized is 780px, the left margin should be set to -390px  Figure 9-3 .                                                                                                                                                   resolution, which has adequate width for XGA optimization. The resolution of smartphone screens is smaller,  and web sites can be optimized for them with alternate style sheets, as discussed earlier in Chapter 5.   338    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Figure 9-3. Centralizing with negative margins   The corresponding CSS ruleset can be written as shown in Listing 9-2.      339    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Listing 9-2. Centralizing with Negative Margins   main {    position:absolute;    width: 780px;    left: 50%;    margin-left: -390px;  }   Text Around Objects  In many cases, web page text should “wrap around” an object or image. You can achieve this effect by  using the float property; in other words, the image  or its container  should float  Listing 9-3 .   Listing 9-3. Styles for Containers of Floating Images   onleft {    float: left;  }    onright {    float: right;  }   Figure 9-4 shows an image without styling and two floating images that use the previous rules.   Without floating, the text does not wrap around the image: only the first line of the text appears next to  the image  top photo . The second image applies the first rule of Listing 9-3 and is rendered on the left,  surrounded by text on the right. The third image uses the second rule of Listing 9-3 and thus appears on  the right, while the text surrounds the image on the left.   340    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Figure 9-4. Floating images   Since the text would be rendered right next to the floating images, you should declare margins to get   the final result shown in Listing 9-3. If you intend to display all images of a page on the right side, you  can specify the float:right; rule on images without identifiers or classes as img { float:right; }.   If you want to ensure that the next paragraph is displayed below a floating image, you can use the   clear property to stop the float on the left  clear: right; , on the right  clear: left; , or on both sides  of the image  clear:both; .   Layers Above Each Other  Web site components can also be considered in a virtual space where the component order can be set by  a CSS property that represents depth  the third dimension . This property is called z-index. It is  frequently used for setting layer order. The larger the value, the higher the elements in the stack order.  The element with the largest z-index appears above all other elements of the page. This property works  on positioned elements only  elements that have a position rule . For example, the rulesets in Listings   9-4 and 9-5 put the layer with the logo above the main content.      341    Listing 9-4. The Lower Layer  Compared to Listing 9-5    Listing 9-5. The Upper Layer  Compared to Listing 9-4    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   main {    position:absolute;    width: 780px;    left: 50%;    margin-left: -390px;    z-index: 1;  }   logo {    position: absolute;    width: 146px;    height: 120px;    margin-top: 20px;    margin-left: 20px;    z-index: 2;  }    Caution  Flash content requires an additional parameter that allows the developer to override the default setting  that renders Flash content in front of other elements  see the section “Embedding Flash in XHTML” .    Typography  Text has always been a fundamental web component. The first web documents contained mainly  if not  exclusively  text with black fonts over a white background. In the next few years, the Web gradually  transformed to a full multimedia platform. At the same time, more sophisticated whitespace handling  and character encoding have appeared.   In contrast to books and other printed media where proper type arrangements and type design have   always been ensured by typography, until recently the Web lacked these features.   After the introduction of TFT monitors and the ClearType fonts designed for them, characters have   become really clear on the screen. With the increasing popularity of web fonts, an endless variety of  fonts appeared on the Web.   You must be careful to provide not only eye-catching fonts and type but also legible text. The   technique required to achieve that aim is known as web typography, which should also guarantee the  proper appearance of characters and whitespace.   Misused Characters  According to the World Wide Web Consortium, you should be careful to apply the proper punctuation  marks on the Web instead of their misused equivalents  Table 9-1  [4]. Which punctuation marks are  typographically correct depends on the natural language of the web page. For example, in British  English, single quotes are often preferred to double quotes, and commas generally park outside rather   342    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   than inside the closing mark. In other languages, the quotation marks might be inverted. Similar  differences exist in the use of en and em dashes.   Table 9-1. Frequently Applied Punctuation Marks and Their Misused Equivalents   Character   Name   Entity Entities   Misused Equivalent s    “   ”   ’   –   —   …   Opening quote   Closing quote   Apostrophe   &8220;   &8221;   &8217;   En dash  ranges    &8211; or &ndash;   Em dash  change of  thought    Horizontal ellipsis  an  omission or a pause    &8212; or &mdash;   - or --   &8230; or &hellip;   ...   "   "   '   -     The opening and closing quotation marks appear identical in certain typefaces, known as the   straight, vertical, or typewriter quotation marks, which should not be used in the text flow. On the other  hand, these characters are used in the markup as the delimiters of attribute values.    Tip  Many text editors do not support typographic  curly  quotation marks and insert their misused equivalents.  One of the options for getting the proper quotation marks is to insert them in a word processor  usually by pressing  Shift+2  and then copy the characters to the source code through the clipboard.   Even if the proper quotation marks are used in the markup, browsers might render them   incorrectly. Although it is a straightforward idea to apply the q tag for short quotations,2 browsers render  it differently. Firefox 3.6.6 renders both the opening and the closing quotes correctly. However, IE8  incorrectly applies the character „ for opening the quote  the closing is correct . In Safari 5 and Opera  10.6, the misused equivalent " is used for rendering. However, rendering quotes also depends on the  language being used and relies on proper language settings in the markup.   Web Fonts  Originally, the Web was developed as a text-based medium. Initially, the selection of fonts available to  web designers was limited to the intersection of fonts natively installed on all major platforms. In 1998,                                                    2 If the quotation spans multiple lines, the blockquote tag should be used instead.   343    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   the CSS2 specification introduced a font matching and downloading mechanism  which has been  dropped in CSS 2.1 . In CSS3, external fonts can be applied, along with the declaration of multiple   similar  fonts as a fallback option if the specific fonts cannot be downloaded or are not installed on the  user’s computer. The technique has both legal and technical issues, however.   Fonts are generally copyrighted; thus, their font files cannot be stored and used on web sites. Even   the ones that are advertised as free fonts cannot be used for web sites in many cases [5]. Since a standard  font pack has been released under the “Core fonts for the Web” program by Microsoft, the fonts Arial,  Georgia, and Verdana  among others  have become de facto fonts on the Web.    Caution  The character repertoire of typefaces varies greatly. While the English alphabet and the common  punctuation marks are supported by most font files, the list of supported characters should be a major concern for  sites written in a natural language other than English. Multilingual sites should not apply font files that do not  support the full range of required characters, which makes it possible to apply the same fonts for the different  language versions. One of the options to avoid nonsupported characters is to apply Unicode fonts. However, not all  fonts presented on font collection sites as “Unicode fonts” support a really wide range of Unicode characters. In  fact, the ones that do are typically 20MB to 25MB in size  compared to the typical font file size of 50KB to 300KB ,  which is inadequate for web publishing: the fonts won’t appear while the font files are being downloaded, and this  would take much more time than downloading the entire page with all of its components, including images.    From the technical point of view, the browser support for font embedding and downloading varies   from browser to browser. However, the differences are decreasing because of standardization and the  growing popularity of implementations. Embedded OpenType  EOT  font embedding is supported by  Internet Explorer from version 4. Other browsers have introduced font linking for TrueType  TT  and  OpenType  OT  fonts  Firefox 3.5+, Opera 10+, Safari 3.1+, Google Chrome 4.0+ . Internet Explorer 9+  also supports TT OT fonts but only those that have embedded permissions set to installable. TT has  been extended to support additional metadata and gzip compression, known as the Web Open Font  Format  WOFF . WOFF is a cross-browser, web-only format being standardized by the W3C [6] and  supported by Internet Explorer 9+, Mozilla Firefox 3.6+, and Google Chrome 5+.    Note  The semistructural details appearing on the ends of certain strokes of letters and symbols are known as  serifs in typography. The typefaces that use serifs, such as Times New Roman, Cambria, Garamond, and Georgia,  are known as serif typefaces. The typefaces that do not have these small projecting features are the sans-serif  typefaces,3 for example, Verdana, Tahoma, and Helvetica. Declaring one of the generic font families  serif, sans- serif, cursive, fantasy, monospace  is an excellent fallback mechanism [7].                                                     3 The word sans means “without” in French.   344    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Two different fonts  or the same font in two different formats4  can be declared with a fallback   mechanism, as shown in Listing 9-6, and can be applied as demonstrated in Listing 9-7.   Listing 9-6. Using Fonts Stored in Different Formats   @font-face {    font-family: "Csuff";    src: url "http:  example.com fonts csuff.ttf" ;    src: url "http:  example.com fonts csuff.eot" ;  }   Listing 9-7. Applying Web Fonts with a Fallback Mechanism   p {    font-family: "Csuff", "Helvetica", sans-serif;  }   Note that a widely available font is also provided, along with the font family declaration that always   works, in case neither of the external fonts can be used.    Tip  Serif fonts are easy to read5 and adequate for long text blocks published on web pages in medium or large  font size, as well as for printer style sheets. Sans-serif typefaces are more suitable for short texts in small font  size, such as copyright information in the page footer, which is often written in Verdana or a similar font.  Monospace fonts like Courier and DejaVu Sans Mono are ideal for preformatted text, computer codes, and  typewriter effects. Cursive fonts, such as Comic Sans MS and Brush Script, are used for cursive handwriting such  as signatures. Fantasy fonts are best used for headings and artistic texts  for example, Impact and Copperplate .   The normal, bold, and italic versions, as well as the bold and italic fonts, of a typeface are generally   stored in separate files. Consequently, multiple declarations are needed to download and apply the  appropriate font styles of the selected typeface  Listing 9-8 . Without that, the content of headings and  strong elements will be rendered using normal fonts rather than bold ones, em elements will be  displayed with normal rather than italic fonts, and so on.   Listing 9-8. Multiple Declarations for the Same Typeface   @font-face {    font-family: Calluna;    src: url 'fonts Calluna-Regular.otf' ;  }                                                      4 Although there are tools for converting fonts from one format to another, it is legally prohibited in  many cases.  5 This is the reason for their widespread application in books, newspapers, and magazines.   345    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   @font-face {    font-family: Callunab;    src: url 'fonts Calluna-Bold.otf' ;  }    @font-face {    font-family: Callunai;    src: url 'fonts Calluna-It.otf' ;  }    body {    font-family: "Calluna", "Helvetica", serif;  }    h1, h2, h3, strong {    font-family: "Callunab";  }    em {    font-family: "Callunai";  }   There are also some alternatives for web fonts. A technique called image replacement, which is   considered legal by many, is applied by some web designers to use rendered images of fonts. However,  image replacement prevents text selection, has searchability and accessibility issues, and increases  bandwidth use.   Another approach applies the Flash-based solution Scalable Inman Flash Replacement  sIFR . It is   similar to image replacement, but the text is selectable and rendered as a vector graphic. A big  disadvantage is that this method relies on a Flash plug-in on the client side.   The text can also be replaced by SVG or VML6  for Internet Explorer up to version 8  with JavaScript.  In SVG 1.1, fonts can be created within the SVG document. SVG fonts can improve the semantics of   graphics that represent texts, such as logos. SVG fonts are partly supported by Safari 3+ and Opera 8+.   Similar to  X HTML documents, CSS can also be applied in SVG documents. Consequently, the   @font-face rule can be used for SVG texts too [8]. Listing 9-9 shows an example.   Listing 9-9. An Example for Using the @fontface CSS Rule in SVG       <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD SVG 1.1  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org Graphics SVG 1.1 DTD svg11.dtd">                       <![CDATA[          @font-face {            font-family: Calluna;            src: url 'fonts Calluna-Regular.otf' ;                                                    6 SVG was not supported by earlier versions of Internet Explorer, which supported the Vector Markup  Language  VML  instead, which is now obsoleted.   346    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE           }           ]]>                <text x="20"  y="40" style="font-family: Calluna, serif; font-size: 1.2em; stroke: 0f0;     fill: 0f0;">SVG text with Web Fonts       Embedding External Content  The majority of web sites contain not only formatted texts but also graphics and multimedia content,  audio and video clips, and Flash animations. In contrast to formatted text content described by markup  languages in text files, this type of content is retrieved from binary files. Although its optimal format and  features are not standardized for web publishing, its optimization has a huge impact on overall  appearance, look and feel, file size, and download time.   Raster Graphics  Bitmap graphics  also known as raster images , which are stored in a mapped array of bits and represent  a grid of pixels, are common web site components. On the Web, bitmap file formats are used mainly for  storing photographs and other images that are not line art. There are several image file features to be  optimized for web publishing, such as pixel density, color depth, and resolution. You should choose the  file format according to the content and the desired quality.   The Golden Rule of image processing and retouching for the Web is that whatever will be modified,  the original master file should not be overwritten  even if it has a large file size . For example, a title in a  compound image created on multiple layers in Photoshop cannot be modified later if you don’t preserve  the .psd file. Similarly, a heavily retouched or compressed photograph cannot be restored to its original  state  which might be useful in many cases  if you haven’t saved the original file.    Note  The following sections describe the major features and possibilities; however, a detailed description of  image processing is beyond the scope of this book.   Pixel Density  Not just text content but also graphics can and should be optimized for web publishing. The measure of  spatial dot density is dots per inch  dpi , which means the number of individual dots represented in a  line within the span of 1 inch  2.54 cm . Although dot density correlates with image resolution, it is  related indirectly. Instead of the dots that are used for printing, however, computer screens apply pixels  to build up images. Their density can be expressed in pixels per inch  ppi . Although confusing, pixel  densities standardized for computer screens are often expressed incorrectly in dpi rather than ppi  72,  96, and 120 dpi . The lowest value, 72 ppi, derives from typography where 1 point  pt  is defined to be  1 72 inch  ≈ 0.0139 inch or 352.8 µm . An image displayed on a 72 ppi screen has the same physical  dimensions as the printed version in 72 dpi; in other words, 1 pt on paper is equal to 1 px on the screen.  However, this is just a theoretical approach; it is not accurate and has lost its significance. Since the pixel  density affects not only the quality of image rendering but also text readability, higher values provide   347    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   better user experience. Modern operating systems and computer screens usually support 96–120 ppi.  The pixel density of a screen can be calculated by the ratio of the diagonal resolution in pixels  using the  Pythagorean theorem  and the diagonal size in inches:      PPI  =  d p d  i  =  2 w h p  +  2 p d  i       where    pd   is diagonal resolution in pixels,  pw  is width resolution in pixels,  ph   is height resolution in pixels, and  id   is diagonal size in inches.    For example, a 10.1-inch netbook with a WSVGA  1024x600  screen provides 117.51 ppi, a 20-inch  monitor with a WSXGA+  1680x1050  screen provides 99.06 ppi, and a 23-inch HD  1920x1080  monitor  provides 95.78 ppi.   Smartphones are very competitive from this aspect. The 4.3-inch HTC Evo 4G has a WVGA  800x480    screen that corresponds to a pixel density of 216 ppi. In 2010, the Apple iPhone 4 featured the largest  resolution screen, called the Retina display  960x640 , which gives an incredibly high 326 ppi7 for the 3.5- inch screen. As of 2011, high-end smartphones introduced the HD display with a resolution of 1280x720  on a typical screen size of 4.3”, making pixel density even higher.   Although the optimal pixel density for web publishing is not standardized, it should be taken into   account that computer screens and settings generally support 120 ppi as a maximum and apply an  average of 96 ppi. Larger pixel densities needlessly increase the file size.   Resolution  On the screen, resolution determines image size, not quality in general  printing is the opposite . As a  general rule, the smallest image size that provides the desired details should be applied. The usual 8–10  MP photos taken by modern digital cameras should be resized to a smaller resolution for web publishing  in most cases. It should be kept in mind that huge-resolution photographs are large in size  a few  megabytes depending on compression ratio and file format  and thus take too long to download.  Moreover, they have too much detail that might cause legal issues considering faces, number plates, and  so on, in the background. The high-resolution depiction of a human face can be used for fraudulent  purposes because it can be easily retouched and printed  especially in passport size .   Providing width and height attributes on img elements for faster rendering of web page images is   highly recommended. However, these attributes should not be used for resizing photos. Online galleries  and albums should apply small thumbnails linking to the original or full-size version of images.                                                     7 At a distance of 12 inches from one’s eye, this is the maximum amount of detail the human retina can  process  hence the name .   348    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Aliasing  Resizing digital images can result in distortions and quality loss. A high-resolution image represented at  a lower resolution, for example, might cause distortion artifacts called aliasing. Anti-aliasing allows the  edges of objects to be rendered smoothly. On the Web, anti-aliasing is often applied for fonts and curved  web graphics such as rounded corners.   Anti-aliasing requires additional colors with gradually decreasing intensity that merge with the   background  Figure 9-5 .   Figure 9-5. Aliased vs. anti-aliased fonts and circles. The original images are shown above, the  magnification below. Note the pixelated edges on the left images.      Using anti-aliased fonts on the Web has pros and cons. The most important advantages are   smoother fonts, many of which are easier to read because of reduced blurring, the similarity with printed  types  depending on the font being used , and in many cases the more aesthetic appearance. However,  small fonts become too fuzzy to read, and sharp edges are not always precise.     Caution  The readability of different web fonts is very different, and even the same typeface might look  gorgeous in medium size but becomes unreadable when used with a small font size. There is often a transition  between the two states: some parts of the font curves disappear, while others remain visible. Moreover, the  rendering of the same web fonts is different in various browsers.     Color Depth  The number of bits required for representing the color of a single pixel in a bitmap image or video frame  buffer typically varies from 1 to 232 and is known as color depth. Consequently, the higher the color  depth, the larger the file size, which is an important factor in image optimization.   Monochrome  binary  images such as line art with black lines should be stored with 1 bit color   depth, in other words, two possible values for each pixel.   Black-and-white photographs, which are composed exclusively of 256 shades of gray, should be   represented as 8-bit grayscale images  28 = 256 .   24-bit color depth  true color  applies red, green, and blue colors with various intensity values   different   between 0 and 255 per channel  RGB color model  to reproduce  colors with additive color mixing. Since the human eye cannot distinguish any two adjacent intensity  values of these channels, this color depth is adequate for storing photographs.   16,777,216  ⋅ 8 8 2 2 2  24 2  =  =  ⋅  8  349    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Photorealistic images with partially transparent parts can be represented in 32 bits with an   additional channel called the alpha channel8  that is, RGBA color space .   The color depth of logos, pictograms, and icons varies, depending on the complexity and image   content.   Compression  To reduce file size, digital bitmap images are usually compressed. Compressed images are popular not  only for storage but also for web publishing because of the smaller bandwidth requirement.   Image compression can be lossy or lossless. In the case of lossy compressions, part of the original   information is lost and cannot be restored, which might affect image quality. Lossless compression  algorithms allow the reconstruction of the original data from the compressed data, which is a nice  feature but not always needed. The resulting files of lossy compression algorithms are generally smaller  in size than the ones using lossless compression; however, their quality might be lower if the  compression ratio is too high. As you will see, JPEG is the most popular lossy image format, and PNG is  the most popular lossless image format on the Web.   Image-processing software tools usually provide the option to adjust the degree of compression,   making it possible to select a trade-off between storage size and image quality. For example, Adobe  Photoshop has a scale for a JPEG compression ratio with values 0–12. The supported quality ranges are  Low  0–4 , Medium  5–7 , High  8–9 , and Maximum  10–12 . The settings are available after determining the  name and destination of the file in the File   Save As… dialog window  Figure 9-6 .                                                     8 There are also other approaches to provide transparency, but for partially transparent photographs, it is  the common solution.   350    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Figure 9-6. Excellent quality with small file size   JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with hardly perceptible loss in image quality.      Interlacing  Certain bitmap formats such as GIF and PNG have the option to provide a degraded copy of an image  before it is fully downloaded. The method is known as interlacing. Advanced image-processing software  applications support interlacing and offer the choice to save such files either as interlaced or as  noninterlaced. A similar effect can be achieved in photographs by applying a frequency decomposition  hierarchy in progressive JPEG files. In the era of slow, dial-up connections, interlacing was a useful  feature but lost most of its significance after the widespread application of high-speed Internet  connections.   Transparency  The popularity of partially transparent images is increasing. They can be used not only for design effects  but also to provide images that can be used on different background colors or textures  Figure 9-7 .   351    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Figure 9-7. An image on three different backgrounds  first row . The second row is magnified to 600  percent. The transparent shadow perfectly fits to all backgrounds   Not all raster image formats support transparency, though. GIF is generally a good  sometimes the  best  option for partially transparent geometric shapes and cartoon-style images, while PNG is ideal for  more complex partially transparent images. With the exception of really simple shapes with relatively  large areas of the same color, PNG is the better option.      Raster File Formats  The most common raster image file formats on the Web are JPEG, GIF, and PNG.   Joint Photographic Experts Group  JPEG  is a common lossy compression format for digital   photographs. Part 1 has been standardized in ISO IEC 10918-1:1994 [9] and ITU-T T.81  09 92  [10], Part  2 in ISO IEC 10918-2:1995 [11] and ITU-T T.83  11 94  [12], Part 3 in ISO IEC 10918-3:1997 [13] and ITU- T T.84  07 96  [14], Part 4 in ISO IEC 10918-4:1999 [15] and ITU-T T.86  06 98  [16], and Part 5 in  ISO IEC FCD 10918-5 [17].   The original version of the Graphics Interchange Format, GIF87a, was introduced in 1987 [18], and  the enhanced version with transparency and interlacing support, GIF89a, was introduced in 1989 [19].  The Portable Network Graphics  PNG  format was standardized by IETF RFC 2083 in 1997 [20] and   ISO IEC 15948 in 2004 [21]. However, the PNG format has not gained full support until recently.  Although Internet Explorer supports PNG images from version 4.01b, the implementation was neither  complete nor correct until IE9  for example, IE6 had a buggy support for alpha-channel transparency .  There were color inconsistencies between various browsers, partly because of the different handling of  gamma correction  for example, colors of PNG images were displayed incorrectly on Safari running  under Windows . Fortunately, modern browsers overcame these issues.   To choose the right file format for a given image, the main features of file types and compression   algorithms should be considered  Table 9-2 .   352    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Table 9-2. Quick Comparison of JPEG, GIF, and PNG      JPEG   Maximum color depth   24-bit   Palette   Full   Compression   Transparency   Animation   Lossy    in most cases    –   –   Interlaced mode   +  progressive JPEG    Optimal usage   Photographs   GIF   8-bit   Restricted   Lossless   +   +   +   PNG   48-bit   Optional   Lossless   +   +    –9   Icons, logos, diagrams   geometric shapes ,  clipart, cartoon-style  images, and small  animations   Photographs, partially  transparent  photographs, icons,  and logos     For example, a simple image such as a solid circle can be stored with two colors in GIF with a very  small file size compared to other formats such as JPEG. For images that have no complex content, the  color depth can be reduced with color palettes  selected indexed colors  in file formats such as GIF, TIF,  and PNG. Certainly, an anti-aliased version needs a larger color depth resulting in a larger file size.  Although GIF and PNG formats are usually better than JPEG for storing icons and logos, the SVG vector  format should be preferred for such content  see the section “Vector Graphics” .   Although it is very efficient on photographs, the JPEG compression algorithm adds additional pixels   to the whole image, including solid areas. As a result, simple images become more complex than they  were originally. This is the main reason why a solid circle stored in JPEG has several times larger file size  than a GIF file with the same content even if the compression is high. Moreover, if the compression ratio  is high, JPEG artifacts become noticeable, resulting in lower image quality. On the other hand, JPEG  works perfectly on complex images. If the compression is set properly, the image quality to file size ratio  is excellent.   File Size Optimization  Pixel density, resolution, dimensions, color depth, compression ratio, image complexity, and file format  all have a large impact on file size.                                                     9 There is an extension called Animated Portable Network Graphics  APNG  that supports animation.  APNG is natively supported by Firefox 3+, by Opera 9.5+, and with an add-on by Google Chrome.   353    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   The width and height should be optimized by cropping useless or unnecessary parts of the image. It   is a typical task for scanned and high-resolution images where image parts can often be removed  without losing information.   The required color depth must be used; 24-bit color depth is the default setting in many software   tools, which can be reduced in many cases without affecting image quality. For example, black-and- white drawings should not be stored with 16 million colors.   The proper compression ratio must be used for all images.  The size-quality ratio can be effectively optimized with the File   Save For Web & Devices… function   of Photoshop  Figure 9-8 .   Figure 9-8. Comparison of file formats and settings for web publishing in Photoshop   Photoshop also offers optimization to a desired file size, but it should be kept in mind that image   content and complexity determine the reasonable level of compression.   Beyond the compression settings of JPEG files available in Photoshop or GIMP, some software tools   such as JPEG Optimizer [22]  are capable of optimizing the file size to quality ratio by applying different  compression ratios to various image areas.   The major aim of file size optimization is to achieve the perfect balance between file size and picture   quality. A fast web page with low-quality images is pointless.      354    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Small, highly compressed versions  thumbnails  should be provided with links to a larger, high-  quality version in online photo galleries and albums. This approach allows users to determine whether  the image is relevant for them and, thus, reasonable to download the larger version, which will naturally  take more time.   Vector Graphics  Vector and bitmap images have different application areas. Bitmaps are best suitable for photographs  and photorealistic images, while vector images can be applied for artwork and illustrations that consist  of lines and curves. Nonetheless, bitmaps are still used widely on the Web for all kinds of images,  including the ones that should be provided in a vector format instead, partly because of the lack of  native support for a single standard vector format across all major browsers. The situation has started to  change with the widespread support of SVG.   Scalable Vector Graphics should be preferred for all images that require basic shapes such as circles  and polygons, Bézier paths and curves, text, opacity, transformations  rotation, skew, scale, and so on ,10  gradients, and animations. SVG content can also be combined with bitmap graphics such as with a PNG  file.   Similar to PNG, the browser support of SVG should be considered for the sake of backward   compatibility. It should be kept in mind that the browser support of SVG is different for inline SVG, and  the SVG should be embedded via the img or the object element. Additionally, SVG has several versions,  and the support of the different versions varies. The Gecko layout engine has had incomplete SVG 1.1  Full support since 2005 and WebKit since 2006. Opera supports SVG 1.1 Tiny from version 8, SVG 1.1  Basic and partially SVG 1.1 Full from version 9, and partially SVG Tiny 1.2  including compressed SVG   from version 9.5.   Flash  Flash is one of the most popular technologies for publishing active content on the Web. However, the  standard embedding code provided by Flash development tools is often not standard-compliant and has  some browser-dependent issues. Moreover, alternate content should be supported that is automatically  activated if the Flash content cannot be displayed for whatever reasons.   Embedding Flash in XHTML  The first Flash implementations applied the embed element, which was deprecated in HTML 4 and  XHTML in favor of the object element but then was added back into the HTML 5 specification  see next  section . Consequently, in XHTML documents Flash content should be provided by the object element.   To avoid browser- and vendor-specific code, various implementation methods have been   introduced, including duplication  the twice-cooked method , the nested objects method, and Flash Satay.  The latter one, Flash Satay, provides robust and standard-compliant Flash implementation by including  an additional movie parameter. W3C also suggests this method [23]. Listing 9-10 shows an example.                                                     10 Similar effects are also supported by CSS3.   355    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Listing 9-10. Embedding Flash Using Flash Satay   <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="australia.swf" width="735" height="677"    id="flash">           Note that the same Flash file is specified both as a data attribute value on the object element and as  a movie parameter value. It is also important to realize that the classid and codebase parameters used by  older methods have been eliminated. If the codebase parameter is left in the code when modifying a  traditional Flash embedding code, it prevents Firefox from rendering the Flash content, and the  optionally provided alternate content appears instead  or nothing at all .   Even this method has some known issues, however. For example, using the Flash Satay method, the   Flash movie is not streamed by some browsers such as Internet Explorer. Waiting for the whole file to  download and start to play afterward works fine for small files and fast Internet connections only.   If you develop a web page with layers above each other, it might be rather frustrating that Flash  content appears above all other web site elements by default. To provide the possibility of setting the  layer order within pages containing Flash content, an additional parameter  wmode  should be set   Listings 9-11 and 9-12 .   Listing 9-11. Setting the wmode for Nontransparent Flash Content       The parameter value opaque indicates that the content is not transparent. If it is transparent, the   attribute value should be changed to transparent  Listing 9-12 .   Listing 9-12. Setting the wmode for Transparent Flash Content       Although it seems that there is no correlation between the transparency of Flash content and the  stack position of the Flash content in the layer order, the wmode parameter should be used for setting  both. Either the opaque or the transparent attribute value is used on the wmode parameter; Flash content  can be sent behind any layers within the web page  or in any desired position in the layer order . The  only problem associated with wmode is that the Flash content becomes inaccessible to users with screen  readers and is therefore best avoided whenever possible.   Similar to  X HTML markup, Flash content should be accessible and search engine friendly. The  version of the installed Flash plug-in of the user should be detected to determine whether it is up-to- date. Outdated plug-ins might encounter functionalities that are supported in higher plug-in versions  only. This should be considered to eliminate broken and missing content.   As for the version dilemma, Adobe provides the Flash Player Detection Kit [24]; however, the codes   provided by the kit are not standard-compliant.   DOM scripting can address these issues. An open source example is the SWFObject by Geoff Stearns   et al [25]. SWFObject provides a cross-browser method to embed SWF files into web pages using a very  small JavaScript code. This JavaScript code detects Flash Player, declares alternate content, improves  search engine indexing, assists Flash Player downloading if it is not installed, includes Adobe Express  Install, and offers an API for JavaScript developers. However, version detection with JavaScript relies on  scripting, results in longer code, and overcomplicates Flash embedding. As a conclusion, there is no  better standard-compliant, cross-browser Flash embedding method than Flash Satay.   356    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Embedding Flash in  X HTML5  HTML5 has an embed element for embedded content that requires plug-ins. It supports all the standard  attributes and event attributes of HTML5. Additionally, it has the specific attributes src, type  which  specifies MIME type , height, and width. You can use it as shown in Listing 9-13.   Listing 9-13. Basic Flash Embedding in  X HTML5       discussed in Chapter 3.   The embed tag also supports the global and event attributes of HTML5, which have already been   Audio  Prior to HTML5, there has never been native markup support for playing audio on web pages. Most  audio content is played through a plug-in such as Flash. The major problem with this approach is that  not all browsers have the same plug-ins.   HTML5 specifies a standard way to include audio content by the audio element. It can be used to   play sound files as well as audio streams. Three major audio formats are supported by the audio element:  MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and WAV. However, the browser support of these formats varies  Table 9-3 . Note that  the audio element is not supported at all in IE8 and earlier.   Table 9-3. Audio Format Support for the audio Element in Different Browsers   Format   MP3  WAV  Ogg Vorbis  IE   9+   –   –   Firefox   Chrome   Opera   Safari   –   3.5+   3.5+   3.0+ – 3.0+   3.0+   3.0+   10.5+   10.5+   3.0+   3.0+     The basic use of the audio element is straightforward  Listing 9-14 .   Listing 9-14. Basic Audio Embedding in  X HTML5          Beyond the src attribute that specifies the source URL of the audio content to play, there are further   attributes for automatic playing  autoplay="autoplay" , control buttons  controls="controls" ,  repeating  loop="loop" , and loading at page load  preload="preload" . The last one is ignored if  autoplay is present.   To achieve a higher level of accessibility, alternate content should be provided  Listing 9-15 .   357    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Listing 9-15. Alternate Content for Audio          Valerie by Joy        Listing 9-16. Multiple Source Declaration for Different Formats                    Valerie by Joy        Since certain formats supported by a browser cannot be played in another, the audio element allows   multiple source declarations that link to different audio files. Listing 9-16 shows an example.   Browsers can play the first supported format from the different audio formats.   Video  For many years, publishing videos was possible through general object embedding only. Because of the  variety of video and audio codecs and the varying browser support, there is still no ultimate solution for  publishing videos on the Web.   Embedding Video in XHTML  Content from video-sharing services such as YouTube or Google Video, which serve movies through the  Flash Player,11 can be embedded using the Flash Satay method discussed earlier. Listing 9-17 shows an  example.   Listing 9-17.

IE tends to open such videos through an ActiveX control. To embed  QuickTime videos in a browser-independent way that also validates, you can use the method presented  in Listing 9-19.   Listing 9-19.

Embedding Video in  X HTML5  In contrast to the complexity of video embedding with the object element in XHTML,  X HTML5  provides the video element, which is easy to use and has full control over the video being embedded.  The video element is supported in IE9+, Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 3.0+, Opera 10.5+, and Safari 3.0+.  However, its usability depends also on the supported codecs. If you just think of DivX, Xvid, WMV,  FFmpeg, 3ivx, Sorenson, or Flash Video from the enormous variety of video file formats, the video codec  support of web browsers is undoubtedly in its infancy  Table 9-4 .                                                     12 The method was suggested by Lachlan Hunt.   359    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Table 9-4.

Consequently, the full support for a video container should include the support for all kinds of video and  audio codecs allowed in that container format. For example, if browser vendors would like to introduce support for  .flv Flash videos, it would require support for the H.264 MPEG-4 AVC, Sorenson, Screen Video, and VP6 video  codecs, as well as the AAC, ADPCM, Linear PCM, Nellymoser, MP3, and Speex audio codecs. Moreover, many  codecs have proprietary licenses or are encumbered by patents  this is the main reason why Chrome dropped the  H.264 support . Evidently, the different associations of audio and video codecs along with the licensing issues  make it rather complex to standardize video implementations on the Web. Different formats are suitable for  different purposes and application areas, and there is no ultimate choice for video publishing: it depends on the  scenario.   Listing 9-20 shows the basic code for the video element.   Listing 9-20. Basic Video Embedding in  X HTML5          Features such as height or width can be added optionally. An image representing a frame from the  video can also be defined in case the video cannot be rendered. Additionally, alternate content can also  be given between the opening and closing video tags  Listing 9-21 .   Listing 9-21. Additional Properties and Alternate Content for  X HTML5 Video Embedding         Download the  sample video   OGV, 5.34 MB        360    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Video controls can be shown or hidden in the browser by using the controls attribute on the video   element  Listing 9-22 .   Listing 9-22. Controls Set to Be Displayed for  X HTML5 Video Embedding          Since the video codec support is different in each browser, the same video can be provided in   various formats, avoiding the need to download videos that cannot be played on the system. Listing 9-23  shows an example.   Listing 9-23. The Same Video in Different Formats                   Download the  sample video   OGV        However, the MIME type cannot reflect the codecs of videos stored in container formats  for   example, H.264 in MPEG-4 .

Declaring Video Codecs in  X HTML5                   Download the  sample video        Care must be taken to apply single and double quotes alternately for the type attribute values.  The video element of  X HTML5 provides playback support detection, including the canPlayType     method on the media element or the onerror event listener. Listing 9-25 is an example of the second  method.   Listing 9-25.

Thus, there is no   ultimate cross-browser video-embedding code.   Although one of the major advantages of the video element is the avoided object element and plug- in declaration, they can still be useful in some cases. If plug-ins are preferred to simple error messages,  the object element can be embedded into the video element. Flash supports MPEG-4 H.264 AAC  playback, so an .mp4 file can usually be played by the code presented in Listing 9-26.   361    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Listing 9-26.

One of the exceptions is Firefox 3.6+, which downloads only a  fragment necessary to determine duration and render a frame from the video. This behavior can be  overridden by the preload attribute. The attribute value none forces the browser to avoid downloading.  The metadata attribute value hints that enough data should be downloaded only to show a frame and  determine duration. The value auto downloads the whole video if possible. The effect of preload="none"  can be simulated in browsers that do not support it by omitting the src attribute and source elements  that are provided only if the user clicks a button  Listing 9-27 .   Listing 9-27. Loading Video on User Click        Video not supported     <input type="button" value="Load video"    onclick="document.getElementsByTagName 'video' [0].src = 'video.mp4';"  >   Additionally, customized controls can also be added to the video embedding since the DOM API for   video in  X HTML5 supports several events that can be handled through JavaScript. Listing 9-28 shows  an example.   Listing 9-28. Customized Video Controls         var video = document.getElementsByTagName 'video' [0];            Playback can be started automatically by the autoplay attribute of the video element  Listing 9-29 .   Listing 9-29. Video Playback to Be Started Automatically        However, not all users want to download the video, and a start button is usually preferred.   Additionally, if there are multiple videos on the same page, automatic playing is out of the question,  especially if there are at least two that are not mute.   Currently, the src attribute value of the video tag should be a physical file, which makes it   impossible to embed your favorite Aston Martin video from YouTube. For example, the code in Listing   9-30 cannot be used.   362    CHAPTER 9  OPTIMIZED APPEARANCE   Listing 9-30. A YouTube Video Cannot Be Played Using the video Tag  Illegal Example          X HTML5 videos can be dynamically drawn on a canvas with JavaScript using the drawImage   method, such as in Listing 9-31.

You became familiar with many web site components that contribute to user  impression and affect web site usability and functionality. You know that it is a real challenge to ensure  proper appearance on the variety of devices, which can be achieved by creating browser- and  resolution-independent web sites with robust layout. You are well aware that many of the once popular  techniques are obsolete, and tables should be used for representing tabular data, not for layout. CSS  provides full control over the appearance of web site components, and multicolumn layouts should be  used in place of frameset documents. You also know how to optimize images for your web sites and  embed Flash and video files in a browser-independent, standard-compliant manner.   In the next chapter, you will learn accessibility techniques that maximize user access to your web  sites. By following the accessibility guidelines, you will be capable of supporting not only people with  disabilities and mobile users but also all the others, because everyone benefits from an advanced level of  web accessibility.

Since many people suffer from various temporary or permanent disabilities and deficiencies,  advanced web development practices should be applied to provide content that is accessible for all. The  importance of web accessibility is being recognized by an increasing number of web designers and  developers. W3C provides useful guidelines to ensure content accessibility. The accessibility support  implemented in modern software tools and web sites should be clearly indicated so people living with  disabilities can easily identify them. HTML5 markup also supports accessibility through advanced  structuring elements, metadata, and Accessible Rich Internet Applications  ARIAs . Web accessibility  techniques are not limited to the visually impaired or people with other disabilities. In fact, they also  ease mobile access to web content and improve overall web page quality.   In this chapter, you will learn the criteria of accessible web sites, along with the techniques to fulfill   them. You will understand the concept of web accessibility and become familiar with the most widely  adopted official guidelines. The corresponding guidelines provide access to your web sites for the  disabled and improve the user experience for people using devices with limited hardware capabilities,  such as mobile users. The content of your web sites should remain legible even if the style sheets are  turned off, can be read out loud effectively by screen readers, and rendered also in text-based browsers  such as Lynx. Moreover, the techniques that support accessibility have a nice side effect: they contribute  to web site usability; thus, you can further improve the overall quality of any web site.   Defining Web Accessibility  By default, web sites containing a variety of components, especially the ones with nontextual content  such as videos, cannot be used by all people. Even common web site components like text might be  difficult, and sometimes impossible, for some people to read. Not all users can see colors or move the  mouse. Everybody knows how frustrating a web site can be when it does not work or has functionality  that is very difficult to use for whatever reasons. Now imagine that feeling magnified by a factor of ten or  a hundred, which is what people with disabilities suffer from when using inaccessible web sites. The  degree of frustration varies from person to person, because some people live with visual impairment,  while others with mobility, dexterity, auditory, or cognitive impairment.   More and more countries have introduced legislation addressing the need for web sites to be   accessible to people with disabilities or the requirement to be nondiscriminative against people with  disabilities. Some examples are the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 in Australia [1], the Disability Act  2005 in Ireland [2], the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in the United Kingdom [3], or Section 508  Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in the United States [4].   Web accessibility covers those web site development practices that provide web content usable    “accessible”  for everybody, including people with disabilities. W3C director Tim Berners-Lee  announced the launch of the International Program Office  IPO  for the Web Accessibility Initiative   367    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY    WAI  [5] at W3C in 1997 by defining accessibility as follows: “The power of the Web is in its universality.  Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect” [6].   While the brightly contrasting colored strips on the steps of buses provide improved visibility for the   visually impaired, such strips can be useful to other people too  for example, in poor light conditions or  when someone is in a hurry . Many ramps might be useful not only for people in a wheelchair but also  for parents with children, skateboarders, in-line skaters, or people moving heavy goods. Similarly, the  improved accessibility of web content is useful not only for people with disabilities but for any user in  general. For example, web accessibility contributes to a higher level of user experience in mobile  browsing, and mobile devices are used by everybody, not only people with disabilities.   There are several software tools and hardware devices used by people with disabilities for web   browsing  and using the computer in general . Such tools and devices are referred to as assistive  technology  AT .1 This umbrella term covers screen readers, screen magnifiers, switch mechanisms,  alternative and adaptive keyboards such as large key keyboards with simplified keyboard layout and  approximately four-times bigger  and often colored  keys than the keys on standard keyboards, high- contrast keyboards, keysets  chorded keyboards , keyboards with mousepads or keyguards, trackballs,  mouthsticks, handsticks  keyboard aids, type aids , head pointers  head wands , and so on  Figure 10-1 .   Figure 10-1. Examples for assistive technology      According to the 2010 World Standards Day Message, at least 650 million people around the world   are affected by some kind of disability. Consider that as the world population ages, the need for  accessibility is constantly growing. Moreover, accessibility is not only an issue for the elderly or disabled.  Anybody at any stage in life might experience temporarily reduced accessibility [7].   In contrast to the common misbelief, web accessibility authors address much more than just visual   impairment. Many people have motor, mobility, auditory, or cognitive problems. The Web is just as, if  not more, important to people with disabilities than it is to anyone. The reason is that the Web provides  access to services and or information that cannot be obtained easily without it  for example online  ordering  [8]. However, badly designed web sites create barriers that exclude people from using the   Web [9].   The World Wide Web Consortium provides accessibility guidelines and techniques for web content    WCAG , authoring tools  ATAG  [10], and user agents  UAAG  [11]. Accessibility test results can be  expressed in a special language called Evaluation Language  EARL  [12].   The accessibility of dynamic contents and advanced user interfaces developed in a combination of  HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, and other technologies is defined by the collection of specifications released by                                                   1 Sometimes the term Adaptive Technology is also used.   368    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   the Web Accessibility Initiative  WAI  at the W3C. This collection is known as the Accessible Rich Internet  Applications Suite, which includes the following documents [13]:      WAI-ARIA technical specification: Accessibility tips for the authors and editors of  web standards, as well as developers of user agents and accessibility evaluation  tools [14]      WAI-ARIA Primer: The technical approach of WAI-ARIA with detailed descriptions   of accessibility problems that can be solved applying WAI-ARIA [15]      WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices: A practical guideline for developers about   accessible rich Internet applications developed using WAI-ARIA [16]      WAI-ARIA User Agent Implementation Guide: Accessibility requirements for user   agents [17]   Standards such as Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language  SMIL , which is an XML markup   for describing multimedia presentations [18], or the Timed Text Markup Language  TTML , which  provides text in synchrony with media such as video [19], can also be used to improve site accessibility.   WCAG 1.0  The first version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  WCAG 1.0  became a W3C  Recommendation in 1999 with the slogan “how to make web content accessible to people with  disabilities.” WCAG 1.0 consists of fourteen guidelines [20]:   1.  Equivalent alternatives must be provided for auditory and visual content.   2.   Information expressed in colors must also be available and perceivable  without colors.    3.  Markup and style sheets must be applied properly.   4.  The natural language s  of web documents must be declared.   5.  Tables must be created in a way that they transform gracefully.   6.  Pages that apply new technologies must transform gracefully.  7.  User control must be provided for time-sensitive content changes.  8.  Direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces must be ensured.  9.  Web site design must be device-independent.  10.  Interim solutions must be used.  11.  W3C technologies and guidelines must be applied.  12.  Information must be provided on context and orientation.  13.  Navigation must be easy-to-understand.  14.  Documents must be clear and simple.   Each guideline is subdivided into checkpoints that serve as the basis for checking WCAG   conformance. There are 65 of them. Each of these checkpoints has a priority, from 1 to 3. As you will see   369    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   in the next section, they are very similar to the conformance levels introduced in WCAG 2.0. The three  priority levels are the following:               Priority 1  cf. Level A conformance : Developers must satisfy these requirements, or  else one or more groups cannot access the content.   Priority 2  cf. Level AA  Double-A  conformance : Developers should satisfy these  requirements; otherwise, the content will be difficult to access for some groups.  This level removes significant barriers.   Priority 3  cf. Level AAA  Triple-A  conformance : Developers may address these  checkpoints in order to maximize accessibility.   WCAG 2.0  The second version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  WCAG 2.0  became a W3C  Recommendation in 2008 [21]. WCAG 2.0 can be summarized with twelve guidelines following four  principles [22]:   Principle 1: User interface components and published information perceivable to anyone.   1.  Alternate text must be provided for nontext contents, making it possible to   change it into other forms.   2.  Time-based media must have alternatives.  3.  Web content must be available through different presentations without losing   information or structure.   4.  Both visual and aural contents must be easy to distinguish.   Principle 2: Operable user interface and usable navigation.   5.  All functionality must be available from the keyboard.  6.  Users cannot be forced to perform actions within time limits.  7.  Designs that might cause seizures must be avoided.  8.  Guidance and help must be provided for users to navigate through the site.   Principle 3: Understandable content and operation of the user interface.  9.  Text content must be convenient to read and easy to understand.  10.  Content appearance and operation must be predictable.  11.  Assistance must be provided for users to avoid, find, and correct mistakes.   Principle 4: Robust content with high interoperability that can be used reliably on any kind of user   agent, including assistive technology.   12.  Compatibility must be maximized with current and future user agents and  assistive technology, including the ones running on limited resources [23].   These guidelines contain 61 success criteria. WCAG 2.0 conformance can be achieved by applying a   series of techniques [24]. Some of them are required to meet success criteria  sufficient techniques ,  while others are optional only  advisory techniques . W3C claims that none of the accessibility   370    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   techniques can be referred to as required or mandatory [25]. They are recommended only, and  developers may choose to apply them.   In contrast to WCAG 1.0, which has three priority levels, WCAG 2.0 success criteria are organized   into three levels of conformance. The conformance requirements of all levels of WCAG 2.0 are  summarized in the following sections. Generally, the word must in the following sections—similar to the  word use of the WCAG specifications published by the W3C—corresponds to Level A conformance,  which is the minimum level of accessibility in WCAG 2.0  for example, text alternative for nontext  content . The word should corresponds to Level AA conformance  for example, captions for live  synchronized media . The words may and can correspond to Level AAA conformance  for example,  optional sign-language interpreters .   The higher the accessibility conformance level, the more requirements or higher restrictions apply.   For example, Guideline 1.4 describes distinguishable color use and the requirements for separating  foreground from background. To meet level A, you should not rely on color alone for conveying  information. Level AA has a stricter requirement and prescribes a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1  3:1  for large text , while Level AAA demands an even higher-contrast ratio of 7:1  4.5:1 for large text .   Note that some requirements are general, while others are technology-specific and apply to a   certain technology only, such as Flash. Some techniques can be used either alone or in combination  with a similar technique, such as short and long descriptions, but the corresponding requirements  regarding their application depend on the desired level of accessibility.    It is important to keep in mind that Level AAA conformance is not recommended as a general   policy, because there are content types that cannot be published in a way that the document meets all  AAA criteria because of the nature of the content or special technology features and limitations. In other  words, using certain content types might limit the maximum achievable level of accessibility to WCAG  2.0 AA, while WCAG 2.0 AAA cannot be met if certain content types are present. For example, section  headings can contribute to AAA conformance; however, they cannot be added to all kinds of documents   for example, a long letter [26] . Naturally, site structure or markup elements should be reorganized,  added, or modified when creating an accessible web site or redesigning a nonaccessible site to become  accessible, but there is no reason for a content author to modify the textual content of a web page just to  make the site accessible or more accessible. Another example is Flash, which had known accessibility  barriers at the time the WCAG specifications were formed, and generally it was infeasible to provide  Flash content and achieve level AAA conformance at the same time.   Additionally, WCAG conformance can be limited to a conforming alternate version instead of the   whole web site. For example, if the complex design of a web site makes it infeasible to meet WCAG  requirements, the site can still be accessible by providing an alternate style sheet or, in the case of more  sophisticated design, an alternate, accessible version of each page within the site. Consequently,  determining WCAG conformance requires deep site analysis and cannot be judged by simply opening  the home page [27].    Note  In contrast to documents with tag soup and bad markup, well-structured, standard-compliant web sites  with properly written content provide a basic level of accessibility by default, which can be further extended to  achieve the desired  advanced  level of accessibility.   Site Structure Requirements  All web pages  not only the home page  must have descriptive titles provided by the title element. In  the optimal case, page titles identifying the subject are short as well as reasonable and understandable   371    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   without context. Moreover, they should be unique and identify the page within the site. Table 10-1  shows an example.    Table 10-1. Unique and Short, but DescriptiveWeb Page Titles Within a Site   URI   Page   Title Example   http:  www.example.com   Index page   Professional consultants   http:  www.example.com about    About page   Professional consultants: About   http:  www.example.com contact    Contact page   Professional consultants: Contact     A hyperlink pointing to the main content page must be provided at the top of each web page within   a site.    Tip  This requirement can be easily provided without interrupting the content or design by adding the link to the  web site logo as  <img src="images logo.png" alt="Pro  Consultants"  > .   Links to all other pages of the site must be available directly or indirectly from the home page. The   relationship between the currently visited web page and other parts of the web site can be clearly  indicated with properly selected web site components and well-written element content  descriptive  URIs, descriptive titles, metadata provided with link rel, breadcrumb trails, chapters added using  headings, and so on .   Breadcrumb trails may be applied to help the user visualize content structure, ease navigation, and  identify the current location within the site structure as well as within the current web page. This can be  obtained by displaying locations in the path or the location of the current web page within the site  structure. Breadcrumb trails might provide links to previously visited web pages. They are placed in the  same location within each web page. Typical separators used for breadcrumb trailing are ▼, ►, >, , ::,  and  . For example, it can be clearly indicated that the web store user is browsing LCD monitors with a  screen size equal to or larger than 22 inches as Electronics > Computers & Accessories > Monitors > LCD  > 22 Inches & Up  Figure 10-2 .      372    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Figure 10-2. Breadcrumb trails to ease navigation   The current location may be presented within navigation bars too. The list of all other pages of the  site as well as links to related web pages can also ease navigation. The link element may be applied for  clearly indicating multiple relationships between the current web page and other web pages within the  web site  with values of the rel attribute such as Start, Next, Prev, Contents, and Index . Listing 10-1  shows an example.   Listing 10-1. Declaring Web Page Relationships in the Document Head            Chapter 4     …                   …      A logical tab order must be added to web sites that allows the user to easily navigate through links,   objects, and form controls  Listing 10-2 .   373    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Listing 10-2. Tab Order Declared for the Menu, Search Box, and Flash Header of a Web Page                    …       …                       H ome                            A bout                           S ervices                      P ortfolio                      C ontact           …               Search query       <input type="text" name="q" id="q" size="19" maxlength="255" value="Type to search"        tabindex="6"  >                               …  <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="flash header.swf" width="720"    height="300" id="flash" tabindex="8">                      <img src="images alter.jpg" alt="The image alternative for the        flash header."  >            374    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   A search function is vital for all web sites because it might help users find content. A popular   approach for providing a search function to web sites is to create a site-specific Google search field  also  shown in the previous example . The Search button should be adjacent to the search field.   Content sections must begin with a heading element to provide structure  h1–h6 . Descriptive   headings and labels must be provided that allow users to select the information relevant to them. Pages  can be organized efficiently with headings. In  X HTML5, document introductions should apply the  header element.   Content Requirements  The order of content in the source code must coincide with the visual presentation of the content; in  other words, the DOM order must match the visual order. Dynamic content inserted into the Document  Object Model right after the element used to activate the dynamic content insertion ensures a correct  tab order  and thus a correct reading order for screen readers  through the exploitation of the default tab  order of user agents. Web page content must be ordered in a meaningful sequence. This also holds for  interactive elements. Page section reordering must be performed by using the DOM. Repeated  components should always be presented in the same order. Users must be allowed to skip repeated  menu items through expandable and collapsible menus. Flash contents must apply the tabIndex  property in order to specify a logical reading order and a logical tab order.   User Assistance   A site map and a table of contents also contribute to accessibility. A help link may be added to every web  page. A dedicated help page can be used to collect information that can be helpful for less experienced  users but omitted from the main content, because they are evident  and perhaps annoying  for most  users. Moreover, a help page might provide information about special web site features that are not  common on the Web. For example, a user of a highly accessible web site can be informed about the  option to control the menu with keyboard buttons, which is not available on every site. Help may also be  provided in the form of an assistant who gives a tour to new visitors on the functionality and content of  the site. Such an assistant can be presented as an animation with a digital character  also known as a  multimedia avatar  or a video clip with a real person, who gives instructions or a service overview or  explains concepts related to the company portfolio  Figure 10-3 .   Figure 10-3. An assistant  video clip with a real person  [28]      375    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Ensured Readability  In the optimal case, text is easy to read. Complex text content may be summarized in a form that  requires a reading ability less advanced than the upper secondary education level. For example, a  technical article can be too complex to read for some people, and a text summary containing shorter  sentences and more common words might be helpful for them. To achieve AAA conformance, text lines  may not exceed an average of 80 characters even if the browser window is resized.   People with certain cognitive disabilities who have trouble tracking single-spaced lines might find a   spacing of 1.5–2 more convenient to read. Web pages may have buttons to improve readability by  increasing line spaces and paragraph spaces  Listing 10-3 .    Listing 10-3. Sample Buttons for Manipulating Line Space and Paragraph Space   …       function inclineh   {      document.getElementById 'main' .style.lineHeight="200%";    }      function incpars   {      var get_ps = document.getElementsByTagName "p" ;      for  var i = 0; i < get_ps.length; i++  {        get_ps[i].style.marginBottom="40px";      }    }     …        <img src="images lineh.png" alt="Line height"     title="Increased line height"  >      <img src="images pspacing.png" alt="Paragraph spacing"     title="Increased paragraph spacing"  >      …              This is the first paragraph of the main content.                This is the second paragraph of the main content.           Additionally, the letter-spacing CSS property must be used to control spacing within words    whitespace between characters  that can further increase readability. Font sizes are best provided in  relative units  % or em . The em unit is preferred for text sizes of containers such as tables where percent- based fonts might cause a font size that is too large when resizing. Information presented by text  formatting such as font face, font size, or text decoration must also be accessible without formatting.  Basic text formatting should apply not only for  X HTML documents but also for plain-text files. Text  files must have text formatting that represents paragraphs, lists, and headings.   The visual presentation of texts should be controlled with CSS properties such as font-family, font-  size, font-style, font-weight, color, letter-spacing, line-height, text-align, text-transform, and   376    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   background-image and the pseudoclasses :first-line, :first-letter, :before and :after. These  properties and pseudoclasses avoid the need for image text.   Color Use  Web content must be accessible without the ability of sensory perception required for recognizing  locations, shapes, sizes, or sounds.   Justified text aligned to both the left and right margins can be hard to read for people with certain   cognitive disabilities. Consequently, text aligned to one side only contributes to the highest level of  accessibility. If it is not feasible because of layout purposes, a mechanism may be added to remove full  justification upon request.   If users are allowed to use the default colors of their browsers, that is, no background color, text   color, or text background color is specified by CSS rules, users with vision disabilities can override  certain colors that they have trouble seeing. This technique guarantees text readability presented over a  background. It is allowed to specify container layout and border colors, though.   A cross-browser color selector solution may be applied that allows users to change the foreground   and background colors of text sections.   The text-background contrast ratio should be 4.5:1 to achieve AA conformance  3:1 for large text    and may be a minimum of 7:1  4.5 for large text  for AAA conformance  including images of text . A high- contrast control should always be provided that allows users to switch to a presentation with sufficient  contrast. You can easily calculate the contrast ratio between arbitrarily selected colors by considering  the differences in luminosity.    The relative luminance is defined by the WCAG 2.0 specification as “the relative brightness of any   point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white.” In case of the sRGB  color space, the relative luminance of a color is defined as L = 0.2126 × R + 0.7152 × G + 0.0722 × B, where  the R, G, and B components are defined as follows [29]:         G  sRGB  =  B  sRGB  =  R bit 8 255  G bit 8 255 B bit 8 255           R  sRGB  =  If   sRGBR  ≤  0.03928   then   R =   else   R  =  sRGBR 12.92  sRGBG 12.92 sRGBB 12.92  sRGBR  +  0.055  2.4  1.055  sRGBG  +  0.055  1.055  sRGBB  +  0.055  1.055                            2.4  2.4  If   sRGBG  ≤  0.03928   then   G =   else   G  =  If   sRGBB  ≤  0.03928   then   B =   else   B  =    If you don’t want to calculate the color contrast, there are many useful tools that can check it for   you, for example the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker [30], the Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio  Analyser of Juicy Studio [31], or the Luminosity Contrast Ratio Analyser 1.1 of WAT-C [32].   Information expressed in colors must also be available and perceivable without colors. Additional   visual cues must be available when text color differences are used to convey information. Semantic  markup must be added whenever color cues are used to convey information.   An optional multicolor selection tool added to pages to change the foreground and background  colors arbitrarily allows users to specify colors according to their personal preference  Figure 10-4 .   377    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Figure 10-4. A color picker example suggested by W3C [33]       Information and structure must be separated from presentation to enable different presentations.   Various color combinations can be provided for the text and background of the main content along with  component groups within the web page.   Abbreviations, Definitions, and Foreign Words  The full form of words may precede their shortenings. Abbreviations might have an inline expansion or  explanation they are associated with the first time they occur within a web page. Definitions may be  provided by the abbr and acronym elements for all abbreviations. Defined words can be enclosed by the  dfn element. Terms, abbreviations, initialism, and acronyms can be linked to their definitions in order to  provide the highest level of accessibility. Terms and phrases written as definition list items are the most  accessible. They may be collected on a glossary page available through a simple hyperlink provided by  the link element. Alternatively, a search function can be embedded that provides the definitions  through an external online dictionary. Beyond abbreviations, all words or phrases used in an unusual  way or restricted manner can be made more accessible with a definition.   The pronunciation of a special or foreign word provided immediately after the word at least the first   time it occurs within a web page contributes to AAA conformance. Other instances can alternatively  provide a link to a list of pronunciations.   The default language of web documents must be identified in the HTTP header as well as by the   lang and or xml:lang attribute on the html element in the markup. This is also vital for web pages with  Flash content because embedded Flash objects inherit the language settings provided by the lang  and or xml:lang attributes. Document sections written in a language other than the default language  must be clearly identified on their containing elements.   378    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   To ensure text direction for bidirectional inline content, the Unicode right-to-left marks  &rlm;,   &x200f;, or U+200F , and left-to-right marks  &lrm;, &x200e; or U+200E  must be applied.   Text direction of inline content must apply the dir attribute to clearly indicate text direction.  In many languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew, or East Asian languages, text meaning largely depends  on pronunciation. Web content written in such languages may apply Ruby annotation with ruby, rt, and  rp elements in order to provide information about the pronunciation and meaning of text fragments.    Note  Ruby annotations were introduced a long time ago in Far Eastern textbooks to provide hints for students  about complex characters. For example, Japanese texts written in the Kanji syllabary  writing system  often  contain characters that are known only by those Japanese who have at least a high school graduation. Ruby texts  written in Hiragana, which is a syllabary all Japanese are familiar with, can make the text clearer. Similarly,  traditional Chinese texts can be displayed in simplified Chinese using Ruby annotations.   Using Ruby, a base text can be declared within the Ruby markup  the content of the ruby element ,  along with the associated Ruby text  the rt element , and optionally the Ruby parentheses  rp , that can  be declared for browsers that cannot render Ruby text correctly. For example, pronunciation hints can  be provided for words on an educational portal, while foreign words or unusual names can be  transliterated into English  Listing 10-4  or represented using the International Phonetic Alphabet  IPA    Listing 10-5 .   Listing 10-4. Ruby Annotation for Tokyo        東京             Tō kyō               In the case of simple Ruby markup, user agents should render the Ruby text above the base text at   approximately half the font size. In our case, the result should look like Figure 10-5.   Figure 10-5. The Ruby annotation for the word Tokyo rendered in IE9      379    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY    Note  Ruby annotations are rendered most accurately by Internet Explorer.   Browsers that do not support Ruby annotations will render the previous code inline without   interrupting the text flow  Figure 10-6 .   Figure 10-6. The fallback mechanism of the Ruby annotation in action      Listing 10-5. The IPA Representation of an Eastern-European Name Using Ruby Annotation        Count            István Széchenyi        pronounced:         ˈiʃtvaːn ˈseːtʃeːɲi                   was one of the greatest statesmen of Hungarian history.      Listing 10-5 is rendered in compliant browsers as presented in Figure 10-7.   Figure 10-7. Pronunciation hint provided by Ruby annotation   In browsers that do not recognize Ruby markup, the same example would be rendered inline    Figure 10-8 .      380    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY      Figure 10-8. Pronunciation hint rendered inline in browsers that do not support Ruby annotations   More complex Ruby annotations can specify not only the default display and fallback mechanism  shown earlier but also positioning offsets, alignment, spacing, and overhang. The Ruby annotation was  introduced as an XHTML 1.1 module and can also be used in HTML5.2 The Ruby annotations can also be  styled using the corresponding CSS3 module, which provides precise positioning and line breaking,  defines the Ruby box model, and supports the vertical-ideographic layout mode [34].   The most accessible documents apply standard diacritical marks in a way that users are allowed to   turn them on and off upon request.   resizing features of browsers.   Properly selected positioning and units should be applied that support the zooming and text   Accessible web sites have controls that allow users to incrementally change the size of all text  up to   200 percent . There must be no loss of content or functionality when the text resizes while the  dimensions of text containers remain the same.   User Interface  Content must be accessible through alternate user interfaces. Properly written markup must be provided  that allows assistive technology to understand the content, expose information such as form control IDs,  and control certain elements through an API  for example, the DOM .   Standard DOM functions must be applied to dynamically add content to web pages instead of   scripting, which provide contents not necessarily read by screen readers.    Note  Screen readers may not automatically read dynamically added content. Reading of dynamically added  new content can be ensured by setting the focus to the new element or adding it below the current location where  it will be encountered as the user continues browsing.   Liquid layout should be used on all web sites to present content without introducing unnecessary   horizontal scroll bars. Page content should adapt to the available horizontal space. Layout regions  should be resized with text and reflow as needed to display the page section. Highly accessible web sites  eliminate horizontal scrolling even if the user resizes the browser window. One of the techniques to  achieve such a foolproof layout is to specify the width of text containers in %. If it is not feasible on the  default screen, an alternate layout may be provided that does not require horizontal scrolling.                                                    2 There is a difference between the XHTML 1.1 and HTML5 implementations. As of 2011, the rb  ruby  base  element of the original specification cannot be used in HTML5, however, its reintroduction is still  an open question. The examples in the listings show HTML5 examples.   381    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Content positioning should be based on structural markup. The appearance can be enhanced with   CSS, but the content structure must also remain meaningful without style sheets.   If the content of the default version of a web page is not accessible but an alternate, WCAG-  conforming version is, that web page must be linked at the beginning of the nonconforming page. If  nonaccessible objects cannot be eliminated from the content, a link must be added adjacent to or  associated with these objects that link to an alternate, WCAG-compliant version. User preference must  be saved in a cookie. The accessibility of the alternate version must always be ensured with .htaccess or  the HTTP referrer header. A style switcher must be provided to ensure an alternate version with WCAG- compliant styles.3 Three different types of style sheets are required to create a style switcher:   1.  Persistent CSS file: The base styles that are used to share common styles   throughout the site. The rel attribute is set to stylesheet, while the title  attribute is omitted  Listing 10-6 .   Listing 10-6. A Persistent CSS File      2.  Preferred CSS file: Styles enabled by default when the page is loaded. The   attribute value of the rel attribute is stylesheet, and the title attribute is  provided  Listing 10-7 .   Listing 10-7. A Preferred CSS File       3.  Alternate CSS files: CSS files designed for alternate versions of the site that  reuse the styles declared in the main style sheet file but overwrite some of  them  for example, set the font size to a larger value, or modify the font color to  achieve higher contrast  or add new ones on top of the reused ones  for  example, define a maximum width for mobile devices . They can be used not  only for increasing accessibility but also for design or media-specific versions  of the site  as hinted earlier in Chapter 3 . Alternate CSS files have the rel  attribute value alternate stylesheet instead of stylesheet, and they have a title  attribute that identifies them  Listing 10-8 .   Listing 10-8. Alternate Style Sheets   <link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text css" href="styles large.css"  title="Large"  >  <link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text css" href="styles contrast.css"  title="Contrast"  >   First, create three CSS files, one for the main styles  Listing 10-9  and two for alternate styles that will   provide large font size  Listing 10-10  or huge font size with high contrast  Listing 10-11 , respectively.                                                     3 Since not all functionalities can be provided through CSS, a conforming alternate version of a web site  cannot always be provided by simply creating additional style sheets.   382    Listing 10-9.

The CSS File for the High-Contrast Version  contrast.css    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   383    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Next, we need a script that sets the styles from the selected CSS file and stores the choice in a cookie   that can be read if the user returns to the page  Listing 10-12 . Without cookies, the alternate styles  would be applied for the current page of the current session only, which is almost useless. If a visually  impaired user selects the “high-contrast theme,” he or she would probably like to read all the pages of  the site with the same setting.   Listing 10-12. The styleswitcher.js [35]   function setActiveTheme title  {    var i, a, main;    for  i = 0;  a = document.getElementsByTagName "link" [i] ; i++  {      if  a.getAttribute "rel" .indexOf "style"  != -1 && a.getAttribute "title"   {         a.disabled = true;         if  a.getAttribute "title"  == title  a.disabled = false;      }    }  }    function getActiveTheme   {    var i, a;    for i = 0;  a = document.getElementsByTagName "link" [i] ; i++  {      if a.getAttribute "rel" .indexOf "style"  != -1 && a.getAttribute "title"  &&  !a.disabled  return a.getAttribute "title" ;    }    return null;  }    function getPreferredTheme   {    var i, a;    for  i = 0;  a = document.getElementsByTagName "link" [i] ; i++  {      if  a.getAttribute "rel" .indexOf "style"  != -1          && a.getAttribute "rel" .indexOf "alt"  == -1          && a.getAttribute "title"            return a.getAttribute "title" ;    }    return null;  }    function createCookie name,value,days  {    if  days  {      var date = new Date  ;      date.setTime date.getTime   +  days*24*60*60*1000  ;      var expires = "; expires=" + date.toGMTString  ;    }    else expires = "";    document.cookie = name + "=" + value + expires + "; path= ";  }    function readCookie name  {    var nameEQ = name + "=";    var ca = document.cookie.split ';' ;    for  var i = 0; i < ca.length; i++  {   384    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY        var c = ca[i];       while  c.charAt 0 ==' '  c = c.substring 1, c.length ;       if  c.indexOf nameEQ  == 0  return c.substring nameEQ.length, c.length ;    }    return null;  }    window.onload = function e  {    var cookie = readCookie "style" ;    var title = cookie ? cookie : getPreferredTheme  ;    setActiveTheme title ;  }    window.onunload = function e  {    var title = getActiveTheme  ;    createCookie "style", title, 365 ;  }    var cookie = readCookie "style" ;  var title = cookie ? cookie : getPreferredTheme  ;  setActiveTheme title ;   Finally, we put all the components together and get the style switcher functionality on our site    Listing 10-13 .

Web pages that apply image replacement for text fragments from CSS should have an interface that   allows users to switch between the two versions.   Web content structure should contain appropriate semantic markup elements. The elements must   be used according to their meaning rather than their  default  appearance. Semantically meaningful  markup such as em or strong must be used for emphasized and special texts. The ol, ul, and dl elements  must be applied for both lists and link groups. Links must be grouped using the map element.   Keyboard users must not be stopped by a web site section accessible exclusively with a mouse. The   same holds for Flash objects that are not keyboard accessible by default.    Note  Duplicated attributes on the same element might cause key errors for assistive technology and must be  eliminated.   The appearance of elements receiving focus or being hovered over with a pointing device should be  changed  for example, highlighted  to provide visual feedback to the user  such as changed background  or border color . Flash content should also provide highly visible focus indication.   Alternate texts, labels, and names should be shared among components with the same   functionality.   An optional sign language version provided for all information required to use the content can  improve accessibility for people who are deaf or have certain cognitive disabilities. It can be either a  multimedia avatar using a technology such as Flash or a video clip of an animated or real sign language  interpreter  Figure 10-9 .      Figure 10-9. A signing avatar [36]   386    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Web site components such as markup, style sheets, and XML files must be validated to guarantee   the proper use of formal specifications, grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. Opening and closing tags  must be used according to the markup specification. All web pages must be well-formed.   Markup Requirements for Nontext Content  Images, photos, graphics, and symbols can be applied to improve user experience and help the user  understand the content. However, all nontext content, such as images, embedded objects  Flash  content, applets, audio, video, and so on , ASCII arts, emoticons, and leetspeaks must have alternate  texts.   All images must have an alt attribute. For those images that can be safely ignored by assistive   technology, the title attribute must be omitted and the alt text set to null  alt="" . If an image and its  associated text have the same link, they must be combined in order to avoid unnecessary duplication.  Spacer images such as 1x1 pixel GIF files should be totally eliminated in favor of CSS margins and   For those images and objects where a short description is not adequate, a long description must be   added. For years, the longdesc attribute was used for that purpose. However, the longdesc attribute is  obsoleted in  X HTML5, and a regular a element with a link to the description must be used instead.   Nontext content represented in colors must also be available with patterns that can be understood   padding.   without colors.   Alternate text must be provided for nontext content that identifies its purpose  even for the content  that requires sensory experience . Additionally, both a short and a long description must be provided for  nontext content with an identical purpose that presents the same information.    If the original nontext content is too long or the same information cannot be achieved with text   alone, short alternate text must be written that briefly summarizes the nontext content.   Images used exclusively for decoration, such as background images, image rollovers, or tab images,   must be provided using CSS. Since there is no additional markup, assistive technology can ignore this  nontext content.   Alternate text must be written for all area elements within image maps.  A text or nontext alternative must be provided for all objects. Alternate texts can be written directly   in the content of the object element. Nontext alternatives can be provided by nested objects.   Adjacent nontext content sharing information or functionality must be described by alternate text in   order to avoid unnecessary duplication.   Blinking and Flashing Content  Photoepileptic seizures caused by strobing or flashing effects should be eliminated. A link or button  must always be added to web pages with blinking content that loads equivalent pages without blinking  content. Blinking contents can be included on web pages only by using a technology that provides the  option to turn off blinking with a browser feature. Blinking content must be minimized below 5 seconds  using scripts and, if possible, totally eliminated. The same holds for animated GIF images.   Flashing content must also be minimized. A maximum of three flashes is allowed within 1 second. If   it is not feasible because of the content features, the flashing area must be less than 25 percent of 10  degrees of the visual field. The content is not allowed to violate the general flash threshold or red flash  threshold, which avoids photosensitive seizures. There are tools, such as the Photosensitive Epilepsy  Analysis Tool  PEAT  [37], that can be used to evaluate flashing content to reduce the risk of seizure.   387    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Flash Objects  The dimensions of embedded Flash objects may be specified in relative units  em or % .   Nontext objects marked with the name property must be applied in Flash to allow assistive   technology to access them. A long text alternative must be provided by the description property for  nontext objects in Flash. Text alternatives must be provided for clickable image hotspots that serve the  same purpose. The accessible description of DataGrids has been used for years to provide information  readable by screen readers.   Flash graphics must be marked in a way that they can be ignored by assistive technology if needed.  This can be accomplished by directly exploiting the accessibility features of Flash objects or by applying  textual alternatives using ActionScript.   If adjacent text and image buttons  icons  serve the same purpose, they must be combined into a   single button symbol instance.   Forms written in markup are preferred to Flash forms. However, if you have to use Flash forms on   your site, the following guidelines should be considered. Flash controls must be understood out of  context. To achieve this, control labels can be changed via scripting to provide additional information.  Similar to their markup equivalents, the required fields of Flash forms must be clearly indicated. Related  Flash form controls must be grouped together to provide semantic meaning. Flash forms must be  validated on the client side. If errors are found, a description must be added to the controls containing  invalid data. Flash form controls must have an associate text label  for example, via auto labeling . Only  CheckBox and RadioButton components get labels by default.   Users must be allowed to pause scrolling Flash contents controlled by a script.  Blinking of Flash contents must be controlled by scripts to stop within a maximum of five seconds.   Link Requirements  Hyperlink anchors must always have a text description that clearly identifies the purpose of the link.  Links must apply the title attribute to provide additional link text. Hyperlinks must have a descriptive  alternate text that clearly indicates the purpose of the link.   Additional link text added for advanced screen reader and Braille display support can be hidden  using CSS selectors  without visibility:hidden or display:none . This link text can also be applied in  combination with a style switcher. Repetitive content must be avoided.   A control must be added to the top of each web page providing an alternate page version with link   texts that are sufficient to determine their purpose even without context.   The purpose of a link must be clear even without context  applying a descriptive link text , but the  container context  paragraph, preceding heading, list item, table cell, and its associated table heading   must also be written in a way that further improves the clarity of the purpose of the link.   The minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 should be ensured between link colors and text colors. Moreover,   additional visual cues must be provided on focus for links and controls where color alone is used to  identify them.   Destination URIs are generally not sufficiently descriptive. The link text Read more… is, for example,  not sufficient to understand a link. However, if the description precedes the link in the same sentence, it  can be understandable. The link purpose must be identified using the combination of link text and the  text of the enclosing sentence to ensure a logical text flow for screen readers. Link text changed  dynamically upon context must be provided whenever reasonable.   Links should be added for all web page elements and objects that do not support long descriptions   on the attribute level. The links must be next to the nontext content. The location of the long description  must be indicated in the short description  if applicable . For example, the short description of an image  provides the text “Comparison of smartphone operating systems—see details below,” while the long   388    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   description below the image states “In Figure 1, you can see the market share of smartphone operating  systems, including Android, BlackBerry OS, iOS, Microsoft Windows Mobile, Symbian, and webOS.”   If a web page contains blocks of repeated content such as navigation links or table of contents, a link   must be added to the beginning of the blocks that allows users to bypass them. The top of the web page  must contain links to the different sections of the content.   Dialog messages must be device-independent. Pop-up windows should be eliminated whenever   possible. If a new window cannot be eliminated, advanced warning may be provided. To avoid  confusion, new windows opened on user request with the target attribute may have a proper link text  clearly indicating that the content will be opened in a new window. As a general rule, however, links  should be opened in the same window rather than a new window or tab. While this approach  contributes to accessibility, it has the drawback that it might lead to loss of visitors  if they forget to  return to your site .   User Input and Form Requirements  Form controls and links must be provided using  X HTML elements rather than other technologies such  as Flash.   Text inputs of forms must have a title attribute that can be used for providing context-sensitive   help.   An accessible name must be applied for labeling Flash form controls. Flash buttons must always   have an accessible label that describes the purpose of the link. Flash image buttons must have accessible  names that provide information about the function of the buttons but do not describe the images in  general.   The label property must be set for the Button, CheckBox, and RadioButton Flash form components  explicitly. As a result, the label text appears next to the component and becomes available for assistive  technology.    Groups of form controls must have a description provided by the legend element and must be   grouped with fieldset.   A button must be applied along with select elements to perform an action. The option elements   must be grouped with optgroup within select elements.   To keep proportions, textual form elements such as input boxes and buttons should be resized   when text size is significantly changed in the browser.   Beyond enumerated options, forms sometimes allow user-defined values  typically with the text   other, please specify  for which text descriptions must be provided.   Text instructions must be added to the beginning of forms and fieldsets that clearly indicate the   required input. Text input elements may have a spell checker. Required fields must be clearly indicated,  for example with an asterisk  *  character. The user must be informed through a text description if the  input is a prohibited value, falls outside the allowed limits, or is provided in a nonsupported format.   When using technologies that support Accessible Rich Internet Applications  WAI-ARIA , the   allowed range of entry fields should be identified with the aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax properties.  User agents typically do not permit users to enter values outside the specified range and generate a  validation error if users do so.   Expected data formats presented with examples reduce the probability of inadequate user input.   The same holds for review and correction options offered before form submitting. A mechanism should  be provided for web applications to recover information deleted in error upon request.   Multipart forms must provide a checkbox on the first page that gives users more time upon request   or totally eliminates session time limits.   User input should be validated by means of client-side scripting. If errors are found, an alert dialog   must be used to inform the user. Error messages can also be added via the DOM. Additionally, a  mechanism should be provided that helps users find the location of input errors. If the information   389    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   supplied by the user is not adequate and cannot be accepted, correct text should be suggested  if  available .    If a CAPTCHA is applied, alternate text must be added that describes its purpose. Additionally,   another CAPTCHA should be generated upon request.   A checkbox provided in addition to Submit buttons encourages users to review their input before   submitting. If confirmation is required to continue a selected action, form submission problems can be  minimized or eliminated. After submission, a stated time period should be provided when the  order request can be updated or canceled by the user. A success feedback should always be provided  when data is submitted successfully.   The aria-describedby WAI-ARIA property can be applied to attach descriptive information to one or  more elements. Form controls must be associated with text labels by the label element. When the label  element cannot be used, the title attribute must be applied. Labels must be positioned immediately  before the field  with text direction taken into account  except the labels of radio buttons and  checkboxes that are positioned after the field. Form fields and the buttons that clearly indicate their  purpose must be adjacent.   A text cue must be added to colored form control labels to combine color and text or character cues   to convey information. For example, required field labels represented in red can be quickly recognized  by most people, but not all people can see colors. However, they can still read text cues or listen to them.   A description must be associated with form controls indicating context changes in advance. A   submit button must be used in order to allow users to explicitly request changes of context. The aria- required WAI-ARIA property can be used to indicate that user input is required before submission. Text  descriptions must be provided to identify required fields that were not completed.   Table Requirements  Tabular information must be presented with the table element. Table captions must be associated with  tables by using the caption element. Data cells and header cells must be associated with the id, header,  and scope attributes in tables. In Flash, the DataGrid component must be used to associate column  headers with cells. These components must have a caption text. The summary attribute must be applied  on the table element to give an overview of the table.   User Control Requirements  All web site functionalities must be accessible not only with pointing devices such as a mouse but also  with the keyboard. This also holds for Flash contents  using the click event on standard components .   A control must be provided on all web pages that allows users to stop moving, blinking, or   autoupdating contents.   Both a pausing and a restarting option must be provided for all automatically refreshing or   disappearing contents such as banners or flash headers. A link to the alternative for time-based media  must be placed immediately next to the nontext content. Users should not be forced to complete any  activities within time limits. Users must always be warned by a script if the time limit is about to expire.  This also holds for Flash content.   Users must always have the option of setting time limits to ten times the default value. The option  for extending the default time limit also applies for Flash contents. Moreover, users must be allowed to  turn off time limits.   The actions of markup elements such as anchors and form elements must be keyboard-accessible.  Event handlers must be device-independent and allow not only the mouse but also keyboard access to  full content functionality  for example, drag and drop . This can be achieved using redundant keyboard  and mouse event handlers. The same holds for Flash contents as well as all scripting functions.   390    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Web servers that require user authentication often terminate sessions for security reasons after a  certain period of time spent without user activity. If the user cannot provide the input quickly enough,  the session times out before data submission, and reauthentication is required. Servers should store  such data in a temporary cache and retain them after a successful user reauthentication, so the user can  continue filling in the form rather than starting it all over again, because all previously entered data is  restored. Reauthorization pages may hide and encrypt user data.   Context changes must apply predictable actions. For example, if data entries of a form cannot be  presented on a single page, the second page should not be loaded automatically after the user presses  the Tab key on the last entry of the first page, because it can confuse screen reader users, which must be  avoided.   Automatic redirections should be eliminated whenever possible. Both client-side  meta refresh    and server-side  HTTP response  redirections have accessibility issues that can confuse users.   Certain user interface components are highlighted by some browsers when they receive focus. For   example, a form input is slightly highlighted in Google Chrome and strongly highlighted in Safari by  default but not highlighted at all in IE, Firefox, and Opera  Figure 10-10 .      Figure 10-10. Default browser highlighting of the same input field in Firefox and Safari  the second text  input is selected    Since highlighting varies from component to component and from browser to browser, the high   visibility of focus indicators should be ensured by web developers.   Form components, links, and all elements with a tabindex attribute greater than 0 can receive focus.   However, the default focus indicator of some platforms is not highly visible and may be difficult to see  against certain backgrounds. The visibility of focus indicators should always be ensured.   Nonessential alerts are optional. In the ideal case, users are not disturbed with unnecessary modal   pop-up windows  dialog windows that require the user to click the OK button to disappear .   Time-based media such as presentations must always have an alternate textual version or   description. Automatically updated contents may be eliminated and a mechanism provided to postpone  automatic content update. Moving and scrolling texts must also be available in a static page section or  window.   391    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Live Media, Audio, and Video Requirements  Prerecorded synchronized media such as video clips must have captions. Sounds can be played on user  request only. Sound effects must automatically be turned off within three seconds. Additionally, an  easily discoverable control must be located near the beginning of the page for turning sound on off.  Flash contents must also have a control for the same purpose.   In Flash movies, screen reader detection with the flash.accessibility.Accessibility.active   property can be used to turn off sounds that are played automatically if assistive technology is used  by  default, the sound can still be played automatically .   Nonspeech sounds in audio files may be at least 20 dB lower than the speech audio content.  An additional, user-selectable audio track must be provided with audio descriptions.  A spoken version of the text can significantly improve site accessibility because it is more accurate   and perceivable than the speech of screen readers.   Live audio-only contents may have text alternatives. This can be achieved by a real-time caption   service with a trained human operator who can type the text with small delay. Note that such services are  very rarely used in practice.   A link to a text transcript of a prepared statement or script may be provided for scripts followed by   live audio contents. These scripts can be more accurate and complete than live transcriptions; however,  care must be taken to ensure correct synchronization.   Accessible alternatives must be provided for time-based media presenting audio-only or video-only   contents.   A descriptive label must be provided for live audio-only and live video-only content.  Videos must be provided with extended audio comments that fully describe the video content.  Additionally, a second version of video content must always be provided with audio descriptions to  maximize accessibility. This also holds for Flash audio-visual materials. Gaps of dialogue must be filled  with extended audio descriptions using SMIL.   Video-only content, which is inaccessible to blind and certain visually impaired people, must have   an audio alternative in a common audio format such as MP3. Video stream accessibility can be  maximized with sign language interpreters through a synchronized video whose display can be selected  by the user.   Captions must be added for video contents that can be turned on and off upon request because they   maximize availability. Captions must provide information for the hearing impaired not only about the  dialogue but also the sound descriptions  unlike conventional subtitles .   Migrating from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0  Some projects require web site upgrade from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0. Several WCAG 1.0–compliant sites  require little or no changes at all to meet WCAG 2.0. WCAG 2.0 is based on WCAG 1.0; however, there are  some differences in the approach and requirements.   Sites that meet WCAG 1.0 partly fulfill WCAG 2.0 by default. The two versions of WCAG are   compatible. Consequently, it is possible to meet both WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 requirements at the  same time. Because of the advanced flexibility of the second version, however, a WCAG 2.0–compliant  site does not automatically meet the requirements of WCAG 1.0. Some WCAG 2.0 success criteria are  very similar to WCAG 1.0 checkpoints. On the other hand, there are WCAG 1.0 requirements that are not  needed in WCAG 2.0. Some WCAG 2.0 requirements are more specific than the related requirements in  WCAG 1.0 [38].   WCAG 1.0 is technology-specific [39], while WCAG 2.0 applies to W3C and non-W3C technologies as   long as they provide accessibility [40].   compliance assumes user agent support.   WCAG 1.0 uses interim solutions  “until user agents…” , while WCAG 2.0 success criteria   392    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   In WCAG 1.0, JavaScript is considered a technology with accessibility problems [41]. In fact,   JavaScript can be accessible, depending on the application and functionality being used  which we’ll  discuss in more detail later . Scripting techniques successfully tested with screen readers are considered  in WCAG 2.0.   The major steps of migrating from WCAG 1.0 to 2.0 can be summarized as follows [42]:   1.  Conformance parameters should be determined.  2.  Applied technologies should be determined.  3.  The application potential of technical requirements should be analyzed.  4.  WCAG 1.0 checkpoints should be checked related to WCAG 2.0 requirements.  5.  WCAG 2.0 success criteria should be checked.   Finally, strange as it sounds, not everyone is enthused over the highest level of web accessibility.  Although WCAG 2.0 is very impressive from the accessibility point of view, it is still being criticized for  many reasons. For example, the specifications are very long and complex, the technology-neutral  descriptions are rather difficult to implement for developers, very special requirements are included   especially for AAA conformance, like the real-time caption service , some definitions are difficult to  understand, inaccessible page versions are tolerated when an accessible version is present, testing is far  too complex, and not all content can be written in a way that conforms to the strictest requirements [43].    U.S. Section 508  Beyond W3C standards, there are country-specific standards and or legislations on web accessibility  around the world. In the United States, a basic requirement for government web sites is Section 508  compliance. Subpart B of the Amendment describes technical standards. The most important part for  web developers is §1194.22  Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications  [44].   The web-based technology and information criteria defined by Section 508 are based on W3C WAI   guidelines. Consequently, §1194.22 and WCAG 1.0 checkpoints are consistent [45].   There are no limitations on graphic or animation use, but they must be provided in an accessible   form. Beyond the text labels and descriptions provided for graphics, this section also addresses usability  of style sheets, forms, scripting, multimedia contents, image maps, languages, and plugins.   An alternate text should be written for all nontext elements. Multimedia presentations should be   synchronized with their equivalent alternatives. Information cannot be expressed in color alone.   Information representation cannot rely exclusively on associated style sheets.  Row and column headers should be declared for data tables.  Data cells and header cells of data tables should be associated.  Client-side image maps should be preferred to server-side image maps except where the regions   cannot be defined with an available geometric shape.   Redundant text links should be provided for all active regions of server-side image maps.  Frames should have unique titles.  Screen flickering with a frequency of 2–55 Hz should be eliminated.  A text-only page should be provided with equivalent information and functionality.  Assistive technology must be able to access content provided by scripting.  Web content that requires third-party software such as plug-ins must provide a link to the plug-in   web site.   Forms should provide access for assistive technology.  Users should be allowed to skip repetitive navigation links.  Users should be notified on timed response requirements and allowed to extend time limits.   393   w   CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Semantic  X HTML5 Elements and WAI-ARIA  The new semantic markup elements introduced in the HTML5 specification such as header, hgroup,  footer, article, section, aside, and nav involve accessibility potential. It is important to keep in mind,  however, that browser support for these elements varies.   The support for ARIA roles is also increasing. ARIA roles can be applied as additional markup to   improve accessibility potential; in other words, their presence does not cause any problems on systems  without ARIA support. ARIA roles are added as attributes to elements such as banner, complementary,  contentinfo, form, main, navigation, or search. Several ARIA roles describe document structure, namely,  article, columnheader, definition, directory, document, group, heading, img, list, listitem, math, note,  presentation, region, row, rowheader, separator, and toolbar.   The role of structuring elements can be provided by the role attribute. Listing 10-14 shows an   example.   Listing 10-14. Using the role Attribute       Certain roles must be unique within a page. The banner header code shown is a good example.  While developers can use an unlimited number of headers, only one header can be a banner header.   JavaScript Accessibility  Hidden content, navigation, and strange user control behavior provided by scripting can cause  confusion and accessibility problems. For example, the onblur event used for checking user input can  override the default behavior of user agents and maintains focus until the correct answer is given, which  makes it impossible for screen readers to access any other parts of the page  including the feedback text  provided elsewhere  without entering the correct answer. Not all event handlers are device- independent, and some rely on the mouse  onmouseover, onmouseout, ondblclick  or keyboard  for  example, onkeydown, onkeyup , and cannot be triggered on all devices. If device-independent event  handlers are used  such as onfocus, onblur, onselect, or onchange , content and functionality provided  through scripting are accessible, full keyboard control is provided, and the scripts do not cause  confusion by modifying or overriding normal browser functionality, then scripts can be accessible [46].  When JavaScript cannot be made natively accessible, an accessible alternative must be provided.   Drop-down and fly-out menus are commonly used throughout the Web. However, the onmouseover   and onmouseout event handlers cannot be made directly accessible to keyboard users. Thus, an  alternative must be provided.   The onfocus and onblur event handlers can be inconvenient or inaccessible for keyboard users to   trigger.   The onclick event handler is a device-independent event handler; however, some applications rely   on the mouse. In contrast to links or form controls, where the onclick event handlers can be triggered by  pressing the Enter key, plain text and table cells cannot gain focus while navigating with the keyboard.  Consequently, keyboard users cannot activate the onclick event for elements other than links or form  controls. If this event is used with a form element  for example, for form validation , it is not a problem,  and the Submit button using the onclick event can be activated by both pointing devices and keyboards.    The ondblclick event handler is generally mouse-dependent, because it is associated with the   double-click of the mouse, and there is no equivalent event on all input devices such as on keyboards.   Drop-down selection lists such as language selectors usually apply the onchange event handler.   Going directly to the corresponding version by selecting an option from the list with a single click is very  convenient for mouse users. However, these lists are not accessible for keyboard users who cannot select   394    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   anything else but the first option  after pressing the cursor down key on the keyboard, the first option is  selected immediately . One possible solution for the problem is to add a button to be the trigger of the  onclick event handler. However, in this case all users should press the button after selecting the desired  option to trigger the event handler.   The onselect event handlers can also be applied in a device-independent way.  Certain event handlers such as onkeydown and onkeyup can be triggered exclusively by the keyboard.   The actions associated with them cannot be accessed by the mouse.   Dynamic content, such as the current time presented by document.write, cannot be read by screen   readers.    Note  Some features of dynamic web pages can also be achieved by pure CSS  especially CSS3 ; thus, certain  JavaScript code can be eliminated in favor of CSS  for example, transitioning effects or transforming menu items .  However, screen readers can handle certain CSS features poorly, for example, elements hidden by display:  none; or visibility: hidden;.   PDF Accessibility  Adobe Acrobat and Acrobat Reader provide accessibility  Figure 10-11  as well as screen reader options.  They are available under Edit   Preferences or directly with the shortcut Ctrl+K. You can find the screen  reader option under View   Read out loud.   Figure 10-11. Accessibility preferences in Adobe Acrobat Acrobat Reader      395    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Special features such as the Setup Assistant can be set under Advanced   Accessibility  Figure 10-12 .   Figure 10-12. Accessibility Setup Assistant      Image-only PDF files, which are usually created by scanning paper documents, have accessibility   issues. Text cannot be searched. Colors cannot be adjusted. Screen readers cannot read the image only  PDF files. Authors should use the OCR capabilities of Acrobat to provide text documents as text and  preserve structure at the same time.   The accessibility of unstructured PDF files varies. Their reading order can be changed. They provide   automatic tagging and authors can optionally use manual tagging. Protected files cannot be saved to  accessible formats.   Texts of structured PDF files are completely accessible. Hyperlinks are functional. The alternate text  of images is accessible  if present . Page numbers are correct. Screen readers can read basic data tables  correctly. If provided, the optional bookmarks can further improve accessibility. Protected files are also  accessible. However, even structured PDF files have some known accessibility issues. Paragraphs, for  example, cannot be located perfectly. Font attribute information is not available.   396    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   Flash Accessibility  Although accessibility was a weak point of the Flash technology for ages, both the developer  environment and the free player have been improved in this aspect. Adobe Flash Professional and Adobe  Flash Player have several features to support assistive technology [47].   The layout and structure can be rather complex in Flash movies, making it very difficult for screen  readers to read the content. A description added for the entire movie can give hints for screen readers  about the movie structure.   Text equivalents must be added for graphic elements such as names for graphic icons or   descriptions for gesturing animations. Element groups must have a single text equivalent.   Movies that never stop moving cause screen readers to refresh frequently. Even on web pages that   contain a movie at the bottom, screen readers might interpret motion as a page update and return to the  top to start reading again. This behavior can be eliminated by making the child objects of movie clips or  entire movies inaccessible [48].   To allow users to control motion, Next buttons must be added to movies instead of displaying   information for a limited time.   Several user interface components are accessible in Flash that automate common accessibility tasks   such as labeling or providing keyboard access. The accessibility object can be enabled with the class  enableAccessibility  .   The FLVPlayback component provides the option to include a video player in Flash applications to   play downloaded Adobe Flash Video  FLV  files and streaming FLV files. The FLVPlaybackCaptioning  component makes it possible to associate captions to your video. The captioning component supports  the Timed Text Markup Language  TTML  W3C standard, along with multiple captioning and toggle  control.   There are various approaches for providing control over reading order in Flash such as limiting   stage size, providing an additional, linear version of the content or specifying reading order via  ActionScript.   User controls must be accessible through the keyboard. Keyboard shortcuts must be added to   buttons. In order to consider the limitations of screen readers, scripts must be kept within frames and  empty movie clips used as buttons must be avoided.   In Flash Professional CS5, a new component was introduced to display audio captions contained   either in Timed Text format  DFXP  or integrated with the FLV file as cue points. Flash Professional CS5  also provides native support for accessible video player skins.   User control is a must for audio playback such as the Play and Pause button.  For all controls, it is important to provide the user with feedback on the control as it changes.  The general rules for color selection described earlier in the WCAG requirements also apply for   Flash contents.   Accessibility of Mathematical Notations  Mathematical equations provided in GIF images can be hard to read for the visually impaired and, if  provided without a textual description, are inaccessible for screen readers.   In contrast, MathML equations are accessible. The accessibility potential of MathML is clearly  demonstrated by the accessibility features of a free MathML plug-in for Internet Explorer,4 Design  Science MathPlayer [49]. The software provides audio or Braille descriptions for mathematical notations                                                    4 Since Internet Explorer has native MathML support from version 9, a MathML plugin is required for  earlier versions only. The company also provides tools for creating mathematical notations such as  MathType  see section “MathType” .   397    CHAPTER 10  ACCESSIBILITY   to screen readers. MathPlayer also has native speech capabilities  speak expression from the local  menu . It allows keyboard navigation. MathPlayer 2 also contains MathZoom that allows users to  magnify individual expressions. The matching algorithm ensures that the font size of mathematical  notations is increased when the surrounding text is zoomed. Additionally, MathPlayer supports line  breaks, which can improve readability if the font size is zoomed. It provides synchronized highlighting of  subexpressions that are being read out loud, which helps people with certain learning disabilities such  as dyslexia or dyscalculia.   Summary  In this chapter, you learned the accessibility guidelines to be applied in the markup, style sheets, client-  and server-side scripting, and multimedia content. You are now capable of creating web sites with the  desired level of accessibility that can be used by anyone, regardless of user disability or browsing device  limitations.   In the next chapter, you will learn about the tools of a web standardista. You will become familiar   with the requirements to be taken into account when selecting your advanced text editor, specific editor,  or markup corrector that can ease your work significantly.

In this part of the  book, you will analyze those errors that occur most frequently in standard-based web site development,  and you will master techniques and best practices through step-by-step guides to be able to plan and  create standards-compliant web sites with confidence. You will get useful tips to achieve full standards  compliance, robust functionality, optimal code length, and interoperability, as well as meaningful,  structured, and accessible content, and proper settings at the same time. You will also learn the features  of development and evaluation software to consider when selecting tools for web site development,  standardization, and optimization.   401    C H A P T E R  11              Development Tools   Since modern markup elements and attributes are becoming more and more sophisticated, complex  development software is used to generate web pages. However, certain web content such as descriptive  metadata can be so complex that it often requires human decisions. Advanced text editors always have a  top priority in the software list of every web standardista. Although they can be used for a variety of  tasks, specific editors should be applied such as semantic editors and markup correctors. Advanced text  editors can also be integrated with SFTP clients. WYSIWYG editors and content management systems  can be useful for rapid development; however, they often produce invalid code. Consequently, their  application should be minimized in web site standardization and optimization.   In this chapter, you will learn about software tools that can help you develop standard-compliant  web sites. You will become familiar with those vital features that should be considered when selecting  your development tools, optimizers, and testing environments.   Feature Requirements  Although experienced web standardistas can write valid code in any text editor, the software tools to be  selected should provide some advanced features that are vital for efficient hand-coding:     Comprehensive character encoding support, including full Unicode support     Whitespace character support     Control character support, for example, CR+LF  Windows , LF only  UNIX , and   Apple  CR only  break rows     Multifile editing with tabs     Customizable color schemas for syntax highlighting  XHTML, CSS, XML, scripts,   Forced word wrap   and so on      Undo redo           Auto indent     Guides for tag pairs and element nesting     OS integration  adds application to right-click menu     Line numbering   403    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   The selected editor should be integrated with at least one of your browsers as the default source   code editor, which you can use to open the currently rendered web document for editing with a button  or hotkey.   There are additional features of text editors that are not vital but can be useful:   Spell checker      Customized color and font settings     Customizable toolbars        Templates     Bookmarks        Built-in FTP client or integration with an  S FTP client      Conversions  uppercase, lowercase, invert case, and initial caps           International versions  can be convenient for some developers    Full drag-and-drop support   Support for double-byte character systems  DBCS  used in Far East languages  such as Chinese or Japanese  if required       Browser preview1  launching the default or selected web browser for debugging   and testing    Text Editors  In contrast with word processors such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer, plain-text editors  cannot be used for document formatting. These basic text editors can be used for creating web pages,  though. However, they are not convenient, and some vital features are missing from them. For example,  many of them do not handle all control and whitespace characters correctly. The most well-known  examples are Notepad under Windows and vi under Linux.   Advanced text editors such as WordPad provide text formatting and other additional features. Source   code editors are advanced text editors with additional tools specifically designed for hand-coders and  programmers. The most common feature of them is syntax highlighting for a variety of markup  languages, style sheets, and programming languages. These full-featured editors are comprehensive  tools suitable for hand-coding web pages. The following are some examples:     Linux      BlueFish [1]     Komodo Edit [2]     Mac OS      BBEdit [3]   404                                                     1 Some developers do not use this feature and open the desired browser s  manually.    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   EditPad Lite  free [5] and low-cost versions [6] are available         TextWrangler [4]   Windows   EditPlus [7]            NotePad++  free, open source [8]       TextPad  low cost, free evaluation [9]    Cross-platform      Arachnophilia  available for Windows, Linux, Unix, FreeBSD, and Mac OS [10]    As an example, let’s look at the major features of Notepad++. It is a multifile editor with convenient   file manager options. For example, the editor saves multiple files with a single click, opens recently  edited files, and provides tabs for each opened file. It has a fully customizable interface with advanced  features such as line markers, guides for opening and closing tag pairs, structuring guides to collapse or  reveal the currently edited level of the DOM tree, and syntax highlighting  Figure 11-1 .   Figure 11-1. Syntax highlighting and tag pair guides in Notepad++      405    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   There are a variety of programming and web development languages supported in syntax   highlighting from HTML to XML and from PHP to Ruby. There are several predefined color themes you  can select from, or you can create and apply new ones if you want. The different document components   indent guidelines, marks, carets, whitespaces, tag pairs, active and inactive tabs, and so on  can be  styled individually. Notepad++ can change text direction of documents. It also supports a variety of  character encodings, can add and remove byte-order marks, supports big-endian and little-endian  Unicode files, and converts files from one encoding to another.2 The documents opened in the  application can be previewed in any installed browsers.   Notepad++ also provides advanced text transformation functionalities, such as escaping certain   characters, transforming lowercase characters to uppercase  or vice versa , searching for matching  strings, converting decimal numbers to their hexadecimal equivalents, inserting the current date and  time, sorting lists ascending or descending, automatically converting leading spaces to tabs, and so on.  Notepad++ also supports macros, which you can run multiple times. The list of features can be extended  through additional plug-ins, such as the MIME tools for Base64 encoding and decoding.   WYSIWYG Editors  Graphical authoring tools can be comfortable, but standard compliance is not guaranteed in all cases.  They have features that can be useful even for advanced developers, and they provide an interface with  markup window, instant preview, and advanced debugging tools. Still, not all developers apply them,  and some use an advanced text editor exclusively. The graphical developing environments usually  require only a basic knowledge of markup and CSS  and sometimes no technical background  whatsoever , which is the major reason for their extreme popularity. Because of the large number of  features, however, there might be usability issues. For example, the interface can be confusing and  intimidating to some users, especially the ones without a few years’ expertise. In spite of the graphical  interface, some systems are difficult to master. Moreover, all of them have a different interface, and  someone who is an expert in one of them is not necessarily familiar with other systems, which is a  limitation, especially if the editor is available for one platform only. In contrast, hand-coders can work in  pretty much any environment, because text editors are available for all platforms, and their major  functionalities are very similar.   It is important to note that most WYSIWYG editors have a built-in source editor. Consequently,   WYSIWYG editors can be applied as source code editors as well. Additionally, some features of graphical  editors can be useful for any web developers, such as for database management, web servers, and  frameworks. Moreover, there are WYSIWYG editors that are dedicated to web standardistas such as  XStandard XHTML and W3C Amaya  Figure 11-2 .                                                     2 This feature can be used for certain encodings that can be reasonably converted to another, more  advanced encoding without sacrificing certain characters  for example, ANSI to UTF-8 .   406    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   Figure 11-2. An SVG file in Amaya   Many commercial and free editing tools exist [11]. Compared to advanced text editors and source   code editors, however, many commercial WYSIWYG editors are expensive. On the other hand, there are  several graphical developers that are not only free but also open source. Here are some examples:     Windows     Cross-platform      Microsoft Expression Web [12]  commercial      Microsoft WebMatrix [13]  freeware       Adobe Dreamweaver, available for Windows and Mac OS  commercial  [14]      W3C Amaya, a free, open source  X HTML, MathML, and SVG editor [15]      XStandard XHTML, the standards-compliant XHTML editor, available for  Windows and Mac OS  free lite version  [16]      407    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   The standard compliance of the industry-leading authoring application Dreamweaver is constantly   evolving. However, it took several years for web standards to attract attention.   The latest versions support HTML, CSS, XSLT, JavaScript, ActionScript, XML, ASP, ColdFusion, JSP,   and PHP. Some features and tools in Dreamweaver are useful not only for development in general but  also for standard-compliant development. Some examples are invalid code highlighting, syntax error  alerts displayed in the info bar, the list of CSS properties associated with the currently selected element,  and syntax highlighting. The program interface is highly customizable and features different modes for  displaying the code, the result, or both at the same time  Figure 11-3 .    Figure 11-3. Code and design can be displayed simultaneously in Adobe Dreamweaver.   Content Management Systems and Bloggers  Content management systems  CMSs  are WYSIWYG tools developed mainly for web content authoring  and blog publishing. Many of them are driven by PHP. The most well-known content management  systems are cross-platform, such as Drupal [17], Joomla! [18], and WordPress [19]. Beyond the common  tasks of web publishing, they provide modern functionalities such as semantic content support.  However, the standard support of CMSs varies. Undoubtedly, they are responsible for a large share of  invalid markup on the Web. Figure 11-4 shows a typical example.      408    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   Figure 11-4. Errors and warnings in every tenth row of the markup generated by a CMS      Since they are designed for rapid development without source editing, experienced web   standardistas avoid using them whenever possible. Although there are more and more CMSs that claim  to produce standard-compliant code  LiveStoryboard [20], WebDandy [21], sNews [22], and so on , most  of them do not provide a holistic approach to standards implementation; however, some produce a  reasonable markup code that is close to optimal.    Web Standards Support  The standards support of editors varies. Several tools know certain markup versions or variants, while  others have partial CSS support only  Table 11-1 . No ultimate solution exists, but any comprehensive  tools could be a good choice for hand-coders. For example, BlueFish supports not only all  X HTML  versions and variants but also RSS, Atom, MathML, CSS2, frames, JavaScript, Java, XSLT, XForms, and  XPath.   Table 11-1.

Such tools are semantic editors, markup correctors, special editors, SFTP clients, and  browser plug-ins.   Semantic Editors and Reasoners   Along with the increasing popularity of OWL, more and more tools are appearing on the market for OWL  development. Web ontologies are machine-processable, and semantic reasoners  also known as  reasoning engines or rules engines  can be used to infer logical consequences from facts or axioms  described by the ontologies. Some of the most useful semantic editors and reasoners are described next.  Protégé is a free open source framework [23] and one of the most widely used OWL editors. It is an  efficient tool for developing and testing ontologies. Protégé supports several file formats and syntaxes,  including OWL, OWL in functional syntax, OWL in Manchester syntax, RDF XML, OBO flat file, KRSS2,  Latex, and Turtle. It can directly open not only saved files but also online ontologies.   HermiT is an OWL Reasoner that can be used to determine ontology consistency, identify  relationships between classes, and further tasks. It can be used from the command line, in Java  applications, or as a Protégé plug-in  Figure 11-5 .   410    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   Figure 11-5. The HermiT reasoner running in Protégé       HermiT is released under the LGPL license [24]. TopBraid Composer is a graphical development tool   for data modeling and semantic data processing that supports standards such as RDF, OWL, and  SPARQL [25]. Pellet is an OWL 2 Reasoner for Java [26]. RacerPro 2.0 supports standards such as RDF,  RDFS, OWL Lite, OWL DL, and SPARQL. Connectivity with external software is also possible [27].  FaCT++ is a Description Logic reasoner compatible with OWL DL and OWL 2 [28].   MathType  MathType is an advanced editor for mathematical notations developed by Design Science. The  equations and annotations can be edited through a powerful graphical user interface  Figure 11-6 .   411    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   Figure 11-6. Equation editing in MathType      The software is available for Windows and Mac OS [29]. The editor is often embedded into Microsoft   Word to replace the Equation Editor  either as a new menu or as a new ribbon, depending on the Word  version , but it can also be used in other word processors such as OpenOffice, Google Docs, or Apple  Pages. The mathematical annotations edited in MathType can also be exported to MathML and LaTeX.  In fact, using MathType is one of the easiest ways to generate MathML. Beyond MathType, the W3C  browser editor Amaya can also be used to generate MathML.   Markup Correctors  Although sophisticated markup components such as metadata require human decision, conventional   X HTML markup elements and attributes can be reliably corrected automatically. They can be useful in  many cases; however, markup correctors do not replace hand-coder web standardistas. In contrast with  developers, software tools do not always support the latest standards; some of them are discontinued or  will be updated several years later than the date of standard release.   HTML Tidy  HTML Tidy is a markup corrector that fixes invalid HTML and improves the layout and indent style of  the markup. The tool was developed by Dave Raggett, the coauthor and editor of several markup  specifications at W3C. Since it is written in ANSI C, precompiled binaries are available for a variety of  platforms and can be compiled for further ones. HTML Tidy is available under the W3C license at  Sourceforge.net  both as a downloadable binary and as the source code  [30] or as an online service at  W3C [31].   The software can identify and correct missing or mismatched end tags, mixed-up tags, and quotes,   as well as change markup layout according to predefined styles [32].    412    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   Tidy for PHP  The HTML markup generated by PHP scripts can be checked and corrected by the PHP extension Tidy.  As an example, functions can be written to take HTML markup fragments as strings and run them  through HTML Tidy. The output is a valid markup. This approach makes automatic page processing and  standardization possible. If there are errors in the code, the location  line, column  and the error cause  are clearly indicated or automatically corrected [33].   Log Validator  W3C Log Validator “combines a Server Log analysis engine with batch validation, link checking, and  other quality-oriented processing, for step-by-step improvement and maintenance of Web Site Quality”  [34]. It finds the most frequently downloaded invalid documents, broken links, other errors, and  inconsistencies, and it sets a priority list for fixing them. This feature is designed for standardizing large- scale invalid web sites step by step by correcting only a certain amount of documents at a time.  Eventually, the whole site will be fixed, but the standardista can determine how to schedule  development time and effort.   Log Validator applies processing modules that validate the latest server logs against markup and   style sheet recommendations  according to W3C HTML and CSS Validation Services . The SurveyEngine  module creates a summary of errors for the most popular documents that might affect the overall quality  of the site. The basic processing module generates only a list of documents by popularity. Log Validator  supports three types of output: raw, mail, and HTML.   Browsers as Development Tools  Although the primary aim of web browsers is to process and render web documents, they can also be  used in development and standardization. Accessibility can be effectively evaluated by turning off style  sheets and nontext content or by applying a text-based browser.   Debugging and Add-ons  There are various built-in debugging features in browsers such as the Developers Tools in Internet  Explorer  Tools   Developer Tools or F12  [35], the Developer Tools in Safari  Edit   Preferences   Show  Developer Menu in menu bar  [36], or the Developer Mode in Opera  View   Developer Tools  [37].    Browsers can also be extended with additional functionality by installing developer plug-ins, many   of which are freely available.   There are numerous add-ons for Firefox that can be useful for developers [38]. For example, HTML   Validator is an extension that adds HTML validation inside Firefox [39]. It clearly indicates the number of  markup errors as an icon in the status bar when browsing. Live HTTP Headers displays HTTP headers of  a page and while browsing [40]. FireFTP is a free, secure, cross-platform  S FTP client for the browser  [41]. The User Agent Switcher extension adds a menu and a toolbar button to switch the user agent of  the browser [42]. The IE Tab extension supports Internet Explorer rendering from IE6 to IE9, which can  be useful for testing purposes [43]. The Web Developer extension adds various web developer tools to a  browser, such as the option to disable certain styles or display CSS by media type [44]. One of the most  comprehensive developer add-ons for Firefox is Firebug [45]. It integrates several development tools to  the browser to directly edit, debug, and monitor HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  Figure 11-7 .    413    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS      Figure 11-7. Firebug in action   Some of these Firefox tools are also available under Chrome  for example, Firebug [46], Web   Developer [47] , and the ones that do not have a Chrome version have their equivalents for Chrome   such as IE Tab [48] . There are many other developer tools under Chrome 49], such as W3C HTML5 &  CSS3 Validator [50], Validity that validates the markup from the address bar  or with hotkeys  [51],  colorPicker [52], XML Tree [53], Resolution Test [54], just to mention a few.   Testing Web Pages in Text Browsers  Testing a web site in text browsers such as Lynx [55] is the best method to check information availability  without styles and graphics3 as well as accessibility. Properly designed web content remains usable in  text browsers  Figure 11-8 , while a large share of web sites do not.                                                     3 Lynx cannot display nontext contents by default, but external programs can be launched from Lynx  such as image viewers or video players.   414    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS      Figure 11-8. Browsing an accessible site in Lynx   View the Source Code  Web browsers provide the option to view the source code of the currently opened web page  usually by  selecting View   Source or Page Source, selecting a similar menu item from the local menu, or pressing  Ctrl Cmd+U or in Safari Ctrl Cmd+Alt+U . This feature can be used to analyze the markup and other  components of the site. Although it can be very useful to learn from other developers, it is crucial to keep  in mind that a large amount of web sites are not standard-compliant and should not be considered as a  reference or best practice.   There is a difference between the copyright of the web site content and that of the markup code that   produces it. As a general rule, code derived from other web pages without permission is not allowed to  be published.   Summary  In this chapter, you learned how to select development tools, independent from the platform of your  preference. By now you should know the vital features that are needed for effective work, such as   415    CHAPTER 11  DEVELOPMENT TOOLS   support for control characters and special characters like the BOM. The most fundamental tool of a web  standardista is an advanced text editor, and a carefully selected combination of software tools can  expedite your web site standardization efforts, both for redesign and for start-from-scratch projects.   After you have acquired the standards, approaches, and knowledge described in the previous  chapters, it is time to apply the theory in practice. In the next chapter, all these things will be used  together in step-by-step guides to improve your standardization skills.   References  1.   2.   3.   4.   5.   6.   7.   8.  9.   10.

Web site standardization is always a complex project, and it  takes into account a variety of needs simultaneously. The list includes, but is not limited to, full standard  compliance; optimal code length; interoperability; meaningful, structured, and accessible content;  adequate metadata; and proper settings. Creating valid code can be learned most efficiently through the  collection of step-by-step guidelines provided in this chapter.   After becoming familiar with web standards, it is time to learn how to create fundamental standard- compliant web site components from scratch in a text editor and extend them for your web pages. Most  XHTML 1.0 Strict code fragments you will learn can be used as the basis for XHTML projects and HTML5  markup for new HTML projects. You will see how to use indentations to create clear, easy-to-maintain  markup and provide the end tags immediately after the opening tags to avoid tags to be missed. The  presented guidelines also demonstrate the proper, logical use of structural elements from paragraphs to  lists and from tables to forms. After mastering the basic structure of lists, tables, objects, and forms, you  will be able to extend, modify, and standardize the corresponding markup elements and never get lost in  the details even if the markup is rather long and complex.1   Choosing the Relevant Standards  In web site standardization, there is no ultimate choice. The browser support and the concerns of  developers are constantly changing. Most developers have at least a notion about W3C  Recommendations; however, there are standards released by other standardization bodies as well, such  as ERCIM, IETF, WaSP, or WSG  as discussed in Chapter 1 . Even developers with a thorough grasp of  standards do not necessarily apply them appropriately.   The choice of standards has a serious impact on each process of web site standardization and future   possibilities. When considering the similarities and differences between the various markup languages  and their variants, the choice should be made before the design and development stage.   Switching Between Standards  It is a common misconception that applying the latest technologies immediately at all costs is the key to  developing modern web sites. In fact, the latest technologies without finalized specification are not  recommended for use. The latest standards  with the W3C status “Recommendation”  should be applied  exclusively, and the Working Drafts, which are subject to change, should not be used. For example, there                                                   1 Each step-by-step guide in this chapter focuses on a certain element or element group and the  corresponding markup elements. The complexity of the markup will increase drastically when adding  additional contents and attributes, but the basic structure always remains the same.   419    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   is no reason to update a web site using valid XHTML markup to XHTML5  not to mention HTML5   unless the new elements introduced in that specification are required on the site. The major reason is  that these technologies are at varying degrees of adoption and standardization. Moreover, web sites  applying these technologies cannot be validated  or validators provide this feature as an experimental  tool only . Users of such web sites might face nonworking components, be prompted to download files  of unknown types, and so on. Functionality and usability are more important than the incorrect use of  the latest, nonfinalized specifications  Figure 12-1 .      Figure 12-1. Modern markup applied incorrectly. What is the point?   On the other hand, web developers should not fall behind if they want to remain competitive.   Additionally, they should keep making their clients or bosses believe in the importance of quality code  and development time, which is often in competition with direct business interests.   Step-by-Step Development  Creating a standard-compliant web site with valid markup, styles, semantic content, and accessible code  should be the preferable way to develop a web site. You can verify whether individual technologies are  standard-compliant by validating the markup, the style sheet, and further components such as the feed  channel during development. However, the full standards compliance of a whole web site is more  complex than that. As discussed throughout this book, full standards compliance covers valid character  encoding  preferably valid UTF-8 , valid HTML or valid XHTML markup  the stricter, the better , valid  CSS, valid RSS or valid Atom news feed, valid RDF, valid metadata, valid XML, valid object embedding,  valid script embedding, WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 conformance, accessibility-friendliness, the  application of Semantic Web technologies, browser- and resolution-independent code, and proper  server settings, just to mention the most important ones.   Starting from Scratch  Typically, you should perform the following core tasks when creating a web site from scratch:      Determine the document type.   420    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER      Create the index.html file. All required elements must be provided, along with the   ones that are highly recommended for structuring.2 As a general rule, the html  element should be used as the root element for all HTML and XHTML documents.  Markup documents should contain a document head  between   and     and a document body  delimited by   and   . Beyond the  general container div and paragraph p used in HTML 4.01 and XHTML, or the  more specific HTML5 structuring elements header, article, and section, the  cohesive parts of web page content should have headings. In  X HTML, there are  six levels of headings: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6  from the largest to the smallest .  Levels should not be skipped  for example, applying h4 in a document in which  there is no h3 but just h1 and h2 .      Multiply files. Carefully applied copying and pasting reduces development time   for hand-coders. It provides integrity throughout the site; however, modifications  should be done on all files if the initial file has been modified. Such modifications  are often easier on dynamic sites, which typically store the identical sections  centrally.      Create the primary style sheet file  for example, main.css  with an initial design for   basic layout, colors, and font styles  they will be updated later . The main  designing concepts should be determined in advance.       Provide optional elements. Which optional elements are reasonable depends on  the project. The various meta elements are recommended in most cases. Several  link elements are also frequently applied including, but not limited to, links to  external files such as the Atom or RSS news feed  atom.xml, rss.xml , the web site  icon  favicon.ico , or optional metadata  metadata.rdf, foaf.rdf, doac.rdf .      Add useful extensions. The number of useful—and free—web site extensions and   APIs is constantly increasing. Some are Google Analytics tracking code   JavaScript , interactive Google Maps for contact details, or the Like and Tweet  buttons for social networking. Although they are popular and used by millions,  most of them are not standardized. The golden rule is that you must be careful to  avoid invalid embedding codes provided by third-party software developers.    Note  This doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice third-party content, because many invalid embedding codes can  be rewritten in a standard-compliant manner.      Do additional tasks depending on client needs.      Set up hosting on a web server.                                                     2 Development tools often provide templates and skeleton documents to begin your work with. Even text  editors have options to insert markup elements, which might be faster than typing.   421    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER      Beyond the simplest static sites, all web sites apply server-side scripting and  applications with prerequisite technology support and configuration. These  depend on the user needs.       Upload and install.          Static files can be directly uploaded to the web server.   Server-side applications usually have some installation files that should be  uploaded to the server. These files can be executed on the server to install  and configure the application.       Share the web site through a domain.   Note that there is no fixed order for these tasks, although some always precede others. Furthermore,   these steps apply for static web pages. If the site relies on server-side scripting, the steps depend on the  type of the system.   Following the basic principles discussed in the next sections can be good starting points for   developing standard-compliant code from scratch. The list of web site components is not complete by  any means. However, most of these samples can be applied in a variety of markup languages and style  sheets and are frequently applied in web site development.    Note  The order of the step orders is a suggestion only.   XHTML  XHTML 1.0 Strict documents can be developed with the following steps. Other XHTML documents can  be authored similarly by applying the desired document type.   1.  Create XML declaration.      2.  Add document type declaration.     <!DOCTYPE html    PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">   3.  Add root element with default namespace and language setting.      <!DOCTYPE html    PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">           422    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   4.  Additional namespaces can also be added upon request.  5.  Add document head and body.     <!DOCTYPE html    PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">                         6.  Add document title.      <!DOCTYPE html    PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         XHTML Document Sample                  7.  Add head content, including metadata, base URI, links, and scripts. Although   they are optional elements, many of them are used frequently. The most  common one of all is the link to an external CSS file:     Create a basic link with the file path or URI. If XHTML syntax is used, self-  closing is required.       Set the link type.                   Identify the link role.       Set the media type  optional .      8.  Head content can be arbitrarily extended upon request, for example with   metadata from external vocabularies such as DC. A typical head section with  highly customized content looks like this:   423    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER      <!DOCTYPE html    PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">               XHTML Document Sample                                                 <meta name="description" content="Contact data of IT pro Dr. Leslie Sikos.  Website  standardization, semantic websites, accessability, professional  photography, videography, multimedia &amp; more."  >             <link rel="alternate" type="application rss+xml" title="Dr. Leslie Sikos IT  professional" href="http:  www.lesliesikos.com sikos.xml"  >                    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" media="all" href="styles sikos.css"  title="Default style"  >      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"  media="handheld" href="styles mobile.css"  title="Styles for mobile devices"  >      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"  media="print" href="styles print.css"  title="Styles for printing"  >                                       9.

Links  Hyperlinks are fundamental elements of web pages that can be developed as follows:   1.  Provide the basic anchor. It can be a URI of an external site such as the   following:           or a path within your site such as the following:          Hyperlinks can also point to a document segment  identified by the id   attribute  with a fragment identifier. Here’s an example:       2.  Set the target  if required . External links are often intended to be opened in a   new window. Here’s an example:       3.  Add a tabbing index to improve accessibility  optional .       4.  Ensure that external links won’t affect the PageRank of your site  optional .           Steps 2 and 4 apply for external links only.   427    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   Images  Images are embedded with the img element. If XHTML syntax is used, self-closing is required. The  location of the image file is determined by the src  source  attribute.   1.  Embed a basic image.      2.  Provide alternate content that can be rendered in case the image cannot be   displayed  fundamental for accessibility .       3.  Provide a text to be displayed when the user moves the mouse over the image    optional . It can be the same as the alternate text or different.   <img src="images logo.png" alt="The logo of Big Profit Company" title="The logo of Big Profit   Company"  >   Lists  List items of both ordered  ol  and unordered lists  ul  are delimited by   and    Listing 12-1 .

List Accessibility  You can improve the accessibility of lists by adding elements such as accesskey and tabindex. Here’s an  example:                      Home                  About                  Gallery                 <a href="shop " title="Webstore of oil paintings" accesskey="s"  tabindex="6">Shop                  Exhibitions                  Contact            429    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   Styling Lists  You can use unordered lists for more sophisticated purposes than simple lists. They are often used to  build menus.3 Typical horizontal menus override the default display style, as shown in Listing 12-3, in  order to render the list items next to instead of below each other.   Listing 12-3. Styling of List Items to Be Displayed Inline   A simple style frequently applied for the hyperlinks of such list items are bottom borders  Listing    li {    display: inline;  }   12-4 .   Listing 12-4. Bottom Border for Menu Hyperlinks   a:hover {    color: 949295;    border-bottom: 1px solid 949295;  }   Naturally, this style is seldom applied globally. Instead, it is extended with the identifier of the list or   its container parent element such as main a:hover or navtabs li a:hover.   A usual technique for creating custom navigation effects is to add a background image to the list   items. Listing 12-5 shows an example.   Listing 12-5. Custom Navigation Effect with a Background Image   li {    background: url 'images navbg.png'  5px no-repeat;    padding-left: 16px;  }   If certain links, such as the first, the last, or the currently selected one, have different styles than all   the others, unique identifiers should be provided for them  Listing 12-6 .   Listing 12-6. More Specific Rules for the First and Last Items                Home         …            Contact               The first ruleset can be styled as shown in Listing 12-7.                                                     3 XHTML 2.0 also provides the more specific element nl for navigation lists.   430    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   Listing 12-7. A Specific Ruleset for the First List Items   li.first {    background: none;    padding-left: 0;  }   If the project is more than just a small web page, these styles should not be applied globally, simply   because these specific styles would be applied to all lists throughout the document, most of which  should be overridden  there would be more styling rules to override than the inherited rules that suit our  needs . Instead, an identifier should be added to the list such as shown in Listing 12-8.   Listing 12-8. An Unordered List Used for Navigation Is Identified to Be Styled Differently                Home          …            Contact            From now on, all styles should begin with navtabs  Listing 12-9 .   Listing 12-9. A Specific Ruleset for Styling the First List Items of the Unordered List navtabs   navtabs li.first {    background: none;    padding-left: 0;  }   Alternatively, the styles can be declared at the container level and use inheritance to style the list.4  This approach is useful when multiple lists are used within the document that have the same styles or  are slightly different only. Such differences can be easily overridden by more specific styling rules.   Additional styles can be declared for access keys and further features. For example, the markup in   Listing 12-10 can be styled with the CSS rules shown in Listing 12-11.   Listing 12-10. A Span Used to Style an Access Key   S i temap   Listing 12-11. CSS Rules for Access Keys   span.ak {    color: red;    background-color: ffffbb;                                                    4 Note that in this case the identifiers should be changed from id to class in the markup and from hash  mark    to period  .  in the CSS.   431    The default bullets can be changed to arbitrary characters or images by CSS. Listing 12-12 shows an   example, which applies to unordered lists such as the one presented in Listing 12-13.   Listing 12-13.

All tables should have an opening and a closing tag.   2.  Table rows should be delimited by   and  . The first row starts like this:                           3.  Table header cells should be written between   and  . Since the desired   table has five columns, five header cell elements are required:                                    4.  A new row should be started for the first row of data cells.                                              5.  Data cells should be provided by td tags. Since the desired table has five   columns, five data cell elements are required for each row.                                                              6.  Since the structure of rows is identical, the table row containing the five data   cells can be copied three times with a simple copy and paste:                                 433    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER                                                                                                               7.  Finally, the cells should be filled with data:                 Model  iPhone  iPhone 3G  iPhone 3GS  iPhone 4                  Preinstalled OS  iPhone OS 1.0  iPhone OS 2.0  iPhone        OS 3.0  iOS 4.0                   Display resolution  480 x 320  480 x 320  480 x 320         960 x 640                  CPU clockrate  620 MHz  620 MHz  833 MHz  1 GHz                  Camera  2 MP  2 MP  3 MP  5 MP  rear ,        0.3 MP  front              Table Accessibility  You can further improve the markup to increase accessibility. Processing and understanding tables can  be challenging for nonvisual browsers. You can use the table header  th  and the caption  caption   markup elements as well as the summary attribute for increasing table accessibility. The first two are  useful for visual browsers too, while the third one is valuable for screen readers.   The table header element th not only adds meaning to the first row but is repeated by screen readers   when each row of the table is read. It helps the visually impaired understand the correlations between  table cells.   While the data provided by the caption element is usually sufficient for small, easy-to-understand   tables, more complex tables might provide a summary attribute  Listing 12-14 . However, the summary   434    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   attribute is considered obsolete in HTML5, where the details element can be used instead.5  Consequently, it is recommended you describe the table structure either in a caption element or in a  figcaption element within a figure element next to or containing the table. Alternatively, tables can also  be described in conventional paragraphs surrounding the table. These methods can also be combined.   Listing 12-14. Table Caption               A comparison table of iPhone models.

Table Styling  Although table headers are usually rendered in bold by most browsers, the default styles of table cells,  padding, and borders are different in each rendering engine, which is inadequate in many cases. All  table features can be styled arbitrarily through CSS rulesets, however. For example, the default value of  the border-collapse property, separate, can be overridden in order to make borders collapse into a  single border whenever possible  Listing 12-15 .   Listing 12-15. Set Borders to Collapse   table {    border-collapse: collapse;  }                                                     5 As of 2011, the details element is not supported properly by browsers yet; thus, it is recommended to  wait for implementations.   435    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   In this case, the border-spacing and empty-cells properties will be ignored. The padding and   border of the header and data cells can be set as shown in Listing 12-16.   Listing 12-16. Padding and Border for Header and Data Cells   Drop-Down Selection Lists  Selection lists can provide options to choose from. Suppose a language selector is needed for a  multilingual web site. It can be developed as follows:   1.  Create a selection list with the select element.   th, td {    padding: 10px;    border: 1px solid 13b141;  }            2.  Add the default option.         English         3.  Add further options. Provide the URIs of each language version as the option   values.          English        Deutsch      Français      Español      本語       4.  To load the appropriate web page, the subdomains provided as the option   values can be used as target URIs through an event handler. Although the use  of the onchange event handler would be logical, it would be inaccessible for  keyboard users. One of the solutions is to provide a button with an onclick  event handler, which is device-independent. For example, the following  function        function goto_URL object  {      window.location.href=object.options[object.selectedIndex].value;    }      436    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   5.  declared in the document head or a linked external file can be used by the   onclick event handler on the input element as follows:                English        Deutsch        Français        Español        本語                 6.  Note that other methods can also be applied such as server-side redirection,   which eliminates the need for JavaScript.   Forms  Basic forms can be created with the following steps:   1.  Create an empty form.            form.            2.  Specify the location of the server-side script used to process data from the   3.  Specify the method to be used for sending data. The form data can be sent as   URL variables  method="get"  or as an HTTP post  method="post" .      The get method appends the form data to the URL as name-value pairs,  which makes it possible to bookmark the result of the form submission.  Because of the length limitations of URLs, however, it cannot be ensured  that all form data will be transferred. Moreover, the get method is  inadequate for transforming sensitive information such as passwords,  because the data will be visible in the address bar of the browser.       The post method sends the form data as an HTTP post transaction. This  method has no size limitations and is more secure than the get method.            4.  Create logical group s  for form elements.       437    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER                                  5.  Add the desired form controls such as text fields  text  and checkboxes    checkbox  and their attributes.                                                                  6.   Improve accessibility. The label element adds a label to a form control. The  legend element assigns a caption to a fieldset. The tabbing order can be set  by tabindex attributes.                Personal data        First name        <input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname" size="15" maxlength="30"   tabindex="12"  >        Last name        <input type="text" name="lastname" id="lastname" size="20" maxlength="50"  tabindex="13"  >                 Main interests               Photography                Videography                Web            438    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   Flash Content  You can embed a Flash file with the general object tag in XHTML as follows:   1.  Declare an application x-shockwave-flash object.       2.  Add the source with cross-browser code.                        4.      3.  Provide attributes such as dimensions and an identifier  if required .   <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="flash header.swf" width="610"   height="224" id="flash">        If the Flash content has a transparent background, it should be declared as an  optional parameter. This is also required for providing the possibility to set  layer order within the web page.   <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="flash header.swf" width="610"    height="224" id="flash">             5. Add alternate content such as a placeholder image and text descriptions to   improve accessibility. If a short description is not adequate, a good practice is  to add a hyperlink to a resource that describes the object.   <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="flash header.swf" width="610"    height="224" id="flash">               <img src="images altheader.jpg" alt="The image alternative for     the Flash header." title="Our headquarters"  >       In  X HTML5, the embed tag should be used instead of object.   6.  Create an embed element. Since the parameters can be provided as attributes of   embed, the self-closing tag can be applied in XHTML5 as follows:       Evidently, the shorthand notation should be omitted in HTML5.   439    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   7.  Add the path or URI of the file. It can be done by using the src attribute instead   of data applied on object elements.       8.  Add dimension and optional parameters.       RSS News Feeds  Creating RSS news feeds generally consists of the following steps:   1.  Create the XML declaration. Since RSS 2.0 news feeds should be valid XML   documents, the first line is the XML declaration:      The character encoding is optional but recommended.   2.  Create the RSS channel. The contents of the RSS channel should be written   within the rss and channel tags as follows:                   If additional namespaces are required, they should be added to the rss element. The widest   interoperability possible can be achieved by providing escaped HTML markup, the creator with Dublin  Core metadata, the update period and frequency defined by the syndication namespace, and the self- link from the Atom vocabulary. The following namespace declarations should be added:   <rss version="2.0"    xmlns:content="http:  purl.org rss 1.0 modules content "    xmlns:dc="http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 "    xmlns:sy="http:  purl.org rss 1.0 modules syndication "    xmlns:atom="http:  www.w3.org 2005 Atom"  >   3.  Provide feed information, including the required title, link, and description   elements, as well as optional elements such as lastBuildDate and language.    John Smith photography    http:   example.com     The news feed of Alaskan photographer John Smith.    Fri, 10 Feb 2012 14:47:00 GMT-0900    en-US    4.  Provide news items. To create a valid RSS 2.0 feed channel with the highest   level of interoperability, each item should have the following elements: title,  link, description, pubDate, and guid.       440    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER      Photo exhibition      http:  example.com events       Fri, 10 Feb 2012 14:47:00 GMT-0900      John Smith      Events      http:  example.com events       Best shots of 2011      <![CDATA[ My photo exhibition   Best shots of 2011  takes place at the  Moose Hotel in Anchorage, AK, USA on 17–18 February 2012. ]]>        This is the section that can be copy and pasted and then modified each time the feed channel is   updated with the latest news. The next news should be provided before the latest one, that is, earlier in  the source code.   5.  Validate.  6.  Share. News feeds are usually used by linking to the XML file that contains  them6. To use the built-in RSS reader of modern browsers, a link should be  provided in the head section of  X HTML documents. Here’s an example:   <link rel="alternate" type="application rss+xml" title="John Smith photography"   href="http:  www.example.com rss.xml"  >   This makes it possible for browsers to recognize that the current web page has an RSS news feed.    Making Web Sites Valid Through Redesign  The stricter the markup, the easier to upgrade to a newer version. However, in certain cases, migrating to  another standard is not feasible without completely rewriting the site. Regarding style sheets, valid CSS  2.1 can be easily extended with CSS3 features in most cases. Still, standardizing an existing site can be a  difficult task.   Generally, there are two possibilities: rewrite the whole site from scratch or manually standardize   each page one by one. Both seem to need much more work than developers can afford. The first  approach often results in broken links. The second approach requires lots of time and work  unless the  site is very small  and can be performed in only a few cases.   The World Wide Web Consortium suggests a solution: carefully selected sections should be updated   systematically [1]. The most frequently served  most popular  documents can be identified by the Log  Validator, which also tries to find n invalid documents among the most popular ones  as discussed in the  previous chapter . Certainly, the whole project is affected by the deadline and the affordable workload.   Summary  In this chapter, you saw a series of step-by-step guides for creating fundamental web site components  from character to character by hand. By learning the semantic use of structural elements, you are now                                                    6 Another option is to retrieve the desired number of channel items with scripting. If you want to publish  the latest news as part of a web page rather than a separate file, you need a script that opens the file,  retrieves the contents of the news feed items, and generates the corresponding markup code.   441    CHAPTER 12  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER   capable of creating meaningful markup with a logical flow and a perfect DOM in the background. The  core elements of XHTML 1.0 Strict can be used in most projects, naturally with or without self-closing  tags  depending on the markup language of your choice . Such carefully created markup code provides a  high level of interoperability and can be rendered in virtually any browser running on any kind of device  without multiple site versions. Even if the CSS styles are disabled, the headings, paragraphs, lists, and  other site components remain legible, and the content is accessible to not only the latest browsers but  also to very old versions and mobile browsers with limited capabilities and standard support.   In the next chapter, you will learn widely used standard-compliant best practices that can be   applied in your daily work.   Thereaux O  2008  Making your web site valid: a step by step guide. World Wide Web Consortium.  www.w3.org QA 2002 09 Step-by-step. Accessed 09 January 2011   References    1.         442    C H A P T E R  13              Best Practices   Beyond optimal markup and styles provided by the appropriate use of web standards, there are  designing conventions that are browser-independent, reliable, and satisfactory, which thus can be  applied as ultimate solutions. Best practices should have top priority in web site development. Although  they change over time, many can be applied for years. It is important to know the techniques that  provide standard-compliant codes and distinguish them from those tricks and hacks that cause  incorrect markup.   By now you should know the major web standards for markup, styles, news feeds, and other web  site components. It is time to learn how to apply these standards in practice, which can be used in the  daily work of any developer. Even standard-compliant web pages do not necessarily provide content in a  meaningful, logical manner; thus, you should learn the purpose of markup elements and CSS properties  to maximize web page quality. The ultimate aim is to find the right combination of structure,  presentation, and behavior and to separate them in order to exploit the benefits of web standards.   Appropriately Used Elements  A vital point in web development is the application of appropriate elements. Always apply the more  specific elements if applicable. Here are some examples:   Tables for tabular data   Floating elements instead of tables for positioned components  very bad practice    Paragraphs instead of separate lines with break rows  very bad practice             Headers instead of general paragraphs           Definition lists for terms and their descriptions instead of general paragraphs     Headers, articles, and sections instead of general div containers  HTML5       The audio and video elements instead of general object embeddings  HTML5    Paragraphs for text paragraphs instead of divisions   Most of these items are gross errors even if the web sites containing them validate.   Content in Logical Order  Even though CSS styling makes it possible to arbitrarily position document sections and elements,  content should be written in a logical order. This approach has the following advantages:   443    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES   Easier development and maintenance         Higher efficiency in text-based browsers      Legible and usable content even without CSS  in case the .css file cannot be  loaded or the style sheets are turned off        Improved accessibility through advanced support for aural browsers and screen  readers that read pages without breaking continuity by default   Reliable Positioning  The Coggins method discussed in Chapter 9 can be extended to position the layer not just horizontally  but also vertically. The “dead center” positioning is a technique that positions a container element to the  very center of the screen, independently from resolution or aspect ratio. It is also browser-independent.  In the case of an 800 × 600 layer, for example, the rules presented in Listing 13-1 can be applied.   Listing 13-1. “Dead Center” Positioning   wrapper {    position: absolute;    left: 50%;    top: 50%;    margin-left: -400px;    margin-top: -300px;    width: 800px;    height: 600px;  }   Certainly, if this technique is used for a logo on a loading screen, a proportion such as 2:3, 1: 3 , or  the Golden Section should be applied by decreasing the top offset to the desired value. You should take  into account, however, that very small images or short text looks completely different on various screens.  Moreover, if the positioned layer is larger than the resolution of the browser window, parts of the  content will be truncated and become inaccessible for some users. Consequently, the positioned layer  should not be larger than the smallest resolution currently used worldwide  which is constantly  increasing . There are several alternate solutions such as resolution detection, media-specific style  sheets  for example, maximized width for mobile devices , or browser-independent design with liquid  layout. The latter one, liquid layout, is ideal in all cases where the design allows content positioning in a  way that it spans the entire page width according to the available space  expands or contracts as  required1 .   Sizes and Proportions  Style sheet validity does not guarantee proper sizes and proportions. The selection of CSS units has a  large impact on the overall appearance of web page components, as well as the usability and readability  of the content.                                                     1 Liquid layout works not only for different resolutions, but also for resized windows on the same  resolution.   444    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES   Lengths in Relative Units  The relative units of CSS  em and % , which are computed with respect to a feature of another element,  should be used for lengths.   The absolute units such as inches, centimeters, points, and pica can be used only if the physical   characteristics of the target media are known. A typical example is a printing option of a web page where  the default output for an official document can be in 12pt Times New Roman with 2.5 cm margins on a  standard-sized paper, such as the North American letter paper  8.5 ×11”  or standard A4 paper  210 × 297  mm, ISO 216 international standard [1] .   Combine Units Properly  The em unit can be used in CSS to provide scalable styles. It is a general unit for measuring lengths such  as page margins or element paddings. It allows developers to specify several CSS properties relative to  the current font size. Consequently, margins declared in this unit stay in proportion even if the user  magnifies the font size.   To ease the calculation of font sizes expressed in em, user experience expert Richard Rutter   introduced a technique that applies a font size of 62.5 percent on the body element  Listing 13-2  [2].   Listing 13-2. The Rutter Method   body {    font-size: 62.5%;  }   Since 62.5 percent of the 16px default size used by many user agent style sheets is 10px, the previous   rule makes the font size of the paragraphs styled by the rule in Listing 13-3 be 12 pixels because  1.2 10  px.   12  =  ⋅   Caution  Although widely implemented, this value is not completely reliable and might be different in some  browsers.    Listing 13-3. Font Size Easily Calculated Using the Rutter Method   p {    font-size: 1.2em;  }   Although em-based sizing could be used to ensure readable font sizes on any screen, this approach  has a known issue. If the user changes the default font size or applies zooming in the browser, the text  might become unreadable. On the other hand, font sizes set in pixels are robust in different  environments but not proportional to other elements and the screen. The larger the resolution, the  smaller the font size. Moreover, the built-in text zoom of browsers cannot be used in all cases for content  with pixel-based font sizes.   445    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES    Note  Because of the differences between browsers, font sizing on the Web is challenging. Absolute positioned  content is not scaled uniformly in all cases by the magnifier feature in IE7+  sometimes they are scaled smaller . IE  supports both zooming and text size changes for fonts set with %, em, or named sizes. In Firefox 2 and older, only  text size changes are supported; however, changing the size of pt and px fonts is also possible beyond the ones  set in %, em, or declared using named sizes. Firefox 3+ supports both zooming and text size changes. Opera 9+  also has a zooming feature. Zooming might give different results under different browsers, depending on the  content and the styles associated with the page.   Embedding External Content Properly  Since the Web is a truly full multimedia platform, web pages often have embedded video clips,  interactive objects, and other external components. Because of the incorrect embedding codes provided  by the content resources, however, additional tasks are required in many cases to make them standard- compliant. Moreover, standardization cannot be performed sometimes because of the inadequate code  provided along with the embedding code. Even if web developers standardize the invalid embedding  code, they cannot correct the associated namespaces, scripts, and other components. A good example is  the classic “Like” box of Facebook2. The namespace and vocabulary provided with the embedding code  generated in the developers’ section on Facebook.com are not consistent. One of the “solutions”  developers use on the Web is to add the incorrect markup section to a JavaScript function such as the  one in Listing 13-4, which writes the markup fragment delimited by apostrophes into the  X HTML  source.3   Listing 13-4. A Widely Used Trick to Embed Invalid Code   document.write '      <fb:like-box href="http:  www.facebook.com pages Your-page 122946805997761" width="280"    show_faces="true" stream="false" header="false"> ' ;   The same fragment gives error messages in validators if it is written directly in the markup. The   iframe version of the button has problems too because it cannot be used in XHTML. It can be rewritten  as an object  with the same parameters , but then it stops working. Users of APIs and third-party  software components often apply the previous trick if they want their web page to validate.     Caution  Providing markup code with document.write in JavaScript is a hack that you should not use. The  same trick is applied for validating virtually any kind of otherwise incorrect markup that definitely cannot be  accepted by real web standardistas even in cases where this markup code validates. It certainly does validate                                                     2 Fortunately, Facebook provides a valid HTML5 embedding code for “Like” buttons and boxes from fall  2011. However, the classic embedding code is still used on many websites.  3 Assuming that JavaScript is enabled   446    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES   because the content written in the external .js file is not considered by the validator. This code is still not valid!  How to provide such content without sacrificing either functionality or validity is an open question in many cases,  though.   Embedding YouTube Videos as Valid XHTML or HTML5  The popular video-sharing portal YouTube offers two types of embedding codes for YouTube videos:   The older-style embed code applies the object element with parameters and an  embed element. It supports Flash playback only.    The new embed code uses an iframe and supports both Flash and HTML5 video  content.   Under each video on YouTube, there is a Share button that provides a link to the current video with   options such as long link, HD link, and declaring a starting position for playback. Below the link area,  there is an Embed button. After clicking it, a text box appears with the selected new-type embedding  code ready for copying to the clipboard. Below that text box there are further options for customizing the  embedding code, such as declaring the size4 or using the old-style embed code.   From the standardization point of view, both versions need some improvement.  In XHTML, the following issues should be addressed:   The embed element contained by the older-style embedding code is invalid in  XHTML.   The iframe element used by the new-style embedding code cannot be used in  XHTML 1.0 Strict or XHTML 1.1  only in XHTML 1.0 Transitional, which should  not be used . Moreover, the data and type attributes should be provided to  maximize interoperability  without them, the embedding will not work under  certain browsers . However, providing the data attribute while preserving the  movie parameter from the suggested embedding code ensures browser- independence, because some rendering engines will use the outer declaration  the  value of the data attribute on the object element , and others will use the inner  declaration  the value of the movie parameter  to identify the URL to retrieve the  video from  similarly to the Flash Satay method used for Flash embedding covered  in Chapter 9 .   In HTML5, the following issues should be addressed:   If you prefer the new-style embedding code, the frameborder and allowscreen  attributes should not be used on the iframe element.   If you want to use the old-style code, the data and type attributes are missing from  the object element. Moreover, the param elements as well as the embed element  should be closed using the shorthand notation rather than the closing tags    and  .   Suppose we want to embed the video with the embedding code presented in Listings 13-5 and 13-6.                                                     4 The size can also be modified arbitrarily later in the markup when using the embedding code.                           447    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES   Listing 13-5. New Embed Code for Example Video Suggested by YouTube   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http:  www.youtube.com embed L2tuL_2Q3vA?rel=0"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>    Listing 13-6.

In XHTML 1.0 Strict, the object  element should be wrapped in a container element such as div or p; otherwise, the code will not validate.   The same code can also be used in HTML5, where the embed element could also be preserved;   however, it can be safely removed: the first two lines ensure browser-independence. In HTML5, the new- style embedding code can also be used. It can be standardized by removing the frameborder and  allowfullscreen attributes  Listing 13-8 .   Listing 13-8. A Standard-Compliant YouTube Embedding in HTML5          Embedding Google Maps as Valid XHTML or HTML5  A popular way of defining the position of offices, restaurants, and so on, is embedding interactive Google  Maps objects.   448    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES   The source code provided by Google Maps is something like Listing 13-9.

In HTML5, the frameborder, scrolling,   marginheight, and marginwidth attributes should be removed  styling should be achieved through CSS .  In XHTML, the embedding code should be modified as follows:                   Since the inline frame element  iframe  cannot be used in XHTML 1.0 Strict and  XHTML 1.1, it should be replaced by the object tag.   The type attribute should be defined with the value text html; otherwise, the map  will not appear even if the code is valid.   The src attribute should be replaced by the data attribute.   The frameborder, scrolling, marginheight, and marginwidth attributes should be  removed.   The object element should be enclosed by a p or div container element.   Styles should be defined by CSS to fit into page design  if the default appearance is  not adequate .   The result should be in the form presented in Listing 13-10.   Listing 13-10.

Semantic Web Best Practices  The Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group at the World Wide Web Consortium  provides documents for authoring semantic web sites [3]. The most important ones are the following:       Image Annotation on the Semantic Web [4]: The document describes the  importance and advantages of image metadata. It provides guidelines for  Semantic Web–based image annotation and use cases. The related RDF and OWL  vocabularies are mentioned, together with an overview of free tools.      Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies [5]: The document provides   RDF Schema and OWL best practices for vocabulary designers.      RDFa Primer—Bridging the Human and Data Webs [6]: Techniques are shown for  providing metadata with RDFa notation, along with techniques that turn existing  human-visible text and links into machine-readable data without repeating  content. There is also a live example for RDFa notation entitled “Alice in Semantic  Wonderland” [7]. It can be used as a starting point for providing image, personal,  and licensing metadata with external vocabularies.      Quick Guide to Publishing a Thesaurus on the Semantic Web [8]: The document   describes how RDF can be used to express the content and structure of a  thesaurus, as well as the associated metadata.      Managing a Vocabulary for the Semantic Web—Best Practice [9]: External   vocabularies that identify, document, and publish vocabulary terms can be cited  and reused in a wide range of applications. However, proper maintenance is  inevitable.    WAI-ARIA Best Practices  The W3C WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide describes best practices for developing rich Internet  applications [10]. Approaches are recommended to create accessible widgets, keyboard navigation, form  properties, drag-and-drop support, relationships, dialog boxes, and reusable component libraries.   Mobile Web Best Practices  More and more users browse the Internet on mobile phones, smartphones, or PDAs with smaller screen  size and resolution, limited bandwidth and capacity, and a less convenient interface than desktop  computers. Web pages optimized for them should be designed and served in the appropriate manner to  provide a reasonable user experience. The specific features of mobile devices, PDAs, and smartphones  should be considered when designing for mobile media [11]. The most important ones are as follows  [12]:   450    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES                       Limited bandwidth: Techniques such as compression, caching, and minimized  data size can contribute to a better mobile user experience. Cookies and  redirections should be eliminated whenever possible.   Limited processing capacity: A large DOM, huge background images, a large  number of scripts, and so on, can increase processing time. As a result, users will  have to wait for relatively long periods of time, which should be avoided. Simple  markup can be provided for mobile devices with XHTML Basic [13]. As for styles,  CSS has a profile dedicated to mobile devices [14].   Limited technology support: Do not rely on scripts, embedded objects, cookies, or  style sheets. Tabular presentation should be minimized. Since mobile browsers  usually support a small set of file types only, download sections should warn users  of files provided in formats poorly supported by mobile devices.   Smaller interface: The automatic sign-in feature and unchanged focus on  dynamically updated pages can make the use of mobile applications more  convenient. Preselected default values should be provided where possible. Default  text entry mode, language, and or input format should be specified [15]. The small  screen size and resolution should be taken into account for sizing and positioning.  Absolute units and pixel measures should be eliminated.       Harder navigation: The simpler the top navigation, the easier to use on mobile   devices. Link targets should be clearly identified. Access keys used for accessibility  might also ease navigation.   Flexibility: If devices are classified, the user experiencecan be boosted  significantly. Providing alternate content for JavaScript is important.      Mobile-specific features: Certain web page components can be exploited more on  mobile devices than on computers. Telephone numbers, for example, should be  provided with a direct calling feature.   Rendering web sites on mobile devices require optimization. Pop-up windows should be completely   eliminated. Graphical components should not be used for spacing. The use of image maps should be  reduced. Bad practices such as frames or table-based layouts that should be avoided can make web  pages unusable on mobile devices   Providing Robustness  Web developers should ensure that the content can be used even if some expected technologies cannot  be used or fail. Some common examples are discussed in the following sections.   Declaring Fallback Generic Fonts  Because of the endless variety of fonts available for computers, it cannot be guaranteed that a special  font exists in each browser. One of the generic font families defined by the CSS specification, that is,  serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy, and monospace [16], should always be specified. Let’s look at an  example of text provided in Gill Sans, which is not available for all users. The rule shown in Listing 13-11  can be applied; it ensures that the document text will be rendered with Gill Sans when available and any  other sans-serif font when not. Depending on the browser and configuration applied, it might be Arial,  Helvetica, or a similar font.   451    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES   Listing 13-11. A Fallback Mechanism for Fonts   body {     font-family: "Gill Sans", sans-serif;  }   Certainly, you can specify further  preferably similar  fonts of the same type as well  Listing 13-12 ,   from which the first available will be applied, but the generic font family declaration will always work.   Listing 13-12. A List of Similar Fonts Preceding the Generic Font Family   body {     font-family: "Gill Sans", "London", "Corinthian", sans-serif;  }   Declarations with Appropriate Specificity  Web developers often have to choose from a variety of settings and options. As a general rule,  declarations should be defined in a way that obtains the desired effect or functionality on the widest  range of devices and settings. For example, the color names reliably supported by CSS are limited to 16  colors  as discussed in Chapter 5 . Although they are known by all browsers and seem developer- friendly, the hexadecimal notation should be preferred because there is no ultimate color list for the  Web. Certain browsers support additional color names, but they are not standardized. There is no  reason to mix the basic color names and other color notations in the CSS. After all, hexadecimal notation  can produce virtually any color.   Testing  Since several web site features cannot be guaranteed by standardization, testing is vital in most cases.   Rendering in Multiple Browsers  Because of the differences of rendering engines, markup, and style, validity cannot ensure proper  rendering under different user agents. Consequently, the legibility and functionality of web sites should  be checked on all major browsers before publishing.5 The more sophisticated the site design, the more  complicated it is to provide similar rendering under different browsers. There are freely available,  browser-independent style sheets that eliminate this time-consuming task. Good examples are the W3C  Core Styles [17].   Readability Without Styles   An advanced method for testing web sites is to render them with the default style sheet of the browser.  Properly structured, logically constructed web documents remain legible without the style sheet s   developed for them. This test is also useful for checking content accessibility.                                                     5 As discussed in the previous chapter, some browsers provide the option to render web pages with  different rendering engines, and there are more and more plug-ins available for testing browser- independence on tabs.    452    CHAPTER 13  BEST PRACTICES   Summary  In this chapter, you learned standardized best practices that should be differentiated from the trends  introduced by enthusiastic content authors and developers. You can safely apply these time-proven  techniques in almost all scenarios and improve the overall web page quality, from code optimality to  robust rendering.  The standard compliance of web sites created using the techniques and standards presented   so far should be approved by validation, which will be described in the next chapter.   References  1.

Similar to natural  languages, they have their own grammar, vocabulary, and syntax that need to be followed. However, just  like the grammar, structural, or spelling errors that occur in documents written in natural languages,  web documents might also have errors in them. Validation is the task of checking the source code of web  documents against a DTD or schema. It contributes to error-free, clean code and increases overall web  page quality.   Even a single character might affect your carefully created standard-compliant code, so it is   important to regularly check your documents. After achieving the necessary routine, you are able to  modify or extend web documents at the source level without destroying standard compliance. In this  chapter, you will learn about the tools that help you locate and correct errors if they occur and can  assure you whether your code is error-free.   Concepts  Markup language grammar rules are defined by Document Type Definitions  DTDs . Prior to  HTML5 XHTML5, developers should have provided a reference to the DTD associated with the  document type being used  as discussed in Chapter 3 .   Web documents can be verified against these rules, which is called validation. The tools used to   perform validation are called validators. Documents successfully passing validation are claimed to be  valid; in other words, they are free of errors and do not contain incorrectly used elements or attributes.  However, validation guarantees neither well-structuredness nor proper element use [1]. A valid  document follows the grammar rules outlined in the corresponding DTD, which makes it possible for  user agents to construct the DOM correctly and render the document accurately.   Applying the grammar rules defined in DTDs is described in technical specifications, most of which   are published by W3C.   Standard conformance is the feature of those web documents that fulfill all the requirements  described by the appropriate DTD and specification. A web document is valid when it is correctly  written in accordance to the formal grammar included in the technical specification of the  corresponding markup language, whereas conformance relates to the entire specification. Since some  conformance requirements, such as the proper use of attribute values, cannot be described by the  formal grammar, validity is only part of conformance. Consequently, validity and conformance might be  identical, but the latter one is a wider term.   Valid documents are written according to the formal grammar of the language being used.   Standard-compliant documents apply the technology the recommended way.   Validation should not be considered as the final step right before publication. Instead, it should be  performed as an essential part of development. If new markup elements or attributes are used in large   455    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   quantities and the developer cannot provide them with 100 percent certainty, validation can help  identify potential errors and prevent invalid markup from being duplicated or multiplied. Even the most  experienced web standardistas might find validation useful and consider it an assistance rather than a  mandatory task. After inserting new structural elements to the source, for example, it can be more than  inconvenient to identify the numerous—and often identical—closing tags  such as four to five or more  consecutive   tags . While finding start tag–end tag pairs is very easy in a file containing 100–200  lines, the task can be overwhelming for larger files.1   No matter how experienced a developer is or how sophisticated development tools are used, errors   are inevitable. This is where validators can help the work of developers. As you will see, validators  provide error locations, along with hints for possible causes and potential solutions.   Since validation contributes to overall web page quality, validators and advanced specific checkers   are also known as web quality assurance tools [2].   Markup Validation  The primary validator for HTML XHTML documents is the W3C Markup Validation Service at  http:  validator.w3.org. In fact, Markup Validation Service v1.1 can be used to validate several types of  markup [3], including the following:      HTML: ISO IEC 15445:2000  “ISO HTML” , HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01   Frameset, HTML 4.01 Transitional, and HTML5   SMIL: SMIL 1.0, SMIL 2.0      MathML: MathML 2.0           XHTML: XHTML Basic 1.0, XHTML Basic 1.1, XHTML 1.0 Frameset, XHTML 1.0  Strict, XHTML 1.0 Transitional, and XHTML 1.1, XHTML Mobile Profile 1.2, and  XHTML Print 1.0   SVG: SVG 1.0, SVG 1.1, SVG 1.1 Basic, SVG 1.1 Tiny      Mixed-namespace documents: XHTML + RDFa2, XHTML 1.1 + MathML 2.0, and   XHTML 1.1 + MathML 2.0 + SVG 1.1   The W3C Markup Validation Service offers three options to validate web documents:     Validation by direct input: Validation of the markup provided in a textbox. The  code can be either typed directly or copied and pasted from an advanced text  editor. This is suitable for testing. Since there is no physical file to validate, neither  character encoding nor server settings can be checked by direct input.      Validation by file uploading: Validation of a file uploaded to a temporary folder.  Character encoding can also be checked. Experienced web standardistas do not  use this option frequently because the file can be uploaded to the host  final  destination  with the same effort  in the case of static files .                                                     1 Even if there are tools that represent the hierarchy with vertical dotted lines between the opening and  closing tag pairs  e.g., Notepad++ .  2 The RDFa notation can be perfectly validated in XHTML documents. As of 2011, the Validator still does  not recognize RDFa in HTML5, however, and gives errors.   456    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION      Validation by URI: Validation of an uploaded version on a web server. This is the   ultimate validation that validates markup, character encoding, and server settings.  It’s ideal for final checking and the validation of web pages developed by others.   The W3C validator supports the following character encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO-8859-1, ISO- 8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6-i, ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-8-i, ISO- 8859-9, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14, ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-16, US-ASCII,  EUC-JP, Shift_JIS, ISO-2022-jp, EUC-kr, gb2312, gb18030, big5, Big5-HKSCS, tis-620, koi8-r, koi8-u, ISO- ir-111, Macintosh, Windows-1250, Windows-1251, Windows-1252, Windows-1253, Windows-1254,  Windows-1255, Windows-1256, and Windows-1257.   Both document type and character encoding are detected automatically and used for validation  accordingly. If detection is not possible, the validator assumes the document type and or character  encoding; however, the results might be unreliable. Properly served standard-compliant web documents  always provide both data; thus, the validator performs validation accurately. The validator can also be  forced manually to use certain document type and or character encoding; however, this feature should  not be used in general cases. It should be considered a fallback mechanism rather than an overriding  feature.   If there are errors in the markup, they are clearly indicated by the red stripe and the number of   errors  Figure 14-1 . Even the favicon of the page becomes a red square.      Figure 14-1. The red stripe and the number of errors and warnings clearly show that the markup is  invalid.   The consecutive errors potential errors are listed under the summary sequentially by default, in  other words, in the order of occurrence  location in the markup . This behavior can be overridden to  group error messages by error type. However, since many errors can cause further ones  such as a  missing closing tag , sequential checking is adequate in most cases.      457    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION    Tip  Because of the high potential of correlation between markup errors, it might be convenient to correct some  errors only  especially if the document is full of errors  and then revalidate the document. The number of errors  might decrease exponentially. Revalidation is also useful for testing implementations of special or new markup  specifications as a direct input.   There are several advanced settings of the Markup Validation Service you can use for your   standardization projects. The  X HTML source code can be displayed with the error messages directly  linking to the corresponding lines. This is a useful feature for developers. The tree structure of document  headings can be visualized by the outline option, which makes it easier to realize which header is missed   if any . Custom 404 error pages sent by the server can be validated by ticking the checkbox “Validate  error pages.” Beyond the concise reports provided by default, more explanations and longer suggestions  can be requested with the Verbose Output option. Another option of the W3C Markup Validation Service  is to correct markup errors using the tool HTML Tidy discussed in Chapter 11.   Beyond the error location, the Markup Validation Service gives hints for corrections and links to the   corresponding specifications and FAQs  Figure 14-2 . Some of the characters might be highlighted,  which is another aid, and sometimes makes the detection of invalid characters very easy.     Figure 14-2. The W3C Markup Validation Service clearly indicates error locations and provides useful  hints for correction.   The markup validation results and suggestions are useful not only for the less experienced  developers but also for experts. Using the line numbers, it is fairly easy to find errors, which is a  prerequisite step for correcting them even for those who do not rely on the correction tips.      458    After the necessary corrections and the final revalidation, the result should look like Figure 14-3.   CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Figure 14-3. The green stripe and the result “Passed” indicate that the markup is valid.    Note  As of 2011, validating HTML5 is still only an experimental feature at the W3C Markup Validation Service.  Consequently, the validator will give a warning  not error!  even if the web page being analyzed is valid. The  validator does not recognize RDFa annotations in HTML5, nor XHTML5 documents.3 Furthermore, in contrast to  valid XHTML documents, the validator does not provide validation badges with hyperlinks for valid HTML5  documents. As will be discussed later, such badges can be downloaded from a separate site.   The W3C Markup Validator is not only free but also open source and available under the W3C   Software License [4]. Anyone is allowed to set up mirrors of the service or contribute to its development.                                                    3 The XML declaration and all namespace declarations provided in XHTML5 result in an error message,  even if they are valid. Moreover, the validation result of XHTML5 documents states HTML5 instead of  XHTML5.      459    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Although there are other markup validators on the Web, such as the WDG HTML Validator [5], or   offline tools such as the Firefox plug-in HTML Validator [6], using the W3C Markup Validation Service is  recommended. It is part of W3C Unicorn, which can be used if styles sheets and feed channels should  also be checked  see later in section “W3C Unicorn” .   Validating markup is more complicated for developers of dynamic web sites since markup   validators generally cannot deal with scripts such as PHP. Checking the dynamically generated  X HTML  output, performing corrections, and revalidating documents are all real challenges. This is one of the  major reasons why dynamically generated web pages are often invalid.   Validating XML  XML documents can be validated for conformance with a DTD, an XML schema, or the schema language  RELAX NG. Syntactic well-formedness is a basic requirement, but it does not guarantee XML validity,  which has several constraints, such as proper use of required and optional elements and attributes,  correct document structure and syntax, and properly applied data types.   Although XML validation and parsing are logically independent tasks, both are often performed by   XML parsers. Considering that even a single error can prevent the document from being parsed or its  tree structure shown, XML parsers of web browsers can always be used as basic XML validators.   XML validity is not required by all XML parsers but by the XML parsers that check the document   against its associated schema.   Batch validation of XML files can be performed by the xmlvalidate task of Apache Ant [7]. For   example, the target in Listing 14-1 validates the .xml files in the directory specified by the dir attribute.4   Listing 14-1. Validating XML with xmlvalidate                                                 Validating RDF XML  RDF documents written in the XML serialization format  RDF XML  can be checked with the W3C RDF  Validation Service at www.w3.org RDF Validator [8]. Validations can be performed by URI or direct input.  The Validator not only checks the RDF code but also represents RDF triples  Figure 14-4 .                                                     4 Relative to the Ant build file   460    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION         461   Figure 14-4. Subject–predicate–object triples retrieved from a valid RDF file   Optionally, the RDF graph can be generated in various formats, including embedded or linked PNG,  SVG, GIF, PostScript, IsaViz ZVTM, HPGL, and HPGL 2. Although the arcs look like hand-drawn curves  and often overlap each other—which is not the most visually appealing representation—the image  output can be useful for demonstrational or designing purposes  Figure 14-5 . It is also important to  keep in mind that there are only very few similar services available on the Web for generating graph  images from RDF.   Figure 14-5. Detail of an RDF graph generated by the W3C RDF Validation Service    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION    Note  In contrast to the raster  PNG  output, the SVG output not only has incomparable quality but also contains  the URIs as hyperlinks.   Optionally, the triples can be displayed in N-Triples format. The colors of nodes, arcs, and text, as   well as font size and orientation, can be set as advanced options.   Validating News Feeds  Since RSS and Atom news feeds should be valid XML documents, care must be taken to provide error- free elements and well-formed XML structure.   The World Wide Web Consortium runs the W3C Feed Validation Service, for Atom and RSS at   http:  validator.w3.org feed  [9]. Similar to other W3C validators, it provides not just validation by  URI but also validation by direct input. After successful validation, the service provides a “valid RSS” or  “valid Atom” logo  depending on the validated feed , an embedding code, and a text link.   The FEED Validator for Atom and RSS and KML at http:  feedvalidator.org can also be used to   validate RSS 2.0 as well as Atom 1.0 feeds [10]. Additionally, it validates elements of the blogChannel, dc,  itunes, mod_admin, mod_syndication, and mod_content5 namespaces.   Validating CSS  Style sheet validations should be performed according to the CSS level being used. Although valid CSS1  style sheets are also valid CSS 2.1 style sheets, some CSS1 rulesets should be written with slightly  different semantics in CSS 2.1 [11]. Since certain CSS2 features are omitted in CSS 2.1, not all CSS2 styles  are valid in CSS 2.1 [12]. Similarly, the new properties introduced in CSS3 are invalid in earlier CSS  versions. Valid CSS style sheets must conform to the grammar rules of the corresponding version and  must contain only at-rules, properties, and property values defined in that specification.   In spite of the relatively wide selection of markup language versions and variants, the document   type to be used for markup validation can be selected automatically in most cases because of the  document type declaration. However, there is no similar mechanism in CSS, and determining the  version of style sheets to be validated is not so straightforward. First, there is no version declaration in  CSS, and second, there is a large overlap between the vocabularies, making automatic version detection  impossible. Hence, the W3C CSS Validation Service at http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator  [13]  validates style sheets against CSS 2.1 by default. However, the profile to be applied can be overridden  manually as an advanced option. For example, if you want to validate a CSS3 file by URI, you should  construct a URI6 similar to the one shown in Listing 14-2.   Listing 14-2. Manual Override for CSS3 Validation   http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator validator?uri=www.example.com styles main.css    &profile=css3&usermedium=all&warning=0&lang=en                                                     5 content:encoded only  6 Naturally, you can select the profile “CSS level 3” from the drop-down list under “More Options.”  However, you need to construct a URI manually if you want to provide a validation link for your CSS3  button, because the default code assumes CSS 2.1.   462    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Similar to the Markup Validation Service, the CSS validator can perform the validation by URI, file   uploading, or direct input. The CSS validator can be used primarily to validate external CSS files, but  internal styles can also be checked. However, in the latter case, the  X HTML document should be  validated first with the Markup Validation Service.   The CSS Validation Service supports CSS1, CSS2, CSS 2.1, and CSS3 style sheets, along with other   document profiles. Media types can be selected manually, including all, aural, Braille, embossed,  handheld, print, projection, screen, TTY, TV, or presentation. The default media type is all. Beyond  errors, the validator might identify warnings as well. Since they might be false positives or the  consequence of errors, warnings can be hidden.   The validation request applies parameters in conjunction with the base URI   http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator validator. The supported parameters are the following:   uri: The URI of the document to be validated. It can be CSS or  X HTML.                               text: The CSS document to validate.   usermedium: The media type used for validation.   output: html  HTML , xhtml  XHTML, default , soap12  SOAP 1.2 , text  plain text .   profile: css1, css2, css21, css3, svg, svgbasic, svgtiny, mobile, atsc-tv, tv, or  none.   lang: The report language such as en  default , fr, it, ko, ja, es, zh-cn, nl, de, it, or  pl.   warning: Warning level with possible values no  hidden warnings , 0  less  warnings , 1 or 2  more warnings . 2 is the default.   The output of the W3C CSS Validation Service is similar to the result page of the W3C markup   validator. A green stripe indicates a valid file, while a red stripe means that the CSS file is invalid.   Validating I18N  The Internationalization Activity Group at the World Wide Web Consortium runs the W3C  Internationalization Checker [14]. The I18N checker can be used to check web pages for  internationalization-friendliness according to the following factors:      Character encoding: HTTP Content-Type, byte-order mark, XML declaration, the   Content-Type metadata, and HTML5 meta charset   Language settings: the lang and xml:lang attributes on the html element, the HTTP  Content-Language, and the content-language metadata   Text direction: ltr  default  or rtl            Request headers: Accept-Language, Accept-Charset   The class and id names: Non-ASCII as well as non-NFC classes and identifiers   463    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Validating Hyperlinks  One of the most disappointing browser experiences is the broken hyperlink  dead link . W3C Link  Checker at http:  validator.w3.org checklink is a useful tool for checking internal and external  hyperlinks of web documents [15]. Linked documents can also be checked recursively throughout a  maximum of 150 documents. URI fragments including a hash mark such as index.htmlabout are  included in the test. Links forbidden by the robots exclusion rules declared in the robots.txt file are not  checked  Figure 14-6 .      Figure 14-6. Link Checker results   Hyperlink validation is useful not only for checking entry points but also for important files such as   style sheet files, scripts, or external URIs that might be modified by their administrators any time  without notification. For example, permanent redirections  HTTP response status code 301  are also  identified by Link Checker, and although they work, such links should be updated. The results can be  useful for eliminating broken links and accessibility barriers associated with links of the analyzed web  page.   Validating Accessibility  Unlike other web site features, accessibility cannot be validated by validators with 100 percent certainty.  While markup errors, such as incorrect element use, missing tags, or structural errors, can be identified  automatically, accessibility is too complex and sophisticated to be validated automatically [16]. Many  potential issues require human decision, checking, or confirmation. The equivalent functionality of  scripts and noscript contents, adequacy of text descriptions, script functionality and effects, visual lists  represented by paragraphs and break rows, and pause options in objects are some of the features that  cannot be checked automatically with full certainty.   Even so, there are useful tools that can make the work of accessibility developers easier [17]. Such  tools should be used throughout the phases of web site development to prevent accessibility barriers,  repair encountered barriers, and improve overall web page quality. The major task of accessibility tools  is to identify accessible-friendly elements and attributes in the markup. Moreover, certain tools can  assist developers in performing those checks that cannot be validated automatically [18]. Accessibility   464    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   tools perform validation against W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines  WCAG 1.0 and or WCAG 2.0  as well  as Section 508.   A typical online accessibility checker is AChecker  http:  achecker.ca [19]  that has been released  by the Inclusive Design Research Centre at the University of Toronto, Canada. AChecker can test web  sites for conformance to various accessibility guidelines, including WCAG 1.0 2.0 Level A AA AAA,  Section 508, Stanca Act, and BITV. The interface provides accessibility checking by either URL or file  upload. It identifies three types of errors: known, likely, and potential problems. Known problems are  claimed to be errors that can be identified with certainty  for example, img element with missing alt  attribute, missing label for the input element . Likely problems need human decisions  for example,  misused elements, onchange event handler on the select element might cause extreme change in  context . Potential problems are often not errors at all; however, they require human decision and  confirmation  for example, dir attribute may be required to identify changes in text direction, data table  may require th elements, script user interface may not be available from the keyboard . Unfortunately,  not every suggestion would validate and some of them are incorrect  for example, the lang attribute on  the html element is neither valid nor required in XHTML+RDFa if the natural language of the document  is identified by the xml:lang attribute   Figure 14-7 .   Figure 14-7. AChecker provides good suggestions; however, not all of them would be valid.   AChecker also supports HTML validation. It provides error descriptions and suggestions for   corrections.   The online accessibility validation tool Cynthia can perform validations by URI according to Section   508 and WCAG 1.0 with all priority levels [20]. Advanced options are also available such as browser  emulation or line exclusions. Reports are clear and useful for developers dealing with accessibility   Figure 14-8 .      465    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Figure 14-8. Detailed accessibility report with explanations and links to W3C guidelines   One of the most comprehensive accessibility tools is WebAIM WAVE [21]. It is a free online tool at   http:  wave.webaim.org that renders web pages with accessibility errors, warnings, and information   Figure 14-9 . It identifies accessible attribute values, inaccessible and potentially inaccessible content  such as Flash or scripts, and device-dependent content such as keyboard traps.            Figure 14-9. Section of an accessible menu rendered by WAVE   While WAVE is a general accessibility tool focusing on markup, there are much more specific tools   as well. For example, there are several free online tools for evaluating the contrast between text color and  background color, such as the Color Contrast Analyzer [22], the Luminosity Color Contrast Ratio  Analyzer [23], or the index of color texts on white background provided by the University of Wisconsin  [24].   It is important to keep in mind that no accessibility tools can perform a complete evaluation by any   With the introduction of new semantic elements in HTML5, care must be taken to apply the latest   The final accessibility test is always a real-life test that involves evaluation performed by people with   means.   checkers available.   disabilities.   466    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Validating Mobile-Friendliness  With the enormous popularity of mobile browsing, it is vital to test your web sites on mobile devices.  However, it is practically infeasible to check web sites on all kinds of mobile devices. Fortunately, the  W3C mobileOK Checker at http:  validator.w3.org mobile  can help you analyze the suitability of  your web pages for mobile browsing [25]. The mobileOK Checker applies the tests defined in the W3C  Recommendation “W3C mobileOK Basic Tests 1.0” [26], categorizes failures, and gives useful error  descriptions  Figure 14-10 .      Figure 14-10. The W3C mobileOK checker gives useful hints when evaluating web site suitability for  mobile browsing.   After correcting the flagged issues, the web site will fulfill the fundamental requirements for   providing a reasonable mobile browsing experience.    Unified Validators  Although individual validators could be used in combination for validating full web sites, in the case of  large projects, it would be inconvenient and slow. Developers can apply unified validators to perform  multiple validations easily and effectively.   467    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   W3C Unicorn  On 27 July 2010, W3C released Unicorn, a unified validator available at  http:  validator.w3.org unicorn  [27] with the slogan “Improve the quality of the Web.” Unicorn is the  ultimate markup, CSS, and news feed validator and mobileOK checker. Validations can be performed by  URI, by file upload, or by direct input individually or simultaneously. The advanced options are identical  to the ones provided by the individual W3C validation services discussed earlier. Unicorn is available in  many languages [28].   Depending on the tests chosen, the output provides information about the validity of the markup,   style sheets, and news feeds, as well as the mobile-friendliness of the web page  Figure 14-11 .    Figure 14-11. The heaven of web standardistas: valid markup, valid style sheet, and valid news feed   Similar to the individual W3C validators, valid documents are indicated by a green stripe, while   invalid documents are indicated by a red stripe. By clicking the stripes, the validation test results can be  collapsed uncollapsed by category  they are uncollapsed by default . On the right side, on each stripe  you can see the number of errors, warning, and information  if any . These numbers are hyperlinks and  can be used to jump to the corresponding section on the page. In case of a valid web page, the validators  provide not only reassuring information but also W3C badges with evaluation links that can be  embedded to your valid web page. In other words, the output of Unicorn is identical to the output of the  separate validators.      468    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Total Validator  Another unified validator is Total Validator, which once was an online service. In contrast, the current  version is available exclusively as a desktop software tool for different platforms [29]. The basic version  can be downloaded free of charge. Total Validator is available for different platforms, including  Windows, OS X, and Linux.7 Total Validator is a small and powerful tool that combines a markup  validator, an accessibility validator, a spell-checker, and a link validator  Figure 14-12 .   Figure 14-12. The configuration interface of Total Validator      This interface is used for starting the process only. After declaring the URI of the web page to   validate, along with the parameters, Total Validator opens a browser window and displays the validation  results. Errors and warnings are shown in the markup code with hyperlinks to the corresponding entries  of the long description after the markup code  Figure 14-13 .                                                    7 The basic tool is Java based and requires Java 1.5 or later.   469    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION      Figure 14-13. Validation results with a segment of the markup code  top  and the long description at the  bottom of the page   Beyond common markup languages such as XHTML 1.0 Strict, XHTML 1.1, and HTML5  and many   older versions , Total Validator also supports HTML + RDFa 1.1, XHTML + RDFa 1.1, HTML5 used as a  polyglot language, and even XHTML5. Accessibility can be checked at all levels of WCAG, as well as  according to Section 508. The spell checker supports American and British English, French, Italian,  Spanish, and German.   Total Validator provides screenshots for analyzing web page appearance in different browsers,   including various versions of Firefox from version 1.5, Internet Explorer from version 5.5, Konqueror 3.5,  Lynx 2.8, Opera, and Safari.   An interesting option is that the validation result can be saved as HTML and opened with a single   click on the button Last Results the next time the tool is executed.   SortSite  A comprehensive commercial validator is SortSite, developed by PowerMapper [30]. Its main features  can be summarized as follows:   Accessibility: Check conformance against WCAG 1.0, WCAG 2.0, and Section 508.         Broken links: Check for broken links and incorrect server configuration.     Compatibility: Check for browser-specific code, scripts, and image formats.     Compliance: Check for compliance with EU and U.S. law.     Markup and styles: HTML, XHTML and CSS validation.        Usability: Check against Usability.gov guidelines.   Search engine optimization: Check Google, Yahoo!, and Bing content guidelines   470    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Extracting Semantic Content  Semantic content of web sites can be checked with the W3C Semantic Data Extractor [31]. It can extract  semantic data such as following:      Generic metadata              Title, author, and description provided in the document head   RDFa metadata embedded in the document body  also generated in  RDF XML      Related resources   Linked files, for example, RSS or Atom news feeds      Glossary, copyright, and bookmarkable points provided in the document head     Outline of the document     Quotes and citations   Menu points and URIs are provided with hyperlinks.  Another comprehensive semantic data extractor tool is the Sindice Web Data Inspector at   http:  inspector.sindice.com [32]. The tool can be used to extract RDF triples from markup, RDF XML,  Turtle, or N3 documents provided either by URI or by direct input. Sindice Web Data Inspector can be  used exclusively for retrieving semantic data  Inspect button  or combined semantic data extraction and  validation  Inspect + Validate button , as well as ontology analysis and reasoning  Figure 14-14 .    Figure 14-14. Comprehensive options on the start screen of Sindice Web Data Inspector      471    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   As a result, the tool provides the full list of subject–predicate–object triples retrieved from the file    Figure 14-15 . The output format can also be changed to N-triples or RDF XML.   Figure 14-15. Semantic data extraction is in progress   The “Sigma” option is a really good demonstration of machine-readable metadata. Software tools   can extract structured data from properly written semantic documents and display them arbitrarily   Figure 14-16 . This is the true essence of the Semantic Web!      472    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Figure 14-16. A personal description extracted from RDF and displayed in a visually appealing manner   A very nice feature of Sindice Web Data Inspector is that a scalable graph can be generated from the   semantic document  Figure 14-17 . The graph not only presents the triples but also provides a quick  summary of the ontologies and vocabularies used in the file.      473    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   474      Figure 14-17. A scalable graph generated from an RDF file   The Sindice Web Data Inspector also has a validation feature with two different options. The first   one, called “RDF syntax validation,” performs an RDF syntax validation according to the W3C  specification. The second option is the “Pedantic validator,” which is a validation over the extracted  triples. In case of a valid document, both validators give the result “Valid document.”   Expressing Validity  Standard conformance of web sites can be expressed easily by the “valid” icons  also known as validity  badges or validity logos . In addition to notifying readers, they can also be used as instant validation links  if used appropriately. The expected hyperlink is listed in the sample code provided by W3C validators  themselves when validating web documents  Figure 14-18 .    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION      Figure 14-18. W3C validation icons with embedding code   Note that the codes are just suggestions. For example, the style attribute on the img element can be  omitted in favor of external CSS rules. The recommended embedding code for XHTML [33] is presented  in Listing 14-3.   Listing 14-3.

In many cases, the version or the Recommendation is also shown.   475    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Figure 14-19. Structure of conventional W3C validity icons      The default size of the icons is 88 × 31 pixels. The World Wide Web Consortium provides two   versions for each icon: a gold one and a blue one. The content author is free to choose which one to use.  The W3C Trademark License as well as the logo and icon usage policies apply to all W3C validity icons.  Modifying icons is not allowed.   The W3C valid logos can be used exclusively on web pages that pass validation. They are designed   for verification. The icons must provide a hyperlink that validates the web page according to the  corresponding W3C technology or standard. Consequently, clicking a correctly set “valid markup  button” should pass the URI of the page to the W3C Markup Validation Service, which gives the same  result page as if the URI was used directly for validation on the validator web page. The same holds for  CSS validation buttons. Consequently, these buttons can also be used by content providers and web  developers to revalidate pages every time they are modified. Experts can use this facility to reassure  themselves about the latest modifications without the need for loading the corresponding validator and  adding the URI manually.   The World Wide Web Consortium does not verify the validity of web pages; thus, it is the developers   and Web authors’ responsibility to ensure consistency and conformance.   The full list of W3C validation icons is listed on the W3C Quality Assurance site [34] and includes the   following:      Markup icons: “HTML 2.0”, “HTML 3.2”, “HTML 4.0”, “HTML 4.01”, “ISO-HTML”   for ISO IEC 15445  legacy missing , “XHTML 1.0”, “XHTML 1.1”, “XHTML Basic  1.0”, “XHTML-Print 1.0”, and “XHTML+RDFa”      CSS icons: A general valid “CSS” icon and more specific icons for “CSS level 1” and   “CSS level 2”      XML icons: “XML 1.0”, “XML 1.1”        MathML icon: “MathML 2.0”   SVG icons: “SVG 1.0”, “SVG 1.1”, “SVG 1.2”, “SVG Tiny 1.1”, and “SVG Tiny 1.2”   The validity icons are also available directly at the W3C Icon Repository  along with other images    [35].   Representing Technologies  Beyond validation, numerous icons are available that represent web technologies used by web sites.  They can express not only underlying technologies but also dedication, initiatives the site developers  agree with, or projects and organizations they sympathize with. They can also be used to proudly  present rarely implemented but advanced features that can hardly be seen on other sites. The most  frequently used W3C technology icons are the following:   476    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   “HTML5 Powered with Semantics”   “HTML5 Powered with Multimedia”   “HTML5 Powered with CSS3 Styling”   “HTML5 Powered with Offline & Storage”   “HTML5 Powered with Connectivity Realtime”   “HTML5”                          Technology names are optional and can be combined  by adding the word “and”  prior to the last technology selected . The badges can be generated with Badge  Builder 5000 in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The HTML5 mark with  or without wordmark, supporting elements, technology classes, and sticker  templates are available as separate SVG and PNG files. The HTML5 logo is also  available as a one-color version. All badges are released with the Creative  Commons Attribution 3.0 License [36].   “HTML5 Powered with Performance & Integration”   “HTML5 Powered with Graphics, 3D, and effects”   “HTML5 Powered with Device Access”   “Made with Cascading Style Sheets”.         Accessibility icons: “WAI-A WCAG 1.0”, “WAI-AA WCAG 1.0”, “WAI-AAA WCAG   1.0” [37], “WAI-A WCAG 2.0”, “WAI-AA WCAG 2.0”, and “WAI-AAA WCAG 2.0” [38].   Semantic Web technology buttons: “GRDDL”, “OWL”, “POWDER”, “RDF”,  “RDFa”, “RIF”, “SKOS”, and “SPARQL” [39].   However, W3C is not the only institution that releases technology icons and logos. Here are some   examples:   “HCARD”, “XFN FRIENDLY”, and icons and logos for other microformats [40]   “Unicode encoded”   “Dublin Core used here”   “Java—Get it now”   “Cynthia tested” [41]   “SEO friendly”   “NO popups, NO spyware”   “Powered by PERL”   PageRank n 10—PRchecker.info  where n is a number between 1 and 10  [42]                                       477    CHAPTER 14  VALIDATION   Summary  In this chapter, you learned that there are powerful, efficient tools to check your web documents for  errors. They can be used during development and are very useful for redesign. Many of these validators  are free tools and are available online. The most commonly used ones are markup validators and CSS  validators, because the markup and style sheets are such fundamental web site components that can be  validated automatically. Validating web site accessibility is a real challenge, because several aspects of  WCAG often require human decision.   The last chapter will enumerate the most common errors that result in invalid markup, style sheets,   news feed channels, and accessibility barriers.

The code is written either manually or  generated automatically, and errors are inevitable. This is also true for server settings. Errors occur in the  markup, in the style sheet, in the XML files, in scripts, and so forth. By analyzing and learning the most  common errors, many of them can be eliminated or at least minimized. As a result, they can be  recognized, localized, and corrected quickly and efficiently.   Even the most carefully created web pages can contain errors. In this chapter, you will learn about   the most common errors and their solutions. It is really beneficial to know them, because they occur  rather frequently, and learning how to correct them will decrease the time required for corrections and  ease your standardization efforts.   Common Serving Errors  One of the most common serving errors is to serve XHTML as text html. For many years, web browsers  handled XHTML markup as if it were HTML. This is known as the “dirty secret of XHTML.” Self-closing  tags and other XHTML specific notations have been ignored, and XHTML documents have been  rendered by SGML parsers instead of XML parsers [1]. As a result, none of the beneficial features of XML  has been used.   In contrast, modern browsers support the proper MIME type. XHTML documents should be served   as application xhtml+xml instead of text html, as discussed in Chapter 4.    Common Markup Errors  Web standardistas should know all the common markup errors in order to easily identify, find, and  correct them. Incorrectly used elements, wrong document structure, incorrectly closed tags, missing alt  attributes, directly provided ampersand characters, ignored case sensitivity, nonunique identifiers, and  misspelled keywords are among the most common markup errors. Many of them are clearly indicated  by markup validators and can be corrected easily. Validators also provide useful hints on the correction.  However, some errors can cause several others. For example, a missing end tag for a division makes not  only the document collapse in the browser but also the nesting to become incorrect. Consequently, it  might happen that an invalid document with 18 errors indicated by a validator has 2–3 errors only. So,  do not be frightened by the initial number of errors!   Incorrectly Used Elements  As a golden rule, extended care must be taken to eliminate unnecessary containers in the markup. For  example, images positioned to the right side of the page with the text “wrapping around” can be styled   481    directly instead of putting them onto floating divisions. Another example is the p tag, which should be  used for a paragraph container and not for carriage return. Look at the  really bad  example shown in  Listing 15-1.   CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS   Listing 15-1. A Practice That Should Never Be Used    This is a very bad practice   dating back to the early days   of the Web   unfortunately it is still in use   even if it has many drawbacks, e.g.,   illogical   hard to identify related content   The technique of omitting end tags should be forgotten. Although it is allowed in HTML, it is not a   clean code and is invalid in XHTML. Beginners with a basic  X HTML knowledge might think that br  elements should be added to the end of each line instead of incorrectly forcing line break with  paragraphs. They are wrong.   Web content should be logical. The first five rows should belong to a paragraph, and the last two  should belong to an unordered list. The previous example should be written as shown in Listing 15-2.   Listing 15-2. The Correct Markup for Listing 15-1    This is a very bad practice dating back to the early days of the Web. Unfortunately it   is still in use even if it has many drawbacks, e.g.,         Illogical      Hard to identify related content       Text width can be set by external style sheets in order to achieve similar  or exactly the same  effect  expected according to the original example. It all depends on the content and the publishing needs. In  this case, the markup in Listing 15-3 with the appropriate style in the external CSS file shown in Listing  15-4 would be a standard solution.   Listing 15-3. A More Advanced Solution         This is a very bad practice dating back to the early days of the Web. Unfortunately it       is still in use even if it has many drawbacks, e.g.,             Illogical        Hard to identify related content            Listing 15-4. CSS Ruleset for Listing 15-3   .thinbox {    width: 400px;    height: 600px;   482    CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS   Incorrect Structure  Incorrectly used elements often offend the DOM model. Required elements should be provided, and  nesting rules should be followed. Moreover, the document structure should be maintained by using  correct containers and elements in the proper manner. Take a look at the code in Listing 15-5.   Listing 15-5. List Items Without Structure or Semantic Meaning  Incorrect    Since the previous rows are items of a list, they evidently should be collected into an unordered list   Listing 15-6. The Correct Markup for Listing 15-5     font-size: 14px;  }   - first item    - second item    - third item      Listing 15-6 .         first item      second item      third item       The default bullets provided by the li elements can be changed in CSS to an arbitrary character or  image  see the section “Styling Lists” . CSS completely separates presentation from structure; thus, any  elements can be arbitrary styled.   Misused Tables  Tableless layout: a Web standardista’s phrase. Tables are for organizing data, not for controlling layout.  For that purpose, div elements should be used instead. Their positions, sizes, colors, layer orders,  transparencies, and many other features can be set via style sheets  Listing 15-8 instead of Listing 15-7 .   Listing 15-7. Fragment of a Misused Table        &nbsp;       Listing 15-8. Correct Structure of Tabular Data in the Markup                Meaningful content in data cell        Content of other data cell            483    CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS   The position of the table is determined by the content elements, text, and images as well as the   container div element. The parameters should be given as CSS rulesets in the external style sheet  associated with the document  see the section “Table Styling” .   Nonoptimal Code Length  Analogously to the “tag soup” discussed in Chapter 1, the more specific “div soup” refers to the misuse  and overuse of divisions  Zeldman calls it divitis [2] .Listing 15-9 shows an example.   Listing 15-9. A Divitis      <div  class="topheadlinesleftalign">The Latest News <div  class="maintextthickborder">         The major problem is that there is no structure at all  even if it might be valid . Unnecessary   divisions should be removed. Moreover, the names are far too long  although descriptive . They should  be kept within reasonable limits.   Remember that in  X HTML5 other elements dedicated to structuring should be used as the main   containers.   Element and Attribute Errors  A gross element error is when elements defined in another specification are used. Elements should be  used according to the document type.   Incorrectly nested elements break the document structure and should be eliminated. The location   and order of elements within  X HTML documents are not arbitrary and should meet the criteria of  nesting rules discussed in Chapter 3.   Both errors can cause the message “document type does not allow element here” in the W3C   Markup Validation Service.   Similar problems are associated with attributes as well. The W3C Markup Validation Service gives  the error “there is no attribute ‘attrib_name’” message. The selection of allowed attributes depends on  the document type being used. For example, several attributes defined in the specification of the  Transitional variant of XHTML are not allowed in Strict XHTML documents, as described in detail in  Chapter 3. Similarly, several HTML attributes are prohibited in XHTML. Styling attributes should be  provided in the CSS rather than the markup. Applying vendor-specific extensions such as marginheight  can also cause similar problems. If an element is undefined, its attributes are considered invalid too.   End Tag Errors  The W3C Markup Validation Service clearly indicates the missing end tags by the message “end tag for  element omitted, but its declaration does not permit this.” Additional  unnecessary  end tags are  identified as “end tag for element which is not open” by the W3C Markup Validation Service.   One of the easiest ways to ensure proper element closing is to write the closing tags immediately   after opening them, such as shown in Listing 15-10.   484    CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS   Listing 15-10. Closing Tag Provided Before Any Child Elements            Element content should not be written until the closing tag is provided. It might seem evident, but   consider that there could be hundreds of code lines between the opening and closing tags. Moreover,  there might be several identical subsequent closing tags whose opening pairs can be difficult to identify  even if indentation is used.   Identifiers  Generally, there are two types of identifiers used in  X HTML markup. Naturally, class identifiers used  mainly for styling multiple elements can be applied several times within the same document—not so  with the id attribute, which should be unique throughout the document  such as a fragment identifier .   Common Style Sheet Errors  Although CSS parsers have a mechanism for handling style sheet errors [3], they should be eliminated by  proper authoring and confirmed by validation. Writing declarations with incorrect properties and  nonexisting property values are among the most common errors in CSS.   Nonexisting Properties  One of the most common CSS errors is the application of nonexisting style properties. The W3C CSS  Validator clearly indicates these errors with the message “Property doesn’t exist.”   CSS name convention differs from the ones used in  X HTML markup. The less experienced might   type a CSS property name that is logical and “should be correct.” For example, the left margin can be set  with the margin-left property, although left-margin  which does not exist  would be more logical. Even  if it seems to be straightforward, the result would be incorrect. If somebody is not familiar with the  whole vocabulary of Cascading Style Sheets, all properties should be checked in the appropriate CSS  specification before applying them. Another good example is a table data cell with vertically centralized  content. In the early days of the Web when many styles were provided on HTML attributes directly, the  valign attribute was used on the td element for that. In CSS, however, there is no property with the  name valign. The corresponding property has a different name: vertical-align.   Nonexisting or Incorrectly Used Property Values  To avoid errors caused by incorrect CSS property values, the allowed values as well as the associated  data types should be known. Additionally, it is very useful to know the initial  default  value. For  example, one of the three attribute values, collapse, separate, or inherit, can be set for the border- collapse property used to set whether table borders are collapsed into a single border or rendered  detached. The ruleset border-collapse: yes; cannot be used, because the attribute value yes would be  illegal. Since this is an inheritable property, a corresponding ruleset is needed only if the inherited value  is not appropriate for our purposes and needs to be overridden  or ensured .   485    CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS   Ignored Inheritance  Redundancy often occurs in badly written CSS. Although such style sheets might even be standard- compliant, they are longer than necessary, use more bandwidth, and are harder to maintain. Code  optimality can be achieved only if inheritance is considered properly. Assume the style rulesets  presented in Listing 15-11.   Listing 15-11. Redundant Rulesets  Should Be Optimized    body {    font-family: Verdana, Arial;    font-size: 1.2em;    color: 351801;  }    p {    font-family: Verdana, Arial;    font-size: 1.2em;    color: 351801;  }    div {    font-family: Verdana, Arial;    font-size: 1.2em;    color: 351801;  }   in Listing 15-12.   body, p, div {    font-family: Verdana, Arial;    font-size: 1.2em;    color: 351801;  }   Listing 15-13. The Correct Solution   body {    font-family: Verdana, Arial;    font-size: 1.2em;    color: 351801;  }   486   The previous rules are obviously redundant. Some developers would write them in the form shown   Listing 15-12. A Better Yet Still Redundant Solution   Since browsers apply the same styles for the child elements  p and div in this example  as defined  for the parent element  body , the code is still redundant and should be written as shown in Listing 15- 13.   In other words, the second and third rulesets of the original example aren’t required and should be  deleted. Note such identical, redundant rules are much more difficult to notice in long CSS files where    CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS   there are tens of other rulesets between them. That’s why it is important to think the major CSS rules  over at the very beginning and later override those rules only where inherited values are not appropriate  for the overall design and layout.   Descendant selectors  also known as contextual selectors [4]  should be used for optimum code   length. Examine the markup shown in Listing 15-14 and CSS rules in Listing 15-15.   Listing 15-14. Standard-Compliant but Nonoptimal Markup  Classitis          The is the main content of the site.      The second paragraph should look like the first one.      In fact, all paragraphs of the document have the same styles.       Listing 15-15. Standard-Compliant but Nonoptimal Styling Rules   .maintext {    margin-left: 15px;    margin-right: 15px;    margin-top: 10px;    margin-bottom: 5px;    font-size: 1.4em;    color: 1d4c90;  }   Although both the markup and the style rules are presented in a standard form, the code is far from   optimal. This kind of class overuse is called classitis [5]. A much shorter, easier to understand, optimal  solution could be the markup presented in Listing 15-16 with the CSS rules shown in Listing 15-17.   Listing 15-16. The Correct Markup for Listing 15-14         The is the main content of the site.      The second paragraph should look like the first one.      In fact, all paragraphs of the document have the same styles.       Listing 15-17. The Optimal CSS Rules   main p {    margin: 10px 15px 5px;    font-size: 1.4em;    color: 1d4c90;  }   If this is not a unique section of the page, the id attribute could be omitted, and the CSS ruleset   could be modified in order to be applied to p elements in general.   Color Errors  CSS validation often results in color warnings that indicate potential problems with foreground and  background colors. For example, if a very light font color is used on a white background, it might be hard   487    CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS   or even impossible to read the content. In such cases, the W3C CSS Validator gives the message “Same  colors for color and background-color in two contexts.”   However, some of these messages can be considered as false positives since there are cases when   visibility is not a problem at all  transparent or overlapping layers, text on background image, and so on .  To be on the safe side, the text must remain readable even if other components of the page  for example,  background image  cannot be downloaded.   Incorrect Locations  Incorrect location errors are typically caused by not properly closed rulesets. They should be checked  one by one near the line indicated by the W3C CSS Validation Service error message “The element can't  appear here in the context CSS 2.1.”   Transparent Backgrounds  Transparent surfaces are becoming more and more popular throughout the Web. The transparency of a  div is usually set as shown in Listing 15-18.   Listing 15-18. A Typical but Nonstandard, Browser-Dependent Ruleset for Transparency   transdiv {    opacity: 0.7;    filter: alpha opacity=70 ;    -moz-opacity: 0.7;    -khtml-opacity: 0.7;  }   In modern browsers it works fine. However, when validating as CSS 2.1, the validator would give   errors. Even in CSS3, only the first one  opacity  is valid, which works in Firefox, Opera, and Safari but  not in IE  which requires the filter property . Thus, validity can be obtained by removing the last three  properties; however, the result won’t work under Internet Explorer and older versions of other browsers.   A valid, cross-browser solution could be the transparent background image such as the one shown   in Listing 15-19.   Listing 15-19. A Transparent PNG Background File Is a Robust Solution   transdiv {    background-image: url 'images transpbg.png' ;    background-repeat: repeat;  }   Miscellaneous Errors  Not all documents can be checked by validators. Incorrect serving or temporary server errors are the  most common reasons. Without providing data required for automatic document type detection or  character encoding detection, validation cannot be performed or provides unreliable results.   488    CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS   Common News Feed Errors  Valid news feed channels should be well-formed and meet all general XML criteria. Even so, some errors  might occur in manually updated news feeds because of human error. One of the most common errors  is an incorrect date. If the publication date is earlier than the date of updating, validators give an error.  This is referred to as an implausible date. Care must be taken to apply the proper offset whose misuse  can lead to the same problem.   Common Script Errors  Scripts are out of the scope of markup validators. Consequently, extended care must be taken to ensure  correctness and proper functionality. It should be ensured that a web page remains usable even if the  scripts cannot be executed for whatever reason. It is important to keep in mind that alternate content  written for scripts cannot be checked by software tools, and their evaluation depends on human  decision.   Common Accessibility Errors  In contrast with markup or CSS errors where errors depend on the language version being used,  accessibility errors are determined by the version and level of guidelines considered. A comprehensive  overview of accessibility errors and their solutions  “Failures of Success Criteria”  is collected in the W3C  group note describing techniques and failures for WCAG 2.0 [6]. The most common accessibility errors  can be summarized as follows:   Lack of structured markup or table layout         User control is missing to stop or pause blinking, scrolling, and automatically   Images that convey important information are embedded through CSS   played sound files or videos   Time limits   Information representation relies exclusively on color, shape, location, or graphics   Inadequate user guidance for forms     Missing captions or labels for sound effects and synchronized media      Difficult navigation and traps          Nonunique identifiers  not only inaccessible but also invalid     Missing alternate content and long description for nontext content and scripts     Functionality that might disturb the user with nonrequested features such as a  new window   Inaccessible custom controls      Text is not legible or clear enough, too small font size, or insufficient contrast  difference between foreground and background colors or images   489    CHAPTER 15  MOST COMMON ERRORS      Missing document title     Missing or inadequate text alternatives such as filenames or placeholder     Missing labels     Whitespace or control spacing used to create multiple columns in plain text or   within words      Automatic form submission without warning     Missing or incorrect tab order declaration     Missing header cells, captions, and summaries in tables        Nonspecific links such as “Click here” or “More”   Pointing device-specific event handlers   Summary  This chapter enumerated the most common errors you might face in your daily work as a web developer.  You are well aware by now how to eliminate them when you develop from scratch and correct them  when you redesign a site.   After thoroughly reading this book, you have learned the importance and benefits of web standards   and techniques for writing valid markup from scratch. You know how to recognize standards and  differentiate them from nonfinalized specifications. You now have all the skills required to provide  meaningful semantics and machine-readable metadata, restrict markup to semantics, and achieve full  standard compliance in your projects.

Anybody with minimal know-how can publish on the Web from anywhere, anytime. This easy  access has allowed billions of web sites to appear on the “network of networks,” in any form. However,  this approach caused serious problems that affect both the present and the future of the Web.   Because of the rapidly growing number of Internet services  beyond WWW , such as Voice over   Internet Protocol  VoIP , IPTV, and instant messaging, the number of users has also been increasing  gradually. Among this growing popularity the need for web development is also increasing. More and  more people want to develop and maintain their own web sites and provide online services, but they are  often reluctant to pay for the services of an IT professional. However, these tasks can be rather complex  and often require much more technical know-how than many people have.   In the era of modern content management systems, many people think that there is no need for  qualified professionals anymore to develop web sites. Although these software tools are good options in  many cases, neither non-IT people nor computer software will ever replace professional web site  developers. However, the possibility exists for everyone to develop and maintain professional-like web  sites on their own with user-friendly software tools. The problem is that these tools often produce  invalid code and don’t follow web standards.   Web developers are constantly pushed to address inconsistency problems of appearance and  behavior of the same site in various rendering engines and browser versions, and this is something that  nonprofessionals generally find very difficult to address. Web standards should be used to completely  eliminate these problems.   Common development approaches do not consider more than just a few basic principles, such   as design and user interface, or the behavior in the most popular browsers. Some developers who read  about emerging technologies try to apply these approaches as soon as possible to compete with other  web studios. Other developers keep using the same technologies, techniques, and practices for as long  as possible even if better technologies and new trends appear. Unfortunately, the proper  implementation of web standards is not a major concern in most cases.   Even though there have been more and more standards for web development and   configuration practices, many of them take years before achieving widespread adoption or are  completely ignored. Some examples are news feeds, SVG, Web Fonts, MathML, the namespace  mechanism, accessibility techniques, and RDFa.   From the standardization point of view, it is not an exaggeration that nearly all web sites  even   the ones that are constantly evolving  apply obsolete technologies and practices and are not optimal.  The growing number of Internet users leads to growing demands for online services, appearance,  presence, and overall functionality. As a result of the new trend of wide-screen monitors, for example,  new resolution and aspect ratio standards have appeared. How can web site developers deal with that?  And how can web content be prepared for both large-resolution monitors and small handheld devices at  the same time? How can the latest Web 3.0 services be provided in a way that they can be used across  most browsers? How can web site appearance and functionality be guaranteed on a variety of platforms?   xix    How can the length of the markup and styling rules be minimized while preserving site information,  functionality, and behavior?   Although there is no ultimate solution for these problems to date, the application of web   recommendations and standards may be the one and only option. Applying new recommendations and  standards provides impressive potential for addressing those issues that make the lives of both web site  developers and Internet users more difficult.   Browsers are capable of ignoring incorrect code blocks and annotations. They are capable of   rendering even incorrect documents by supplying missing end tags. Web browsers keep communication  channels alive because the browsers are extremely error tolerant. Browsers can render not only  standardized documents but also the ones full of errors, which is what makes the Web work. Most  people, however, are prone to forget this fact or simply do not even know about it. Furthermore, many  do not know anything about the issues arising with web site development practices that do not comply  with standards. The needs of Internet users form the Web and introduce the need for new approaches  and constant evolution of new technologies. Before such technologies are standardized, there is no  formal way to implement them. After they are standardized, developers should apply them according to  the corresponding standards. Standard compliance issues considerably affect the daily life of millions of  people around the world. Even if users do not know the real reason why web sites fall apart, contain  unreadable elements, are hard to use, and look completely different in various browsers, or do not work  at all, these problems occur and reoccur.   It is the responsibility of web site developers to create and maintain a better, well-formed Web  for everyone. Similarly, browser vendors should also contribute to standardization by providing proper  standards support in their products.   This book is a comprehensive collection of state-of-the-art information on current and future   standards for the World Wide Web. In fact, it is written to be the most complete reference of web  standardization resources ever published. Since standard compliance is, in many cases, not a  straightforward process, web developers should evaluate numerous standardization issues before  achieving some kind of routine to be able to develop fully functional standard-compliant web sites.  User-friendly descriptions and precise technical documents can also be presented beautifully. After all,  web standardization is not a sacrifice!   Covering all major web standards, this book focuses on syntax, formal grammar, recommended   annotations, and other standardization concerns rather than providing full technology descriptions.   The aim of this book is to provide a guide on standard web site creation for web developers. The   chapters include both theoretical technology discussions and practical sample code for step-by-step  programming. Beyond the basics and the short review of technologies, the book enumerates the most  important practices and resources in standard web site development.    PREFACE      xx
