requires rapid development and  proven results. jQuery UI, a trusted suite of official plugins for the jQuery JavaScript  library, gives you a solid platform on which you can build rich and engaging  interfaces with maximum compatibility, stability, and a minimum of time and effort.  jQuery UI has a series of ready-made, great-looking user interface widgets and   a comprehensive set of core interaction helpers designed to be implemented in   a consistent and developer-friendly way. With all this, the amount of code that   you need to write personally to take a project from conception to completion is  drastically reduced.  Specially revised for version 1.8+ of jQuery UI, this book has been written to  maximize your experience with the library by breaking down each component   and walking you through examples that progressively build upon your knowledge,  taking you from beginner to advanced usage in a series of easy-to-follow steps.  In this book, you'll learn how each component can be initialized in a basic default  implementation and then see how easy it is to customize its appearance and  configure its behavior to tailor it to the requirements of your application. You'll look  at the configuration options and the methods exposed by each component's API to  see how these can be used to bring out the best of the library.  Events play a key role in any modern web application if it is to meet the expected  minimum requirements of interactivity and responsiveness, and each chapter will  show you the custom events fired by the component covered and how these events  can be intercepted and acted upon.   Preface  What this book covers Chapter 1, Introducing jQuery UI, lets you find out exactly what the library is, where  it can be downloaded from, and how the files within it are structured. We also look  at ThemeRoller, which browsers support the library, how it is licensed, and how  the API has been simplified to give the components a consistent and easy-to-use  programming model. Chapter 2, The CSS Framework and Other Utilities, looks in detail at the extensive CSS  framework, which provides a rich environment for integrated theming through  Themeroller, or allows developers to easily supply their own custom themes or  skins. We also cover the new position utility, as well as a whole section dedicated   to writing your own jQuery UI plugins using the widget factory. Chapter 3, Using the Tabs Component, looks at the first widget, which is the tabs  component, a simple but effective means of presenting structured content in an  engaging and interactive widget. Chapter 4, The Accordion Widget, looks at the accordion widget, another component  dedicated to the effective display of content. Highly engaging and interactive, the  accordion makes a valuable addition to any web page and its API is exposed in full  to show exactly how it can be used. Chapter 5, The Dialog, focuses on the dialog widget. The dialog behaves in the same  way as a standard browser alert, but it does so in a much less intrusive and more  visitor-friendly manner. We look at how it can be configured and controlled to  provide maximum benefit and appeal. Chapter 6, The Slider Widget, provides a less commonly used, but no less valuable  user interface tool for collecting input from your visitors. We look closely at its API  throughout this chapter to see the variety of ways in which it can be implemented. Chapter 7, The Datepicker Widget, looks at the date picker. This component packs a  huge amount of functionality into an attractive and highly usable tool, allowing your  visitors to effortlessly select dates. We look at the wide range of configurations that  its API makes possible as well as seeing how easy common tasks such as skinning  and localization are made. Chapter 8, The Progressbar Widget, looks at the progressbar widget, examining its  compact API and seeing a number of ways in which it can be put to good use in   our web applications.  [ 2 ]   Preface  Chapter 9, The Button and Autocomplete Widgets, looks at the brand new button, and  recently revivied autocomplete. Longtime users of the library will remember the  autocomplete from a previous version of the library. The widget is now back, fully  updated to fit in with the latest version of the library and in this chapter we get to   see how it can be used to great effect. Chapter 10, Drag and Drop, begins to look at the low-level interaction helpers,  tackling first the related drag-and-droppable components. We look at how they   can be implemented individually and how they can be used together to enhance  your user interfaces. Chapter 11, The Resizable Component, looks at the resizing component and how it is  used with the dialog widget seen earlier in the book. We see how it can be applied   to any element on the page to allow it be resized in a smooth and attractive way. Chapter 12, The Selectables Component, looks at the selectable component, which allows  us to add behavior to elements on the page and allows them be selected individually  or as a group. We see that this is one component that really brings the desktop and  the browser together as application platforms. Chapter 13, The Sortables Component, looks at the final interaction helper in this  chapter–the sortable component. This is an especially effective component that  allows you to create lists on a page that can be reordered by dragging items to a new  position on the list. This is another component that can really help you to add a high  level of professionalism and interactivity to your site with a minimum of effort. Chapter 14, UI Effects, the last chapter of the book, is dedicated solely to the special  effects that are included with the library. We look at an array of different effects that  allow you to show, hide, move, and jiggle elements in a variety of attractive and  appealing animations.   What you need for this book All you need to work through most of the examples in this book is a simple text or  code editor and a browser. One or two of the more advanced examples rely on PHP,  but for convenience, I've put these examples up on my site for you to use if need be.  You can find them at http:  danwellman.co.uk examples jqueryui .  [ 3 ]   Preface  Who this book is for This book is for front-end developers who need to quickly learn how to use jQuery  UI, or designers who wish to see how jQuery UI functions, behaves, and looks. To  get the most out of this book you should have a good working knowledge of HTML,  CSS, and JavaScript, and should ideally be comfortable using jQuery.  Conventions In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between  different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an  explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text are shown as follows: "When prompted for a location to unpack  the archive to, choose the jqueryui folder that we just created."  A block of code is set as follows:  <link rel="stylesheet"     href="development-bundle themes base jquery.ui.tabs.css"> <link rel="stylesheet"     href="development-bundle themes base jquery.ui.theme.css">  When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the  relevant lines or items are set in bold:  $ ".ui-positioned-element" .position {   of: ".ui-positioning-element",   my: "right bottom",   at: "right bottom" } ;  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on  the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this:   "When we view the page and select the Images tab, after a short delay we should  see six new images".  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  [ 4 ]   Preface  Reader feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[ 6 ]   Introducing jQuery UI  Welcome to jQuery UI 1.8: The User Interface Library for jQuery. This resource aims  to take you from your first steps to an advanced usage of the JavaScript library of   UI widgets and interaction helpers that are built on top of the hugely popular and  easy-to-use jQuery.  jQuery UI extends the underlying jQuery library to provide a suite of rich and  interactive widgets along with code-saving interaction helpers, built to enhance the  user interfaces of your websites and web applications. It's the official UI library for  jQuery and although it is not the only library built on top of jQuery, in my opinion   it is without a doubt the best.  This chapter will cover the following topics:     How to obtain a copy of the library    How to set up a development environment    The structure of the library    ThemeRoller    Browser support    How the library is licensed    The format of the API   Introducing jQuery UI  jQuery has quickly become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in use  today. jQuery UI will definitely become the extension library of choice, thanks to its  ever-growing range of common UI widgets, high levels of configurability, and its  exceptional ease of implementation.  jQuery UI runs on top of jQuery so the syntax used to initialize, configure, and  manipulate the different components is in the same comfortable, easy-to-use style  as jQuery. We automatically get all of the great jQuery functionality at our disposal  as well. The library is also supported by a range of incredibly useful tools, such as  the CSS framework that provides a range of helper CSS classes, and the excellent  ThemeRoller application that allows us to visually create our own custom themes   for the widgets, or choose from a growing library of pre-existing themes.  Over the course of this book, we'll look at each of the existing components that make  up the library. We will also be looking at their configuration options and try out their  methods in order to fully understand how they work and what they are capable of.  By the end of the book, you'll be an expert in its configuration and use.  We already have a basic working knowledge of the components when we add a new  widget or interaction helper, because of the consistency in how we implement the  different components that make up the library. Therefore, we only need to learn any  widget-specific functionality to master the particular component we wish to use.  Downloading the library To obtain a copy of the library, we should visit the download builder at  http:  jqueryui.com download. This tool gives us a range of different options for  building a download package that is tailored for our particular implementational  requirements. The following screenshot shows the download builder:  [ 8 ]   Chapter 1  We can either download the complete current release of the library  version 1.8.9 at  the time of writing , or a complete package of a legacy version. We can also select  just the components that we want and download a custom package.  [ 9 ]   Introducing jQuery UI  This book is specifically tailored towards version 1.8, which  is above of jQuery UI and requires jQuery 1.3.2 or higher. To  support older versions of jQuery, the legacy version 1.7.3 is  also available from the download builder.  The page is laid out in a really friendly and easy-to-use way. It lists all of the  different components in their respective groupings  core, interaction helpers, and  widgets  and allows us to choose from one of 24 different predesigned themes  or no  theme at all . The page also provides information about the package  including both  its compressed and uncompressed size .  We'll look at the different files found within the library in just a moment, but for  now we should download the complete library. It will contain everything we need,  including the JavaScript and CSS files, as well as any images from the current theme  that different components rely on. It even contains the latest version of jQuery itself,  so we don't need to worry about downloading this separately. For now, just use the Stable link at the top of the page. This will give us the default  theme, which is called smoothness. We'll look at downloading and using other  themes in the next chapter.  Hosted Files We don't even need to download the library in order to implement it in  a production web application. Both jQuery and jQuery UI are hosted on  Google and Microsoft's Content Delivery Networks  CDN , so we  can include   elements that link to these files instead of using  local versions. Only the complete library  not individual components  is  available, although there are a range of different releases. On a live site that receives a lot of international traffic, using a CDN will  help ensure that the library files are downloaded to a visitor's computer  from a server that is geographically close to them. This helps in making  the response quicker for them and saving our own bandwidth. This is not  recommended for local development however. Google's CDN can be found at: http:  code.google.com apis  libraries . Microsoft's CDN can be found at: http:  www.asp.net  ajaxlibrary cdn.ashx.  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  Setting up a development environment We'll need a location to unpack the jQuery UI library in order to easily access the  different parts of it within our own files. We should first create a project folder,  into which all of our example files, as well as all of the library and other associated  resources, can be saved.  Create a new directory in your C: drive, or in your home directory, and call it  jqueryui. This will be the root folder of our project and will be the location where  we store all of the example files that we'll make over the course of the book.  The structure of the accompanying code download for this  book will mirror the local environment we are creating.  To unpack the library, open it up in a compression program, such as the open source  7-zip, and choose the extract or unzip command. When prompted for a location to  unpack the archive to, choose the jqueryui folder that we just created.  7-zip can be found at: http:  www.7-zip.org   The code examples that we'll be looking at use other resources, mostly images, but  occasionally some PHP files too. The accompanying code download available on  Packt's website contains all of the images that we'll be using. You should download  this now if you can. Visit: http:  www.packtpub.com support book user- interface-library-for-jquery. You'll need to create a new folder within the  jqueryui project folder and call it img, then unpack all of the images within the  img folder in the archive, to this new folder.  The code download also contains all the examples files as well as the library itself.  These files are provided in the hope that they will be used for reference purposes  only. I'd urge you to follow the examples in the book as you go along, manually  creating each file as it is shown, instead of just referring to the files in the code  download. The best way to learn code is to code.   This is all that we need to do, no additional platforms or applications need to  be installed and nothing needs to be configured or set up. As long as you have  a browser and some kind of code or text editor, everything is in place to begin  developing with the library.  [ 11 ]   Introducing jQuery UI  The structure of the library Let's take a moment to look at the structure of the library once it has been unpacked,  so that we know where to look for specific utilities and files. This will give us a feel  for its composition and structure. Open up the jqueryui folder where we unpacked  the library. The contents of this folder should be as follows:     A css directory    A development-bundle directory    A js directory    An index file  The css folder is used to store the complete CSS framework that comes with the  library. Within this folder will be a directory that has the name of the theme we chose  when building the download package. Inside this is a single file that contains all of  the CSS, and a folder that holds all the images used by the theme. We can also store  the CSS files that we will be creating in this css directory.  The js folder contains minified versions of jQuery and the complete jQuery UI  library, with all components rolled into one file. In a live project, it is the js  and css folders that we'd want to drop into our site.  The index is an HTML file that gives a brief introduction to the library and displays  all of the widgets along with some of the CSS classes. If this is the first time you've  ever used the library, you can take a look at this file to see some of the things that  we'll be working with throughout the course of this book.  The development-bundle directory contains a series of resources to help us develop  with the library. It consists of the following subdirectories:     A demos folder    A docs folder    An external folder    A themes folder    A ui folder  Also present in the directory are the license files, documents showing the version of  the library and its main contributors, and an uncompressed version of jQuery.  The demos folder contains a series of basic examples, showing all of the different  components in action. The docs folder contains API documents for each of the  different components.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  The external folder contains a set of tools that may be of use to developers. They  are as follows:     The bgiframe plugin    The cookie plugin    The unit testing suite qunit  consisting of a JavaScript and a CSS file     The simulate plugin    The metadata plugin used to parse metadata from elements  The bgiframe plugin is used to fix the issue in IE6 where   elements appear  above other content, regardless of z-index. The cookie plugin makes it easy to  use browser cookies. qunit is jQuery's unit testing suite and can be used to run unit  tests on widgets and plugins that we may create. For more information on QUnit,  visit http:  docs.jquery.com QUnit.  The themes folder contains the default theme, or the theme that was selected during  in the download builder. Other themes that we download at a later point or themes  we create ourselves, can also be stored here.  The ui folder contains the individual and uncompressed source files of each of the  different components of the library.  ThemeRoller ThemeRoller is a custom tool written with jQuery and PHP. It allows us to visually  produce our own custom jQuery UI theme and package it up in a convenient and  downloadable archive, which we can drop into our project with no further coding   other than using the style sheet in an HTML   element of course . ThemeRoller was created by Filament Group, Inc. and makes use of a number  of jQuery plugins released into the open source community. It can be found at  http:  ui.jquery.com themeroller. It is due to be updated shortly to coincide  with the 1.9 release of jQuery UI.  [ 13 ]   Introducing jQuery UI  ThemeRoller is certainly the most comprehensive tool available for creating your  own jQuery UI themes. We can very quickly and easily create an entire theme  comprised of all of the styles needed for targeting the different widgets that   make up the library, including the images we'll need.  If you looked at the index.html file a little earlier, then the ThemeRoller landing  page will instantly be familiar, as it shows all of the UI widgets on the page, skinned  with the default smoothness theme. The page features an interactive menu on the left that is used to work with the  application. Each item within the menu expands to give you access to the available  style settings for each part of the widget, such as the content and the clickable areas:  the header and content areas of the widget, and other associated things such as  warnings and error messages.  [ 14 ]   Here we can create our custom theme with ease and see the changes instantly, as  they are applied to the different visible parts of each widget on the page:  Chapter 1  When you're not feeling particularly inspired while creating a theme, there is also  a gallery of pre-configured themes that you can instantly use to generate a fully  configured theme. Aside from convenience, the best thing about these pre-selected  themes is that when you select one, it is loaded into the left menu. Therefore, you   can easily make little tweaks as required.  This is an excellent way to create a visually appealing custom theme that matches the  style of your existing site, and is the recommended method of creating custom skins.  [ 15 ]   Introducing jQuery UI  Installing and using the new theme is as easy as selecting or creating it. The  Download theme button in the above screenshot takes us back to the download  builder, which has the CSS and images for the new theme, integrated into the  download package.  If it's just the new theme we want, we can deselect the actual components and just  download the theme. Once downloaded, the css folder within the downloaded  archive will contain a folder that has the name of the theme. We can simply drag this  folder into our own local css folder, and then link to the style sheet from our pages.  We won't be looking at this tool in much detail throughout the book. We'll be  focusing instead on the style rules that we need to manually override in our own  custom style sheets to generate the desired look of the examples manually.  Component categories There are three types of components found within the jQuery UI library: 1.  Low-level interaction helpers: designed to work primarily with   mouse events.  2.  Widgets: produce visible objects on the page. 3.  Core components: components that other parts of the library rely on.  The core components consist of:  The core file sets up the construct that all components use to function, and adds  some core functionality which is shared by all of the library components, such as  keyboard mappings, parent-scrolling, and a z-index manager. This file isn't designed  to be used standalone, and exposes no functionality that can be used outside of  another component.  The interaction helpers are comprised of the following components:     Core    Widget    Mouse    Position     Draggable    Droppable    Resizable    Selectable    Sortable  [ 16 ]   The higher-level widgets  at the time of writing  include:  Chapter 1     Accordion    Autocomplete    Button    Datepicker    Dialog    Progressbar    Slider    Tabs  The widget factory literally creates the basis for all of the visible widgets exposed by  the library. It implements the shared API common to all widgets, such as the create  and destroy methods, and provides the event callback logic. It also allows us to  create custom jQuery UI widgets which inherit the shared API.  Apart from these components and interaction-helpers, there are also a series of UI  effects that produce different animations or transitions on targeted elements on the  page. These are excellent for adding flair and style to our pages. We'll be looking at  these effects in the final chapter of the book.  The great thing about jQuery UI's simplified API is that once you have learned to use  all of the existing components  as this book will show you , you'll be able to pick up  any new components very quickly. As this book is being written, there are already a  number of new components nearing release, with many more in the pipeline, and all  of these components will automatically be ThemeRoller-ready.  Browser support Like jQuery itself, jQuery UI supports all of the major browsers in use today,  including the following:  IE6, IE7, IE8, and IE9        Firefox 2, Firefox 3, and Firefox 4, and Firefox 5    Opera 9, Opera 10, and Opera 11    Safari 3, Safari 4, and Safari 5    Chrome 1 to Chrome 9  The widgets are built from semantically correct HTML elements generated, as  needed by the components. Therefore, we won't see excessive or unnecessary  elements being created or used.  [ 17 ]   Introducing jQuery UI  Book examples The library is as flexible as standard JavaScript. By this, I mean that there is often  more than one way of doing the same thing, or achieving the same end. For example,  the callback events used in the configuration objects for different components, can  usually take either references to functions or inline anonymous functions, and use  them with equal ease-and-efficiency.  In practice, it is advisable to keep your code as minimal as possible  which jQuery  can really help with anyway . But to make the examples more readable and  understandable, we'll be separating as much of the code as possible into discrete  modules. Therefore, callback functions and configuration objects will be defined  separately from the code that calls or uses them.  To reduce the number of files that we have to create and work with, all of the  JavaScript will go into the host HTML page on which it runs, as opposed to   in separate files. Please keep in mind that this is not advisable for production  websites. When scripts reside within external js files, the browser is able to cache  them for vastly improved loading speeds. When scripts are in the   element  of a page, the browser cannot store them in the cache.  I'd also just like to make it clear that the main aim throughout the course of this  book is to learn how to use the different components that make up jQuery UI. If an  example seems a little convoluted, it may simply be that this is the easiest way to  expose the functionality of a particular method or property, as opposed to a situation  that we would find ourselves coding for in regular implementations.  I'd like to add here that the jQuery UI library is currently undergoing a rapid period  of expansion and development. It is also constantly growing and evolving, with bug  fixes and feature enhancements continually being added. It would be impossible to  keep entirely up-to-date with this aggressive expansion and cover components that  are literally about to be released.  Library licensing Like jQuery, the jQuery UI library is dual licensed under the MIT and GPL open  source licenses. These are both very unrestrictive licenses that allow the creators  of the library to take credit for its production and retain intellectual rights over it,  without preventing us as developers from using the library in any way that we like  on any type of site.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 1  The MIT license explicitly states that users of the software  jQuery UI in this case    are free to use, copy, merge, modify, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell. This  lets us do pretty much whatever we want with the library. The only requirement  imposed by this license is that we must keep the original copyright and warranty  statements intact.  This is an important point to make. You can take the library and do whatever you  like with it. Build applications on top of the library and then sell those applications,  or give them away for free. Put the library in embedded systems like cell phone OS  and sell those. But whatever you do, leave the original text file with John Resig's  name present in it. You may also duplicate it word-for-word in the help files or  documentation of your application.  The MIT license is very lenient, but because it is not copyrighted itself, we are free to  change it. We could therefore demand that users of our software give attribution   to us instead of the jQuery team, or pass off the code as our own.  The GPL license is copyrighted, and offers an additional layer of protection for the  library's creators and the users of our software. jQuery is provided for free and is  open source. The GPL license ensures that it will always remain that way, regardless  of the environment it may end up in, and that the original creators of the library are  given the credit they deserve. Again, the original GPL license file must be available  in some form, within your application or site.  The licenses are not there to restrict us in any way, and are not the same as the kind  of license that comes with software you might purchase and install on your own  computer. In most cases, how the library is licensed will not be a consideration when  using it. Plugin authors, however, will want to ensure that their plugins are released  under a similar license.  API introduction Once you've worked with one of the components from the library, you'll instantly  feel at home when working with any of the other components, since the methods   of each component are called in exactly the same way.  [ 19 ]   Introducing jQuery UI  The API for each component consists of a series of different methods. While these  are all technically methods, it may be useful to categorize them based on their  particular function.  Method type The plugin method  Shared API methods  Specialized methods  Description This method is used to initialize the component and  is simply the name of the component, followed by  parentheses. I will refer to this throughout the book as the  plugin method or widget method. The destroy method can be used with any of the  components, to completely disable the widget being used  and in most cases, returns the underlying HTML to its  original state.  The option method is used by all components to get or set  any configuration option after initialization.  The enable and disable methods are used by most library  components to enable or disable the component.  The widget method, exposed by all widgets, returns a  reference to the current widget. Each component has one or more methods unique to that  particular component that perform specialized functions.  Methods are consistently called throughout each of the different components by  passing the method that we'd like to call, as a simple string to the component's  plugin method, with any arguments that the method accepts passed as strings after  the method name.  For example, to call the destroy method of the accordion component, we would  simply do the following:  $ "someElement" .accordion "destroy" ;  See how easy that was? Every single method exposed by all of the different  components, is called in this same simple way.  Some methods, like standard JavaScript functions, accept arguments that trigger  different behavior in the component. If we wanted to call the disable method on a  particular tab in the tabs widget for example, we would do the following:  $ "someElement" .tabs "disable", 1 ;  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1  The disable method, when used in conjunction with the tabs widget, accepts an  integer, which refers to the index of the individual tab within the widget. Similarly,  to enable the tab again we would use the enable method:  $ "someElement" .tabs "enable", 1 ;  Again, we supply an argument to modify how the method is used. Sometimes the  arguments that are passed to the method vary between components. The accordion  widget, for example, does not enable or disable individual accordion panels, only the  whole widget, so no additional arguments following the method name are required.  The option method is slightly more complex than the other common methods, but  it's also more powerful and is just as easy-to-use. The method is used to either get or  set any configurable option, after the component has been initialized.  To use the option method in getter mode to retrieve the current value of an option,  we could use the following code:  $ "someElement" .accordion "option", "navigation" ;  This code would return the current value of the navigation option of the accordion  widget. So to trigger getter mode, we just supply the option name that we'd like  to retrieve.  In order to use the option method in setter mode instead, we can supply the  option name and the new value as arguments:  $ "someElement" .accordion "option", "navigation", true ;  This code would set the value of the navigation option to true. Note that, an object  literal can also be passed to the option method in order to set several different  options at once, for example:  $ "someElement" .accordion "option", {   navigation: true,   autoHeight: false } ;  As you can see, although the option method gives us the power to both get  and set configuration options, it still retains the same easy-to-use format of the   other methods.  Using jQuery UI feels just like using jQuery and having built up confidence coding  with jQuery, moving on to jQuery UI is the next logical step to take.   [ 21 ]   Introducing jQuery UI  Events and callbacks The API for each component also contains a rich event model that allows us to easily  react to different interactions. Each component exposes its own set of unique custom  events, yet the way in which these events are used is the same, regardless of which  event is used.  We have two ways of working with events in jQuery UI. Each component allows  us to add callback functions that are executed when the specified event is fired, as  values for configuration options. For example, to use the select event of the tabs  widget, which is fired every time a tab is selected, we could use the following code:  var config = {   select: function   {   } };  The name of the event is used as the option name and an anonymous function is  used as the option value. We'll look at all of the individual events that are used  with each component in later chapters.  The other way of working with events is to use jQuery's bind   method. To use  events in this way, we simply specify the name of the component followed by the  name of the event:  $ "someElement" .bind "tabsselect", function   { } ;  Usually, but not always, callback functions used with the bind   method are  executed after the event has been fired, while callbacks specified using configuration  options are executed directly before the event is fired.  The callback functions are called in the context of the DOMElement that triggered  the event. For example, in a tabs widget with several tabs, the select event will  be triggered by the actual tab that is selected, not the tabs widget as a whole.   This is extremely useful to us, because it allows us to associate the event with a  particular tab.  Some of the custom events fired by jQuery UI components are cancellable and if  stopped, can be used to prevent certain actions from taking place. The best example  of this  which we'll look at later in the book  is preventing a dialog widget from  closing, by returning false in the callback function of the beforeclose event:  beforeclose: function   {   if  readyToClose === false  {     return false   }  [ 22 ]   Chapter 1  If the arbitrary condition in this example was not met, false would be returned by  the callback function and the dialog would remain open. This is an excellent and  powerful feature that can give us fine-grained control over each widget's behavior.  Callback arguments Any anonymous functions that we supply as callback functions to the different  events, automatically pass two arguments, the original event object, and an object  containing useful information about the widget. The information contained with   the second object varies between components. We'll look at it in greater detail in   later chapters.  To use these two objects we just specify them as arguments to the function:  select: function e, ui  {   e.target   ui.index }  Every single component will automatically supply these objects to any callback  functions we define.  Summary jQuery UI removes the difficulty of building engaging and effective user interfaces.  It provides a range of components that can quickly and easily be used out of the  box with little configuration. They each expose a comprehensive set of properties  and methods for integration with your pages or applications, if a more complex  configuration is required.  Each component is designed to be efficient, lightweight, and semantically   correct, along with making use of the latest object-oriented features of JavaScript.  When combined with jQuery, it provides an awesome addition to any web  developer's toolkit.  So far, we've seen how the library can be obtained, how your system can be set up to  utilize it, and how the library is structured. We've also looked at how the different  widgets can be themed or customized, how the API simply and consistently exposes  the library's functionality, and the different categories of component.  We've covered some important topics during the course of this chapter, but   now we can get on with using the components of jQuery UI and get down to   some proper coding.  [ 23 ]    The CSS Framework and   Other Utilities  Version 1.7 of jQuery UI was an exciting release because it introduced the  comprehensive new CSS framework. All widgets are effectively and consistently  themed by the framework. There are many helper classes that we can use in our   own code, even if we aren't using any of the library components.  In this chapter we'll be covering the following subjects:   	 The files that make up the framework  	 How to use the classes exposed by the framework  	 How to switch themes quickly and easily  	 Overriding the theme   	 Using the position utility  The files that make up the framework There are two locations within the library's structure where the CSS files that make  the framework reside. They are the following:   	 The css folder: This folder holds the complete CSS framework, including  the theme that was selected when the download package was built. All the  necessary CSS has been placed in a single, lean, and mean style sheet to  minimize HTTP requests in production environments. The CSS file is stored  in a directory, named after the theme selected on the download builder. This version of the framework will contain styles for all the components that  were selected in the download builder, so its size will vary depending on  how much of the library is being used. The full version of each theme weighs  in at 26.7 KB and is not compressed.   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities   	 The themes folder: Another version of the framework exists within the  development-bundle\themes folder. Two themes are provided in this  folder—the base theme and whichever theme that was selected when the  library was downloaded. The base theme is a grey, neutral theme which is  visually identical to smoothness theme. Within each of these theme folders are all the individual files that make up  the framework. Each of the different components of the framework is split  into its own respective files.  Use All the required files for a theme can be linked by  using this file in development. It consists of @import  directives that pull in the ui.base.css and the  ui.theme.css files. This file is used by ui.all.css. It also contains @ import directives that pull in the ui.core.css file,  as well as in each of the widget CSS files. However,  it contains none of the theme styles that control each  widget's appearance. This file provides core framework styles such as the  clear-fix helper and a generic overlay.  These files are the individual source files that control  the layout and basic appearance of each widget.  Component jquery.ui.all.css  jquery.ui.base.css  jquery.ui.core.css  jquery.ui.accordion.css jquery.ui.datepicker.css jquery.ui.dialog.css jquery.ui.progressbar. css jquery.ui.resizable.css jquery.ui.slider.css jquery.ui.tabs.css  jquery.ui.theme.css  This file contains the complete visual theme and  targets of all the visual elements that make up each  widget in the library.  Let's take a look at each of these files in more detail.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  jquery.ui.all.css The jquery.ui.all.css file makes use of CSS imports, using the @import rule to  read in two files—the jquery.ui.base.css file and the jquery.ui.theme.css file.  This is all that is present in the file and all that is needed to implement the complete  framework and the selected theme.  From the two directives found in this file, we can see the separation between the part  of the framework that makes the widgets function and the theme that gives them  their visual appearance.  jquery.ui.base.css The jquery.ui.base.css file also consists of only @import rules, and imports the  jquery.ui.core.css file along with each of the individual widget CSS files. At this  point, I should mention that the resizable component has its own framework file,  along with each of the widgets.  jquery.ui.core.css The jquery.ui.core.css file provides generic styles for the framework that are  used by all components. It contains the following classes:  Class .ui-helper-hidden .ui-helper-hidden- accessible  .ui-helper-reset  Use Hides elements with display:none. Hides elements by clipping them, so that the  element remains fully accessible. The element is  not hidden or positioned off-screen at all.  This is the reset mechanism for jQuery UI  it  doesn't use a separate reset style sheet , which  neutralizes the margins, padding, and other  common default styles applied to common  elements by browsers. For an introduction to  see the importance of resetting default browser  styling, visit: http:  sixrevisions.com  css css-tips css-tip-1-resetting-your- styles-with-css-reset .  [ 27 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  Class .ui-helper-clearfix:after  .ui-helper-clearfix  * html .ui-helper-clearfix  .ui-helper-clearfix  .ui-helper-zfix  .ui-state-disabled  .ui-icon  .ui-widget-overlay  Use These classes provide a cross-browser solution  for automatically clearing floats. Whenever an  element is floated, the .ui-helper-clearfix  class is added to the floated element's container.  The .ui-helper-clearfix:after styles  are added after the parent container  it uses  the content style to insert new content  to  automatically clear the float. The .ui-helper-clearfix styles are applied  to the container itself, and the * hack is used to  target older versions of Internet Explorer. The .ui-helper-zfix class provides rules that  are applied to   elements, in order to fix  z-index issues when overlays are used. This class sets the cursor to default for  disabled elements and uses the !important  directive to ensure that it is not overridden. This rule is the library's method of replacing the  text content of an element with a background  image. The responsibility of setting the  background images for the different icons  found in the library is delegated to the jquery. ui.theme.css file. This class sets the basic style properties of the  overlay that is applied to the page when dialogs  and other modal pop ups are shown. As images  are used by the overlay, some styles for this class  are also found in the theme file.  The core file lays the foundation for the rest of the framework. We can also give  these class names to our own elements, to clear floats or hide elements whenever we  use the library, and especially when building new jQuery UI plugins for consistent  theming with ThemeRoller.  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  The individual component framework files Each widget in the library, as well as the resizable interaction helper, has a  framework file that controls the CSS, which makes the widget function correctly.   For example, the tab headings in the tabs widget must be floated left, in order to  display them as tabs. These framework files set this rule. These styles will need   to be preserved when we are overriding the framework in a custom theme.  These files are brief, with each component using the smallest number of rules  possible for it to function correctly. Generally the files are quite compact  usually   not more than 20 style rules long . The dialog and datepicker source files are  the exception, with each requiring a large number of rules to function correctly   as a pop up.  jquery.ui.theme.css This file will be customized to the theme that was selected or created with  ThemeRoller and it sets all of the visual properties  colors, images, and so on    for the different elements that make up each widget.  Within the jquery.ui.reset.css file, there are many comments that contain  descriptive labels, enclosed within curly braces. These are called placeholders and  the CSS styles that precede them are updated by ThemeRoller automatically when  the theme is generated.  This is the file that will be generated for the complete theme and it contains styles  for all the visible parts of each widget, when creating or selecting a theme using  ThemeRoller. When overriding the framework to create a custom theme, it is mostly  rules in this file that will be overridden.  Each widget is constructed from a set of common elements. For example, the outer  container of each widget has the class named ui-widget, while any content within  the widget will be held in a container with the class named ui-widget-content. It is  this consistent layout and classing convention that makes the framework so effective.  [ 29 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  This is the biggest style sheet used by the framework and contains too many classes  to list here in its entirety  but feel free to open it up at this point and take a look  through it . The following table lists the different categories of classes:  Category Containers Interaction states  Interaction cues  States and images  Use Sets style properties for widget, heading, and content containers. These classes set the default, hover, and active states for any clickable  elements. This category applies visual cues to elements including highlight,  error, disabled, primary, and secondary styles. These classes set the images used for icons displayed in the content  and heading containers, as well as any clickable elements including  default, hover, active, highlight, focus, and error states.  Image positioning All of the icon images used by the theme are stored in a single  file  known as a sprite file , and are displayed individually by  manipulating the background-position properties of the sprite file.  This category sets the background positions for all individual icons. CSS3 is used to give rounded corners to supporting browsers  just  Firefox 3+, Safari 3+, Chrome 1+, Opera 10+, and IE9+ . The image used for the generic overlay defined in the core CSS file  is set here, as it is a class that implements a semi-transparent overlay  over specified elements.  Corner radius  Overlays  The jQuery UI documentation features an extensive overview of the theming API at:  http:  docs.jquery.com UI Theming API.  Linking to the required framework files For rapid theming of all jQuery UI widgets in a development environment, we can  link to all of the individual files using jquery.ui.all.css:  <link rel="stylesheet"    href="development-bundle themes smoothness jquery.ui.all.css">  To use each file individually when testing a component such as the tabs widget for  example, we would use the following   elements:  <link rel="stylesheet"    href="development-bundle themes base jquery.ui.core.css"> <link rel="stylesheet"     href="development-bundle themes base jquery.ui.tabs.css"> <link rel="stylesheet"     href="development-bundle themes base jquery.ui.theme.css">  [ 30 ]   Chapter 2  The CSS resources, when linked to separately, should be added to the HTML page   in the following order—core.css, the widget's CSS file, and the theme.css file.  In a production environment of course, we'd use the super-efficient combined file to  minimize the number of HTTP requests for CSS files. We need to link to the combined  jquery-ui-x.x.x.css style sheet found in the css themename  directory:  <link rel="stylesheet"    href="css smoothness jquery-ui-x.x.x.custom.css">  For easier coding and convenience, we'll be linking to the jquery-ui- 1.8.9.custom.css file in all our examples. If you have unpacked the library as  shown in Chapter 1, Introducing jQuery UI, and the .html files that are stored in the  top-level directory alongside the css, development-bundle, and js directories,  the previous path to the CSS file will be correct. If you are using a different folder  structure, please ensure the path to this CSS file is correct.  Using the framework classes Along with using the framework while we're implementing official jQuery UI  widgets, we can also use it when we're deploying our own custom plugins.  Containers Containers are recommended because it means that widgets or plugins that we write,  will be ThemeRoller-ready and easier for end-developers to theme and customize.  Let's look at how easy it is to use the framework with our own elements.  In your text editor, create a new file and add the following code:                     CSS Framework - Containers           <link rel="stylesheet"         href="development-bundle themes base jquery.ui.all.css">                                This is a .ui-widget-header container           [ 31 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities                   This is a .ui-widget-content container                       Save this page as containers.html within the jqueryui project folder that we  created in Chapter 1, Introducing jQuery UI, when we unpacked the library. We're  linking to the jquery.ui.all.css file from the base development theme in the  library. If we were building a more complex widget, we'd probably want to link   to the jquery.ui.core.css file as well.  Working with this file when creating widgets or plugins is essential, because it lets us  verify that the class names we give our containers will pick up appropriate styling,  and reassures us that they will be ThemeRoller-ready. Any style that we need to  apply ourselves would go into a separate style sheet, like each widget from the  library has its own custom style sheet.  We use only a couple of elements in this example. Our outer container is given the  class name ui-widget. If we were making a custom widget, we'd also want to put  a custom class name on this element. For example, if we were making a content  scroller, we might add the class ui-widget-scroller.  Within the outer container, we have two other containers—one is the ui-widget- heading container and the other is the ui-widget-content container. We also give  these elements variants of the corner-rounding classes—ui-corner-top and  ui-corner-bottom respectively.  Inside the header and content containers, we just have a couple of appropriate  elements that we might want to put in, such as   in the header and   in  the content element. These elements will inherit some rules from their respective  containers, but are not styled directly by the theme file.  When we view this basic page in a browser, we should see that our two container  elements pick up the styles from the theme file as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 32 ]   Interactions Let's look at some more of the framework classes in action. Create the following  new page:  Chapter 2                     CSS Framework - Interaction states           <link rel="stylesheet"         href="development-bundle themes base jquery.ui.all.css">                     <div          class="ui-state-default ui-state-active ui-corner-all">          I am clickable and selected                           I am clickable but not selected                                Save this file as interactions.html in the jqueryui project folder. We've defined  two clickable elements in these examples, which are comprised of a container    and an   element. Both containers are given the class names ui-state-default  and ui-corner-all, but the first is also given the selected state ui-state-active.  This will give our clickable elements the following appearance:  [ 33 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  The CSS framework doesn't provide styles on the :hover CSS pseudo-class, instead  it applies a set of styles using a class name, which is added using JavaScript. To see  this in action before the closing   tag, add the following code:           function $  {     $ ".ui-widget a" .hover function   {       $ this .parent  .addClass "ui-state-hover" ;     }, function   {       $ this .parent  .removeClass "ui-state-hover" ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this variation of the previous example file as interactionsHovers.html.  The version number of jQuery will change as the library continues  to evolve.  Our simple script adds the ui-state-hover class name to a clickable element when  the mouse pointer moves on to it, and then removes it when the mouse pointer  moves off. When we run the page in a browser and hover over the second clickable  element, we should see the ui-state-hover styles:  Icons The framework provides a series of images that we can use as icons. Change the  contents of the ui-widget container in interactionsHovers.html so that it appears  as follows:         [ 34 ]   Chapter 2                   I am clickable and selected                             I am clickable but not selected                Save this as icons.html in the jqueryui directory. In this example, our nested    elements, which have the classes ui-icon and ui-icon-circle-plus, are  given the correct icon from a sprite file:  As you can see, the ui-state-active icon differs slightly from the ui-state- default icon  as well as the ui-state-hover icon . We haven't positioned the icons  at all in this example, because this would necessitate the creation of a new style sheet.  The point of this example is to see how the icons can be automatically added using  the class names from the framework.  Interaction cues Another set of classes we can use is the interaction cues. We will look at another  example using these. In a new page in your text-editor, add the following code:                     CSS Framework - Interaction cues      <link rel="stylesheet"         href="development-bundle themes base jquery.ui.all.css">  [ 35 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities                                         Login Form                                       Username                                                                         Required field                                                          Save this file as cues.html in the jqueryui folder. This time we link to a custom file  jquery.ui.form.css that we'll create in a moment.  On the page, we have the outer widget container, with the class names ui-form and  ui-widget. The ui-form class will be used to pick up our custom styles from the  jquery.ui.form.css style sheet. Within the widget, we have ui-widget-header  and ui-widget-content containers.  Within the content section, we've got a   with a single row of elements, a    element followed by a   element that has the ui-state-error and  ui-corner-all class names hardcoded to it.  Within this   element,we have a standard  , a   with the ui-icon,  and ui-icon-alert classes added along with a   element with the ui-state- error-text class name added to it. Because the   will have child elements that  are floated due to styles we will add in jquery.ui.form.css, we can make use of  the ui-helper-clearfix class to clear the floats, which we add as a class name.  We should now create the custom jquery.ui.form.css style sheet. In a new page in  your text editor, add the following code:  .ui-form { width:470px; margin:0 auto; } .ui-form .ui-widget-header h2 { margin:10px 0 10px 20px; }  [ 36 ]   Chapter 2  .ui-form .ui-widget-content { padding:20px; } .ui-form label, .ui-form input, .ui-form .ui-state-error, .ui-form .ui-icon, .ui-form .ui-state-error p { float:left; } .ui-form label, .ui-state-error p {   font-size:12px; padding:10px 10px 0 0; } .ui-form .ui-state-error { padding:4px; } .ui-form .ui-state-error p {   font-weight:bold; padding-top:5px; } .ui-form .ui-state-error .ui-icon { margin:5px 3px 0 4px; }  Within our jqueryui project folder, there is a folder called css that is used to store  the single-file production version of the framework. All of the CSS files we create  throughout the book will also be saved in here for convenience. Save this file as  jquery.ui.form.css in the css folder.  Imagine we have more forms of elements and a submit button. By adding the   ui-state-error class to the   element, we can use the error classes for form  validation, which upon an unsuccessful submission would show the icon and text.  The following screenshot shows how the page should look:  Switching themes quickly and easily After developing a new widget using the base theme, we may decide that we  want to switch to a fancier theme or one that fits in better with our site when we  deploy it. People might want to use a different theme than the one we chose when  downloading the library, if we wrote and released a new plugin.  [ 37 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  Thankfully, the CSS framework makes switching themes a painless task. Looking  at the previous example, all we need to do to change the skin of the widget is   choose a new theme using ThemeRoller, and then download the new theme  we  can download just the new theme by deselecting all of the components in the  download builder .  Within the downloaded archive, there would be a directory with the name of the  chosen theme, such as dot-luv. We drag the theme folder out of the archive into the  development-bundle\themes folder and link the new theme file from our page,  giving our form a completely new look as shown in the following screenshot:  The theme I used to obtain the this screenshot is dot-luv. We'll be using the  smoothness theme, or themes of our own creation for the remainder of the book.  Overriding the theme Using the ThemeRoller gallery and customization tools, we can generate an  extraordinary number of unique themes. But there may be times when we need a  deeper level of customization than we are able to reach using ThemeRoller; in this  situation we have two options.  We can either create a complete theme file from scratch by ourselves, or we can  create an additional style sheet that overrides only those rules in the jquery. ui.theme.css file that we need. The latter is probably the easiest method and results  in having to write less code.  [ 38 ]   We'll now take a look at this aspect of theming. Switch back to the base theme in the    of cues.html, if you changed it for the previous example. Save the page as  cuesOverridden.html and then create the following new style sheet:  Chapter 2  .ui-corner-all {    -moz-border-radius:0; -webkit-border-radius:0;   border-radius:0; } .ui-widget-header {   font-family:Georgia; background:534741;   border:1px solid 362f2d; color:c7b299; } .ui-form .ui-widget-header h2 {   margin:0; border:1px solid 998675; padding:10px;   font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; } .ui-form .ui-widget-content {    background:c7b299; border:1px solid 362f2d; border-top:0;   padding:0; } .ui-widget-content form {   padding:20px; border:1px solid f3eadf; } .ui-widget-content .ui-state-error {   border:1px solid e7cc17; background:fbf5cd; } .ui-widget-content .ui-state-error-text {    color:e7cc17; padding-left:10px; } .ui-state-error .ui-icon { display:none; }  Save this as overrides.css in the css folder. In this style sheet we're mostly  overriding rules from the jquery.ui.theme.css file. These are simple styles  and we're just changing colors, backgrounds, and borders. Link to this style   sheet by adding the following line of code below the other style sheets in  cuesOverridden.html:     [ 39 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  Our humble form should now appear as in the following screenshot:  As long as we match or exceed the specificity of the selectors used in the  jquery.ui.theme.css file, and as long as our style sheet appears after the  theme file, our rules will take precedence. A long discussion on CSS selector   weight is beyond the scope of this book. However, a brief explanation of   specificity may be beneficial as it is the key to overriding the selected theme.  CSS specificity refers to how specific a CSS selector is—the more specific it is,   the more weight it will have, and will subsequently override other rules that are  applied to the element being targeted by other selectors. For example, consider the  following selectors:  myContainer .bodyText  .bodyText  The first selector is more specific than the second selector, because it not only uses  the class name of the element being targeted, but also the id of its parent container. It  will therefore override the second selector, regardless of whether the second selector  appears after it.  In this example, we have full control over the elements that we're skinning. But  when working with any widgets from the library or with plugins authored by third- parties, a lot of markup could be generated automatically, which we have no control  over  without hacking the actual library files themselves .  [ 40 ]   Therefore, we may need to rely on overriding styles in this way. All we need to  do to find which styles to override, is open up the jquery.ui.theme.css file in a  text editor and take a look at the selectors used there. Failing to do that, we can use  Firebug's CSS viewer to see the rules that we need to override:  Chapter 2  DOM Explorers All modern browsers have DOM explorers and CSS inspectors like  Firebug that can be used to see the order in which CSS rules are  being applied. Using the browser's CSS inspector is usually the most  convenient way of checking CSS order.  [ 41 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  The position utility The position utility is a powerful stand-alone utility that is used to position  any element relative to the window, the document, a specific element, or the   mouse pointer. It is unique among library components, in that it doesn't require  jquery.ui.core.js or jquery.effects.core.js as dependencies.  It exposes no unique or custom methods  other than the position   method  and  fires no events, but it does come with a series of configuration options that allow us  to use it. These options are listed in the following table:  Option at  Format string  collision  string  string  my  of  offset  string  using  function  selector, jQuery, object,  event object  Used to... Specify the edges of the element that is  being positioned against. Formatted as, for  example, left bottom. Move the positioned element to an  alternative position when the positioned  element overflows its container. Specify the edges of the element being  positioned that are expected to be aligned  to the element being positioned against, for  example right top. Specify the element to position against the  positioned element. When a selector or  jQuery object is provided, the first matched  element is used. When an event object is  provided, the pageX and pageY properties  are used Move the positioned element to the  specified number of pixels. Formatted   as, for example, 10, 20 with the value  for the horizontal axis appearing first, then  the vertical. Accepts a function, which actually positions  the positioned element. This function  receives an object containing the top and  left values of the new position.  [ 42 ]   Using the position utility Using the position utility is easy. Let's look at a few examples; create the following  page in your text editor:  Chapter 2                     Position Utility - position                                 I am being positioned against                   I am being positioned                       <script        src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.position.js">                    function $  {         $ ".ui-positioned-element" .position {           of: ".ui-positioning-element"         } ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as position.html. We also use a very basic style sheet in this example  consisting of the following styles:  .ui-positioning-element {   width:200px; height:200px; border:1px solid 000; } .ui-positioned-element {   width:100px; height:100px; border:1px solid ff0000; }  [ 43 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  Save this file in the css folder as position.css. The element that we are positioning  against, as well as the element that we are positioning itself, can be set to either  relative, absolute, or static positioning, without affecting how the positioned  element behaves. If the element we are positioning against is moved using its top,  left, bottom, or right style properties, the element we are positioning will take  account of this and still work correctly.  On the page we just have two   elements: one is what we will be positioning  against, and the other is the actual element we will be positioning. jQuery itself is a  requirement so we link to that at the bottom of the   element, and also we  link to the position utility's source file. As I mentioned earlier, we don't need to link  to the jquery.ui.core.js file when using position by itself.  The minimum configuration we can use, as we have in this example, is to set the of  option, which we use to specify the element we are positioning against. When we set  just this one option, the element we are positioning is placed exactly in the center of  the element we are positioning against, as shown in the following screenshot:  This alone is incredibly useful as the element is not only centered horizontally, but  vertically too.  By using the my and at properties as well, we can place any edge of the positioned  element against any edge of the element we are positioning against. Change the   code within the outer function so that it appears as follows  new altered code is  shown in bold :  $ ".ui-positioned-element" .position {   of: ".ui-positioning-element",   my: "right bottom",   at: "right bottom" } ;  [ 44 ]   The following screenshot shows the output of this code:  Chapter 2  The my option refers to the element that is being positioned. The first part of the  string, which is supplied as the value of this option, is the horizontal axis, and can be  set to left, center, or right. The second part is the vertical axis, and can be set to  top, center, or bottom.  The at option refers to the horizontal and vertical edges of the element being  positioned against. It also accepts a string in the same format as the my  configuration option.  At the time of writing, there appears to be an issue in Webkit browsers  that causes the positioning to be reversed. This is due to the default  value of flip being applied even when no collision occurs. We can  work around this issue by setting the collision option to none  see  the Collision avoidance, section below .  Collision avoidance The position utility has a built-in collision detection system to prevent the element  that is being positioned from overflowing the viewport. There are two different  options that we can use to set what happens when a collision is detected. The   default is flip, which causes the element to flip and align the opposite edges,  of those configured.  [ 45 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  For example, if we position a   element's right edge to align to the left edge of  another element, it will be flipped to have its right edge aligned to the positioning  element's right edge instead, if it overflows the viewport. Change the configuration in  position.html to the following:  $ ".ui-positioned-element" .position {   of: ".ui-positioning-element",   my: "right",   at: "left" } ;  This would result in the following positioning:  The other mode of collision avoidance is fit, which will honor the configured  positioning as much as possible, but adjust the offset, so that the positioned element  stays within the viewport. Configure the collision option as follows:  $ ".ui-positioned-element" .position {   collision: "fit",   of: ".ui-positioning-element",   my: "right",   at: "left", } ;  [ 46 ]   Save this file as positionFit.html. This time, the element is positioned as close as  possible to its intended position:  Chapter 2  We can also set the value of the collision option to none to disable  collision detection entirely, and allow the positioned element to  overflow the viewport.  Positioning with a function We can set the using option to a function, and position the positioned element  manually. Change the configuration so that it appears as follows:  $ ".ui-positioned-element" .position {   of: ".ui-positioning-element",   my: "right bottom",   at: "right bottom",   using: function pos  {     $ this .css {       backgroundColor: "fc7676",       top: pos.top,       left: pos.left     } ;   } } ;  [ 47 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  Save this change as positionFunction.html. We supply an anonymous function as  the value of the using option. This function is passed as a single argument that is an  object containing the properties top and left, which correspond to the values that  the element we are positioning, should be given.  As you can see from this code, we still need to position the element manually, but  the function allows us to do any pre-processing of the element that may be required.  Within the function, the this object is set to the element being positioned.  The widget factory Version 1.8 of jQuery UI split the functionality that allows widgets to be easily  created into a separate and standalone utility file. This is the jquery.ui.widget. js file and we can use it to create our very own jQuery UI plugins with ease. Like  jQuery itself, which provides the fn.extend   method for easily creating plugins,  jQuery UI also provides mechanisms to make plugin creation easier, and to ensure  that the common API functionality is retained in new plugins.  In this section, we'll create a very simple jQuery UI plugin so that we can see the  conventions that should be adhered to and the different features we have at our  disposal. The widget we'll create will be a simple JavaScript calculator. The following  screenshot shows how the calculator will appear once we are finished:  [ 48 ]   Creating the widget We'll start by creating the script file for our plugin; in a new file in your text editor  add the following code:  Chapter 2   function $  {   $.widget "ui.calculator", {     options: {       autoShow: true,       currentSum: []     },     _create: function   {     },     destroy: function   {     },     disable: function   {     },     enable: function   {     },   } ; }  jQuery ;  Save this file as jquery.ui.calculator.js in the js folder. jQuery UI plugins  should always be named using this convention. This is just the shell of our plugin;  we still have to add a good deal of code, but let's look at what we have so far.  jQuery UI plugins should always be encapsulated in a self-executing anonymous  function, which aliases the $ character to ensure that jQuery's noConflict   method  works as intended.  Next we use the $.widget   method to define our plugin. This method accepts  two arguments; the first is the name of our widget, which should always be added  to the ui namespace, and the second is the options prototype, which contains the  properties and methods that make the plugin function.  Plugins should normally have configurable options that the end developer can use to  customise a particular implementation of the plugin. These are defined using the key  options in the second argument to the widget   method. The value of this property  should be an object literal containing the actual options. The widget factory will  handle interacting with the options object; all we need to do is define it.  In this basic example, we have just two configurable options: autoShow, which  determines  or will determine once we have added the code for it  whether the  widget is displayed when the page loads, and currentSum, which starts out as an  empty array.  [ 49 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  The next property of the options prototype has the key _create. This is used to  add an initialisation function for our widget, so that we can build any mark-up  required by the plugin, attach event handlers, or do any other processing that may  be required. The function supplied as the value of _create can only be executed  internally by jQuery UI; it is generally not accessible from outside of the plugin. As  nothing in JavaScript is ever truly private, in the sense that other languages can have  public and private methods, this is not entirely true. But to invoke this code from  outside of our plugin, would require extremely advanced code and is not something  that could be done accidentally.  Any additional functions that we want our plugin to use internally, which should  not be exposed as methods for implementing developers to use, should be prefixed  with an underscore. Any functions we wish to be exposed as useable methods,  should not have an underscore. This makes it incredibly easy to write robust code  that only exposes the functionality that is required to use the plugin.  After the _create function, we have also added destroy, disable, and enable  methods  these will be available for use by developers implementing the plugin .  In order to maintain consistency with the common API exposed by the rest of the  library, we should always define these methods.  The _create function The code we looked at in the previous section forms the shell of the plugin; we'll now  move on to add some more internal functions, and fill out those already defined,  starting with the _create function. Add the following code to the _create function:  _create: function   {   var div = $ " " ,   list = $ "  ", {     "class": "ui-helper-reset ui-helper-clearfix"   } ,   li = $ " ", {     "class": "ui-corner-all ui-state-default"   } ,   a = $ " ", {     href: "",     "class": "ui-calculator-button"   } ,   container = div.clone        .addClass "ui-calculator-container ui-corner-all ui-widget-      content ui-helper-clearfix" ,  [ 50 ]   Chapter 2    display = div.clone        .addClass "ui-corner-all ui-widget-content ui-calculator-      display" .text "0" .appendTo container ,   numberpad = div.clone        .addClass "ui-calculator-numberpad" .appendTo container ,   functionpad = div.clone        .addClass "ui-calculator-functionpad" .appendTo container ,   numberlist = list.clone  .appendTo numberpad ,   functionlist = list.clone  .appendTo functionpad ,   buttons = ["","clear",7,8,9,4,5,6,1,2,3,0,"."],   functions = [" ", "*", "-", "+", "="];   for  var x = 0; x < buttons.length; x++  {     var listitem = li.clone  .appendTo numberlist ,     linky = a.clone  .text buttons[x] .appendTo listitem ;     if x === 0  {       $ " ", {         "class": "ui-calculator-icon ui-icon ui-icon-arrowthick-1-w",         text: "Backspace"       } .appendTo linky ;     } else if  x === 1  buttons[x] === 0  {       linky.addClass "ui-calculator-button-wide" ;     }   }   for  var y = 0; y < functions.length; y++  {     var listitem2 = li.clone  .addClass "ui-state-default"         .appendTo functionlist ,     linky2 = a.clone  .text functions[y] .appendTo listitem2 ;   }   this.element      .addClass "ui-calculator ui-widget ui-helper-reset" ;    this.options.autoShow  ?   container.appendTo this.element  :    container.appendTo this.element .hide  ;   this.element.this "li" .bind {     mouseenter: this._addHoverState,     mouseleave: this._removeHoverState,     click: this._buttonClick   } ; },  We start out by defining a series of variables. The first four variables are a series of  elements that we create and then use to build the mark-up required by the widget  including a  , a  , an  , and an  . We add any general attributes that  will be required each time we make use of one of these base elements, such as class  names, or in the case of the anchor, an href.  [ 51 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  The next six variables are the actual elements that are used to build the widget,  which are created by cloning our base elements and augmenting them with  additional class names that are required for theming purposes.  Once created, these elements are appended to each other to form the required DOM  structure, although they aren't yet added to the page. We also define two arrays here,  where each contains the different labels that will be used for the calculator buttons.  Next, we use a for loop to build the buttons contained in the buttonpad container.  The buttons are built from   elements, wrapped in   elements. Some of these  buttons will not be number buttons, such as the backspace and clear buttons. The  backspace button has an extra   element added to it, which will be used to  show an icon  a back-arrow . This is the first item in the buttons array.  The clear and 0 buttons are wider than the rest of the buttons. We know that the  clear label is the second item in the buttons array, so we can detect this using the  array index 1. The 0 button is checked by looking at the actual array value, to see  if it is 0.  When either of these conditions are met, we add the class ui-calculator-button- wide  normal buttons have the class name ui-calculator-button added to them   to the newly created   element.   The custom class names used by our plugin are in the same format as  other class names used by jQuery UI for consistency.  We then use another for loop to create the function buttons  division, multiplication,  and so on , and append them to the second container within the calculator. This time,  none of the buttons have additional elements or special class names added to them,  so we don't need a conditional if statement.  Within the functions we define, the this object is scoped to our plugin. jQuery UI  adds two special properties to the this object for us: the first is called element and  points to the actual element that the plugin method is called on, the second is called  options and refers to the options configuration object that we defined at the start  of the plugin.  We use this.element to add some class names to the element when the plugin  method is called on. We then check the autoShow option within our options object;  if the option is set to its default value of true, we simply append our widget to the  page. If it is set to false, we still append it, but hide it straight away.  [ 52 ]   The last thing we do in our _create function is attach some event handlers to the    elements within the widget. We haven't added the event-handling functions  yet, but when we do, these will be added to the widget, so we can access them via  the this object. As the event handling functions should not be directly accessible to  implementing developers, we prefix them with an underscore.  Chapter 2  The common API methods Next, we can add the code that will make the common API methods, destroy,  disable, and enable, function correctly:  destroy: function   {   $.Widget.prototype.destroy.call this, arguments ;   this.element      .removeClass "ui-calculator ui-widget ui-helper-reset" ;   this.element.find "li" .unbind  ;   this.element.children ":first" .remove  ; }, disable: function   {   $.Widget.prototype.disable.call this, arguments ;   this.element.find "li" .unbind  ; }, enable: function   {   $.Widget.prototype.enable.call this, arguments ;   this.element.find "li" .bind {     mouseenter: this._addHoverState,     mouseleave: this._removeHoverState,     click: this._buttonClick   } ; },  All of these functions follow a common format, with jQuery UI doing most of   the heavy lifting for us. The widget factory already defines these methods for us;   all we need to do is call the original method defined by the widget factory using   the JavaScript call   function. The original method can be accessed through the  widget prototype using the name of the method we wish to call, appended to  $.Widget.prototype. We then provide any additional code, specific to our plugin.  In our destroy function, we remove the class names we added to the element  our plugin   method is called on, unbind the event handlers we attached, and  then remove the DOM structure we created. This is done to tidy-up after our   plugin, which other plugins do, and to prevent memory leaks in the case of older  versions of IE.  [ 53 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  In our disable function, we again call the widget factory's original disable  function, and then simply unbind the handlers we attached to stop the over-states  and clicks working on the buttons, while the widget is disabled.  In our enable function, we again call the widget factory's original enable   method  and then re-attach our event handlers.  Adding custom methods As we've provided the autoShow option, so that the widget can be appended to the  page but not shown immediately, we should provide a method that can be used  to show the widget when required. Add the following function directly after the  enable   method:  show: function   {   var el = this.element.children ":first" ;   if  el.is ":hidden"   {     el.show  ;   }   this._trigger "show", null, this.element ; },  Our method is stored with the key show, so developers can use this in the same way  as the standard API methods we have already defined, for example, $ "el" . calculator "show" . All we need to do in this function is find the first child of the  outer element that the widget is appended to, and show it if it is currently hidden.  Once we have shown the calculator, we then trigger a custom event. This makes   it useful for developers using our widget to hook into key interaction points.   The _trigger   method accepts three arguments: the first is for the event we  are triggering, the second is for the original browser event object  which we   don't need to use in this implementation because it is a custom event and hence,  there is no browser event for it , and the third is a reference to the element stored   in this.element, which is the element that the main widget method is called on.  Even in custom methods, the this object is still scoped to our widget instance. Note  that this can be any hash of key value pairs we wish to pass to the handler function  that a developer defines for our custom event.  In the _create   function,  as well as the enable function , we bind to several  events, namely mouseenter, mouseleave, and click. We now need to add the  handler function that will react to these events being detected by our plugin. After  the show   method, add the following code:  _addHoverState: function   {   $ this .addClass "ui-state-hover" ;  [ 54 ]   Chapter 2  }, _removeHoverState: function   {   $ this .removeClass "ui-state-hover" ; }, _buttonClick: function   {   var buttonText = $ this .text  ,   display = $ ".ui-calculator-display" ,   newArray = $.ui.calculator.prototype.options.currentSum;   if  buttonText == "Backspace"  {     if  display.text   !== "0" && display.text  .length > 1  {       newArray.pop  ;       $.ui.calculator.prototype.options.currentSum = newArray;       display.text function i, orig  {         return orig.substring 0, orig.length - 1 ;       } ;     }   } else if  buttonText == "clear"  {       $.ui.calculator.prototype.options.currentSum = [];       display.text "0" ;   } else if  buttonText == "="  {       result = eval           $.ui.calculator.prototype.options.currentSum.join ""  ;       display.text result ;       $.ui.calculator.prototype.options.currentSum = [result];   } else if  buttonText == " "  buttonText == "*"  buttonText       == "-"  buttonText == "+"  {       $.ui.calculator.prototype.options.currentSum.push buttonText ;       display.text buttonText ;   } else {       $.ui.calculator.prototype.options.currentSum.push buttonText ;       if  display.text   == "0"  display.text   == " "            display.text   == "*"  display.text   ==  "-"            display.text   == "+"  {         display.text "" ;     }       display.text function i, orig  {         return orig + buttonText;     } ;   } }  The functions called when the mouseenter and mouseleave events are detected are  really straight-forward; we just add and remove the appropriate state class names so  that the over state is applied and removed respectively.  [ 55 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  The click handler is a little more complex, but all we are really doing is  checking which button was clicked and reacting to the different types of button   in different ways.  The first thing we do in the click handler is cache some variables, including the  text of the button that was clicked, the display element of the widget, and a copy   of the currentSum configuration option. Because the this object is no longer  scoped to our widget instance, we can't access the options using this.options,  but we can still access them through the prototype of our widget using $.ui. calculator.prototype.options.  We then have an if statement that checks for each type of button, including the  backspace button, the clear button, the = button, any other function button    , +, and so on , or any number button.  If the backspace button was clicked, we check that the display doesn't consist  of just 0, and that the length of the text being displayed is longer than a single  character. If these conditions are met, we remove the last item from the currentSum  that we obtained from our widget's prototype, update the currentSum with the new  shortened array, and then remove the last character from the text being displayed.  If the clear button was clicked, we just empty the currentSum option by setting its  value to an empty array, and then reset the display back to 0.  If the = button was clicked, we evaluate the expression stored in the currentSum  array, show the result in the display element, and then update the currentSum,  so that it just contains the result.  If any of the function buttons are clicked, we simply add the text of the button to  the currentSum array and then set the text of the display element to the text of the  button that was clicked.  Finally, if any number button is clicked, we first check what is currently being  displayed on the calculator, and if it is either 0 or one of the functions, we empty the  display element. We then update the display with the new number. This is so that  if a number has already been pressed, then the display is updated to include the  original number as well as the new number, but if a function key has been pressed,  the number is added as a new number to avoid displaying things like +1, and so on.  [ 56 ]   The widget style sheet We need to add some basic styling specific to our widget. A lot of styling will come  from the jQuery UI class names we added, but we will still need to define the layout.  In a new file in your text editor add the following code:  Chapter 2  .ui-calculator { width:9.65em; } .ui-calculator-container { padding:.2em .2em 0; } .ui-calculator-display {   width:12.3em; padding:.3em; margin-bottom:.3em;   font-size:0.7em; overflow:auto; } .ui-calculator-numberpad {   width:7em; float:left; } .ui-calculator-functionpad { width:2em; float:left; } .ui-calculator li {   float:left; margin:0 .2em .2em 0; } .ui-calculator-button {   display:block; width:2em; height:1.2em;   padding:.3em 0 .5em; text-align:center; border:0; } .ui-calculator-button-wide { width:4.3em; } .ui-calculator-icon { margin:.2em auto; }  Save this in the css folder as jquery.ui.calculator.css.  Using the widget Our widget is now pretty much complete. There's still a lot of functionality we could  add, and probably a number of bugs to fix, but this simple demonstration was more  to see how to make a jQuery UI plugin, not how to make a JavaScript calculator.  To use the plugin, a developer could use the following code:                 Widget Factory - calculator       <link rel="stylesheet"       href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">   <link rel="stylesheet"   [ 57 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities      href="css jquery.ui.claculator.css">                                                 <script         src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.widget.js">                                function $  {         $ "calc" .calculator  ;       }  jQuery ;              This page can be saved in the main project folder as calculator.html. The basic  calculator can be added using just the widget method:  $ "calc" .calculator  ;  To configure the autoShow option, we could use: $ "calc" .calculator {   autoShow: false } ;  To add a handler for the custom show event we defined, we could do  this: $ "calc" .calculator {   autoShow: false,   show: function e, ui  {     alert e + ", " + $ ui .attr "id" ;   } } ;  To actually show the calculator, we could use our custom show   method:  $ "calc" .calculator "show" ;  [ 58 ]   This could then display an alert, for example, showing the name of the event, and the  id of the element that the widget method was called on:  Chapter 2  Summary In this chapter, we've seen how the CSS framework consistently styles each of the  library components. We've looked at the files that make it and how they work  together to provide the complete look-and-feel of the widgets. We also saw how  tightly integrated the ThemeRoller application is with the framework.  We saw how easy it is to install or change a theme using ThemeRoller. We also  looked at how we can override the theme file if we require a radical customization of  a widget that we cannot obtain with ThemeRoller alone.  [ 59 ]   The CSS Framework and Other Utilities  The chapter also covered building our own widgets or plugins in a way that is  compatible with and can make use of the framework, as well as to ensure that  our creations are ThemeRoller ready. We can also make use of the helper classes  provided by the framework, such as the ui-helper-clearfix class, to quickly  implement common CSS solutions.  We also looked at some of the other utilities included with the library including the  position utility, which allows us to align any edge of one element with any edge of  another element, giving us a powerful and flexible way of positioning elements that  we create or manipulate.  We ended the chapter with an extensive look at the widget factory and how it allows  us to quickly and easily create our very own jQuery UI plugins. We saw how easy  it was to make our widget conform to the common API exposed by official jQuery  plugins, how we can add custom methods for implementing developers to use, how  to add protected functions that are only accessible from within our plugin, and how  to add custom events that implementing developers can easily hook into.  In the next chapter, we'll move on to start looking at the widgets provided by the  library, starting with the tabs widget.  [ 60 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  Now that we've been formally introduced to the jQuery UI library, the CSS  framework, and some of the utilities, we can move on to begin looking at the  individual components included in the library. Over the next six chapters, we'll   be looking at the widgets. These are a set of visually engaging, highly configurable  user interface widgets.  The UI tabs widget is used to toggle visibility across a set of different elements, with  each element containing content that can be accessed by clicking on its tab heading.  Each panel of content has its own tab. The tab headings are usually displayed across  the top of the widget, although it is trivial to reposition them so that they appear  along the bottom of the widget instead.  The tabs are structured so that they line up next to each other horizontally, whereas  the content sections are all set to display: none except for the active panel. Clicking  a tab will highlight the tab and show its associated content panel, while ensuring all  of the other content panels are hidden. Only one content panel can be open at a time.  The tabs can be configured so that no content panels are open.  In this chapter, we will look at the following topics:   	 The default implementation of the widget  	 How the CSS framework targets tab widgets  	 How to apply custom styles to a set of tabs  	 Configuring tabs using their options  	 Built-in transition effects for content panel changes  	 Controlling tabs using their methods  	 Custom events defined by tabs  	 AJAX tabs   Using the Tabs Widget  The following screenshot shows the different elements that a set of jQuery UI tabs  consists of:   A basic tab implementation The structure of the underlying HTML elements on which tabs are based is fairly  rigid, and widgets require a certain number of elements for them to work.  The tabs must be created from a list element  ordered or unordered  and each list  item must contain an   element. Each link will need to have a corresponding  element with a specified id that is associated with the href attribute of the link.  We'll clarify the exact structure of these elements after the first example.  In a new file in your text editor, create the following page:                      Tabs      <link rel="stylesheet"        href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                                  Tab 1             Tab 2                  This is the content panel linked to the first tab,           it is shown by default.                This content is linked to the second tab and will           be shown when its tab is clicked.  [ 62 ]   Chapter 3                                            <script        src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.widget.js">                                function $ {         $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;       }  jQuery ;              Save the code as tabs1.html in your jqueryui working folder. Let's review what  was used. The following script and CSS resources are needed for the default tab  widget configuration:  jquery.ui.all.css jquery-x.x.x.js jquery.ui.core.js jquery.ui.widget.js jquery.ui.tabs.js  A tab widget is usually constructed from several standard HTML elements arranged  in a specific manner:   	 An outer container element, which the tabs method is called on  	 A list element    or     	 An   element within an   element for each tab  	 An element for the content panel of each tab  These elements can be either hardcoded into the  page, added dynamically, or can be a mixture of both,  depending upon the requirements.  The list and anchor elements within the outer container make the clickable tab  headings, which are used to show the content section that is associated with the tab.  The href attribute of the link should be set to a fragment identifier, prefixed with .  It should match the id attribute of the element that forms the content section with  which it is associated.  [ 63 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  The content sections of each tab are created using   elements. The id attribute  is required and will be targeted by its corresponding   element. We've used    elements in this example as the content panels for each tab, but other elements can  also be used as long as the relevant configuration is provided and the resulting  HTML is valid. The panelTemplate and tabTemplate configuration options can be  used to change the elements used to build the widget  see the Configuration section,  later in the chapter for more information .  We link to several   resources from the library at the bottom of the    before its closing tag. Loading scripts last, after style sheets and page elements, is  a proven technique for improving the apparent loading time of a page, and should  therefore be used whenever possible.  After linking first to jQuery, we link to the jquery.ui.core.js file that is required  by all components  except the effects, which have their own core file , and the  jquery.ui.widget.js file. We then link to the component's source file, which in  this case is jquery.ui.tabs.js.  After the three required script files from the library, we can turn to our custom    element in which we add the code that creates the tabs. We use an  anonymous function which is executed immediately  thanks to the extra set of  parentheses following the function  and aliases the $ character.   Aliasing the $ character in this way is considered a current best-practice, and  although not strictly necessary unless writing our own custom jQuery UI plugins,   it does make our code more portable by ensuring that other JavaScript libraries,  which may use the $ character, do not break it.  Within this anonymous function we simply call the tabs   widget method on  the jQuery object, representing our tabs container element  the   with an id of  myTabs . When we run this file in a browser, we should see the tabs as they appeared  in the first screenshot of this chapter  without the annotations of course .  Tab CSS framework classes Using Firebug for Firefox  or another generic DOM explorer , we can see that a  variety of class names are added to the different underlying HTML elements that   the tabs widget is created from.  [ 64 ]   Let's review these classnames briefly and see how they contribute to the overall  appearance of the widget. To the outer container  , the following classnames  are added:  Chapter 3  Classname ui-tabs ui-widget  ui-widget-content ui-corner-all  Purpose Allows tab-specific structural CSS to be applied. Sets generic font styles that are inherited by nested  elements. Provides theme-specific styles. Applies rounded corners to the container.  The first element within the container is the   element. This element receives the  following classnames:   Classname ui-tabs-nav ui-helper-reset  ui-helper-clearfix  ui-widget-header ui-corner-all  Purpose Allows tab-specific structural CSS to be applied. Neutralizes browser-specific styles applied to    elements.  Applies the clear-fix as this element has children that are  floated. Provides theme-specific styles. Applies rounded corners.  The individual   elements that form a part of the tab headings are given the  following classnames:  Classname ui-state-default  ui-corner-top ui-tabs-selected  ui-state-active  Purpose Applies the standard, non-active, non-selected, non-hovered  state to the tab headings. Applies rounded corners to the top edges of the elements. This is only applied to the active tab. On page-load of the  default implementation, this will be the first tab. Selecting  another tab will remove this class from the currently selected  tab and apply it to the newly selected tab. Applies theme-specific styles to the currently selected tab.  This class name will be added to the tab that is currently  selected, just like the previous classname. The reason there  are two class names is that ui-tabs-selected provides  the functional CSS, while ui-state-active provides the  visual, decorative styles.  [ 65 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  The   elements within each   are not given any classnames, but they still have  both structural and theme-specific styles applied to them by the framework.  Finally, the panel elements that hold each tab's content are given the following  classnames:  Classname ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom  Purpose Applies structural CSS to the content panels. Applies theme-specific styles. Applies rounded corners to the bottom edges of  the content panels.  All of these classes are added to the underlying HTML elements automatically by the  library. We don't need to manually add them when coding the page or adding the  base markup.  Applying a custom theme to the tabs In the next example, we can see how to change the tabs' basic appearance. We  can override any rules used purely for display purposes with our own style rules  for quick and easy customization, without changing the rules related to the tab  functionality or structure.  In a new file in your text editor, create the following very small style sheet:  myTabs {   width:400px; padding:5px; border:1px solid 636363;   background:c2c2c2 none; } .ui-widget-header {   border:0; background:c2c2c2 none; font-family:Georgia; } myTabs .ui-widget-content {   border:1px solid aaa; background:fff none; font-size:80%;  } .ui-state-default, .ui-widget-content .ui-state-default {   border:1px solid 636363; background:a2a2a2 none; } .ui-state-active, .ui-widget-content .ui-state-active {   border:1px solid aaa; background:fff none; }  [ 66 ]   Chapter 3  This is all we need. Save the file as tabsTheme.css in your css folder. If you  compare the classnames with the tables on the previous pages, you'll see that we're  overriding the theme-specific styles. Because we're overriding the theme file, we  need to meet or exceed the specificity of the selectors in theme.css. This is why we  target multiple selectors sometimes.   In this example, we override some of the rules in jquery.ui.tabs.css. We  need to use the ID selector of our container element along with the selector from  jquery.ui.theme.css  .ui-widget-content , in order to beat the double class  selector .ui-tabs .ui-tabs-panel.  Add the following reference to this new style sheet in the   of tabs1.html and  resave the file as tabs2.html:     Make sure the custom style sheet we just created appears after the  jquery.ui.tabs.css file, because the rules that we are trying to  override will be not overridden by our custom theme file if the style  sheets are not linked in the correct order.  If we view the new page in a browser, it should appear as in the following  screenshot:  Our new theme isn't dramatically different from the default smoothness  as shown in  the first screenshot , but we can see how easy it is, and how little code it requires to  change the appearance of the widget to suit its environment.  [ 67 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  Configurable options Each of the different components in the library has a series of options that control  which features of the widget are enabled by default. An object literal, or an object  reference, can be passed in to the tabs   widget method to configure these options.  The available options to configure non-default behaviors are shown in the   following table:   Option ajaxOptions  Default value null  cache  false  collapsible  false  cookie  null  disabled  false  event  "click"  fx  null  idPrefix  "ui-tabs-"  panelTemplate  "  "  selected  0  Used to… Specify additional AJAX options. We can  use any of the options exposed by jQuery's  $.ajax   method such as data, type,  url, and so on. Control whether the remote data is loaded  only once when the page initializes, or is  reloaded every time the corresponding tab  is clicked. Allow an active tab to be unselected if it  is clicked, so that all of the content panels  are hidden and only the tab headings are  visible. Show the active tab using cookie data on  page load. The cookie plugin is required  for this option to be used. Disable the widget on page load. We  can also pass an array of tab indices    zero-based  in order to disable   specific tabs. Specify the event that triggers the display  of content panels. Specify an animation effect when changing  tabs. Supply an object literal or an array of  animation effects. Generate a unique ID and fragment  identifier when a remote tab heading's    element has no title attribute. Specifying the elements used for the  content section of a tab panel. Show a tab panel other than the first  one on page load  overrides the cookie  property .  [ 68 ]   Chapter 3  Option spinner  Default value "Loading&8230"  tabTemplate   <a    href="{href}">      {label}              Used to… Specify the loading spinner for  remote tabs. Specify the elements used when  creating new tabs. The {href}  and {label} strings are replaced  by the widget internally when the   new tab is created.  Selecting a tab Let's look at how these configurable properties can be used. For example, let's  configure the widget so that the second tab is displayed when the page loads.  Remove the   for tabsTheme.css in the   of tabs2.html and change  the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     var tabOpts = {       selected: 1     };     $ "myTabs" .tabs tabOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as tabs3.html. The different tabs and their associated content panels are  represented by a numerical index starting at zero. Specifying a different tab to open  by default is as easy as supplying its index number as the value for the selected  property. When the page loads now, the second tab should be selected by default.  Along with changing which tab is selected, we can also specify that no tabs should be  initially selected by supplying null as the value for this property. This will cause the  widget to appear as follows on page load:  [ 69 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  Disabling a tab You may want a particular tab to be disabled until a certain condition is met. This  is easily achieved by manipulating the disabled property of the tabs. Change the  tabOpts configuration object in tabs3.html to this:  var tabOpts = {   disabled: [1] };  Save this as tabs4.html in your jqueryui folder. In this example, we remove the  selected property and add the index of the second tab to the disabled array. We  could add the indices of other tabs to this array as well, separated by a comma, to  disable multiple tabs by default.  When the page is loaded in a browser, the second tab has the classname   ui-widget-disabled applied to it, and will pick up the disabled styles from  ui.theme.css. It will not respond to mouse interactions in any way, as shown  in the following screenshot:  Transition effects We can easily add attractive transition effects using the fx property. These are  displayed when tabs are opened or closed. This option is configured using another  object literal  or an array  inside our configuration object, which enables one or   more effects. We can enable fading effects, for example, using the following  configuration object:  var tabOpts = {   fx: {      opacity: "toggle",     duration: "slow"   } };  [ 70 ]   Chapter 3  Save this file as tabs5.html in your jqueryui folder. The fx object that we created  has two properties. The first property is the animation to use when changing tabs.  To use fading animations we specify opacity, as this is what is adjusted. Toggling  the opacity simply reverses its current setting. If it is currently visible, it is made  invisible and vice-versa.  The second property, duration, specifies the speed at which the animation occurs.  The values for this property are slow or fast, which correspond to 200 and 600  milliseconds respectively. Any other string will result in the default duration of 400  milliseconds. We can also supply an integer representing the number of milliseconds  the animation should run for.  When we run the file we can see that the tab content slowly fades-out as a tab closes  and fades-in when a new tab opens. Both animations occur during a single tab  interaction. To only show the animation once, when a tab closes, for example, we  would need to nest the fx object within an array. Change the configuration object in  tabs5.html so that it appears as follows:  var tabOpts = {   fx: [{     opacity: "toggle",     duration: "slow"   },   null]  };  The closing effect of the currently open content panel is contained within an object in  the first item of the array, and the opening animation of the new tab is the second. By  specifying null as the second item in the array, we disable the opening animations  when a new tab is selected.  We can also specify different animations and speeds for opening and closing  animations, by adding another object as the second array item instead of null.  Save this as tabs6.html and view the results in a browser.  Collapsible tabs By default when the currently active tab is clicked, nothing happens. But we can  change this so that the currently open content panel closes when its tab heading is  selected. Change the configuration object in tabs6.html so that it appears as follows:  var tabOpts = {   collapsible: true };  [ 71 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  Save this version as tabs7.html. This option allows all of the content panels to  be closed, much like when we supplied null to the selected property earlier on.  Clicking a deactivated tab will select the tab and show its associated content panel.  Clicking the same tab again will close it, shrinking the widget down so that only tab  headings are visible.  Tab events The tab widget defines a series of useful options that allow you to add callback  functions to perform different actions, when certain events exposed by the widget  are detected. The following table lists the configuration options that are able to  accept executable functions on an event:  Event add disable enable load remove select show  Fired when... A new tab is added.  A  tab is disabled. A tab is enabled. A tab's remote data has loaded. A tab is removed. A tab is selected. A tab is shown.  Each component of the library has callback options  such as those in the previous  table , which are tuned to look for key moments in any visitor interactions. Any  functions we use within these callbacks are usually executed before the change  happens. Therefore, you can return false from your callback and prevent the  action from occurring.  In our next example, we will look at how easy it is to react to a particular tab being  selected, using the standard non-bind technique. Change the final   element  in tabs7.html so that it appears as follows:        function $ {     var handleSelect = function e, tab  {       $ "  ", {         text: "Tab at index " + tab.index + " selected",         "class": "status-message ui-corner-all"       } .appendTo ".ui-tabs-nav", "myTabs" .fadeOut 5000, function           {         $ this .remove  ;       } ;  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3      },     tabOpts = {       select: handleSelect     }     $ "myTabs" .tabs tabOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this file as tabs8.html. We also need a little CSS to complete this example. In  the   of the page we just created, add the following   element:     Then in a new page in your text editor, add the following code:  .status-message {   padding:11px 8px 10px; margin:0; border:1px solid aaa;   position:absolute; right:10px; top:9px; font-size:11px;   background-color:fff; }  Save this file as tabSelect.css in the css folder. We made use of the select  callback in this example, although the principle is the same for any of the other  custom events fired by tabs. The name of our callback function is provided as the  value of the select property in our configuration object.  Two arguments will be passed automatically by the widget to the callback function  we define, when it is executed. These are the original event object and custom object  containing useful properties from the tab, which was selected.  To find out which of the tabs was clicked, we can look at the index property of the  second object  remember these are zero-based indices . This is added, along with a  little explanatory text, to a paragraph element that we create on the fly and append  to the widget header:  [ 73 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  Whenever a tab is selected, the paragraph before it fades away. Note that the event is  fired before the change occurs.  Binding to events Using the event callbacks exposed by each component is the standard way of  handling interactions. However, in addition to the callbacks listed in the previous  table, we can also hook into another set of events fired by each component at  different times.  We can use the standard jQuery bind   method to bind an event handler to a  custom event, fired by the tabs widget in the same way that we could bind to a  standard DOM event, such as a click.  The following table lists the tab widget's custom binding events and their triggers:  Event tabsselect tabsload tabsshow tabsadd tabsremove tabsdisable tabsenable  Fired when... A tab is selected. A remote tab has loaded. A tab is shown. A tab has been added to the interface. A tab has been removed from the interface. A tab has been disabled. A tab has been enabled.  The first three events are fired in succession, in the order of events in which they  appear in the table. If no tabs are remote, then tabsselect and tabsshow are fired  in that order. These events are sometimes fired before and sometimes after the action  has occurred, depending on which event is used.  Let's see this type of event usage in action; change the final   element in  tabs8.html to the following:       function $  {     $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;     $ "myTabs" .bind "tabsselect", function e, tab  {       alert "The tab at index " + tab.index + " was selected" ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    [ 74 ]   Chapter 3  Save this change as tabs9.html. Binding to the tabsselect in this way produces  the same result as the previous example, using the select callback function. Like  last time, the alert should appear before the new tab is activated.  All the events exposed by all the widgets can be used with the bind   method, by  simply prefixing the name of the widget to the name of the event.  Using tab methods The tabs widget contains many different methods, which means it has a rich set of  behaviors. It also supports the implementation of advanced functionality that allows  us to work with it programmatically. Let's take a look at the methods, which are  listed in the following table:  Method abort add  destroy disable  enable  length load option remove  rotate  select  url  widget  Used to... Stop any animations or AJAX requests that are currently in progress. Add a new tab programmatically, specifying the URL of the tab's content, a  label, and optionally its index number as arguments. Completely remove the tabs widget. Disable a specific tab by passing a zero-based index number to the method,  or pass nothing to the method to disable the entire set of tabs. Enable a disable tab by passing a zero-based index number to the method,  or enable the entire widget by passing nothing to the method.  Return the number of tabs in the widget. Reload an AJAX tab's content, specifying the index number of the tab. Get or set any property after the widget has been initialized. Remove a tab programmatically, specifying the index of the tab to remove.  If no index is supplied, the first tab is removed. Tabs can also be removed  using their href value. Automatically changes the active tab after a specified number of  milliseconds have passed, either once or repeatedly. Select a tab programmatically, which has the same effect as when a visitor  clicks a tab, based on index number. Change the URL of content given to an AJAX tab. The method expects the  index number of the tab and the new URL. See also load  earlier in this  table .  Return the element that the tabs   widget method is called on.  [ 75 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  Enabling and disabling tabs We can make use of the enable or disable methods to programmatically enable  or disable specific tabs. This will effectively switch on any tabs that were initially  disabled or disable those that are currently active.  Let's use the enable method to switch on a tab, which we disabled by default in an  earlier example. Add the following new   elements directly after the existing  markup for the tabs widget in tabs4.html:   Enable   Disable   Next, change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     $ "myTabs" .tabs {       disabled: [1]     } ;     $ "enable" .click function   {       $ "myTabs" .tabs "enable", 1 ;     } ;     $ "disable" .click function   {       $ "myTabs" .tabs "disable", 1 ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save the changed file as tabs10.html. On the page, we've added two new    elements—one will be used to enable the disabled tab and the other is used to   disable it again. In the JavaScript, we use the click event of the Enable button to call the tabs    widget method. To do this, we pass the string enable, to the tabs   method as the  first argument. Additionally, we pass the index number of the tab we want to enable  as a second argument. All methods in jQuery UI are called in this way. We specify  the name of the method we wish to call as the first argument to the widget method.  The disable method is used in the same way. Note that a tab cannot be disabled  while it is active. Don't forget that we can use both of these methods without  additional arguments, in order to enable or disable the entire widget.  [ 76 ]   Chapter 3  Adding and removing tabs Along with enabling and disabling tabs programmatically, we can also remove  them or add completely new tabs on the fly. In tabs10.html, remove the existing    elements and add the following:   Enter a tab to remove:     Remove!    Add a new tab!   Then change the final   element to this:       function $ {     $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;     $ "remove" .click function   {       $ "myTabs" .tabs "remove", parseInt $ "indexNum" .val  ,          10  ;     } ;     $ "add" .click function   {       $ "myTabs" .tabs "add", "remoteTab.txt", "A New Tab!" ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;  Save this as tabs11.html. On the page we've added a new instructional  , an   , and a   that are used to specify a tab to remove. We've also added  a second  , which is used to add a new tab.  In the  , the first of our new functions handle removing a tab, using the  remove method. This method requires one additional argument—the index number  of the tab to be removed. We get the value entered into the textbox and pass it to the  method as the argument. The data returned by jQuery's val   method is in string  format, so we wrap the call in the JavaScript parseInt function to convert it.   If no index is passed to the remove method,  the first tab will be removed.  The add method that adds a new tab to the widget, can be made to work in several  different ways. In this example, we've specified that the content found in the file  remoteTab.txt should be added as the content of the new tab. In addition to passing  the string add, and specifying a reference to the file containing the new content, we  also specify a label for the new tab in string format as the third argument.  Optionally, we can also specify the index number of where the new tab should be  inserted as a fourth argument. If the index is not supplied, the new tab will be added  as the last tab.   [ 77 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  After adding and perhaps removing some tabs, the page should appear something  like this:  There is a bug in the current version of the tabs widget that causes  an extra content panel to be added to the tabs widget, when using  the add method  see ticket 5069 at http:  bugs.jqueryui. com ticket  . It is this bug that causes the extra space to appear  when the new tab is initially added in the previous example.  Simulating clicks There may be times when you want to programmatically select a particular tab  and show its content. This could happen as the result of some other interaction by  the visitor.  We can use the select   method to do this, which is completely analogous with  the action of clicking a tab. Alter the final   block in tabs11.html, so that  it appears as follows:       function $ {     $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;     $ "remove" .click function   {       $ "myTabs"           .tabs "remove", parseInt $ "indexNum" .val  , 10  ;     } ;     $ "add" .click function   {      $ "myTabs" .tabs "add", "newTab", "A New Tab!"           .tabs "select", $ "myTabs" .tabs "length"  - 1 ;     } ;   } ;    [ 78 ]   Chapter 3  Save this as tabs12.html in your jqueryui folder. Now when the new tab is added,  it is automatically selected. The select   method requires just one additional  argument, which is the index number of the tab to select.  As any tab that we add will, by default  although this can be changed , be the last  tab in the interface, and as the tab indices are zero based, all we have to do is use the  length method to return the number of tabs, and then subtract 1 from this figure to  get the index. The result is passed to the select method.  Interestingly, selecting the newly-added tab straight away fixes, or at least hides, the  extra space issue from the last example.  Creating a tab carousel One method that creates quite an exciting result is the rotate method. This method  will make all of the tabs  and their associated content panels  display one after the  other automatically.  It's a great visual effect and is useful for ensuring that all, or a lot, of the individual  tab's content panels get seen by the visitor. For an example of this kind of effect in  action, see the homepage of http:  www.cnet.com. There is a tabs widget  not a  jQuery UI one  that shows blogs, podcasts, and videos.   Like the other methods we've seen, the rotate method is easy-to-use. Change the  final   element in tabs9.html to this:       function $ {     $ "myTabs" .tabs  .tabs "rotate", 1000, true ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this file as tabs13.html. We've reverted back to a simplified page with no  additional elements other than the underlying structure of the widget. Although we  can't call the rotate method directly using the initial tabs   method, we can chain  it to the end like we would with methods from the standard jQuery library.  Chaining UI methods Chaining widget methods is possible because like the methods  found in the underlying jQuery library, they almost always return  the jQuery  $  object. Note that this is not possible when using  getter methods that return data, such as the length method.  [ 79 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  The rotate method is used with two additional parameters. The first parameter is an  integer that specifies the number of milliseconds each that tab should display before  the next tab is shown. The second parameter is a Boolean that indicates whether the  cycle through the tabs should occur once or continuously.  The tab widget also contains a destroy method. This is a method common to all the  widgets found in jQuery UI. Let's see how it works. In tabs13.html, after the widget  add a new   as follows:   Destroy the tabs   Next, change the final   element to this:       function $ {     $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;     $ "destroy" .click function   {       $ "myTabs" .tabs "destroy" ;     } ;    }  jQuery ;    Save this file as tabs14.html. The destroy method that we invoke with a click on  the button, completely removes the tab widget, returning the underlying HTML to  its original state. After the button has been clicked, you should see a standard HTML  list element and the text from each tab, just like in the following screenshot:  Only the original tabs hard-coded in the page will remain if the  tabs are destroyed, not those added with the add method.  [ 80 ]   Chapter 3  Getting and setting options Like the destroy method, the option method is exposed by all the different  components found in the library. This method is used to work with the configurable  options and functions in both getter and setter modes. Let's look at a basic example;  add the following   after the tabs widget in tabs9.html:   Show Selected!   Then change the final   element so that it is as follows:       function $ {     $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;     $ "show" .click function   {       $ "  ", {         text: "Tab at index " + $ "myTabs"             .tabs "option", "selected"  + " is active"       } .appendTo ".ui-tabs-nav" .fadeOut 5000 ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this file as tabs15.html. The   on the page has been changed, so that  it shows the currently active tab. All we do is add the index of the selected tab to a  status bar message, as we did in the earlier example. We get the selected option by  passing the string selected as the second argument. Any value of any option can be  accessed in this way.  To trigger setter mode instead, we can supply a third argument containing the  new value of the option that we'd like to set. Therefore, to change the value of the  selected option, in order to change the tab being displayed, we could use the  following HTML:   Enter a tab index to activate     Change Selected   And the following click-handler:        function $ {     $ "set" .click function   {       $ "myTabs"           .tabs "option", "selected", parseInt $ "newIndex" .val    ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;  [ 81 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  Save this as tabs16.html. The new page contains a  , an  ,  as well as a   that is used to harvest the index number that the selected  option should be set to. When the button is clicked, our code will retrieve the value  of the   and use it to change the selected index. By supplying the new value  we put the method in setter mode.  When we run this page in our browser, we should see that we can switch to   the second tab by entering its index number  1  and clicking the Change  Selected button.   AJAX tabs We saw how we can use the add method to add an AJAX tab to the widget  dynamically, but we can also add remote content to tabs using the underlying  HTML. In this example, we want the tab that will display the remote content to be  available all the time, not just after clicking the button. Add the following new    element to the underlying HTML for the widget in tabs16.html:    AJAX Tab    We should also remove the   from the last example.  The final   element can be used to just call the tabs method; no additional  configuration is required:   $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;  Save this as tabs17.html. All we're doing is specifying the path to the remote file   the same one we used in the earlier example  using the href attribute of an    element in the underlying markup, from which the tabs are created.  Unlike static tabs, we don't need a corresponding   element with an id that  matches the href of the link. The additional elements required for the tab content  will be generated automatically by the widget.  If you use a DOM explorer, you can see that the file path that we added to link to the  remote tab has been removed. Instead, a new fragment identifier has been generated  and set as the href. The new fragment is also added as the id of the new tab  minus  the  symbol of course  so that the tab heading still shows the tab.  [ 82 ]   Along with loading data from external files, it can also be loaded from URLs. This is  great when retrieving content from a database using query strings or a web service.  Methods related to AJAX tabs include the load and url methods. The load method  is used to load and reload the contents of an AJAX tab, which could come in handy  for refreshing content that changes very frequently.  Chapter 3  There is no inherent cross-domain support built into the AJAX  functionality of tabs widget. Therefore, unless additional PHP or  some other server-scripting language is employed as a proxy, you  may wish to make use of JSON structured data and jQuery's JSONP  functionality. Files and URLs should be under the same domain as  the page running the widget.  Changing the URL of a remote tab's  content The url method is used to change the URL that the AJAX tab retrieves its content  from. Let's look at a brief example of these two methods in action. There are also a  number of properties related to AJAX functionality.   Add the following new   element after the tabs widget in tabs17.html:       tabContent.html      tabContent2.html     Then change the final   element to the following:      $ function  {     $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;     $ "fileChooser" .change function   {       $ "myTabs" .tabs "url", 2, $ this .val   ;     } ;   } ;    Save the new file as tabs18.html. We've added a simple   element to the  page that lets you choose the content to display in the AJAX tab. In the JavaScript,   we set a change handler for the   and specified an anonymous function to  be executed each time the event is detected.  [ 83 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  This function simply calls the url method, passing in the index of the tab whose  URL we want to update and the new URL as arguments.  We'll also need a second local content file. Change the text in the remoteTab.txt file  and resave it as remoteTab2.txt.  Run the new file in a browser and use the dropdown   to choose the second  remote file, then switch to the remote tab. The contents of the second text file should  be displayed.  Reloading a remote tab One thing you may have noticed in the previous example is that if the remote tab  was already selected when its URL was changed, the content was not updated until  you switched to a different tab and then back to the remote tab. To fix this, we can  make use of the load method, which reloads a remote tab's content. Update the  change event-handler in tabs18.html to the following:  $ "fileChooser" .change function   {   $ "myTabs" .tabs "url", 2, $ this .val   .tabs "load", 2 ; } ;  The load method accepts a single argument, which is the index number of the tab  whose content we want to reload. We should find now that we can change the URL  of the remote tab with the   element, even while the remote tab is selected  and the content will be automatically updated.  The slight flicker in the tab heading is the string value of the spinner option that by  default is set to Loading. We don't really get a chance to see it in full here, as the tab  content is changed too quickly as its running locally.  Displaying data obtained via JSONP Let's pull-in some external content for our final tabs example. If we use the tabs  widget, in conjunction with the standard jQuery library getJSON method, we  can bypass the cross-domain exclusion policy and pull-in a feed from another  domain, to display in a tab. In tabs19.html, change the tabs widget so that it  appears as follows:               Nebula Information           Images         [ 84 ]   Chapter 3           A nebulae is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen gas, and         plasma. It is the first stage of a star's cycle. In these re        gions the formations of gas, dust, and other materials clump         together to form larger masses, which attract further matter,         and eventually will become big enough to form stars. The re        maining materials are then believed to form planets and other         planetary system objects. Many nebulae form from the gravita        tional collapse of diffused gas in the interstellar medium or         ISM. As the material collapses under its own weight, massive         stars may form in the center, and their ultraviolet radiation         ionizes the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wave        lengths.                   Next, change the final   to the following:       function $ {     var img = $ " ", {       height: 100,       width: 100     } ,     tabOpts = {       select: function event, ui  {          if  ui.tab.toString  .indexOf "flickr"  != -1   {           $ "flickr" .empty  ;           $.getJSON "http:  api.flickr.com services feeds  photos_public.gne?tags = nebula&format = json&jsoncallback = ?",  function data  {             $.each data.items, function i,item {               img.clone                 .attr "src", item.media.m .appendTo "flickr" ;               if  i == 5  {                 return false;               }             } ;           } ;         }       }     };     $ "myTabs" .tabs tabOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    [ 85 ]   Using the Tabs Widget  Save the file as tabs20.html in your jqueryui folder. We first create a new    element and store it in a variable. We also create a configuration object and add the  select event option to it. Every time a tab is selected, the function we set as the  value of this option will check to see if it was the tab with an id of flickr that was  selected. If it was, the jQuery getJSON method is used to retrieve an image feed from  http:  www.flickr.com.  Once the data is returned, first empty the contents of the Flickr tab to prevent a  build-up of images, then use jQuery's each   utility method to iterate over each  object within the returned JSON, and create a clone of our stored image.  Each new copy of the image has its src attribute set using the information from the  current feed object, and is then added to the empty Flickr tab. Once iteration over six  of the objects in the feed has occurred, we exit jQuery's each method. It's that simple. When we view the page and select the Images tab, after a short delay we should see  six new images, as seen in the following screenshot:  Summary The tabs widget is an excellent way of saving space on your page by organizing  related  or even completely unrelated  sections of content that can be shown or  hidden, with simple click-input from your visitors. It also lends an air of interactivity  to your site that can help improve the overall functionality and appeal of the page on  which it is used.  Let's review what was covered in this chapter. We first looked at how, with just  a little underlying HTML and a single line of jQuery-flavored JavaScript, we can  implement the default tabs widget.  [ 86 ]   Chapter 3  We then saw how easy it is to add our own basic styling for the tabs widget so   that its appearance, but not its behavior, is altered. We already know that in   addition to this, we can use a predesigned theme or create a completely new   theme using ThemeRoller.  We then moved on, to look at the set of configurable options exposed by the   tabs' API. With these, we can enable or disable different options that the widget  supports, such as whether tabs are selected by clicks or another event, whether  certain tabs are disabled when the widget is rendered, and so on.  We took some time to look at how we can use a range of predefined callback options  that allow us to execute arbitrary code, when different events are detected. We also  saw that the jQuery bind   method can listen for the same events if necessary.  Following the configurable options, we covered the range of methods that we can  use to programmatically make the tabs perform different actions, such as simulating  a click on a tab, enabling or disabling a tab, and adding or removing tabs.  We briefly looked at some of the more advanced functionality supported by the tabs  widget such as AJAX tabs and the tab carousel. Both these techniques are easy to use  and can add value to any implementation. In the next chapter, we'll move on to look at the accordion widget, which like  the tabs widget, is used to group content into related sections that are shown one   at a time.  [ 87 ]    The Accordion Widget  The accordion widget is another UI widget that allows you to group content into  separate panels that can be opened or closed by visitor interaction. Therefore, most  of its content is initially hidden from view, much like the tabs widget that we looked  at in the previous chapter.  Each container has a heading element associated with it that is used to open the  container and display the content. When you click on a heading, its content will slide  into view  with an animation  below it. The currently visible content is hidden, while  the new content is shown whenever we click on an accordion heading.  In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:   	 The structure of an accordion widget  	 The default implementation of an accordion  	 Adding custom styling  	 Using the configurable options to set different behaviors  	 Working with methods for controlling the accordion  	 The built-in types of animation  	 Custom accordion events   The Accordion Widget  The accordion widget is a robust and highly configurable widget that allows you to  save space on your web pages, by displaying only a single panel of content at any  time. The following screenshot shows an example of an accordion widget:  It's easy for our visitors to use and easy for us to implement. It has a range of  configurable options that can be used to customize its appearance and behavior,  and exposes a series of methods that allow you to control it programmatically. It  also comes with a rich set of interaction events that we can use to hook into key  interactions between our visitors and the widget.  The height of the accordion's container element will be set automatically, so that  there is room to show the tallest content panel in addition to the headers. Also, by  default, the size of the widget will remain fixed, so that it won't push other elements  on the page around it out of the way, when content panels open or close.  Accordion's structure Let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with the underlying markup that an  accordion is made of. Within the outer container is a series of links. These links are  the headings within the accordion and each heading will have a corresponding  content panel that opens when the header is clicked.  It's worth remembering that only one content panel can be open at a time   when using the accordion widget. In a blank page in your text editor, create   the following page:                 [ 90 ]   Chapter 4      <link rel="stylesheet"        href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">      Accordion                                      Header 1                          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing           elit.

The widget should appear as it did in the screenshot at the start of the chapter, fully  skinned and ready for action.  The following list shows the required dependencies of the widget:   	 jquery.ui.all.css  	 jquery-x.x.x.js  	 jquery.ui.core.js  	 jquery.ui.accordion.js  Each widget also has its own source file, and may depend on other components as  well. For example, we could include some effect files to use non-standard animations  on the opening accordion panels.  The order in which these files appear is important. The jQuery library must always  appear first, followed by the jquery.ui.core.js file. After these files, any other  files that the widget depends upon, should appear before the widget's own script  file. The library components will not function as expected if files are not loaded in   the correct order.  The underlying markup required for the accordion is flexible, and the widget can  be constructed from a variety of different structures. In this example, the accordion  headings are formed from links wrapped in   elements, and the content panels  are simple   elements.  For the accordion to function correctly, each content panel should appear directly  after its corresponding header. All of the elements for the widget are enclosed within  a container   that is targeted with the accordion   widget method.  After the required script dependencies from the library, we use a custom    block to transform the underlying markup into the accordion.  To initialize the widget, we use a simple id selector $ "myAccordion" , to  specify the element that contains the markup for the widget, and then chain the  accordion   widget method after the selector to create the accordion.  [ 92 ]   Chapter 4  In this example, we used an empty fragment    as the value of the href attribute in  our tab heading elements, such as:    Header 1    You should note that any URL supplied for accordion headers will not be followed,  when the header is clicked in the default implementation.  Similar to the tabs widget that we looked at in the previous chapter, the underlying  markup that is transformed into the accordion has a series of classnames added to it,  when the widget is initialized.  A number of different elements that make up the widget are given role and  aria- attributes. ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications and is a  W3C recommendation for ensuring that rich-internet applications remain accessible  to assisted technologies.  The accordion panels that are initially hidden from view are given the attribute  aria-expanded="false" to ensure that screen readers don't discard or cannot  access content that is hidden using display:none. This makes the accordion  widget highly accessible.  Styling the accordion ThemeRoller is the recommended tool for choosing or creating the theme of the  accordion widget, but there may be times when we want to considerably change the  look and style of the widget beyond what is possible with ThemeRoller. In that case,  we can just style our own accordion.  In a new page in your text editor add the following code:  myAccordion {   width:400px; border:1px solid 636363; padding-bottom:1px; } .ui-accordion-header {   border:1px solid fff;   font-family:Georgia; background:e2e2e2 none; } .ui-widget-content { font-size:70%; border:none; } .ui-corner-bottom {   -moz-border-radius:4px 4px 0 0;   -webkit-border-radius:4px 4px 0 0;   border-radius:4px 4px 0 0; }  [ 93 ]   The Accordion Widget  .ui-corner-all {   -moz-border-radius:0; -webkit-border-radius:0;    border-radius:0; } .ui-accordion .ui-accordion-header { margin:0 0 -1px; } myAccordion .ui-state-active, myAccordion .ui-widget-content .ui- state-active { background:fff; } .ui-state-hover, .ui-widget-content .ui-state-hover {   background:d2d2d2; }  Save this file as accordionTheme.css in the css folder, and link to it after the jQuery  UI style sheet in the   of accordion1.html:     Save the new file as accordion2.html in the jqueryui folder and view it in a  browser. It should appear something like this:  As you can see from this screenshot, we've disabled the built-in rounded corners that  are added by the theme file and have set alternative fonts, background colors, and  border colors.   We haven't changed the widget much, but we haven't used many style rules. It  would be easy to continue overriding rules in this way to build a much more  complex custom theme.  [ 94 ]   Configuring an accordion The accordion has a range of configurable options that allow us to change the default  behavior of the widget. The following table lists the available options, their default  values, and gives a brief description of their usage:  Chapter 4  Option active  animated  Default value first child  the first panel  is open  "slide"  autoHeight  true  clearStyle  false  collapsible  false  disabled event  false "click"  fillSpace  false  header  "> li >:first-child,>  :not li :even"  icons  navigation  'header': 'ui-icon- triangle-1-e',  'headerSelected': 'ui- icon-triangle-1-s' false  navigationFilter location.href  Used to… Set the active heading on page  load.  Animate the opening of content  panels. Automatically set height  according to the biggest drawer. Clear the height and overflow  styles after a panel opens. Allow all of the content panels to  be closed at the same time. Disable the widget. Specify the event on headers that  trigger drawers to open. Allow the accordion to fill the  height of its container instead  of sizing itself according to the  content within it. Specify the selector for header  elements. Although it looks  complex, this is a standard jQuery  selector that simply targets the  first-child within every odd    element.  Set the icons for the header  elements and the selected state.  Enable navigation mode for  accordion. Change the function used to  obtain the ID of the content panel  that should be open when the  widget is initialized.  [ 95 ]   The Accordion Widget  Changing the trigger event Most of the options are self-explanatory, and the values they accept are usually  Booleans, strings, or element selectors. Let's put some of them to use, so that we can  explore their functionality. Change the final   element in accordion2.html  so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     var accOpts = {       event:"mouseover"          }          $ "myAccordion" .accordion accOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save these changes as accordion3.html. First, we create a new object literal called  accOpts that contains the key event and the value mouseover, which is the event  we wish to use to trigger the opening of an accordion panel. We pass this object to  the accordion   method as an argument and it overrides the default option of the  widget, which is click.  The mouseover event is commonly used as an alternative trigger event. Other events  can also be used, for example, we can set keydown as the event, but in order for this  to work, the accordion panel that we wish to open, must already be focused.  You should note that you can also set options using an inline object within the  widget method, without creating a separate object. Using the following code   would be equally as effective, and would often be the preferred way of coding:       function $  {      $ "myAccordion" .accordion {       event:"mouseover"     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Changing the default active header By default, the first header of the accordion will be selected when the widget is  rendered, with its content panel open. We can change which header is selected   on page load using the active option. Change the configuration object in  accordion3.html, so that it appears as follows:  [ 96 ]   Chapter 4  Save this version as accordion4.html. We set the active option to the integer 2 to  open the last content panel by default, and like the tab headers that we saw in the  previous chapter, accordion's headers use a zero-based index. Along with an integer,  this option also accepts a jQuery selector or raw DOM element.  We can also use the Boolean value of false to configure the accordion, so that none  of the content panels are open by default. Change the configuration object once again  to the following:  var accOpts = {   active: 2 };  var accOpts = {   active: false };  Save this as accordion5.html. Now when the page loads, all of the content panels  are hidden from view:  The widget will only remain closed until one of the headers is selected, and then one  panel will remain open at all times. This behavior can be changed by employing the  collapsible option in the configuration object:  var accOpts = {   active: false,   collapsible: true };  Save this as accordion6.html. Now, not only is the accordion closed when the  page loads, but also clicking an active header will close its associated content panel  as well. As expected, when a closed header is clicked, it will show its content panel  in the usual way. For usability, it is best to avoid configuring both this and the  mouseover event option together in the same implementation, as the open panels  would close even when the user inadvertently moused off-and-back over them.  [ 97 ]   The Accordion Widget  Filling the height of its container If the fillSpace option is set, it will override autoHeight, and force the accordion  to take the full height of its container. In our examples so far, the container of the  accordion has been the body of the page, and the height of the body will only be the  height of its largest element. We'll need to use a new container element with a fixed  height to see this option in action.   In the   of accordion6.html, add the following   element:      container { height:600px; width:400px; }     Then wrap all of the underlying markup for the accordion in a new container  element as follows:              Header 1        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.         Aenean sollicitudin. Sed interdum pulvinar justo. Nam iaculis         volutpat ligula. Integer vitae felis quis diam laoreet ullam        corper.             Header 2        Etiam tincidunt est vitae est. Ut posuere, mauris at sodales         rutrum, turpis tellus fermentum metus, ut bibendum velit enim         eu lectus. Suspendisse potenti.             Header 3        Donec at dolor ac metus pharetra aliquam. Suspendisse         purus. Fusce tempor ultrices libero. Sed quis nunc.         Pellentesque tincidunt viverra felis. Integer elit mauris,         egestas ultricies, gravida vitae, feugiat a, tellus.              Finally, change the configuration object to use the fillSpace option:  var accOpts = {   fillSpace: true };  [ 98 ]   Save the changes as accordion7.html. The new container is given a fixed height and  width using the CSS specified in the   of the page.  Chapter 4  This is not the best way to add style to our pages. But when we  only have a single selector and two rules, it seems excessive to  create a new style sheet.  The fillSpace option forces the accordion to take the entire height of its container,  and restricting the width of the container naturally reduces the width of the widget  too. This page should appear as follows:  Accordion animation The accordion widget comes with the built-in slide animation that is enabled by default,  and has been present in all of our examples so far. Disabling this animation is as easy as  supplying false as the value of the animated option. Remove the   tag from the    of the page in accordion7.html, and remove the additional container  ,  then change the configuration object so that it appears as follows:  var accOpts = {   animated: false };  Save this as accordion8.html. This will cause each content panel to open  immediately instead of sliding-open nicely whenever a header is clicked.  [ 99 ]   The Accordion Widget  An alternate animation has also been built into the widget—the bounceslide  animation. However, to use this alternate animation, we need to add a link   to the jquery.effects.core.js file.  Directly after the link to ui.accordion.js at the bottom of the  , add the  following line of code:  <script    src="development-bundle ui jquery.effects.core.js">    Now, change the configuration object in our custom   element so that it  appears like this:  var accOpts = {   animated: "bounceslide" };  Save these changes as accordion9.html. Although the accordion panels close in  exactly the same way as they did in previous examples, when they open they bounce  a few times at the end of the animation. It's a great effect, and as we saw in this  example, it's easy to use.  In addition to the two preconfigured animations, we can also use any of the   different easing effects defined within the jquery.effects.core.js file,  including the following:   	 easeInQuad  	 easeInCubic  	 easeInQuart  	 easeInQuint  	 easeInSine  	 easeInExpo  	 easeInCirc  	 easeInElastic  	 easeInBack  	 easeInBounce  Each of these easing methods is complimented by easeOut and easeInOut  counterparts. For the complete list, see the jquery.effects.core.js file,  or refer to the easing table in Chapter 14, UI Effects.  See the jQuery UI demo site for some great examples of the accordion  effects: http:  jqueryui.com demos accordion   [ 100 ]   The easing effects don't change the underlying animation, which will still be based  on the slide animation. But they do change how the animation progresses. For  example, we can make the content panels bounce both on opening and closing  animations, by using the easeOutBounce easing effect in our configuration object:  Chapter 4  var accOpts = {   animated: "easeOutBounce" };  Save this file as accordion10.html and view it in a browser. Most of the easing  effects have opposites, for example, instead of making the content panels bounce  at the end of the animation, we can make them bounce at the start of the animation  using the easeInBounce easing effect.  Another option that has an effect on animations is the clearStyle property, which  resets height and overflow styles after each animation. Remember that animations  are enabled by default, but this option isn't. Change the configuration object in  accordion10.html to the following:  var accOpts = {   clearStyle: true,   animated: "easeOutBounce" };  Save this as accordion11.html. Now when the page is run, the accordion will  not keep to a fixed size; it will grow or shrink depending on how much content is   in each panel. It doesn't make much of a difference in this example, but the property  really comes into its own when using dynamic content, when we may not always  know how much content will be within each panel when the panel content changes  frequently.  Accordion events The accordion exposes three custom events, which are listed in the following table:  Event change changestart create  Triggered when… The active header has changed. The active header is about to change. The widget has been created.  [ 101 ]   The Accordion Widget  The change event is triggered every time the active header  and its associated  content panel  is changed. It fires at the end of the content panel's opening  animation, or if animations are disabled, immediately  but still after the active   panel has been changed .  The changestart event is fired as soon as the new header is selected, that is before  the opening animation  or before the active panel has changed, if animations are  disabled . The create event is fired as soon as the widget has been initialized.  Using the change event Let's see how we can use these events in our accordion implementations. In                  accordion11.html, change the configuration object so that it appears as follows:  var accOpts = {   change: function e, ui  {     $ ".notify" .remove  ;     $ " ", {       "class": "notify",       text:  [         ui.newHeader.find "a" .text  ,         "was activated,",          ui.oldHeader.find "a" .text  ,         "was closed"].join " "              } .insertAfter "myAccordion" .fadeOut 2000, function  {       $ this .remove  ;     } ;   } ;   $ "myAccordion" .accordion accOpts ; } ;  Save this as accordion12.html. In this example, we use the change configuration  option, to specify an anonymous callback function that is executed every time the  active panel is changed. This function will automatically receive two objects as  arguments. The first object is the event object, which contains the original browser  event object.  The second argument is an object, which contains useful information about the  widget, such as the header element that was activated  ui.newHeader  and the  header that was deactivated  ui.oldHeader . The second object is a jQuery object,  so we can call jQuery methods directly on it.  [ 102 ]   Chapter 4  In this example, we navigate down to the   element within the header and display  its text content in an information box, which is appended to the page and then  removed after a short interval with a fading animation.  For reference, the ui object also provides information on the content panels in the  form of ui.newContent and ui.oldContent properties.   Once a header has been activated, and its content panel shown, the notification will  be generated:  The changestart event The changestart event can be used in exactly the same way, and any callback  function we specify using this event also receives the e and ui objects to use.  Change the configuration object from the last example to as follows:  var accOpts = {   changestart: function e, ui  {   $ " ", {     "class": "notify",     text:  [ui.newHeader.find "a" .text  ,      "was activated,", ui.oldHeader.find "a" .text  ,      "was closed"].join " "     } .insertAfter "myAccordion" .fadeOut 2000, function  {     $ this .remove  ;   } ; };  [ 103 ]   The Accordion Widget  Save this as accordion13.html. All that's changed, is the property that we're  targeting with our configuration object. When we run the page, we should find that  everything is exactly as it was before, except that our notification is produced before  the content panel animation instead of after it.  There are also events such as accordionchange and accordionchangestart for use  with the standard jQuery bind   method, so that we can specify a callback function  to execute outside of the accordion configuration.  Accordion navigation Along with a standard content accordion, the widget can also be put to good use as  a navigation menu through the simple addition of some proper href attributes and  the navigation option. We'll need to create two new pages to fully appreciate the  effect of this option. In accordion13.html, change the underlying markup for the  accordion to the following:              About Me                My Bio         Contact Me         My Resume                              Tutorials         AJAX        <a href="accordionJS.htmljs" title="JavaScript           Apps">JavaScript Apps                      Page 1         Then change the configuration object, so that it appears as follows:  var accOpts = {   navigation: true };  [ 104 ]   Chapter 4  Save this file as accordion14.html, then save it again as accordionMe.html  and accordionJS.html, to give us the two extra example pages we need for this  example. In the   of the page, we've added a new outer container to hold  all the page content and have added two inner containers within this—one for the  accordion widget that will appear as a navigation menu, and the other for content.   In this example, the two pages just have   elements denoting which page is open.  The underlying markup that the accordion is built from has also changed. We've  added classnames and href attributes to the links within the accordion headers that  include fragment identifiers. Adding the href is critical to the functioning of the  navigation accordion.  In the final   element, we set the navigation option to true.  The navigation option changes how the widget appears when the page is  initially loaded.  Instead of activating the first header when the accordion is initialized, it instead  looks at the location.href property of the window. If the contents of the  location.href property match the href attribute of one of the accordion headers,  that header will be activated.  When we run accordion14.html in a browser, and select one of the links in the  second content panel, the page will navigate to accordionJS.html and the second  header will automatically be activated. The navigation property gives us a great  way of maintaining state between pages for the widget.  We also need some additional styles in order to make sure that the accordion   and the page appear correctly. In a new page in your text editor, create the   following file:  navCol { width:250px; float:left; }  contentCol { float:left; } contentCol h1 { text-indent:20px; font-family:Georgia; } navCol .ui-accordion-header {   display:block; padding-left:40px; } .ui-accordion-content a {   font-size:70%; text-decoration:none; display:block; } .ui-accordion-content a:hover { text-decoration:underline; }  Save this in the css folder as accordionTheme2.css. We don't need many styles for  this example; we just need to arrange the containers and set some basic aesthetics for  the accordion and the links within it.  [ 105 ]   The Accordion Widget  The following screenshot shows how the page will appear when navigating from          accordion14.html to accordionJS.html:  When going back to the first page from the second page, the first header should once  again be activated.  Accordion methods The accordion includes a selection of methods that allow you to control and  manipulate the behavior of the widget programmatically. Some of the methods   are common to each component of the library, such as the destroy method that  is used by every widget. The following table lists the unique methods for the  accordion widget:  Method activate  resize  Use Programmatically activates a header. This is analogous to the header  being selected by the visitor. Resizes the accordion when the fillSpace option is set to true  and when the contents on an accordion has changed.  In addition to the accordion-specific activate and resize  methods, the destroy, enable, disable, option, and widget  methods are also available.  [ 106 ]   Chapter 4  Header activation The activate method can be used to programmatically show or hide different  drawers. We can easily test this method using a textbox and a new button. In  accordion15.html, add the following new markup directly after the accordion:   Enter a header index to activate     Activate   Now change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     $ "myAccordion" .accordion  ;     $ "activate" .click function   {       $ "myAccordion" .accordion "activate",        parseInt $ "activateChoice" .val  , 10  ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save the new file as accordion15.html. The activate method takes an additional  argument. It expects to receive the index  zero-based  number of the header element  to activate. In this example, we obtain the header to activate, by returning the value  of the text input. We convert it to an integer using the parseInt   function of  JavaScript because the val   jQuery method returns a string.  If an index number that doesn't exist is specified, nothing will happen. The first  header will be activated if no index is specified. If a value other than an integer is  specified, nothing will happen; the script will fail silently, without errors, and the  accordion will continue to function as normal.  Resizing an accordion panel Change the underlying markup for the accordion widget in accordion11.html, so  that the third header points to a remote text file and the third panel is empty. The  heading element should also be given an id attribute:        Header 1      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.       Aenean sollicitudin. Sed interdum pulvinar justo. Nam iaculis       volutpat ligula. Integer vitae felis quis diam laoreet       ullamcorper.  [ 107 ]   The Accordion Widget          Header 2      Etiam tincidunt est vitae est. Ut posuere, mauris at sodales       rutrum, turpis tellus fermentum metus, ut bibendum velit enim eu       lectus. Suspendisse poten-ti.         Remote           Then change the final   element, so that it appears as follows:   function $ {   var accOpts = {     changestart: function e, ui  {       if  ui.newHeader.attr "id"  === "remote"  {         $.get ui.newHeader.find "a" .attr "href" ,         function data  {           ui.newHeader.next  .text data ;         } ;       }     },     change: function e, ui  {       ui.newHeader.closest "myAccordion" .accordion "resize" ;     }   };   $ "myAccordion" .accordion accOpts ; }  jQuery ;  Save this file as accordion16.html. In our configuration object, we use the  changestart event to check whether the id of the element matches the id we gave  to our remote accordion heading.  If it does, we get the contents of the text file specified in the   element's href  attribute, using jQuery's get   method. If the request returns successfully, we add  the contents of the text file to the empty panel after the header. This all happens  before the panel opens.  We then use the change event to call the resize method on the accordion, after the  panel has opened.  When we run the page in a browser, the contents of the remote text file should be  sufficient to cause a scroll bar to appear within the content panel. Calling the resize  method allows the widget to read just itself, so that it can contain all of the newly  added content without displaying the scroll bar.  [ 108 ]   The widget will automatically display the configured spinner when  loading remote content.  Chapter 4  Accordion interoperability Does the accordion widget play nicely with other widgets in the library? Let's take  a look and see whether the accordion can be combined with the widget from the  previous chapter, the tabs widget.  Change the underlying markup for the accordion, so that the third content panel  now contains the markup for a set of tabs, and the third heading no longer points   to the remote text file:        Header 1      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.       Aenean sollicitudin. Sed interdum pulvinar justo. Nam iaculis       volutpat ligula. Integer vitae felis quis diam laoreet       ullamcorper.         Header 2      Etiam tincidunt est vitae est. Ut posuere, mauris at sodales       rutrum, turpis tellus fermentum metus, ut bibendum velit enim eu       lectus. Suspendisse potenti.         Header 3                                 Tab 1               Tab 2                   This is the content panel linked to the first          ab, it is shown by default.         This content is linked to the second tab and           will be shown when its tab is clicked.               [ 109 ]   The Accordion Widget  We should also link to the source file for the tabs widget, after the accordion's source  file. Next, change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     $ "myAccordion" .accordion  ;     $ "myTabs" .tabs  ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this file as accordion17.html. All we've done with this file is add a simple tab  structure to one of the accordion's content panels. In the   at the end of the  page, we just call the accordion and tab's widget methods. No additional or special  configuration is required.  The page should appear as follows, when the third accordion heading is activated:  The widgets are compatible the other way round; that is we can have an accordion  within one of the tab's content panels without any adverse effects as well.  [ 110 ]   Chapter 4  Summary We first looked at what the accordion does and how it is targeted by the CSS  framework. We then moved on, to look at the configurable options that can be used  with accordion. We saw that we can use these options to change the behavior of the  widget, such as specifying an alternative heading to be open by default, whether the  widget should expand to fill the height of its container, or the event that triggers the  opening of a content drawer.  Along with configurable options, we saw that the accordion exposes several custom  events. Using them, we can specify callback functions during configuration, or bind  to them after configuration to execute additional functionality, in reaction to different  things happening to the widget.  Next, we looked at the accordion's default animation and how we can add simple  transition effects to the opening of content panels in the form of easing effects.   We saw that to make use of non-standard animations or easing effects, the   jquery.effects.core.js file needs to be included.  In addition to looking at these options, we also saw that there are a range of methods  which can be called on the accordion to make it do things programmatically. Like  the tabs widget that we looked at in the previous chapter, the accordion is a flexible  and robust widget that provides essential functionality in an aesthetically pleasing  format. In the next chapter, we get to play with the dialog widget, which allows us to  create a flexible, highly configurable overlay that floats above the page and displays  any content we specify.  [ 111 ]    The Dialog  Traditionally, the way to display a brief message or ask a visitor a question would've  been to use one of JavaScript's native dialog boxes  such as alert or confirm , or to  open a new web page with a predefined size, styled to look like a dialog box.  Unfortunately, as I'm sure you're aware, neither of these methods is particularly  flexible to us as developers, or particularly engaging for our visitors. For each  problem they solve, several new problems are usually introduced.  The dialog widget lets us display a message, supplemental content  such as images  or text , or even interactive content  such as forms . It's also easy to add buttons, such  as simple ok and cancel buttons to the dialog, and define callback functions for them  in order to react to their being clicked; the dialog can also be modal or non-modal.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   	 Creating a basic dialog  	 Working with dialog options  	 Modality  	 Enabling the built-in animations  	 Adding buttons to the dialog  	 Working with dialog callbacks  	 Controlling the dialog programmatically   The Dialog  The following screenshot shows a dialog widget and the different elements that it is  made of:  Creating a basic dialog A dialog has a lot of default behavior built-in, but few methods are needed to  control it programmatically, making this an easy-to-use widget that is also highly  configurable and powerful.  Generating the widget is simple and requires a minimal underlying markup  structure. The following page contains the minimum markup that's required   to implement the dialog widget:                    <link rel="stylesheet"        href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">      Dialog                           Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.   [ 114 ]   Chapter 5          Aenean sollicitudin. Sed interdum pulvinar justo. Nam iaculis           volutpat ligula. Integer vitae felis quis diam laoreet           ullamcorper. Etiam tincidunt est vitae est.           <script        src="development-bundle jquery-1.4.4.js">           <script        src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.core.js">           <script        src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.widget.js">           <script       src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.position.js">           <script         src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.dialog.js">                    function $ {         $ "myDialog" .dialog  ;  Save this file as dialog1.html in the jqueryui project folder. To use the dialog, the  following dependencies are required:       }  jQuery ;               	 jquery-ui-x.x.x.custom.css  	 jquery-x.x.x.js  	 jquery.ui.core.js  	 jquery.ui.widget.js  	 jquery.ui.position.js  	 jquery.ui.dialog.js   	 jquery.ui.mouse.js  	 jquery.ui.draggable.js  	 jquery.ui.resizable.js  [ 115 ]  Optionally, we can also include the following files to make the dialog draggable   and resizable:   The Dialog  The dialog widget is initialized in the same way as the other widgets that we have  already looked at—by calling the widget's plugin method. When you run this  page in your browser, you should see the default dialog widget, as shown in the  screenshot at the start of this chapter.  As with the previous widgets we've covered, a variety of classnames from the CSS  framework are added to different elements within the widget to give them the  appropriate styling for their respective elements, and any additional elements   that are required are created on the fly.   The dialog in the first example is fixed both in size and position, and will be  positioned in the top-left of the viewport. We can make the widget draggable,  resizable, or both easily. All we need to do is include the draggable and resizable  component's source files, as well as the mouse utility, with the other    resources at the end of the  .  It's not important that the draggable and resizable files are included in the page  before the dialog's source file, they can come before or after, and the widget will still  inherit these behaviors. Any styling that is required, such as the resize indicator that  appears in the bottom-left of the dialog, will be picked up automatically from the  master CSS file.  Add the following three   elements directly before the closing   tag  in dialog1.html:      <script     src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.draggable.js">   <script     src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.resizable.js">    Save this as dialog2.html and view it in a browser. The dialog should now be  draggable and can be moved to any part of the viewport, but will not cause it to  scroll if the widget is moved to an edge.  The dialog should also be resizable—by clicking and holding the resize indicator  in the bottom-right and dragging, the widget can be made bigger or smaller. If the  dialog is made bigger than the viewport, then it will cause the window to scroll.  [ 116 ]   Dialog options An options object can be used in a dialog's widget method to configure various  dialog options. Let's look at the available options:  Chapter 5  Option autoOpen  Default value true  buttons  {}  closeOnEscape true  closeText dialogClass  disabled draggable  height hide maxHeight maxWidth minHeight minWidth modal position  close ""  false true  auto null false false 150 150 false center  resizable  true  show  stack  null  true  Used to… Shows the dialog as soon as the dialog   method  is called, when set to true. Supplies an object containing buttons to be used  with the dialog. Each key becomes the text on   the   element, and each value is a callback  function, which is executed when the button is  clicked. If set to true, the dialog will close when the Esc key  is pressed. Sets the text on the close button. Sets additional classnames on the dialog for theming  purposes. Disables the widget. Makes the dialog draggable  use   jquery.ui.draggable.js . Sets the starting height of the dialog. Sets an effect to be used when the dialog is closed.  Sets a maximum height for the dialog. Sets a maximum width for the dialog. Sets a minimum height for the dialog. Sets a minimum width for the dialog. Enables modality while the dialog is open. Sets the starting position of the dialog in the  viewport. Can accept a string, or an array of strings,  or an array containing exact coordinates of the  dialog offset from the top and left of the viewport   use jquery.ui.position.js . Makes the dialog resizable  also requires   jquery.ui.resizable.js .  Sets an effect to be used when the dialog   is opened. Causes the focused dialog to move to the front,  when several dialogs are open.  [ 117 ]   The Dialog  Option title  width zIndex  Default value ""  300 1000  Used to… Alternative to specifying the title attribute on the  widget's underlying container element. Sets the starting width of the dialog. Sets the starting CSS z-index of the widget. When  using multiple dialogs and the stack option is set  to true, the z-index will change as each dialog is  moved to the front of the stack.  As you can see, we have a wide range of configurable options to work with when  implementing the dialog. Many of these options are Boolean, or numerical, or   string-based, making them easy to set and work with.  Showing the dialog In our examples so far, the dialog has been displayed as soon as the page has  loaded. The autoOpen option is set to true by default, so the dialog will be  displayed as soon as it has been initialized.   We can change this, so that the dialog is opened when something else occurs, like  a button being clicked, by setting the autoOpen option to false. Change the final    element at the bottom of dialog2.html to the following:      $ function  {     var dialogOpts = {       autoOpen: false     };     $ "myDialog" .dialog dialogOpts ;   }     Save this as dialog3.html. The widget is still created; the underlying markup is  removed from the page, transformed into the widget, and then re-appended to the  end of the  . It will remain hidden until the open method is called on it. We'll  come back to this option when we look at the open method, a little later on.  The title of the dialog The options table shows a title option. Although the title of the dialog   the actual text in the header of the widget  can be set using the title attribute  of the underlying HTML container element, using the title configuration option  gives us more control over how the title is displayed on the widget.  [ 118 ]   Chapter 5  By default, the title text of the dialog will not be selectable and will also not be  displayed in the operating system's default tool tip style. When using the title  attribute on the underlying element, the text will appear within a   element,  which is inside a   with the class name ui-dialog-titlebar. These elements  will appear in the header of the widget.  If we want to inject additional elements into the DOM structure of the dialog    for additional styling perhaps or different behavior , we could do it using the   title option. Change the configuration object in dialog3.html to the following:  var dialogOpts = {   title: ' A link title! ' };  Save this file as dialog4.html. The change in the widget should be apparent  immediately; the span element in the widget header will now contain our new link  element. The following screenshot shows our new title:  As a cautionary note, I should advise that the system will display  the default OS tooltip, and if a title attribute is specified on  any new elements we add to the widget in this way.  Modality One of the dialog's greatest assets is modality. This feature creates an overlay  that covers the underlying page below the dialog while it is open. The overlay is  removed as soon as the dialog is closed. None of the underlying page content can   be interacted with in any way while the dialog is open.  [ 119 ]   The Dialog  The benefit of this feature is that it ensures the dialog is closed before the underlying  page becomes interactive again, and gives a clear visual indicator to the visitor that  the dialog must be interacted with before they can proceed.  Change the configuration object in dialog4.html to the following:  var dialogOpts = {   modal: true };   This file can be saved as dialog5.html. Only a single property is required when  adding modality and that is the modal option. When you view the page in a browser,  you'll see the modal effect immediately.  The repeated background image that is used to create the overlay is styled completely  by the CSS framework and is therefore fully themeable through ThemeRoller. We can  also use our own image if we need to. The class name ui-widget-overlay is added to  the overlay, so this is the selector to override if customization is required.  The following screenshot shows the modal effect  I've added some fake content to  the page, so that the effect of the modal can be fully appreciated :  [ 120 ]   Adding buttons The button option accepts an object literal that is used to specify the different    elements that should be present on the dialog. Each property:value pair  represents a single button. Let's add a couple of   elements to our dialog.  Modify the final   element in dialog5.html so that it appears as follows:  Chapter 5       function $ {     var execute = function   { },     cancel = function   { },     dialogOpts = {       buttons: {         "Ok": execute,         "Cancel": cancel       }     };     $ "myDialog" .dialog dialogOpts ;   }  jQuery ;     Save the file as dialog6.html. The key for each property in the buttons object is  the text that will form the   label, and the value is the name of the callback  function to execute when the button is clicked. The buttons option can take either an  object, as in this example, or an array of objects. In this example the execute   and  cancel   functions don't do anything; we'll come back to this example shortly and  populate them.  The widget will add our new buttons to their own container at the foot of the dialog,  and if the dialog is resized then this container will retain its original dimensions. The    elements are fully themeable and will be styled according to the theme in  use. The following screenshot shows how our new   elements would appear:  [ 121 ]   The Dialog  Enabling dialog animations The dialog provides us with a built-in effect that can be applied to the opening  or closing  or both  phases of the widget. There is only a single effect that we   can use, which is an implementation of the scale effect  we'll look at this in more  detail in Chapter 13, Sorting . Change the final   element in dialog6.html  to the following:       function $ {     var dialogOpts = {       show: true,       hide: true     };     $ "myDialog" .dialog dialogOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as dialog7.html. We set both the hide and show options to the Boolean  value true. This enables the built-in effect, which gradually reduces the dialog's size  and opacity until it gracefully disappears. The following screenshot shows an effect  in motion:  We can enable or disable either the show or hide animations individually using  Booleans, as we have in this example, or we may specify the type of animation to be  used, by supplying a string specifying the name of the effect to use.  [ 122 ]   Configuring the dialog's dimensions There are several options related to the dialog's size, and the minimum and  maximum size that it can be resized to. We can add all of these options to the next  example as they're all related, to save looking at them individually. Change the  configuration object in dialog7.html to the following:  Chapter 5  var dialogOpts = {   width: 500,   height: 300,   minWidth: 150,   minHeight: 150,   maxWidth: 600,   maxHeight: 450 };  Save this file as dialog8.html. The effect these options have on the widget is simple;  the width and height options define how big the dialog is when it is first opened,  while the min- and max- options define how small or large the dialog can be resized  to respectively.  As an additional note, assistive technologies and keyboard users may find the  content difficult to navigate if the dialog is made too small. There is a usability tenet  that insists dialog boxes should always be non-resizable, whereas windows should  always be resizable.  While I don't think this is a black-and-white, set in granite rule, it may be wise to  keep small, informational, text-based dialogs at a fixed size, while allowing dialogs  richer in content, composed of both images and text, to be resizable.  Stacking The dialog is made, so that it appears above any of the existing page content, and  even provides the zIndex option, in case we need to raise it slightly to cover our  existing content. But what if we have two dialogs on the page? Do we need to  separately define the zIndex for each dialog? How is focus taken into consideration?  Let's see if we can answer these questions by looking at another example; change the    of dialog8.html, so that it has two dialog boxes on it:      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.       Aenean sollicitudin. Sed interdum pulvinar justo. Nam aculis       volutpat ligula. Integer vitae felis quis diam laoreet       ullamcorper. Etiam tincidunt est vitae est.  [ 123 ]   The Dialog        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean       sollicitudin. Sed interdum pulvinar justo. Nam iaculis volutpat       ligula. Integer vitae felis quis diam laoreet ullamcorper. Etiam       tincidunt est vitae est.    Now change the final   element so that it appears as follows:      $ function  {     $ "dialog1, dialog2" .dialog  ;  } ;    Save this file as dialog9.html. We've added another dialog to the page, which  is basically just a clone of the original, with different id and title attributes.  In the  , we simply call the widget method on both of our underlying  dialog containers.  Because the widget method is called last on the second dialog, the second dialog   will automatically have a higher zIndex, so we don't need to worry about  configuring it separately. The order in which the dialogs appear in the underlying  markup doesn't matter; it's the order of the widget methods that dictates each  dialog's zIndex.  Because neither dialog has its position explicitly set, only the second dialog will be  visible when our example page loads. However, both are draggable and we can align  them so that they overlap slightly, by dragging the second dialog away. If we click  on the first dialog box, its zIndex will automatically be increased to one higher than  the second dialog box.  The stack option is set to true by default, so all of this behavior is automatically  available with no additional configuration from us. If for some reason this behavior  is not desired, then we can disable it by supplying false as the value of the  stack option.  Dialog's event model The dialog widget gives us a wide range of callback options that we can use to  execute arbitrary code at different points, in any dialog interaction. The following  table lists the options available to us:  [ 124 ]   Chapter 5  Event beforeclose close create drag dragStart dragStop focus open resize resizeStart resizeStop  Fired when… The dialog is about to be closed. The dialog is closed. The dialog is initialized. The dialog is being dragged. The dialog starts being dragged. The dialog stops being dragged. The dialog receives focus. The dialog is opened. The dialog is being resized. The dialog starts to be resized. The dialog stops being resized.  Some of these callbacks are only available in certain situations, such as the drag and  resize callbacks, which will only be available when the draggable and resizable  jQuery UI components are included. We won't be looking at these callback options in  this chapter, as they'll be covered in detail later in the book.  Other callbacks such as the beforeClose, create, open, close, and focus callbacks  will be available in any implementation. Let's look at an example in which we make  use of some of these callback options.  Remove the second dialog from the page in dialog9.html, and add the following  new markup directly after the first dialog:  <div id="status" class="ui-widget ui-dialog ui-corner-all    ui-widget-content">   <div class="ui-widget-header ui-dialog-titlebar       ui-corner-all">Dialog Status                Now change the final   element, so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     var dialogOpts = {       open: function   {         $ "status" .children ":last" .text "The dialog is open" ;       },  [ 125 ]   The Dialog        close: function   {         $ "status" .children ":last" .text "The dialog is closed" ;       },       beforeclose: function   {         if  $ ".ui-dialog" .css "width"  > 300  {           return false;         }       }     };     $ "dialog1" .dialog dialogOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as dialog10.html. The page contains a new status box, which will be  used to report whether the dialog is open or closed. We've given the elements that  make up the status box of several CSS framework classes, to make them fit with the  theme in use.  Our configuration object uses the open, close, and beforeclose options to specify  simple callback functions. The open and close callbacks simply set the text of the  status box accordingly. The beforeclose callback, which is fired after the close  button on the dialog has been clicked but before it is actually closed, is used to  determine whether or not to close the dialog.  We use a simple if statement to check the width of the dialog; if the dialog is greater  than 300 px wide, we return false from the callback and the dialog remains open.  This kind of behavior is of course usually a big no in terms of usability, but it does  serve to highlight how we can use the beforeclose callback to prevent the dialog  being closed.  When the page loads and the dialog is shown, the open callback will be executed and  the status box should display a message. When the dialog is closed, as shown in the  following screenshot, a different message is displayed:  [ 126 ]   One thing I should make clear is that the dialog widget only passes a single object   the original event object  to the callback functions. It does pass a second ui object  into the handler function, although in this release of the library, this object contains  no properties.  Chapter 5  Controlling a dialog programmatically The full list of the methods we can call on a dialog is as follows:  Method close destroy  Used to… Close or hide the dialog. Permanently disable the dialog. The destroy method for a dialog works  in a slightly different way than it does for the other widgets we've seen  so far. Instead of just returning the underlying HTML to its original state,  the dialog's destroy method also hides it. Temporarily disable the dialog. Enable the dialog if it has been disabled. Determine whether a dialog is open or not.  disable enable isOpen moveToTop Move the specified dialog to the top of the stack. open option widget  Open the dialog. Get or set any configurable option after the dialog has been initialized. Return the outer element that the dialog   widget method is called on.  Toggling the dialog We first take a look at opening the widget, which can be achieved with the simple  use of the open method. Let's revisit dialog3.html, in which the autoOpen option  was set to false, so that the dialog did not open when the page was loaded. Add the  following   to the page:   Toggle dialog!   Then add the following click-handler directly after the dialog's widget method:  $ "toggle" .click function   {   if !$ "myDialog" .dialog "isOpen"   {     $ "myDialog" .dialog "open" ;   } else {     $ "myDialog" .dialog "close" ;   } } ;  [ 127 ]   The Dialog  Save this file as dialog11.html. To the page, we've added a simple   that  can be used to either open or close the dialog depending on its current state. In the    element, we've added a click handler for the   that checks, the  return value of the isOpen method. If it does not return true, the dialog is not open,  so we call its open method, else we call the close method.  The open and close methods both trigger any applicable events; for example, the  close method first fires the beforeclose and then the close events. Calling the  close method is analogous to clicking the close button on the dialog.  Getting data from the dialog Because the widget is a part of the underlying page, passing data to and from it is  simple. The dialog can be treated as any other standard element on the page. Let's  look at a basic example.  We looked at an example earlier in the chapter which added some    elements to the dialog. The callback functions in that example didn't do anything,  but this example gives us the opportunity to use them. Replace the existing dialog  markup in dialog6.html with the following:   Please answer the opinion poll:        Is jQuery UI the greatest JavaScript widget library?        Yes!       <input type="radio" id="yes"       value="yes" name="question" checked="checked">     No!            Now change the final   element as follows:       function $ {     var execute = function  {       var answer =  $ "myDialog" .find "input:checked" .val  ;       $ " " .text "Thanks for selecting " + answer . appendTo $ "body"  ;       $ "myDialog" .dialog "close" ;      }  [ 128 ]   Chapter 5      var cancel = function   {       $ "myDialog" .dialog "close" ;     }     var dialogOpts = {       buttons: {         "Ok": execute,         "Cancel": cancel       }     };     $ "myDialog" .dialog dialogOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as dialog12.html. Our dialog widget now contains a set of radio  buttons, some   elements, and some text. The purpose of the example is  to get the result of which radio is selected, and then do something with it, when   the dialog closes.  We start the   by filling out the execute function that will be attached as the  value of the Ok property in the buttons object, later in the script. It will therefore be  executed each time the Ok button is clicked. In this function, we use the :checked filter to determine which of the radio buttons  is selected. We set the value of the answer variable to the radio button's value, and  then created a short message along with appending it to the   of the page. The  callback mapped to the Cancel button is simple; all we do is close the dialog using  the close method.  The point of this trivial example was to see that getting data from the dialog is   as simple as getting data from any other element on the page.  Dialog interoperability In previous chapters, we've combined multiple widgets so that we can see how well  they work together, and this chapter will be no exception. We can easily place other  UI widgets into the dialog, such as the accordion widget that we looked at in the  previous chapter. In a new file in your text editor, create the following page:                     Dialog        [ 129 ]   The Dialog      <link rel="stylesheet"         href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                                 Header 1                       Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

The underlying markup for the accordion widget is  placed into the dialog's container element, and we just call each component's widget  method in the  . The combined widget should appear like this:  In this example, we use quite a few separate   resources.  It is worth remembering that for production use, we should use  the combined and minified script file, which contains all of the  components we selected in the download-builder.  [ 131 ]   The Dialog  Creating a dynamic image-based dialog The class behind the dialog widget is compact and caters to a small range of  specialized behavior, much of which we have already looked at. We can still have  some fun with a dynamic dialog box, which loads different content depending   on which element triggers it. The following image shows the kind of page we'll   end up with:  In a new page in your text editor, add the following code:                 [ 132 ]   Chapter 5       Dialog           <link rel="stylesheet"         href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                                Some Common Flowers                           click a thumbnail to view a full-size image                                                           Helianthus annuus                    Sunflowers  Helianthus annuus  are annual plants native to               the Americas, that possess a large flowering head                                                                    Lilium columbianum                    The Lilium columbianum is a lily native to western North               America. It is also known as the Columbia Lily or Tiger               Lily                                                                    Myosotis scorpioides                    The Myosotis scorpioides, or Forget-me-not, is a             herbaceous perennial plant of the genus Myosotis.                    [ 133 ]   The Dialog                                                   Nelumbo nucifera                    Nelumbo nucifera is known by a number of names including;             Indian lotus, sacred lotus, bean of India, or simply lotus.                                                                                         <script       src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.accordion.js">                                                  Save this file as dialog14.html. The page is relatively straightforward—we've got  an outer container which encloses everything and an element which we've given the  class name ui-widget-header. We've used the latter in order to pick up some of the  default styling from the theme in use.  Following this, we have some explanatory text followed by a series of containers.  Several classnames are given to these containers, some of which are so that we  can style them, and others  such as ui-helper-clearfix , in order to pick up  framework or theme styles.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 5  Within each of these containers is an image, wrapped in an anchor, a subheading,  and some descriptive text. After the outer container becomes the empty,    element is used for the dialog. In this example, we don't use the resizable feature.  Each of the thumbnail images is wrapped in a link, in order for the page to function  even with JavaScript disabled. The dialog widget won't work in this situation, but  the visitor will still be able to see a full-sized version of each image. Progressive  enhancement such as this is essential in this kind of application.  Now add the following   block directly before the closing   tag:       function $ {     var filename,     titleText,     dialogOpts = {       modal: true,       width: 388,       height: 470,       autoOpen: false,       open: function   {         $ "dialog" .empty  ;         $ " ", {           src: fileName         } .appendTo "dialog" ;         $ "dialog" .dialog "option", "title", titleText ;       }     };     $ "dialog" .dialog dialogOpts ;     $ "thumbs" .find "a" .click function e  {       e.preventDefault  ;       filename = $ this .attr "href" ;       titleText = $ this .attr "title" ;       $ "dialog" .dialog "open" ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    The first thing we do is define three variables; the first variable is used to add the  path to the full-sized image of whichever thumbnail was clicked, the second is  to store the image title to use, as the text for the widget's title, and the third is the  configuration object for the dialog. We've seen all of the configuration options in  action already, so I won't go over most of them in much detail.  [ 135 ]   The Dialog  The open callback, called directly before the dialog is opened, is where we add the  full-sized image to the dialog. We first empty the dialog, then create a new    element, and set its src to the value of the filename variable. The new   is then  appended to the inner content area of the dialog.  We then use the option method to set the title option to the value of the  titleText variable. Once the open callback has been defined, we then call the  dialog's widget method as normal.  We can use the wrapper   elements as the triggers to open the dialog. Within our  click-handler, we set the contents of our filename and titleText variables using  the href and title attributes of the link that was clicked. We then call the dialog's  open method to display the dialog, which in turn triggers the callback function  specified in the open option.  We'll also need a new style sheet for this example. In a new page in your text editor,  add the following code:  thumbs {   width:342px; padding:10px 0 10px 10px;    border:1px solid ccc; background-color:eee; } thumbs p {   width:330px; font-family:Verdana; font-size:9px;   text-align:center; } .thumb {   width:310px; height:114px; padding:10px;   border:1px solid ccc; border-bottom:none;  } .last { border-bottom:1px solid ccc; } .thumb img {   border:1px solid ccc; margin-right:10px; float:left;    cursor:pointer;   } .thumb h3 { margin:0; float:left; width:198px; } thumbs .thumb p {   width:310px; margin:0; font-family:Verdana; font-size:13px;   text-align:left;  } thumbs .ui-widget-header { width:330px; text-align:center; }  [ 136 ]   Chapter 5  Many of these styles have been used in previous examples, but adding some  new rules for the other page elements lets us see the dialog in real-world context.  Save this as dialogTheme.css in the css folder. We also use some images in this  example, which can be found in the img folder in the accompanying code download  for this book.  This should now give us the page that we saw in the previous screenshot and when a  thumbnail is clicked, the full size version of the same image will be displayed:  Summary The dialog widget is specialized and caters to the display of a message or question  in a floating panel that sits above the page content. Advanced functionality such  as dragging and resizing, are directly built-in and require just the inclusion of an  additional script file for each feature. Other features such as the excellent modality  and overlay are easy to configure.  [ 137 ]   The Dialog  We started out by looking at the default implementation, which is as simple as  with the other widgets we have looked at so far. We then examined the range of  configurable options exposed by the dialog's API. We can make use of them to enable  or disable built-in behavior such as modality, or set the dimensions of the widget. It  also gives us a wide range of callbacks that allow us to hook into custom events fired  by the widget during an interaction.  We then took a brief look at the built-in opening and closing effects that can be used  with the dialog, before moving on to see the basic methods we can invoke, in order  to make the dialog do things, such as open or close.  In the next chapter, we'll move on to look at the slider widget, which allows us to  create an interactive form widget used to select from a predefined range of values.  [ 138 ]   The Slider Widget  The slider component allows us to implement an engaging and easy-to-use widget  that our visitors should find attractive and intuitive to use. Its basic function is  simple. The slider background represents a series of values that are selected by  dragging the thumb along the background.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   	 The default slider implementation  	 Custom styling for sliders  	 Changing configuration options  	 Creating a vertical slider  	 Setting minimum, maximum, and default values  	 Enabling multiple handles and ranges  	 The slider's built-in event callbacks  	 Slider methods   Before we roll up our sleeves and begin creating a slider, let's look at the   different elements that it is made from. The following screenshot shows a   typical slider widget:  It's a simple widget, as you can see, comprised of just two main elements—the slider  handle, also called the thumb, and the slider background, also called the track.   The Slider Widget  Implementing a slider Creating the default, basic slider takes no more code than any of the other widgets  that we have looked at so far. The underlying HTML markup required is also  minimal. Let's create a basic one now. In a new page in your text editor, add the  following code:                    <link rel="stylesheet"         href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">      Slider                                                                                                    function $ {         $ "mySlider" .slider  ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this file as slider1.html and view it in your browser. On the page is a simple  container element; this will be transformed by the widget into the slider track. In  the   at the end of the  , we select this element and call the slider  method on it. The   element that is used for the slider handle will be automatically  created by the widget.  [ 140 ]   When we run this page in a browser, we should see something similar to  the previous screenshot. We've used several library resources for the default  implementation, including the following files:  Chapter 6   	 jquery-ui-x.x.x.custom.css  	 jquery-x.x.x.js  	 jquery.ui.core.js  	 jquery.ui.widget.js  	 jquery.ui.mouse.js  	 jquery.ui.slider.js  The default behavior of a basic slider is simple but effective. The thumb can be  moved horizontally along any pixel of the track on the x-axis by dragging the  thumb with the mouse pointer, or using the left down or right up arrow keys of the  keyboard. Clicking anywhere on the track with the left or right mouse button will  instantly move the handle to that position.  Custom styling Because of its simplicity, the slider widget is extremely easy to create a custom theme  for. Using ThemeRoller is the recommended method of theming, but to completely  change the look and feel of the widget, we can easily create our own theme file. In  your text editor create the following style sheet:  . background-div {   height:50px; width:217px; padding:36px 0 0 24px;   background:url .. img slider_outerbg.gif  no-repeat; } mySlider {   width:184px; height:23px; border:none; position:relative;   left:4px; top:4px;   background:url .. img slider_bg.gif  no-repeat; } mySlider .ui-slider-handle {   width:14px; height:30px; top:-4px;   background:url .. img slider_handle.gif  no-repeat; }  [ 141 ]   The Slider Widget  Save this file as sliderTheme.css in the css directory. In slider1.html, add a link  to the style sheet in the   of the page  after the jQuery UI style sheet , and wrap  the underlying slider element in a new container:               Resave the file as slider2.html. With a minimum of CSS and a few images  these  can be found in the code download , we can easily but considerably modify the  widget's appearance, as shown in the following screenshot:  Of course, this example is completely arbitrary, and was intended purely to show  how to override the default theme.  Configurable options Additional functionality, such as vertical sliders, multiple handles, and stepping  can also be configured using an object literal, passed into the widget method when  the slider is initialized. The options that can be used in conjunction with the slider  widget are listed in the following table:  Option animate  Default value false  disabled max min orientation  false 100 0 auto  Used to… Enable a smooth animation of the slider handle  when the track is clicked. Disable the widget when it is initialized. Set the maximum value of the slider. Set the minimum value of the slider. Set the axis along which the slider thumb is  moved. This can accept the strings vertical or  horizontal.  [ 142 ]   Chapter 6  Option range step  Default value false 1  value  0  values  null  Used to… Create a style-able range element between them. Set the distance of the step the handle will take  along the track. The max value must be equally  divisible by the supplied number. Set the value of the slider thumb when the  widget is initialized. Accept an array of values. Each supplied integer  will become the value of a slider handle.  Creating a vertical slider To make a vertical slider, all we need to do is set the orientation option to  vertical; the widget will do the rest for us.  In slider1.html, change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     var sliderOpts = {       orientation: "vertical"     };     $ "mySlider" .slider sliderOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save the new file as slider3.html. We just need to set this single option to put  the slider into vertical mode. When we launch the page, we see that the slider  operates exactly as it did before, except that it now moves along the y-axis, as in the  following screenshot:  The widget defaults to 100 px in height, if we don't provide our own CSS height  rule for the slider track.  [ 143 ]   The Slider Widget  Minimum and maximum values By default, the minimum value of the slider is 0 and the maximum value is 100,  but we can change these values easily using the min and max options. Change the  configuration object in slider3.html to the following:  var sliderOpts = {   min: -50,   max: 50 };  Save this as slider4.html. We simply specify the integers that we'd like to set as  the starting and end values. Because the value option is set to 0 by default, when  we run this file, the slider thumb will start in the middle of the track, half way  between -50 and 50.  When the slider handle, in this example, is at the minimum value, the value method   see the methods section  will return -50, as we would expect.  Slider steps The step option refers to the number and position of steps along the track that the  slider's handle jumps, when moving from the minimum to the maximum positions  on the track. The best way to understand how this option works is to see it in action,  so change the configuration object in slider4.html to the following:  var sliderOpts = {   step: 25 };  Save this version as slider5.html. We set the step option to 25 in this example. We  haven't set the min or max options, so they will take the default values of 0 and 100  respectively. Hence, by setting step to 25, we're saying that each step along the track  should be a quarter of the track's length, because 100  the maximum  divided by 25   the step value  is 4. The thumb will therefore take four steps along the track, from  beginning to end.  The max value of the slider should be equally divisible by whatever value we set  as the step option, other than that, we're free-to-use whatever value we wish.  This is a useful option for confining the value selected by visitors, to one of a set of  predefined values.  If we were to set the value of the step option, in this example, to 27 instead of 25,  the slider would still work, but the points along the track that the handle stepped to,  would not be equal.  [ 144 ]   Slider animation The slider widget comes with a built-in animation that moves the slider handle  smoothly to a new position, whenever the slider track is clicked. This animation  is disabled by default, but we can easily enable it by setting the animate option to  true. Change the configuration object in slider5.html, so that it is as follows:  Chapter 6  var sliderOpts = {   animate: true }  Save this version as slider6.html. The difference this option makes to the overall  effect of the widget is extraordinary. Instead of the slider handle just moving  instantly to a new position when the track is clicked, it smoothly slides there.  If the step option is configured to a value other than 1, and the animate option is  enabled, the thumb will slide to the nearest step mark on the track. This may mean  that the slider thumb moves past the point that was clicked.  Setting the slider's value The value option, when set to true in a configuration object, determines the starting  value for the slider thumb. Depending on what we want the slider to represent, the  starting value of the handle may not be 0. If we wanted to start at half-way across the  track instead-of at the beginning, we could use the following configuration object:  var sliderOpts = {   value: 50 }  Save this file as slider7.html. When the file is loaded in a browser, we see that the  handle starts halfway along the track instead of at the beginning, exactly as it did  when we set the min and max options earlier on. We can also set this option after  initialization, to programmatically set a new value.  Using multiple handles I mentioned earlier that a slider may have multiple handles; additional handles can  be added using the values option. It accepts an array, where each item in the array is  a starting point for a handle. We can specify as many items as we wish, up to the max  value  taking step into account :  var sliderOpts = {   values: [25, 75] };   [ 145 ]   The Slider Widget  Save this variation as slider8.html. This is all we need to do; we don't need to  supply any additional underlying markup. The widget has created both new handles  for us, and as you'll see, they both function exactly as a standard single handle does.  The following screenshot shows our dual-handled slider:  When a slider has two or more handles, each handle may move past the other  handle s  without issue.  The range element When working with multiple handles, we can set the range option to true. This  adds a styled range element between two handles. In slider8.html, change the  configuration object to this:  var sliderOpts = {   values: [25, 75],   range: true };  Save this page as slider9.html. When the page loads, we should see that a styled    element now connects our two handles, as in the following screenshot:  A maximum of two handles can be used in conjunction with the range option, but  we can also enable it with a single handle as well; change the configuration object in  the previous example to the following:  var sliderOpts = {   range: "min" };  [ 146 ]   Chapter 6  Save this as slider10.html. Along with the Boolean value true, we can also supply  one of the string values "min" or "max", but only when a single handle is in use.  In this example, we set it to "min", so when we move the slider handle along the  track, the range element will stretch from the start of the track to the slider handle.   If we set the option to "max", the range will stretch from the handle to the end of  the track.  When using two handles and a range, the two handles may not cross each other   on the track.  Using slider's event API In addition to the options we saw earlier, there are another four options used to  define functions that are executed at different times during a slider interaction.   Any callback functions that we use, are automatically passed by the standard   event object and an object representing the slider. The following table lists the   event options we can use:   Event change slide start stop  Fired when… The slider's handle stops moving, and its value has changed. The slider's handle moves. The slider's handle starts moving. The slider's handle stops moving.  Hooking into these built-in callback functions is extremely easy. Let's put a basic  example together to see. Change the configuration object in slider10.html, so that  it appears as follows:  var sliderOpts = {   start: function   {     $ "tip" .fadeOut function   {       $ this .remove  ;     } ;   },   change: function e, ui  {     $ "  ", {       "class": "ui-widget-header ui-corner-all",       id: "tip",       text: ui.value + "%",       css: {         left: e.pageX - 35  [ 147 ]   The Slider Widget        }     } .appendTo "mySlider" ;   } };  Save this as slider11.html. We use two of the callback options in this example— start and change. In the start function, we select the tool tip element if it exists,  and fade it out with jQuery's fadeOut   method. Once hidden from view, it is  removed from the page.  The change function will be executed each time the value of the slider handle  changes; when the function is called, we create the tool tip and append it to the  slider. We position it so that it appears above the center of the slider handle and give  it some of the framework classnames in order to style it with the theme in use.  In several places, we use the second object passed to the callback function, the  prepared ui object that contains useful information from the slider. In this example,  we use the value option of the object to obtain the new value of the slider handle.  We also need a very small custom style sheet for this example. In a new page in your  text editor, add the following code:  mySlider { margin:60px auto 0; } tip {   position:absolute; display:inline; padding:5px 0;   width:50px; text-align:center; font:bold 11px Verdana; }  Save this file as sliderTheme2.css in the css folder, and link to it from the    of slider11.html. When displayed, our tool tip should appear as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 148 ]   When all of the event options are used together, the events will be fired in the  following order:  Chapter 6   	 start  	 slide  	 stop  	 change  The slide callback can be quite an intensive event as it is fired on every mouse- move while the handle is selected, but it can also be used to prevent a slide in certain  situations by returning false from the callback function. When using the stop and  change callbacks together, the change callback may override the stop callback.  As with all library components, each of these events can also be used with   jQuery's bind  method by prefixing the word slider to the event name, for  example, sliderstart.  Slider methods The slider is intuitive and easy-to-use, and like the other components in the library,  it comes with a range of methods that are used to programmatically control the  widget after it has been initialized. The methods specific to the slider are shown in  the following table:  Method value  values  Used to… Set a single slider handle to a new value. This will move  the handle to the new position on the track automatically.  This method accepts a single argument which is an integer  representing the new value. Set the specified handle to move to a new value when multiple  handles are in use. This method is exactly the same as the  value method, except that it takes two arguments—the index  number of the handle followed by the new value.   The methods destroy, disable, enable, option, and widget are common to all  components, and work in the same way with slider that we would expect them to.  The value and values methods are exclusive to the slider, and are used to get or  set the value of single or multiple handles. Of course, we can also do this using the  option method, so these two methods are merely shortcuts to cater for common  implementational requirements. Let's take a look at them in action. First of all, let's  see how the value method can be used.  [ 149 ]   The Slider Widget  In slider11.html, remove the   to sliderTheme2.css and add a new    element to the page, directly after the slider container:   Set to max value   Now, change the final   element so that it is as follows:       function $ {     $ "mySlider" .slider  ;     $ "setMax" .click function   {       var maxVal = $ "mySlider" .slider "option", "max" ;       $ "mySlider" .slider "value", maxVal ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this file as slider12.html. We add a click handler for our new  ;  whenever it is clicked, this method will first determine what the maximum value for  the slider is, by setting a variable to the result of the option method, specifying max  as the option we'd like to get. We don't need a configuration object in this example.  Once we have the maximum value, we then call the value method, passing in the  variable that holds the maximum value as the second argument; our variable will  be used as the new value. Whenever the button is clicked, the slider handle will  instantly move to the end of the track.  Working with multiple handles is just as easy, but involves a slightly different  approach. Remove the setMax button in slider12.html, and add these two  buttons directly after the slider element:   Preset 1  low     Preset 2  high     Now change the final   element at the end of the   to the following:      $ function  {      var sliderOpts = {       values: [25, 75]     };      $ "mySlider" .slider sliderOpts ;     $ ".preset" .click function   {  [ 150 ]   Chapter 6        if  this.id === "low"  {         $ "mySlider" .slider "values", 0, 0 ;         $ "mySlider" .slider "values", 1, 25 ;       } else {         $ "mySlider" .slider "values", 0, 75 ;         $ "mySlider" .slider "values", 1, 100 ;       }     } ;   } ;    Save this file as slider13.html. To trigger multiple handles, we specify the  values of two handles in our configuration object. When either of the two     elements on the page are clicked, we work out which button was  clicked and then set the handles to either low values or high values, depending   on which button was clicked.  The values method takes two arguments. The first argument is the index number of  the handle we'd like to change, and the second argument is the value that we'd like  the handle to be set to. Notice that we have to set each handle individually and that  we can't chain the two methods together. This is because the method returns the new  value and not a jQuery object  this is fixed in an upcoming version of the library .  The following screenshot shows how the page should appear after the second button  is clicked:   Practical uses An HTML5 element that may lend itself particularly well to implementations of  the slider widget, is the   element. This element will automatically add  controls that enable the visitor to play, pause, and adjust the volume of the media  being played.  [ 151 ]   The Slider Widget  The default controls, however, at this point anyway, do not appear to be style-able,  so if we wish to change their appearance, we need to create our own controls.   The slider widget of course, makes an excellent substitution for the default   volume control.  Create the following new page in your text editor:              <link rel="stylesheet"         href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">            Slider                   <audio id="audio"         src="http:  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia         en 7 77 Jamiroquai_-_Snooze_You_Lose.ogg">       Your browser does not support the  audio           element.                                                                                            function $ {         var audio = $ "audio" [0],         sliderOpts = {           value: 5,           min: 0,           max: 10,           orientation: "vertical",           change: function   {             var vol = $ this .slider "value"    10;  [ 152 ]   Chapter 6              audio.volume = vol;           }         };         audio.volume = 0.5;         audio.play  ;         $ "volume" .slider sliderOpts ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as slider14.html. On the page, we have the   tag, which has its  src attribute set to a copyright-free audio clip hosted on Wikipedia. We also have  the empty container element for our volume control.  This example uses a hosted OGG file as the source for the audio  player. The OGG codec is supported in Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 3+,  and Opera 11+.  In the script we first select the   element using the standard jQuery syntax  and retrieve the actual DOM element from the jQuery object, so that we can call  methods from the   API.  Next, we define the configuration object for our slider; we set the initial minimum  and maximum values, and set the slider to vertical. We then add a handler for the  change event, which is used to change the volume of the currently playing audio  track, using the volume property and play   method. Whenever the value of the  slider is changed, we get the new value and convert it to the required format for the  volume option, by dividing it by 10.  Once our variables are defined, we set the volume of the audio clip and begin  playing the clip immediately with the play   method.  When we run this example in a supporting browser, the only thing visible on   the page will be the volume slider, but we should also be able to hear the audio   clip. Whenever the slider handle is moved, the volume of the clip should increase   or decrease.  [ 153 ]   The Slider Widget  A color slider A fun implementation of the slider widget, which could be very useful in certain  applications, is the color slider. Let's put what we've learned about this widget into  practice to produce a basic color choosing tool. The following screenshot shows the  page that we'll be making:  In a new file in your text editor, create the following page:                    <link rel="stylesheet"         href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">            Slider              <div id="container" class="ui-widget ui-corner-all ui-        widget-content ui-helper-clearfix">        R:                   G:                   B:                 <div id="colorBox" class="ui-corner-all ui-widget-          content">                        Color value:   [ 154 ]   Chapter 6                                                                                $ function  {         var sliderOpts = {           min:0,           max: 255,           value: 255,           slide: function   {             var r = $ "rSlider" .slider "value" ,             g = $ "gSlider" .slider "value" ,             b = $ "bSlider" .slider "value" ;             var rgbString = ["rgb ", r, ",", g, ",", b, " "]               .join "" ;             $ "colorBox" .css {               backgroundColor: rgbString             } ;             $ "output" .val rgbString ;           }         };         $ "rSlider, gSlider, bSlider" .slider sliderOpts ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as slider15.html. The page itself is simple enough. We've got some  elements used primarily for displaying the different components of the color slider,  as well as the individual container elements, which will be transformed into slider  widgets. We use three sliders for our color chooser, one for each RGB channel.  [ 155 ]   The Slider Widget  We'll need some CSS as well to complete the overall appearance of our widget. In a  new page in your text editor, create the following style sheet:  container {   width:426px; height:146px; padding:20px 20px 0;    position:relative; font-size:11px; background:eee; } container label {   float:left; text-align:right; margin:0 30px 26px 0;   clear:left; } .ui-slider { width:240px; float:left; } .ui-slider-handle { width:15px; height:27px; } colorBox {   width:104px; height:94px; float:right; margin:-83px 0 0 0;   background:fff; } container outputLabel {   float:right; margin:-14px 34px 0 0; } output {   width:100px; text-align:center; float:right; clear:both;   margin-top:-17px; }  Save this as colorSliderTheme.css in the css folder.  In our script, we give various elements such as the container and color box elements,  classnames from the CSS framework, so that we can take advantage of effects like   the rounded corners, and so that we can cut down on the amount of CSS we need   to write ourselves.  The JavaScript is as simple as the underlying markup. We first set the configuration  object. As RGB color values range from 0 to 255, we set the max option to 255 and the  value option to 255 as well, so that the widget handles start in the correct location   the color box will have a white background on page load .  The slide callback is where the action happens. Every time a handle is moved,  we update each of the r, g, and b variables, by using the value method in getter  mode, and then construct a new RGB string from the values of our variables. This  is necessary, as we can't pass the variables directly into jQuery's css   method. We  also update the value in the   field.  [ 156 ]   When we run the example, we should find that everything works as expected.  As soon as we start moving any of the slider handles, the color box begins to   change color and the   updates.  Chapter 6  The slide event is a potentially intensive event that may cause  issues in older browsers or on slow computers. Care should be  taken when used in a production environment.  Summary In this chapter, we looked at the slider widget and saw how quickly and easily it can  be put on the page. It requires minimal underlying markup and just a single line of  code to initialize.  We looked at the different options that we can set, in order to control how the slider  behaves and how it is configured once it's initialized. It can be fine-tuned to suit a  range of implementations.  We also saw the rich event model that can easily be hooked into, and reacted to, with  up to four separate callback functions. This allows us to execute code at important  times, during an interaction.  Finally, we looked at the range of methods that can be used to programmatically  interact with the slider, including methods for setting the value of the handle s , or  getting and setting configuration options after initialization.  These options and methods turn the widget into a useful and highly functional  interface tool that adds an excellent level of interactivity to any page.  In the next chapter, we look at the datepicker widget, which has the biggest,  most feature-packed API of any widget in the library, and includes full  internationalization.  [ 157 ]    The Datepicker Widget  The jQuery UI datepicker widget is probably the most refined and documented  widget found in the library. It has the biggest API and probably provides the most  functionality out of all the widgets. It not only works completely out-of-the-box, but  is also highly configurable and robust.  Quite simply, the datepicker widget provides an interface that allows visitors to your  site or application to select dates. Wherever a form field is required that asks for a  date to be entered, the datepicker widget can be added. This means your visitors get  to use an attractive and engaging widget, and you get dates in the format in which  you expect them. It's easy for everyone, and that's the attraction.  In this section, we will look at the following topics:  Implementing a trigger button   	 The default datepicker implementation  	 Exploring the configurable options  	  	 Configuring alternative animations  	 The dateFormat option  	 Easy internationalization  	 Multiple month datepickers  	 Date range selection  	 Datepicker's methods  	 Using AJAX with the datepicker  Additional functionality built into the datepicker includes automatic opening and  closing animations along with the ability to navigate the interface of the widget using  the keyboard. While holding down the Ctrl key  or Command key on the Mac , the  arrows on the keyboard can be used to choose a new day cell, which can then be  selected using the Return key.   The Datepicker Widget  While easy to create and configure, the datepicker is a complex widget made up of a  wide range of underlying elements, as shown in the following screenshot:  Despite this complexity, we can implement the default datepicker with just   a single line of code, much like the other widgets in the library that we have   covered so far.  The default datepicker To create the default datepicker, add the following code to a new page in your  text editor:                    <link rel="stylesheet"       href = "development-bundle themes smoothness ui.all.css">      Datepicker                    Enter a date:                                [ 160 ]   Chapter 7                                 function $ {         $ "date" .datepicker  ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as datePicker1.html in the jqueryui project folder. All we have on the  page is a   and a standard text   element. We don't need to specify  any empty container elements for the datepicker widget to be rendered into. All of  the markup required to create the widget is automatically added by the library.  When you run the page in your browser and focus on the   element, the  default datepicker should appear below the input and will look like the screenshot   at the start of the chapter. Along with an  , the datepicker can also be  attached to a   element.  Apart from looking great, the default datepicker also comes with a lot of built-in  functionality. When the datepicker opens, it is smoothly animated from zero to  full size, and it will automatically be set to the present date. Selecting a date will  automatically add the date to the   and close the calendar  again with a  nice animation .  With no additional configuration and a single line of code, we now have a perfectly  usable and attractive widget that makes date selection easy. If all you want is to let  people pick a date, then this is all that you need. The source files required for the  default datepicker are the following:   	 jquery-x.x.x.js  	 jquery.ui.core.js  	 jquery.ui.datepicker.js  [ 161 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Configurable options of the datepicker The datepicker has a large range of configurable options  currently 46 to be exact .  The following table lists the basic options, their default values, and gives a brief  description of their usage:  autoSize  false  Option altField  altFormat  appendText  buttonImage  buttonImageOnly  buttonText  calculateWeek  changeMonth  changeYear constrainInput  Usage Specifies a CSS selector for an  alternative   field to which  the selected date is also added. Specifies an alternative format for  the date added to the alternative   . See the dateFormat  option in the later section for  clarification on the value this  option takes. Adds text after the datepicker    to show the format of the  selected date. Automatically sets the width of  the   element so that it can  accommodate a date according to  the specified dateFormat. Specifies a path to the image to use  for the trigger  . Sets to true to use an image  instead of a trigger button. Provides text to display on a  trigger    if present . Accepts a function, used to  calculate the week of the year for a  specified date. Show the month change   drop-down. Show the year change drop-down. Constrains the   to the  format of the date, specified by   the widget.  Default value ""  ""  ""  ""  false  "..."  false  false true  $.datepicker. iso8601Week  [ 162 ]   Chapter 7  Usage Sets the date that will be  highlighted when the datepicker  opens and the   is empty. Disables the datepicker. Sets the speed at which the  datepicker opens. Sets the current day link to move  the datepicker to the currently  selected date instead of today. Hides the prev next links   when not needed, instead of  disabling them. Sets the maximum date that can be  selected. Accepts a date object or a  relative number. For example: +7,  or a string such as "+6m". Sets the minimum date that can be  selected. Accepts a number, date  object, or string. Allows us to specify month   names using the prev, next, and  current links. Sets the number of months shown  on a single datepicker. Allows days in previous or   next months that are shown   on the current month's panel    see the showOtherMonths  option  to be selected. Determines the current  century when using the y year  representation; numbers less  than this are deemed to be in the  current century. Sets the animation used when the  datepicker is displayed.  Option defaultDate  Default value null  disabled duration  false "normal"  gotoCurrent  false  hideIfNoPrevNext  false  maxDate  minDate  null  null  navigationAsDateFormat  false  numberOfMonths  1  selectOtherMonths  false  shortYearCutoff  "+10"  showAnim  "show"  [ 163 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Option showButtonPanel  Default value false  showCurrentAtPos  0  showOn  "focus"  showOptions  {}  showOtherMonths  showWeek  false  false  stepMonths  1  yearRange  "-10:+10"  Usage Shows a panel of buttons for the  datepicker, consisting of close and  current links. Sets the position of the current  month in multiple-month  datepickers. Sets the event that triggers  displaying the datepicker. It's an object literal containing  options to control the configured  animation. Shows the last and first days of the  previous and next months. Displays a column showing  the week of the year. The  week is determined using the  calculateWeek option. Sets how many months are  navigated with the previous   and next links. Specifies the range of years in the  year drop-down.  Basic options Change the final   element in datepicker1.html to the following:       function $ {     var pickerOpts = {       appendText: "mm dd yy",       defaultDate: "+5",       showOtherMonths: true     };     $ "date" .datepicker pickerOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    [ 164 ]   Save this as datePicker2.html. The following image shows how the widget will  look after configuring these options:  Chapter 7  We've used a number of options in this example because there are simply so many  options available—the appearance of the initial page, before the datepicker is even  shown, can be changed using the appendText option. This adds the specified text  string using a   element directly after the   field, which is associated  with the picker. This helps visitors to clarify the format that will be used for the date.  For styling purposes, we can target the new   element using the  .ui-datepicker-append classname.  The defaultDate option sets which date is highlighted in the datepicker, when  it opens initially and the   is empty. We've used the relative "+5" string  in this example, so when the datepicker opens initially, the date five days from  the current date is selected. Pressing the Enter key on the keyboard will select the  highlighted date.  Along with a relative string, we can also supply null as the value of defaultDate to  set it to the current date  today subjectively , or a standard JavaScript date object.  As we can see in the previous screenshot, the styling of the datepicker date for the  current date is different from the styling used to show the default date. This will vary  between themes, but for reference, the current date is shown in a light yellow color,  while the default date has a darker border than normal dates with the default theme.  [ 165 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Once a date has been selected, subsequent openings of the datepicker will show the  selected date as the default date, which again has different styling  a preselected date  with the smoothness theme will be white .  By setting the showOtherMonths option to true, we've added grayed-out   non-selectable  dates from the previous and next months to the empty squares   that sit at the beginning and end of the date grid, before and after the current   month. These are visible in the previous screenshot and are rendered in a much  lighter color than selectable dates.  Minimum and maximum dates By default, the datepicker will go forward or backward infinitely, there are no  upper or lower boundaries. If we want to restrict the selectable dates to a particular  range, we can do it easily using the minDate and maxDate options. Change the  configuration object in datePicker2.html to the following:  var pickerOpts = {   minDate: new Date  ,   maxDate: "+10" };  Save this as datePicker3.html. In this example, we supply a standard, unmodified  JavaScript date object to the minDate option, which will set the minimum date to the  current date. This will make any dates in the past un-selectable.  For the maxDate option, we use a relative text string of "+10", which will make only  the current date and the next 10 dates selectable. You can see how these options  affect the appearance of the widget in the following screenshot:  [ 166 ]   The minDate and maxDate options can also take strings such  as "+6w"  , "-10m", or "1y", which represent weeks, months,  and years respectively.  Chapter 7  Changing the elements in the datepicker UI The datepicker API exposes a number of options directly related to adding or  removing additional UI elements within the datepicker. To show   elements  that allow the visitor to choose the month and year, we can use the changeMonth and  changeYear configuration options:  var pickerOpts = {   changeMonth: true,   changeYear: true };  Save this as datePicker4.html. Using the month and year   elements,  gives the user a much quicker way to navigate to dates that may be far in the past   or future. The following screenshot shows how the widget will appear with these  two options enabled:  [ 167 ]   The Datepicker Widget  By default, the year select box will include the previous and next 10 years, covering a  total range of 20 years. We can navigate further than this using the prev next arrow  links, but if we know beforehand that visitors may be choosing dates very far in the  past or future, we can change the range of years using the yearRange option:  var pickerOpts = {   changeMonth: true,   changeYear: true,   yearRange: "-25:+25" };  var pickerOpts = {   showButtonPanel: true };  Save this as datePicker5.html. This time when we run the page, we should find  that the year range now covers 50 years in total.  Another change we can make to the UI of the datepicker is to enable the button  panel, which adds two buttons to the footer of the widget. Let's see it in action.  Change the configuration object in datepicker5.html, so that it appears as follows:  Save this as datePicker6.html. The buttons added to the foot of the widget appear  exactly as the buttons in a dialog widget, as you can see in the following screenshot:  [ 168 ]   Chapter 7  The Today button will instantly navigate the datepicker back to the month showing  the current date, while the Done button will close the widget without selecting a  date. We can change the Today button, so that it goes to the selected date instead of  the current date using the gotoCurrent option.  Adding a trigger button By default, the datepicker is opened when the   element that it is associated  with, receives focus. However, we can change this very easily, so the datepicker  opens when a button is clicked instead. The most basic type of   can  be enabled with just the showOn option. Change the configuration object in  datePicker6.html, so that it is as follows:  var pickerOpts = {   showOn: "button" };  Save this as datePicker7.html. Setting the showOn option to true in our  configuration object will automatically add a simple   element directly  after the associated   element. We can also set this option to both, so that it  opens when the   is focused as well as when the   is clicked.  The datepicker will now open only when the   is clicked, rather than when  the   is focused. This option also accepts the string value both, which opens  the widget when the   is focused and when the   is clicked. The new    is shown in the following screenshot:  The default text shown on the    an ellipsis  can easily be changed by  providing a new string as the value of the buttonText option; change the previous  configuration object to this:  var pickerOpts = {   showOn: "button",   buttonText: "Open Picker" };  [ 169 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Save this as datePicker8.html. Now, the text on the   should match the  value that we set as the buttonText option:  Instead of using text as the label of the   element, we can use an image. This  is configured using the buttonImage option:  var pickerOpts = {   showOn: "button",   buttonText: "Open Picker"   buttonImage: "img cal.png", };  Save this as datePicker9.html. The value of the buttonImage option is a string,  consisting of the path to the image that we'd like to use on the button. Notice that  we also set the buttonText option in this example too; the reason for this is that the  value of the buttonText option is automatically used as the title and alt attributes  of the   element that is added to the  . Our trigger button should now  look as shown in the following screenshot:  We don't need to use a button at all if we don't want to; we can replace the     element with an   element instead. Change the configuration  object in datePicker9.html, so that it appears as follows:  var pickerOpts = {   showOn: "button",   buttonImage: "img date-picker cal.png",   buttonText: "Open Picker",   buttonImageOnly: true };  [ 170 ]   Save this as datePicker10.html. This should give you a nice image-only button, as  illustrated in the following screenshot:  Chapter 7  Configuring alternative animations The datepicker widget comes with an attractive built-in opening animation that  makes the widget appear to grow from nothing to full size. Its flexible API also  exposes several options related to animations. These are the duration, showAnim,  and showOptions configuration options.  The simplest animation configuration that we can set is the speed at which the  widget opens and closes. To do this, all we have to do is change the value of the  duration option. This option requires a simple string that can take a string value  of either slow, normal  the default , or fast, or a number representing a duration  in milliseconds.  Change the configuration object in datePicker10.html to the following:  var pickerOpts = {   duration: "fast" };  Save this variation as datePicker11.html. When we run this page in a browser, we  should find that the opening animation is visibly faster.  Along with changing the speed of the animation, we can also change the animation  itself using the showAnim option. The default animation used is a simple show  animation, but we can change this so that it uses any of the other show hide effects  included with the library  refer to Chapter 13, Sorting . Change the configuration  object from the previous example to the following:  var pickerOpts = {   showAnim: "drop",   showOptions: {direction: "up"} };  [ 171 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Save this as datePicker12.html. We also need to use two new   resources  to use alternative effects. These are the jquery.effects.core.js and the source file  of the effect we wish to use, in this example, jquery.effects.drop.js. We'll look at  both of these effects in more detail in Chapter 14, UI Effects, but they are essential for  this example to work. Make sure you add these to the file, directly after the source  file for the datepicker:               Our simple configuration object configures the animation to drop, using the  showAnim option, and sets the direction option of the effect using showOptions,  which is required due to the datepicker's absolute positioning. When you now run  this example, the datepicker should drop-down into position instead of opening.  Other effects can be implemented in the same way.  Multiple months So far, all of our examples have looked at single-month datepickers, where only one  month was shown at a time. However, we can easily adjust this to show a different  number of months, if we wish using a couple of configuration options. Remove the  effect source files before the configuration object in datePicker12.html, and change  the configuration object so that it appears as follows:  var pickerOpts = {   numberOfMonths: 3  };  Save this as datePicker13.html. The numberOfMonths option takes an integer  representing the number of months that we would like to be displayed in the   widget at any point. Our datepicker should now appear like this:  [ 172 ]   Chapter 7  There is no upper limit to the number of months that will be  displayed; however, the performance of the widget decreases  with each additional month shown. There is also a noticeable lag  between focusing the   and the widget being displayed.  Also, the individual month panels are floated side-by-side, and due to their size, they  will soon overflow the viewport causing a horizontal scrollbar to appear. However,  as-soon-as the scrollbar is used, the datepicker will close, making any months that go  beyond the boundary of the screen unusable. For these reasons, it's best to keep the  number of months displayed to a minimum.  There are several other configuration options related to multiple-month datepickers.  The stepMonths option controls how many months are changed when the previous  or next links are used.  The defau lt value of stepMonths is 1, so in our previous example, the widget starts  with the current month displayed first and the next two months after it. Each time  the Previous or Next icons are clicked, the panels move one space left or right. If we set stepMonths to 3, the same as the number of months shown, each month  will move three spaces left or right when the previous or next links are clicked, so  entirely new panels are shown on each click.  The showCurrentAtPos option specifies where the current month is shown when the  datepicker is displayed. In our previous example, the current month is shown as the  first month panel. Each month panel has a zero-based index number, so if we want  the current month to be in the middle of the widget, then we would set this option   to 1 instead.  [ 173 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Changing the date format The dateFormat option is one of the localization options at our disposal for  advanced datepicker locale configuration. Setting this option allows you to quickly  and easily set the format of selected dates  as displayed in the   , using a  variety of short-hand references. The format of dates can be a combination of any of  the following characters  they are case-sensitive :   	 d: day of month  single digit where applicable   	 dd: day of month  two digits   	 m: month of year  single digit where applicable   	 mm: month of year  two digits   	 y: year  two digits   	 yy: year  four digits   	 D: short day name  	 DD: full day name  	 M: short month name  	 MM: long month name  	 '...': any literal text string  	 @: UNIX timestamp  milliseconds since 01 01 1970   We can use these shorthand codes to quickly configure our preferred date format, as  in the following example. Change the configuration object in datePicker13.html to  the following:  var pickerOpts = {   dateFormat:"d MM yy" };  Save the new file as datePicker14.html. We use the dateFormat option to specify a  string containing the shorthand date code for our preferred date format. The format  we set is the day of the month  using a single digit if possible  with d, the full name  of the month with MM, and the full four-digit year with yy.  When dates are selected and added to the associated  , they will be in the  format specified in the configuration object, as in the following screenshot:  [ 174 ]   Chapter 7  Note that dates returned programmatically through the getDate method  see  Datepicking methods section  are in the default GMT date-and-time standard. In  order to change the format of the date returned by the API, the $.datepicker. formatDate   utility method should be used.  When using  a string as the value of this option to configure dates, we can also  specify whole strings of text. However, if we do and any letters in the string are   those used as shorthand, they will need to be escaped using single quotes.  For example, to add the string Selected: to the start of the date, we would need to  use the string Selecte'd': to avoid having the lowercase d picked up as the short  day of month format:  var pickerOpts = {   dateFormat:"Selecte'd': d MM yy" };  Save this change as datePicker15.html. Notice how we escape the lowercase d in  the string Selected by wrapping it in single quotes. Now when a date is selected,  our text string is prefixed to the formatted date:  There are also a number of built-in preconfigured date formats that correspond to  common standards or RFC notes. These formats are added to the components as  constants and can be accessed via the $.datepicker object. As an example, let's  format the date according to the ATOM standard:  var pickerOpts = {   dateFormat: $.datepicker.ATOM };  [ 175 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Save this as datePicker16.html. When a date is selected in this example,  the value entered into the   should be in the format as shown in the  following screenshot:   The complete set of predefined date formats is listed in the following table:  Option value $.datepicker.ATOM $.datepicker.COOKIE $.datepicker.ISO_8601 $.datepicker.RFC_822 $.datepicker.RFC_850 $.datepicker.RFC_1036 $.datepicker.RFC_1123 $.datepicker.RFC_2822 $.datepicker.RSS $.datepicker.TIMESTAMP $.datepicker.W3C  Short-hand "yy-mm-dd" "D, dd M y" "yy-mm-dd" "D, d M y" "DD, dd-M-y" "D, d M y" "D, d M yy" "D, d M yy" "D, d M y" @  UNIX timestamp  "yy-mm-dd"  Formatted as… 2011-04-13 Wed, 13 Apr 2011 2011-04-13 Wed, 13 Apr 11 Wednesday, 13-Apr-11 Wed, 13 Apr 11 Wed, 13 Apr 2011 Wed, 13 Apr 2011 Wed, 13 Apr 11 1302649200000 2011-04-13  Updating an additional input element There may be times when we want to update two   elements with the  selected date, perhaps to show a different date format. The altField and altFormat  options can be used to cater to this requirement. Add a second   element to  the page in date-Picker16.html with an id attribute of alt, and then change the  configuration object to the following:  var pickerOpts = {   altField: "alt",   altFormat: $.datepicker.TIMESTAMP };  [ 176 ]   Save this as datePicker17.html. The altField option accepts a standard jQuery  selector as its value, and allows us to select the additional   element that is  updated when the main   is updated. The altFormat option can accept the  same formats as the dateFormat option. The following screenshot shows how the  page should appear, once a date has been selected using the datepicker:  Chapter 7  Localization In addition to the options already listed, there are also a range of regionalization  options. They can be used easily to provide custom locale support in order to easily  display a datepicker with all the text shown in an alternative language, or to change  the default values of words in English.  Those options that are used specifically for localization are listed in the   following table:  Option closeText  Default "Close"  currentText  "Current"  dateFormat  "mm dd yy"  dayNames  dayNamesMin  ["Sunday", "Monday",  "Tuesday",  "Wednesday",  "Thursday", "Friday",  "Saturday"] ["Su", "Mo", "Tu",  "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa"]  Usage Text to display on the close  button. Text to display on the current  link. The format selected dates  should take when added to  the  . An array of names of days in  a week.  An array of two-letter names  of days in a week.  [ 177 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Option dayNamesShort  firstDay  isRTL  monthNames  monthNamesShort  nextText  prevText  showMonthAfterYear  false  yearSuffix  ""  Default ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue",  "Wed", "Thu", "Fri",  "Sat"]  Usage An array of abbreviated  names of days in a week.  false  ["January", "Febru- ary", "March", "April",  "May", "June", "July,  "August", "September",  "October", "November",  "December"] ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar",  "Apr", "May", "Jun",  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep",  "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"] "Next"  "Prev"  Specify the first column of  days in the datepicker. Set the calendar to right-to-left  format. An array of month names.  An array of abbreviated  month names.  Text to display on the   next link. Text to display on the   prev link. Shows the month after   the year in the header of   the widget. An additional text string to  display after the year in the  month header.  A wide range of different translations have already been provided and reside  within the i18n folder in the development-bundle ui directory. Each language  translation has its own source file and to change the default language, all we have to  do is include the source file of the alternative language.  In datePicker1.html, add the following new   element directly after the  link to jquery.ui.datepicker.js:  <script    src="development-bundle ui i18n jquery.ui.datepicker-fr.js">    [ 178 ]   Save this as datePicker18.html and view the results in a browser:  Chapter 7  With just a single link to one new resource, we've changed all of the visible text  in the datepicker to an alternative language, and we don't even need to set any  configuration options. If we wanted to truly internationalize the datepicker, there is  even a roll-up file containing all of the alternative languages, which we can link to.  Custom localization is also very easy to implement. This can be done using a  standard configuration object containing the configured values for the options   from the previous table. In this way, any alternative language, not included in   the roll-up file can be implemented.  For example, to implement a Lolcat datepicker, change the configuration object of  datePicker6.html to the following:  var pickerOpts = {   closeText: "Kthxbai",   currentText: "Todai",   nextText: "Fwd",   prevText: "Bak",   monthNames: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "Mai", "Jun",       "July", "August", "Septembr", "Octobr", "Novembr", "Decembr"],   monthNamesShort: ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "Mai", "Jun", "Jul",       "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"],   dayNames: ["Sundai", "Mondai", "Tuesdai", "Wednesdai", "Thursdai",       "Fridai", "Katurdai"],   dayNamesShort: ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Kat"],  [ 179 ]   The Datepicker Widget    dayNamesMin: ["Su", "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Ka"],   dateFormat: 'dd mm yy',   firstDay: 1,   isRTL: false,   showButtonPanel: true };  Save this change as datePicker19.html. Most of the options are used to provide  simple string substitutions. However, the monthNames, monthNamesShort, dayNames,  dayNamesShort, and dayNamesMin options require arrays.  Note that the dayNamesMin and other day-related arrays should begin with Sunday   or the localized equivalent . We've set Monday to appear first in this example using  the firstDay option. Our datepicker should now appear like this:  Callback properties The final set of configuration options are related to the event model exposed by the  widget. It consists of a series of callback functions that we can use to specify the code  to be executed at different points during an interaction with the datepicker. These are  listed in the following table:  Event beforeShow beforeShowDay  Fired when… The datepicker is about to open. Each individual date is rendered in the  datepicker. Can be used to determine  whether the date should be selectable or not.  [ 180 ]   Chapter 7  Fired when…  Event onChangeMonthYear The current month or year changes. onClose onSelect  The datepicker is closed. A date is selected.  To highlight how useful these callback properties are, we can extend the previous  internationalization example to create a page that allows visitors to choose any  available language found in the i18n roll-up file.  When using the roll-up file, the language displayed by the datepicker will be  whichever language happens to appear last in the source file, which at the time   of writing is Taiwanese. We can change this by setting the regional utility of  the datepicker.  In datePicker19.html, add the following new   box to the page with the  following   elements:       English     Arabic     Algerian Arabic     Azerbaijani     Bulgarian     Bosnian     Catalan     Czech     Danish     German     Greek     English Australia     English New Zealand     English United States     Esperanto     Spanish     Estonian     Euskarako     Farsi     Finnish     Faroese     French     Swiss-French     Galician     Hebrew     Croatian   [ 181 ]   The Datepicker Widget     Hungarian     Armenian     Indonesian     Icelandic     Italian     Japanese     Korean     Kazakh     Lithuanian     Latvian     Malayalam     Malaysian     Dutch     Norwegian     Polish     Brazillian     Portuguese     Romansh     Romanian     Russian     Slovakian     Slovenian     Albanian     Serbian     Swedish     Tamil     Thai     Turkish     Ukrainian     Vietnamese     Chinese     Chinese     Taiwanese     Next link to the i18n.js roll-up file as follows:       [ 182 ]   Chapter 7  Now change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     var pickerOpts = {       beforeShow: function   {          var lang = $ ":selected", $ "language"  .attr "id" ;          $.datepicker.setDefaults $.datepicker.regional[lang] ;       }     };     $ "date" .datepicker pickerOpts ;     $.datepicker.setDefaults $.datepicker.regional[''] ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this file as datePicker20.html. We use the beforeShow callback to specify  a function that is executed each time the datepicker is displayed on the screen.  Within this function, we obtain the id attribute of the selected   element  and then pass this to the $.datepicker.regional option. This option is set using  the $.datepicker.setDefaults   utility method.  When the page first loads, the   element won't have a selected    child, and because of the order of the i18n roll-up file, the datepicker will be set to  Taiwanese. In order to set it to default English, we can set the regional utility to an  empty string after the datepicker has been initialized.  The following screenshot shows the datepicker after an alternative language has  been selected in the   element:  [ 183 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Utility methods We used one of the utility methods available in a datepicker in the previous  example—setDefaults is used to set configuration options on all datepicker  instances. In addition to this, there are several other utility methods that we can   use; these are shown in the following table:  Utility formatDate  iso8601Week  noWeekends  parseDate  regional setDefaults  Used to… Transform a date object into a string in a specified format.  When using the dateFormat option, dates are returned in this  specified format using the formatDate method. This method  accepts three arguments—the format to convert the date to   see dateFormat in configurable options of the picker , the  date object to convert, and an optional configuration object  containing additional settings. The following options can be  provided: dayNamesShort dayNames monthNamesShort monthNames Return the week number that a specified date falls on according  to the ISO 8601 date-and-time standard. This method accepts a  single argument—the date to show the week number. Make weekend dates unselectable. It can be passed to the  beforeShowDay event. Do the opposite of formatDate, converting a formatted date  string into a date object. It also accepts three arguments—the  expected format of the date to parse, the date string to parse,  and an optional settings object containing the following  options: shortYearCutoff dayNamesShort dayNames monthNamesShort monthNames Set the language of the datepicker. Set configuration options on all datepickers. This   method accepts an object literal containing the new  configuration options.  [ 184 ]   Chapter 7  All of these methods are called on the singleton instance of the $.datepicker  manager object, which is created automatically by the widget on initialization   and used to interact with instances of the datepicker.  Date picking methods Along with the wide range of configuration options at our disposal, there are also a  number of useful methods defined that make working with the datepicker a breeze.  The datepicker API exposes the following unique methods:  Method dialog getDate hide isDisabled refresh setDate show  Used to… Open the datepicker in a dialog widget. Get the currently selected date. Programmatically close a datepicker. Determine whether a datepicker is disabled. Redraw the datepicker. Programmatically select a date.  Programmatically show a datepicker.  The widget can also use the shared API methods discussed in Chapter 1, Introducing  jQuery UI: destroy, disable, enable, option, and widget.  Selecting a date programmatically There may be times when we want to be able to set a particular date from within our  program logic, without the visitor using the datepicker widget in the usual way. Let's  look at a basic example.  Remove the   element in datePicker20.html and directly after the    element add the following  :   Select +7 Days   Now change the final   element so that it appears like this:       function $ {     $ "date" .datepicker  ;       $ "select" .click function   {       $ "date" .datepicker "setDate", "+7" ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    [ 185 ]   The Datepicker Widget  Save this as datePicker21.html. The setDate function accepts a single argument,  which is the date to set. Like with the defaultDate configuration option, we can  supply a relative string  as we do in this example , or a date object.  Showing the datepicker in a dialog box The dialog method produces the same highly usable and effective datepicker  widget, but it displays it in a floating dialog box. The method is easy to use, but  makes some aspects of using the widget non-autonomous, as we shall see.  Remove the   from the page and change the final   element in  datePicker21.html to the following:       function $ {     function updateDate date  {       $ "date" .val date ;     }     $ "date" .focus function   {       $ this .datepicker "dialog", null, updateDate ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as datePicker22.html. First we define a function called updateDate.  This function will be called whenever a date is selected in the datepicker. All we do  within this function is assign the date that is selected, which will be passed to the  function automatically, to our   element on the page.  We use the focus event to call the dialog method, which takes two arguments. In  this example, we've supplied null as the first argument, so the datepicker defaults to  the current date.  The second argument is a callback function to execute when a date is selected, which  is mapped to our updateDate function.  We can also supply additional third and fourth arguments; the third is the  configuration object for the datepicker, the fourth is used to control the position   of the dialog containing the datepicker. By default, it will render the dialog in the  centre of the screen.  [ 186 ]   Chapter 7  An AJAX datepicker  For our final datepicker example, we'll work a little AJAX magic into the mix and  create a datepicker, which will communicate with a server to see if there are any  dates that cannot be selected.  Change the   of datepicker22.html, so that it contains the following  mark-up:             Booking Form               Appointment date:           Save this as datepicker23.html. Our simple example form is made from a series  of container elements and a simple  . Each of the containers has classnames  from the CSS framework, which allow us to take advantage of the styling offered by  the theme in use, helping the elements and the widget to appear consistent.  Now we can add the script that will configure and control the widget; this should go  directly before the   tag:       function $ {     var months = [],     days = [];     $.getJSON        "http:  www.danwellman.co.uk bookedDates.php?jsoncallback=?",  function data  {         for  var x = 0; x < data.dates.length; x++  {           months.push data.dates[x].month ;           days.push data.dates[x].day ;         }         }      ;     function addDates date {       if  date.getDay   == 0  date.getDay   == 6  {         return [false, ""];       }       for  var x = 0; x < days.length; x++  {         if  date.getMonth   == months[x] - 1 &&             date.getDate   == days[x]  {             return [false, "preBooked_class"];  [ 187 ]   The Datepicker Widget          }       }       return [true, ""];      }     var pickerOpts = {       beforeShowDay: addDates,       minDate: "+1"     };     $ "date" .datepicker pickerOpts ;   }  jQuery ;     The first part of our script initially declares two empty arrays, and then performs an  AJAX request to obtain the JSON object from a PHP file. The JSON object contains a  single option called dates. The value of this option is an array, where each item is  also an object.  Each of these sub-objects contain month and day properties, representing one date  that should be made unselectable. The months or days array are populated with the  values from the JSON object for use later in the script.  Next, we define the addDates callback function that is invoked on the  beforeShowDay event. This event occurs once for each of the 35 individual day  squares in the datepicker. Even the empty squares.  This function has passed the date of the current day square and must return an   array containing up to two items. The first is a Boolean indicating whether the   day is selectable, and the second is optionally a classname to give the date.  Our function first checks to see whether the day portion of the current date is equal  to either 0  for Sunday  or 6  for Saturday . If it is, we return false as the first item  in the array to make weekends unselectable.  There is a built-in function of the manager object, $.datepicker. noWeekends   that automatically makes weekends unselectable.  This is specified as the value of the beforeShowDay option when  used, but we cannot use it in this example as we are providing our  own callback function.  We then loop through each item in our months and days arrays to see if any of  the dates passed to the callback function match the items in the arrays. If both the  month and day items match a date, then the array returns with false and a custom  classname as its items. If the date does not match, we return an array containing  true to indicate that the day is selectable. This allows us to specify any number of  dates that cannot be selected in the datepicker.  [ 188 ]   Finally we define a configuration object for the datepicker. The properties of the  object are simply the callback function to make the dates specified in the JSON object  unselectable, and the minDate option, which will be set to the relative value +1, as  we don't want people to select dates in the past, or on the current day.   In addition to the HTML page, we'll also need a little custom styling. In a new page  in your editor, create the following style sheet:  Chapter 7  bookingForm { width:503px; } bookingForm h2 { margin-left:20px; } bookingForm .ui-widget-content {   padding:20px 0; border-top:none; } label {   margin:4px 20px 0; font-family:Verdana; font-size:80%;   float:left; } date { width:302px; } .ui-datepicker .preBooked_class { background:none; } .ui-datepicker .preBooked_class span {   color:ffffff;   background:url .. img date-picker red_horizon.gif  no-repeat; }  Save this as datepickerTheme.css in the css folder. We use PHP to provide the  JSON object in response to the AJAX request made by our page. If you don't want   to install and configure PHP on your web server, you can use the file that I have  placed at the URL specified in the example. For anyone that is interested, the PHP  used is as follows:  <?php   header 'Content-type: application json' ;   $dates = " {     'dates':[       {'month':12,'day':2},       {'month':12,'day':3},       etc     ]   } ";   $response = $_GET["jsoncallback"] . $dates;   echo $response; ?>  [ 189 ]   The Datepicker Widget  This can be saved as bookedDates.php in the main jqueryui project folder.  The pre-booked dates are just hardcoded into the PHP file. Again, in a proper  implementation, you'd probably need a more robust way of storing these dates,   such as in a database.   When we run the page in a browser and open the datepicker, the dates specified by  the PHP file should be styled according to our preBooked_class, and should also be  completely non-responsive, as shown in the following screenshot:  Summary We looked at the datepicker widget in this chapter that is supported by one of  the biggest APIs in the jQuery UI library. This gives us a huge number of options  to work with and methods to receive data from. We first looked at the default  implementation and how much behavior is added to the widget automatically.  We looked at the rich API exposed by the datepicker, which includes more  configurable options than any other component. We also saw how we can use the  utility functions that are unique to the datepicker manager object.  [ 190 ]   Chapter 7  We saw how easy the widget makes implementing internationalization. We also saw  that there are 34 additional languages the widget has been translated into. Each of  these are packed into a module that is easy to use in conjunction with the datepicker  for adding support for alternative languages. We also saw how we create our own  custom language configuration.  We covered some of the events that are fired during a datepicker interaction, and  looked at the range of methods available for working with and controlling the  datepicker from our code.  In the next chapter, we'll take a look at the progressbar widget, which allows us to  show a determinate progress bar indicating the time remaining for a given process.  [ 191 ]    The Progressbar Widget  The progressbar widget is used to show the percentage complete for any arbitrary  process. It's a simple and easy-to-use component with an extremely compact API,  which provides excellent visual feedback to visitors.  We'll look at the following aspects of the widget during this chapter:   	 The default implementation  	 The configurable options  	 The event API exposed by the widget  	 The single unique method exposed by the progressbar  	 Some real-world examples  In the current version of the component, the progressbar is purely determinate, so  we or the system must explicitly tell the widget the current amount of progress. An  indeterminate progressbar is planned for a future release.  The widget is made up of just two nested   elements—an outer container  ,  and an inner  , which is used to highlight the current progress. The following  screenshot shows a progressbar that is 50 percent complete:   The Progressbar Widget  The default progressbar implementation Let's take a look at the most basic progressbar implementation. In a new file in your  text editor, create the following file:                     Progressbar           <link rel="stylesheet"        href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                                                             <script        src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.progressbar.js">                    function $ {         $ "myProgressbar" .progressbar  ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as progressbar1.html in the jqueryui project folder. With no  configuration, the progressbar is of course empty. Our example should appear like  the first screenshot, but without any progress displayed  the container is empty .  The progress bar depends on the following components:   	 jquery-ui-x.x.x.custom.css  	 jquery-x.x.x.js  	 jquery-ui.core.js  	 jquery-ui.progressbar.js  [ 194 ]   Chapter 8  All we need on the page is a simple container element. In this case, we've used a    element, but other block-level elements, such as a  , for example, can also  be used. The widget will add a nested   element to the specified container  element at initialization, which represents the value of the progressbar.  This widget, like some of the other widgets, such as the accordion, will naturally fill  the width of its container. Both the container and the inner   are given a series  of attributes and classnames by the component. The classnames pick up styling from  the theme file in use, and the component is fully ThemeRoller-ready.  The additional attributes added to the widget are ARIA-compliant, making the  widget fully accessible to visitors using assisted technologies.  Progressbar's configuration options The progressbar has just two configuration options at the time of writing:  Option disabled Value  Default Value false 0  Used to... Disable the widget Set the value  in percent  of the widget  Setting progressbar's value Change the final   element in progressbar1.html, so that it appears  as follows:       function $  {     var progressOpts = {       value: 50     };     $ "progress" .progressbar progressOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as progressbar2.html. The value option takes an integer and sets the  width of the inner   of the widget to the corresponding percentage. This change  will make the widget appear as it did in the first screenshot of this chapter, with the  progressbar half-filled.  [ 195 ]   The Progressbar Widget  Progressbar's event API The progressbar exposes three custom events:  Event create change complete  Fired when… The widget is initialized The widget's value changes The value of the widget reaches 100 percent  As with the other widgets, we can supply an anonymous callback function as the  value of these events in a configuration object, and the component will automatically  call the function for us, each time the event fires.  To see this event in action, add the following   to the page in  progressbar2.html:   Increase by 10%   Next, change the final   block to the following:       function $  {     var progress = $ "myProgressbar" ,     progressOpts = {       change: function   {         var val = $ this .progressbar "option", "value" ;         if  !$ "value" .length  {           $ " ", {             text: val + "%",             id: "value",             css: {               float: "right",               marginTop: -28,               marginRight: 10             }           } .appendTo ""progress ;         } else {           $ "value" .text val + "%" ;         }       }     };     progress.progressbar progressOpts ;     $ "increase" .click function   {       var currentVal = progress.progressbar "option", "value" ,  [ 196 ]   Chapter 8        newVal = currentVal + 10;       progress.progressbar "option", "value", newVal ;     } ;   } ;    Save this file as progressbar3.html. We first cache the selector for the progressbar,  then define an event handler for the change event. Within this callback function, we  first obtain the current value of the progressbar, which will correspond to the value  after its last update. We can select the progressbar using $ this , when inside the  event handler.  Provided the value is less than or equal to 100  percent , we check whether there is  already an element with an id of value on the page. If there isn't, we create a new    element and set its text to the current value. We also give it an id attribute  and position it, so that it appears inside the progressbar. If the element already exists,  we just update its text to the new value.  We also add a click-handler for the button that we added to the page. Whenever  the button is clicked, we first get the current value of the progressbar by using the  option method in getter mode. We then add 10 to the value, before using the  option method in setter mode to increase the value of the inner   by 10  percent. The value is added to a   element to indicate the progress.  The following screenshot shows the result of clicking the button:  In this example, we set the value of the progressbar manually whenever the button is  clicked; we use the standard option method, common to all UI library components,  to retrieve information about the current state of the progressbar.  Don't forget that like the other library components, this event can be used with  jQuery's bind   method by prefixing the name of the widget onto the event name,  for example, progressbarchange.  [ 197 ]   The Progressbar Widget  Progressbar methods In addition to the common API methods that are exposed by all library components,  such as destroy, disable, enable, and option, the slider API also exposes the  value method, which is a short-cut for using the option method to set the value  of the progressbar.  We can do exactly the same as we did in the last example, but with less code, using  the value method. Change the final   element in progressbar3.html, so  that it is as follows:       function $  {     var progress = $ "myProgressbar" ;     progress.progressbar  ;     $ "increase" .click function   {       var currentVal = progress.progressbar "option", "value" ,       newVal = currentVal + 10;       progress.progressbar "value", newVal ;       if  !$ "value" .length  {         $ "  ", {           text: newVal + "%",           id: "value",           css: {             float: "right",             marginTop: -28,             marginRight: 10           }         } .appendTo progress ;       } else {         $ "value" .text val + "%" ;       }     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as progressbar4.html. We lose the configuration object in this example as  it isn't required. The logic for increasing the value using the value method has been  moved into the click handler for the   element.  [ 198 ]   User initiated progress At its most basic level, we can manually update the progressbar in response to  user interaction. For example, we could specify a wizard-style form, which has  several steps to complete. In this example, we'll create a form as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 8  During each step, we can increment the progressbar manually to let the user  know how far through the process they are. In progressbar4.html, replace the  progressbar container and button with the following code:       Registration Form     Progress:      \    0%                   Personal Details                   Name:                     D.O.B:   [ 199 ]   The Progressbar Widget                     Choose password:                     Confirm password:                                       Contact Details                   Email:                     Telephone:                     Address:                                        Registration Complete                   Thanks for registering!                     Next       Back         Save this as progressbar5.html. In the   section, we link to the framework  theme files, as we have done with the other examples in this chapter, and will need  to link to a custom style sheet that we'll add in a moment:     The   of the page contains a few layout elements and some text nodes, but the  main elements are the container for the progressbar and the  . The   is  separated into several different sections using   and   elements. The  reason for this is so that we can hide parts of the form to make it appear as if it spans  several pages.  We've added a paragraph and a   next to the progressbar. We'll position  these so that they appear inside the widget. The paragraph contains a simple text  string. The label will be used to show the current progress value.  [ 200 ]   Chapter 8  The outer container is given several classnames; the first is so that we can apply  some custom styling to the element, but the next two are to target different features  of the CSS framework. The ui-helper-clearfix class is used to automatically  clear floated elements and is a great way of reducing the clutter of additional and  unnecessary clearing   elements. Don't forget to make explicit use of this and  other framework classes when creating your own widgets.  The ui-corner-all class is used to give the container element  as well as the  progressbar itself, which has them automatically, and our   elements   rounded corners, using several proprietary style rules. These are now supported by  most modern browsers. We also have a next   to move forward through  each panel, and a back   which is disabled by default. We use another class from the CSS framework, within the form. Several panels  need to be hidden when the page first loads; we can therefore make use of the   ui-helper-hidden class to ensure that they are set to display:none. When we  want to show them, all we have to do is remove this classname.  Now let's add the JavaScript; change the final   element at the bottom of the  page, so that it appears as follows:   function $  {   var prog = $ "myProgressbar" ,   progressOpts = {     change: function   {       prog.next         .text prog.progressbar "value"  + "%" ;     }   };   prog.progressbar progressOpts ;   $ "next, back" .click function   {     $ "button" .attr "disabled", true ;     if  this.id == "next"  {       prog.progressbar "option", "value",           prog.progressbar "option", "value"  + 50 ;       $ "form" .find "div:visible" .fadeOut         .next  .fadeIn function  {         $ "back" .attr "disabled", false ;         if  !$ "form" .find "div:last" .is ":visible"   {           $ "next" .attr "disabled", false ;         }       } ;     } else {       prog.progressbar "option", "value",           pro.progressbar "option", "value"  - 50 ;       $ "form" .find "div:visible" .not ".buttons"   [ 201 ]   The Progressbar Widget        .fadeOut  .prev  .fadeIn function   {         $ "next" .attr "disabled", false ;         if  !$ "form" .find "div:first" .is ":visible"   {           $ "back" .attr "disabled", false ;          }       } ;     }   } ; }  jQuery ;  We first cache a selector for the progressbar and define our configuration object,  making use of the change event to specify an anonymous callback function. Each  time the event is fired, we'll grab the current value of the progressbar using the  value method, and set it as the text of the   directly after the progressbar  element. The event is fired after the change takes place, so the value we obtain will  always be the new value.  Once the progressbar is initialized, we add a click handler for the buttons after the  form. Within this handler function, we first disable both of the buttons to prevent the  form from breaking, if a   is repeatedly clicked. We then use an if statement  to run slightly different code branches, depending on which   was clicked.  If the next   was clicked, we increase the value of the progressbar by 50  percent by setting the value option to the current value plus 50 percent. We then  fade-out the currently visible panel and fade-in the next panel. We use a callback  function as an argument to the fadeIn   method, which will be executed once the  animation ends. Within this function, we re-enable the back    as it was next that was  clicked, it is not possible for the first panel to be visible, so this   should be  enabled  and determine whether to enable the next  , which can be done,  provided the last panel is not visible. The second branch of the outer if statement deals with the back   being  clicked. In this case, we reduce the progressbar by 50 percent, enable the next   , and check whether the back   should be enabled. This is now all of the JavaScript that we'll need. All we have to do now is add   some basic CSS to lay the example out; in a new file in your text editor add the  following code:  h1, h2 { font-family:Georgia; font-size:140%; margin-top:0; } h2 { margin:20px 0 10px; font-size:100%; text-align:left; } p {   margin:0; font-size:75%; position:absolute; left:30px;   top:60px; font-weight:bold;  [ 202 ]   Chapter 8  } amount {   position:absolute; right:30px; top:60px; font-size:80%;   font-weight:bold; } thanks { text-align:center; } thanks p {    margin-top:48px; font-size:160%; position:relative; left:0;    top:0; } form { height:265px; position:relative; } .form-container {    width:400px; margin:0 auto; position:relative;   font-family:Verdana; font-size:80%; padding:20px;    background-color:e0e3e2; border:1px solid abadac; } .form-panel {   width:400px; height:241px; position:absolute; top:0; left:0; } fieldset {   width:397px; height:170px; margin:0 auto; padding:22px 0 0;   border:1px solid abadac; background-color:ffffff; } label {   width:146px; display:block; float:left; text-align:right;   padding-top:2px; margin-right:10px; } input, textarea {   float:left; width:200px; margin-bottom:13px; } button { float:right; }  Save this as progressTheme.css in the css directory. We should now have a  working page with a wired-up progressbar. When we run the page, we should   find that we can navigate through each panel of the form, and the progressbar   will update itself accordingly.  We're still relying on user interaction to set the value of the progressbar in this  example, which is driven by the visitor navigating through each of the panels.  Rich uploads with progressbar Instead of relying on user interaction to increase the value of the progressbar  and therefore the completion of the specified task, we can instead rely on the   system to update it; deterministic means simply that something must be able   to update it accurately.  [ 203 ]   The Progressbar Widget  In our final progressbar example, we can incorporate the HTML5 file API, in order  to upload a file asynchronously, and can use the onprogress event to update the  progressbar, while the file is uploading.  Although the onprogress event is defined as part of an official W3C specification,  it has only been implemented by Firefox and webkit. This example however, will  only work in Firefox 3.5+, as webkit browsers do not implement the getAsBinary    method that we use on file objects.  This example will also only work correctly using a full web server with PHP   installed and configured. We won't be looking at the server-side part of the upload  process in this example; we're not interested in what happens to the file once it's   been uploaded, only in updating the progressbar based on feedback received from  the system, while it is uploading.  Change the   in progressbar5.html, so that it contains the following elements:   AJAX File Upload        On the page, we have an   of the type file, followed by the container for the  progressbar as usual. Next, let's add the script; change the final   element at  the end of the   to the following:   function $  {   var prog = $ "myProgressbar" ,   inputFile = $ "file" ,   progressOpts = {     complete: function   {       $ "filename" .text "Complete!" ;     }   }   inputFile.change function   {     prog.progressbar progressOpts ;     var files = inputFile.attr "files" ,     file = files[0],     xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ;     xhr.upload.onprogress = function updateProgress e  {       var loaded =  e.loaded   e.total ;       prog.progressbar "value", Math.round loaded * 100  ;     }     xhr.upload.onload = function   {       prog.progressbar "value", 100 ;  [ 204 ]   Chapter 8      }     $ " ", {       id: "filename",       text: file.fileName     } .insertAfter prog ;     xhr.open "POST", "progressUpload.php" ;     xhr.sendAsBinary file.getAsBinary   ;   } ; }  jQuery ;  Save this file as progressbar6.html. First of all, we cache some selectors and  define a configuration object for the progressbar. Within this object, we configure   the complete option, so that the callback function updates the filename string to  the string Complete!.  Next, we add an anonymous function that hooks into the change event of the    element, which will be triggered when a file is selected  after clicking  the Browse button that is automatically added next to the   .  Within this callback, we first need to get the file that has been selected, which  will be available through the files attribute of the  . Multiple files can  be selected, but this example doesn't cover that, so we just get the first file from   the files collection.  Next, we create a new XMLHttpRequest object and then set an anonymous  callback function as the value of the input.onprogress property. The function  will be executed each time the event is fired. Within this function, we calculate  the percentage of upload by dividing the amount uploaded so far by the total  amount to upload. These details are available through the event object  e , which is  automatically passed to the function.  Once we've established what the percentage of upload is, we can update the value  of the progressbar using the value method. The value stored in the loaded variable  will be a number between 0 and 1, so we need to multiply it by 100 to get the correct  percentage. We can also round the number to the nearest decimal point using  JavaSript's Math.round method.  Next, we display the filename of the file being uploaded next to the progressbar. We  don't need to do this, but it's a good example of how the file object can to used to  obtain information about the selected file before the upload has even taken place.  We also add a handler for the upload.onload event, which is fired once when the  request has completed. We use this function to set the value of the progressbar to   100 percent, as the onprogress event does not also fire at the end of the request.  [ 205 ]   The Progressbar Widget  Finally, we can open a POST connection to the server, and send the file to the server.  Using the file API, we can send the file as a binary file using the getAsBinary and  sendAsBinary methods. The PHP file is not necessary for the example to work, but  even saving an empty PHP of the same name in the directory will prevent 404 errors,  when the example runs.  We also need a tiny bit of CSS for this example; in a new file add the following code:  file { float:left; } myProgressbar.ui-progressbar {   height:1em; width:221px; margin:3px 0 0 4px; float:left; } filename {   float:left; margin:4px 0 0 10px; font-family:Verdana;   font-size:12px; }  This can be saved in the css folder as progressTheme2.css. Mostly the styles just  position the various elements and set the width of the progressbar.  When we run this file in Firefox, we should see that once a file has been selected,  it will automatically begin to upload, and the progressbar will begin to fill-up. If  testing locally, it will be pretty quick, so it's best tested with reasonably large files.  The following screenshot shows the page once the upload has completed:  [ 206 ]   Chapter 8  Summary Despite its compact API, the progressbar widget makes a great addition to the  library, providing essential visitor feedback when processes are in progress. The  component is useful in any situation where the percentage complete of the process  can reliably be updated by the system.  After looking at the default implementation, we moved on to take a look at the value  option and how it can be used; we can set the value prior to initialization using a  configuration object, and we can set it after initialization using the option method.  Next, we looked at the change event, which is fired by the widget whenever its value  is changed. Using the standard way of hooking into the event with an anonymous  callback function within our configuration object, we can easily react to the amount  of progress changing, or the process completing using the complete event.  We saw that in addition to the standard API methods such as destroy, the widget  also exposes the value method, which can be used as a shortcut to setting the value  using the option method.  Although the current version of this widget is purely deterministic, a future release  will include support for an indeterminate progress indicator, for use when the  current status of the process cannot be accurately determined. This is currently quite  a young widget compared to some of the other components, so its API is sure to  mature and grow in forthcoming releases.  In the next chapter, we'll look at two of the most recent additions to the library, the  button widget and the autocomplete widget.  [ 207 ]    The Button and   Autocomplete Widgets  The button and autocomplete widgets are the newest two widgets in the library, and  were released in version 1.8. The autocomplete widget has actually been resurrected,  having been included in a pre-ThemeRoller 1.6 release, retired in 1.7, and then  brought back transformed in the 1.8 release.  Traditionally, it has been tricky to style form elements consistently across all  browsers and platforms, and to confound this, most browsers and platforms   render form controls uniquely. Both of the widgets covered in this chapter are   used to improve some of the traditional form elements that are used on the web.  The button widget allows us to create visually appealing, ThemeRoller-ready, and  highly configurable buttons from elements including  ,  , and    elements. Types of the   element that are supported include submit, radio,  and checkbox. Additional features, such as icons, button sets, and split buttons can  be used to further enhance the underlying controls.  The autocomplete widget is attached to a standard text   and is used to  provide a menu of contextual selections. When the visitor begins typing in the   , the suggestions which match the characters entered into the control  are displayed.  Autocomplete is fully accessible through the keyboard input, allowing the list of  suggestions to be navigated with the arrow keys, a selection made with the Enter key,  and the menu closed with the Esc key. When the arrow keys are used to navigate the  list of suggestions, each suggestion will be added to the   before a selection  is made. If the Esc key is used to close the menu after the list has been navigated, the  value of the   will revert to the text entered by the visitor.   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   	 Standard button implementations  	 Configurable options  	 Adding icons  	 Button events  	 Buttonsets  	 Button methods  	 Using local data sources with autocomplete  	 The configurable options of the autocomplete  	 Autocomplete events  	 Unique methods of the autocomplete  	 Using remote data sources with autocomplete  	 Using HTML in the autocomplete suggestions menu  The button widget The button widget is used to provide a consistent, fully-themed styling to a range of  elements and input types. The widget can be created from several different elements  and the resulting DOM of the widget, as well as the features that can be used, will  vary slightly depending on which element is used.  A standard button widget, built from either a  , or an   element, or an    with a type of button, submit, or reset will appear as follows:  Standard implementations Because the button can be built from several different elements, there are some minor  variations of the underlying code that we can use. When creating buttons using    or   elements, a   element will be created automatically by the widget  and nested within the underlying element. This new   will contain the text  label of the button.  [ 210 ]   Chapter 9  To create a link button, use the following page:                     Button      <link rel="stylesheet"         href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">              A link button                                     Save this page as button1.html. An   element is not allowed to contain  children, so a   is not used for the text when creating button widgets from this  element. It is imperative that the type attribute of the element is set in this case, so  that the appearance of the button matches that of other buttons created from other  underlying elements. For a standard, single button widget, the type attribute can be  set to either submit, reset, or button.  The script required to create a button, when using an   element as the underlying  HTML can be as simple as this, which should be added after the last    element in the previous code:       function $ {     $ "myButton" .button  ;   }  jQuery ;    In this case, no special behavior is added to the resulting button; the   element will  simply send the visitor to the new page or anchor specified in the href attribute of  the anchor. In this case, the widget is simply themed consistently with other jQuery  UI widgets that we may be using in the page or site.  Creating a button from a   element is identical to the previous code   except that we don't add a href attribute to the   :   A &lt;button&gt; button   [ 211 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  Creating a button from an   element is also very similar, except that we  use the value attribute to set the text on the button instead of adding text content  to the  :     The button widget requires the following library resources:   	 jquery-ui-x.x.x-custom.css  	 jQuery-x.x.x.js  	 jquery.ui.core.js  	 jquery.ui.widget.js  	 jquery.ui.button.js  Theming Like all widgets, the button has a variety of classnames added to it, which contribute  to its overall appearance. Of course, we can use the theme classnames in our own  style sheets to override the default appearance of the theme in use, if we wish to  provide custom styling. ThemeRoller is still usually the best tool for theming buttons.  Configurable options The button widget has the following configuration options:  Option disabled icons  label  text  Default Value false {primary: null, secondary:  null} The content of the underlying  element or value attribute true  Used to... Disable the button instance Set the icons for the button instance  Set the text of the button instance  Hide the text of the button when  using an icon-only instance  In our first example, the text content of the   element was used as the button's  label. We can easily override this using the label option. Change the final    element in button1.html, so that it appears as follows:   function $ {   var buttonOpts = {     label: "A configured label"    };  [ 212 ]   Chapter 9    $ "myButton" .button buttonOpts ; }  jQuery ;  Save this file as button2.html. As we'd expect, when we run this page in a browser,  we see that the   within the button widget takes the configured text as its label,  instead of the text content of the   element.  Button icons We can easily configure our buttons, so that they have up to two icons in most cases.  Whenever an   or   element is used as the underlying element for the  button, we can use the icons configuration option to specify one or two icons.  To see icons in action, change the configuration object in button2.html, so that it  appears as follows:  var buttonOpts = {   icons: {     primary: "ui-icon-disk",     secondary: "ui-icon-triangle-1-s"   } };  Save this version as button3.html. The icons property accepts an object with up  to two keys; primary and secondary. The values of these options can be any of the  ui-icon- classes found in the jquery.ui.theme.css file. The icons that we set are  displayed as follows:  The icons are added to the widget using additional   elements, which are  automatically created and inserted by the widget. The primary icon is displayed  to the left of the button text, while the secondary icon is displayed to the right of  the text.  [ 213 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  To generate an icon-only button that has no text label, change the configuration  object in button3.html to the following:  var buttonOpts = {   icons: {     primary: "ui-icon-disk",     secondary: "ui-icon-triangle-1-s"   },   text: false };  Save this as button4.html. When we view this variation in a browser, we see that  the button displays only our two icons:  Input icons As child   elements are used to the display the specified icons, we cannot  use icons when using an   element as the underlying markup for a button  instance. We can easily add our own icons when using   elements, however,  by adding an extra container, the required   elements, and some custom CSS.  Change the   of button4.html, so that it contains the following elements:  <div    class="iconic-input ui-button-text-icons ui-state-default ui-      corner-all">        <input id="myButton" type = "button" value="Input icons"      class="ui-button-text">   <span class="ui-button-icon-secondary ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-      1-s">     Save this as button5.html. We'll also need to override some of the button's styling  for this example. Create a new style sheet and add to it the following basic styles:  .iconic-input { display:inline-block; position:relative; } .ui-icon { z-index:2; } .iconic-input input { border:none; margin:0; }  [ 214 ]   Chapter 9  In older versions of Internet Explorer, the display: inline-block style will not be applied. To prevent the  button taking up the full width of its container, we would  need to float it, or set a width explicitly.  Save this in the css directory as buttonTheme.css. Don't forget to link to the  new style sheet from the   of our page  after the link to the standard  jQuery UI style sheet :     Visually our custom  -based widget is complete, but behaviorally it's not  quite there—the icons do not pick up the correct hover states  the reason for this is  because the widget has applied the required classnames to the underlying    instead of our custom container . We can add the required behavior, like we have  added the container and   elements, manually. Change the code in the final    element, so that it appears as follows:   function $ {   $ "myButton" .button  .hover function   {     $ this .parent  .addClass "ui-state-hover" ;   }, function   {     $ this .parent  .removeClass "ui-state-hover" ;   } ; }  jQuery ;  Now our button should work as intended. As this example shows, although it's  technically feasible to manually add the elements, the styling, and the behavior  required to add icons to a button built from an   element, in most cases it  will be easier and more efficient to simply use an   or   element.  Button events Buttons built from   elements will work as intended with no further intervention  from us—the browser will simply follow the href as we would expect. Provided    or   elements are within a   and have the relevant type  attribute set, these elements will submit the form data in the standard way.   If more modern AJAX submission of any   data is required, or if the button  is to trigger some other action or process, we can use standard jQuery click event- handlers to react to the button being clicked.  [ 215 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  In the next example, we use the following underlying markup for the button widget:   A button   The button widget exposes a single event, the create event, which is fired when  the button instance is initially created. We could use this event to run additional  code each time a button instance is created; for example, if we wanted the button  to be initially hidden from view  in order to display later, after something else has  occurred , we could use the following configuration object:  var buttonOpts = {   create: function   {     $ this .css "display", "none"    } };  Save this page as button6.html. Within the event handler, this refers to the button  instance, which is hidden from view using jQuery's css   method.  In order for the button to fulfill its primary purpose, that is, to do something when  clicked, we should attach a handler to the button manually. We might want to collect  some registration information from our visitors, for example, and use a button to  send this information to the server.  Replace the   in button6.html, with the following markup:       Name:               Email:               Register     Change the final   element to the following:   function $ {   $ "myButton" .button  .click function e  {     e.preventDefault  ;     var form = $ "form" ,     formData = {       name: form.find "name" .val  ,       email: form.find "email" .val       };     $.post "register.php", formData, function   {  [ 216 ]   Chapter 9        $ "myButton" .button "option", "disabled", true ;       form.find "label" .remove  ;       $ " ", {         text: "Thanks for registering!"       } .prependTo form ;     } ;   } ; }  jQuery ;  Save this page as button7.html. The underlying   element is now part of a  simple  , which simply provides text inputs for the visitor, their name, and an  e-mail address. In the script, we chain a click-handler on to the button   method,  which first prevents the default action of the browser, which would be to post the  form in a traditional non-AJAX way.  We then collect the name and e-mail address entered into the fields, and post the  data to the server asynchronously using jQuery's post   method. In the success  handler for the request, we use the widget's option method to disable the button,  then create and display a thanks message.  We're not interested in the server side of things in this example, and we don't include  any validation, but you can see how easy it is to react to the button being clicked  using standard jQuery functionality. To see the example work, we'll need to run the  page through a web server, and should add a PHP file of the name specified in the  request in the same directory as the page. The following screenshot shows how the  page should appear after the button has been clicked:  Buttonsets The button widget can also be used in conjunction with radio buttons and  checkboxes. The button component is unique in jQuery UI, in that it has not one   but two widget methods. It has the button   method that we have already looked  at, and it has the buttonset   method, which is used to create groups of buttons  based on radio buttons and checkboxes.  [ 217 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets Checkbox buttonsets Change the   of button7.html, so that it contains the following markup:       Programming Languages     Select all languages you know:     JavaScript         Python         C         Java          function $ {   $ "buttons" .buttonset  ; }  jQuery ;  Now change the final   element, so that it appears as follows:  Save this page as button8.html. All we need to do is call the buttonset   method  on the container in which the   and   elements reside.  When we run this page in a browser, we see that the checkboxes are hidden from  view and the   elements are converted into buttons and grouped visually  in a horizontal set:  Although the actual checkboxes themselves are hidden from view behind the  buttons, whenever a button is selected, the underlying checkbox will have its  checked attribute updated, so we can still harvest the states from script with ease.  When a checkbox button is selected, it will have a selected state applied to it by  the widget, so that the visitor can easily see that it has been selected. As we would  expect, multiple buttons may be selected at once.  [ 218 ]   Chapter 9  There are a couple of rules that we need to adhere to when creating buttons from  checkboxes. In HTML5, it is common to nest form controls within their associated    elements  we did this in an earlier example , but this is not allowed when  using the button widget. Using the for attribute with the   is required.  Radio buttonsets Buttons based on radio buttons are visually the same as those based on checkboxes;  they differ only in their behavior. In button8.html, change the elements in the    to the following:       Programming Languages     Select your most proficient languages:     JavaScript         Python         C         Java         Save this page as button9.html. The script to initialize radio buttons is the same;  we simply call the buttonset   method on the container. The only difference to the  underlying markup, other than specifying radio as the type, is that these    elements must have the name attribute set.  Button methods The button widget comes with the default destroy, disable, enable, widget, and  option methods common to all widgets. In addition to these methods, the button  widget exposes one custom method, which is the refresh method. This method  is used for changing the state of checkbox and radio buttons, if they are changed  programmatically. By combining some of the previous examples, we can see this  method in action.  Change the   of button8.html, so that it includes two new   elements  as shown below:       Programming Languages     Select all languages you know:     JavaScript   [ 219 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets         Python         C         Java           Select All   Deselect All   In this example, we have reverted to the checkboxes, so that we can  programmatically select or deselect them as a group. Now change the final    element, so that it appears as follows:  $ "buttons" .buttonset  ; $ "select" .button  .click function   {   $ "buttons" .find "input" .attr "checked", true .button "refresh" ; } ; $ "deselect" .button  .click function   {   $ "buttons" .find "input" .attr "checked", false . button "refresh" ; } ;  Save this file as button10.html. In this example, we have a Select all button and  a Deselect all button; when the Select all button is clicked, we set the checked  attribute of the checkboxes to true. This will check the underlying  and hidden   check boxes, but it won't do anything to the   elements that are styled to  appear as buttons. To update the state of these buttons, so that they appear selected,  we call the refresh method. The Deselect all button sets the checked attribute to false, and then calls the  refresh method again to remove the selected states from each button.  The autocomplete widget The autocomplete widget is back, and looking better than ever. This is one of  my favorite widgets in the library, and although it doesn't yet have the full set of  behavior that it had in its first incarnation, it still provides a rich set of functionality  to enhance simple text inputs that expect data from a predefined range.  [ 220 ]   Chapter 9  A good example is cities; you have a standard   on the page,  which asks for the visitor's city. When they begin typing in the  , all of the  cities that contain the letter that the visitor has typed, are displayed. The range of  cities that the visitor can enter is finite and constrained to the country in which the  visitor lives  this is either assumed by the developer or has already been selected  previously by the visitor .  The following screenshot shows how this widget appears:  Like other widgets, a range of elements and classnames are added programmatically  when the widget is initialized.  Working with local data sources To implement a basic autocomplete with a local array as its data source, create the  following new page:                     Autocomplete      <link rel="stylesheet" href="css smoothness jquery-ui-        1.8.9.custom.css">              Enter your city:                       [ 221 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets                                  All we need on the page is a standard   element of the type text. The  initialization required for autocomplete is slightly larger than that required for other  components; add the following   element, after the autocomplete source file:       function $ {     var autoOpts = {       source: [         "Aberdeen", "Armagh", "Bangor", "Bath", "Canterbury",           "Cardiff",           "Derby", "Dundee", "Edinburgh", "Exeter", "Glasgow",           "Gloucester",           "Hereford", "Inverness", "Leeds", "London", "Manchester",           "Norwich",           "Newport", "Oxford", "Plymouth", "Preston", "Ripon",           "Southampton",           "Swansea", "Truro", "Wakefield", "Winchester", "York"       ]     };     $ "city" .autocomplete autoOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this page as autocomplete1.html. In our configuration object for the  autocomplete, we use the source option to specify a local array of strings. The  source option is mandatory and must be defined. The object is then passed to  the widget method, which is called on the   that the autocomplete is to be  associated with.  When we run this page in a browser, we should find that as we begin to type into   the  , a list of the cities defined in our source array that contain the letter s   that we have typed is displayed in a drop-down menu attached to the  .  The autocomplete widget requires the following files in order to function:   	 jquery-ui-x.x.x.custom.css  	 jquery-x.x.x.js  	 jquery.ui.core.js  	 jquery.ui.widget.js  [ 222 ]   Chapter 9   	 jquery.ui.position.js  	 jquery.ui.autocomplete.js  Using an array of objects as the data source In addition to providing an array of strings, we can also supply an array of objects  as the data source, which gives us more flexibility over the text added to the    when a suggestion from the menu is selected. Change the configuration object in  autocomplete1.html, so that it appears as follows:  var autoOpts = {   source: [     { value: "AB", label: "Aberdeen" },      { value: "AR", label: "Armagh" },     { value: "BA", label: "Bangor" },     { value: "BA", label: "Bath" },     { value: "CA", label: "Canterbury" },     { value: "CD", label: "Cardiff" },     { value: "DE", label: "Derby" },     { value: "DU", label: "Dundee" },     { value: "ED", label: "Edinburgh" },     { value: "EX", label: "Exeter" },     { value: "GL", label: "Glasgow" },     { value: "GO", label: "Gloucester" },     { value: "HE", label: "Hereford" },     { value: "IN", label: "Inverness" },     { value: "LE", label: "Leeds" },     { value: "LO", label: "London" },     { value: "MA", label: "Manchester" },     { value: "NO", label: "Norwich" },     { value: "NE", label: "Newport" },     { value: "OX", label: "Oxford" },     { value: "PL", label: "Plymouth" },     { value: "PR", label: "Preston" },     { value: "RI", label: "Ripon" },     { value: "SO", label: "Southampton" },     { value: "SW", label: "Swansea" },     { value: "TR", label: "Truro" },     { value: "WA", label: "Wakefield" },     { value: "WI", label: "Winchester" },     { value: "YO", label: "York" }   ] };  [ 223 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  Save this page as autocomplete2.html. Each item in the array that we are using as  the data source is now an object, instead of a simple string. Each object has two keys:  value and label. The value of the value key is the text that is added to the    when a suggestion is selected from the list. The value of label is what is displayed  in the suggestion list. Other keys, which store custom data, can also be used.  If each object in the array contains only a single property ,the property will be  used as both the value and label. In this case, we might as well use an array of  strings instead of an array of objects, but it is worth noting the alternative format   of the local data.  Configurable autocomplete options The following options can be set in order to modify the behavior of the widget:  Option appendTo  Default Value "body"  autofocus  false  delay  300  disabled minLength  false 1  position  { my: "left top",    at: "left  bottom",   collision:  "none" }  source  Used to... Specify which element to append the   widget to. Focus the first suggestion in the list when  displaying the list of suggestions. Specify the number of milliseconds the  widget should wait before displaying the  list of suggestions, after the visitor has  started typing in the  . Disable the widget. Specify the number of characters   the visitor needs to enter in the     before the list of suggestions  is displayed. Can be set to 0 to make  the widget display all suggestions in   the menu. Specify how the list of suggestions should  be positioned relative to the    element. This option is used in the exact  same way, and accepts the same values  as the position utility that we looked at  earlier in the book. Specify the data source used to fill the list  of suggestions. This option is mandatory  and must be configured.   It accepts an array, string, or function   as its value.  [ 224 ]   Chapter 9  Configuring minimum length The minLength option allows us to specify the minimum number of characters that  need to be typed into the associated   element before the list of suggestions is  displayed. By default, the suggestions that are displayed by the widget only contain  the letters typed into the  , rather than just those starting with the entered  letters, which can result in many more suggestions being displayed than is necessary.  Setting the minLength option to a number higher than the default value of 1 can help  narrow the list of suggestions, which may be much more important when dealing  with large remote data sources.  Change the configuration object that we used in autocomplete1.html  we'll  revert to using an array of strings as the data source for the time being , so that   it appears as follows:  var autoOpts = {   minLength: 2,   source: [     "Aberdeen", "Armagh", "Bangor", "Bath",   "Cardiff",      "Derby", "Dundee", "Edinburgh", "Exeter", "Glasgow", "Gloucester",     "Hereford", "Inverness", "Leeds", "London", "Manchester",  "Norwich",       "Newport", "Oxford", "Plymouth", "Preston", "Ripon",  "Southampton",       "Swansea", "Truro", "Wakefield", "Winchester", "York"   ] };  "Canterbury",   Save this file as autocomplete3.html. The minLength option accepts an integer  specifying the number of characters that must be typed in the  . When we  run this page in a browser, we should find that we need to type two characters into  the  , and only cities that contain the characters in consecutive order are  displayed, which vastly reduces the number of suggestions.  Although the benefits are not obvious in this basic example, this can drastically  reduce the data returned by a remote data source.  Appending the suggestion list to an alternative  element By default, the suggestion list is appended to the   of the page and the  position utility is used to position the list, so that it appears to be attached to the    it is associated with. We can change this and specify that the list should be  added to another element on the page, instead of using the appendTo option.  [ 225 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  Wrap the underlying   and   in a container   in  autocomplete3.html:       Enter your city:         Then change the configuration object in the final   element to the following:  var autoOpts = {   appendTo: "container",   source: [     "Aberdeen", "Armagh", "Bangor", "Bath",   "Cardiff",     "Derby", "Dundee", "Edinburgh", "Exeter", "Glasgow", "Gloucester",     "Hereford", "Inverness", "Leeds", "London", "Manchester",  "Norwich",       "Newport", "Oxford", "Plymouth", "Preston", "Ripon",  "Southampton",       "Swansea", "Truro", "Wakefield", "Winchester", "York"   ] };  "Canterbury",   Save this page as autocomplete4.html. Usually, the suggestion list is added right at  the bottom of the   of the page. The appendTo option accepts a jQuery selector  or an actual DOM element as its value.  In this example, we see that the list is appended to our container   instead of the   , which we can verify using Firebug, or another DOM explorer.  Autocomplete events The autocomplete widget exposes a range of unique events that allow us to react  programmatically to the widget being interacted with. These events are listed below:  Event change  close create focus open search select  Fired when... A suggestion from the list is selected. This event is fired  once the list has closed and the   has lost focus. The suggestion list is closed. An instance of the widget is created. The keyboard is used to focus a suggestion in the list. The suggestion menu is displayed. The request for the suggestions is about to be made. A suggestion from the list is selected.  [ 226 ]   The select event is useful when we are working with an array of objects as the data  source and have additional data other than the label and value properties that we  used earlier. For the next example, remove the container   that we used in the  last example and then change the configuration object, so that it appears as follows:  Chapter 9  var autoOpts = {   source: [     { value: "AB", label: "Aberdeen", population: 212125 },     { value: "AR", label: "Armagh", population: 54263 },     { value: "BA", label: "Bangor", population: 21735 },     { value: "BA", label: "Bath", population: 83992 },     { value: "CA", label: "Canterbury", population: 43432 },     { value: "CD", label: "Cardiff", population: 336200 },     { value: "DE", label: "Derby", population: 233700 },     { value: "DU", label: "Dundee", population: 152320 },     { value: "ED", label: "Edinburgh", population: 448624 },     { value: "EX", label: "Exeter", population: 118800 },     { value: "GL", label: "Glasgow", population: 580690 },     { value: "GO", label: "Gloucester", population: 123205 },     { value: "HE", label: "Hereford", population: 55700 },     { value: "IN", label: "Inverness", population: 56660 },     { value: "LE", label: "Leeds", population: 443247 },     { value: "LO", label: "London", population: 7200000 },     { value: "MA", label: "Manchester", population: 483800 },     { value: "NO", label: "Norwich", population: 259100 },     { value: "NE", label: "Newport", population: 137011 },     { value: "OX", label: "Oxford", population: 149300 },     { value: "PL", label: "Plymouth", population: 256700 },     { value: "PR", label: "Preston", population: 114300 },     { value: "RI", label: "Ripon", population: 15922 },     { value: "SO", label: "Southampton", population: 236700 },     { value: "SW", label: "Swansea", population: 223301 },     { value: "TR", label: "Truro", population: 17431 },     { value: "WA", label: "Wakefield", population: 76886 },     { value: "WI", label: "Winchester", population: 41420 },     { value: "YO", label: "York", population: 182000 }   ],   select: function e, ui  {     if  $ "pop" .length  {       $ "pop" .text ui.item.label + "'s population is: " + ui.item. population ;     } else {       $ "  ", {         id: "pop",  [ 227 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets          text: ui.item.label + "'s population is: " + ui.item. population       } .insertAfter "city" ;     }   } };  Save this file as autocomplete5.html. We've added an extra property to each object  in our array data source—the population of each city. We use the select event to  obtain the label and our extra property, and write them to the page whenever a city  is selected.  The event handler that we pass to the select event accepts the event object and the  object from the data source that was selected. We can access any property defined  within our object in the standard way.  Once a city has been selected, the page should appear as follows:  Autocomplete methods In addition to the standard methods that all widgets share, the autocomplete gives us  two unique methods that allow us to initiate certain actions. The unique methods are  listed below:  Method close search  Used to... Close the suggestion menu Request the list of suggestions from the data source,  specifying the search term as an optional argument  The close method is extremely easy-to-use, we simply call the autocomplete  widget method and specify close as an argument:  $ "associated_input" .autocomplete "close" ;  This will cause the suggestions menu to be closed, and the close event to be triggered.  [ 228 ]   Chapter 9  The search method is slightly more complex, in that it can accept an additional  argument, although this is not mandatory. If the search method is called without  passing an argument  which is likely to be the default behaviour , the value of  the associated   is used as the search term. Alternatively, the term can be  provided to the method as the argument.  Working with remote data sources So far in this example, we've worked with a rather small local array of data. The  autocomplete widget really comes into its own when working with remote data  sources, which is the recommended way of using the widget when the data source   is large.  Using a string as the value of the source option In the next example, we'll use a web service to retrieve the list of UK cities instead  of using our local array. Change the   in autocomplete5.html, so that it  appears as follows:   Enter your country:     Then change the final   element, so that the configuration object is defined  like this:  var autoOpts = {   source: "http:  danwellman.co.uk countries.php?callback=?" };  Save this file as autocomplete6.html. We changed the   in this example, as  we are requesting the visitor's country instead of a city. It is not important that we  are looking for countries now, instead of cities.  We have specified a string as the value of the source configuration object in this  example. When a string is supplied to this option, the string should contain a URL  that points to a remote resource. The widget assumes that the resource will output  JSON data, and it assumes that the JSON data will be in the format that we saw  earlier when using an array of objects as the source.  Therefore, when using a simple string as the value of the source option, the data that  is returned should be an array of objects, where each object contains at least a key  called label. The data can be in JSON or JSONP format for cross-domain requests.  The widget will automatically add the query string term=, followed by whatever  was typed into the  .  [ 229 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  In this example, I have specified a URL of my own website. The resource at this  URL will output data in the correct format, so you can run this example from your  desktop computer  without even needing a web server  and see the correct behavior:  One important point that I should make is that the PHP file, which I have used,  will only return entries from the database that start with the letter s  typed into the   , and does not contain the letters as is the default for the widget. I wanted  to clarify that this is a change that I implemented at the server-level, not behavior  exhibited by the widget.  So, using a string as the value of the source option is useful and convenient when  we have a data source that outputs data in the exact format we require, which is  usually when we are in control of the web service that returns the data, as well as  the data itself. This may not be the case if we are trying to extract data from a public  web service over which we have no control. In these situations, we will need to use a  function as the value of the source option and parse out the data manually.  Using a function as the value of the source option Passing a function to the source option, instead of a local array or a string, is the  most powerful way of working with the widget. In this scenario, we have complete  control over the request and how the data is processed before being passed to the  widget to display in the suggestion menu.  In this example, we'll use a different PHP file that returns different data, which is  not in the format that autocomplete expects. We'll use the function to request and  process the data before passing it to the widget. The context of the example will be  the front-end for a messaging system similar to Facebook's, in which people to send  the message to are suggested, but can also be removed after they have been selected  and added to the  . The page we will end up with will appear as in the  following screenshot:  [ 230 ]   Chapter 9  To start with, change the   of autocomplete6.html, so that it contains the  following markup:                     New message form         New Message                   To:                                                       Message:                                               Send           Cancel                       Then change the final   element, so that it appears as follows:   function $ {   var autoOpts = {     source: function req, resp {  [ 231 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets        $.getJSON "http:  danwellman.co.uk contacts.php?callback=?",  req,           function data  {         var suggestions = [];         $.each data, function i, val {           var obj = {};           obj.value = val.name;           obj.email = val.email;           suggestions.push obj ;         } ;         resp suggestions ;       } ;     },     select: function e, ui  {       var emailList = $ "emails" ,       emails = emailList.val  .split "," ,       span = $ "  ", {         text: ui.item.value       } ,       a = $ "  ", {         "class": "remove",         href: "",         title: "Remove",         text: "x"       } .appendTo span ;       span.insertBefore "to" ;       emails.push ui.item.email ;       emailList.val emails.join ","  ;       $ "to" .remove  ;       $ " ", {         id: "to"       } .insertBefore "emails" .autocomplete autoOpts ;     }   };   $ "to" .autocomplete autoOpts ;   $ "toList" .click function  {     $ "to" .focus  ;   } ;   $ "toList" .delegate "a", "click", function  {     var email = $ this .parent  .data "email" ,     emails = $ "emails" .val  .split "," ;     $ this .parent  .remove  ;     $.each emails, function i, val  {       if  val === email  {  [ 232 ]   Chapter 9          emails.splice i, 1 ;       }     } ;      $ "emails" .val emails ;   } ; }  jQuery ;  Save this page as autocomplete7.html. On the page, we've got some basic markup  for a form and the necessary elements to recreate the Facebook-style message dialog.  We use a   element that is styled to look just like an  , with a totally  unstyled actual   within this.  The actual   is needed, so that the visitor can type into it and so that it can  be associated with the autcomplete. We use the   because we can't insert the    elements that will make up each contact into the  . We also have a  hidden  , which will be used to store the actual e-mail addresses.  In the script, we use a function as the value of the source option; this function  is called every time the text in the   is updated. The function accepts two  arguments; the first, req, will contain a property called term, which is the text  entered into the  . The second, resp, is a callback function, which we should  call in order to display the suggestion menu. This callback must be passed for the list  of suggestions to display.  The first thing we do within the source function is make a JSON request to the  data source. Within the callback for this request, we create an empty array and then  iterate over each item in the JSON object, returned by the request. As before, the  PHP file only returns matching entries from the database, so we don't need to do any  pattern matching.  We process each item in the returned data using jQuery's each   method, which  executes the anonymous function for each item in the data set. Within this function,  we create a new object and add to it value and email properties. The widget will  display the value properties within the suggestion menu and we will make use of  the email property later in the script.  Each newly created object is added to the suggestions array, and once each item in  the returned data has been processed, the suggestions array is passed to the resp  callback function, passed to the source function as the second argument.  The autocomplete will now function as intended using our non-standard remote  data source. However, we still want to post-process the items when they are selected.  We can use the select configuration option to do this and specify a function as the  value of this option. This function receives two arguments: the event object and a  special ui object prepared by the widget.  [ 233 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  Within this function, we first cache the selector for the hidden   and then  create an array from its contents by splitting the text on any commas, which we'll   use to separate the e-mail address when we add them to this field.  We then create a new   element and set its text to the value of the item selected  from the suggestion menu, which is available under ui.item.value. We also create  a new   element and append it to the new  . This element will be used to  remove the   from the list of recipients. We also add the e-mail address as data  on the  , so that each recipient name can be associated with its e-mail address.  We then insert the new   into the   element, styled to look like an   , and then add the email property from the selected item  available under  ui.item.email  to the array of e-mails extracted from the hidden  . Once  this is done, we join the array of e-mail addresses into a single string, specifying a  comma as the separator, and then write the text string back to the hidden  .  In order to stop the selected item being added to the unstyled   that the  autocomplete is attached to, we remove this   from the page, and then  create a new version of it, giving it the same id attribute and re-attaching the  autocomplete to it.  The remainder of the code deals with initially attaching the autocomplete to the  original unstyled  , focusing this   whenever the   element that  is styled to look like the   is clicked, and handling removing a recipient from  the list. When this happens, we also remove the e-mail address from the hidden    element, which we do by splitting the contents of the hidden   into  an array and using the data that we stored on the   earlier to remove the  matching e-mail address.  We'll also need a style sheet to go with this example; add the following CSS to   a new file:  formWrap {    padding:10px; position:absolute; background-color:000;   background:rgba 82,82,82,0.7 ; border-radius:8px;   font:bold 14px "lucida grande",tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif; } formWrap a:hover { color:ff0000; } messageForm {   width:467px; border:1px solid 666; background-color:eee; } messageForm fieldset {   padding:0; margin:0; position:relative; border:none CCC;   background-color:fff; } messageForm legend { visibility:hidden; height:0; }  [ 234 ]   Chapter 9  messageForm span {   display:block; width:467px; padding:10px 0; background- color:6D84B4;         border:3B5998 3B5998; color:fff; text-indent:20px; } .inner-form { padding:20px; } toList {   width:349px; min-height:27px; padding:3px 3px 0 3px;   border:1px solid 6D84B4; margin-bottom:8px; float:left;   background-color:fff; cursor:text; } messageForm to {   width:10px; padding:0; position:relative; top:4px; float:left;   border:none; } messageForm input, messageForm textarea {   display:block; width:349px; padding:3px; border:1px solid 6D84B4;   float:left; outline:none; } messageForm textarea { resize:vertical; } messageForm label {   width:60px; margin:7px 10px 0 0; float:left; color:666;   font-size:11px; text-align:right; } .buttons { padding:10px 20px; background-color:f2f2f2; } .buttons a {   margin:3px 10px 0 0; float:right; font-size:11px; color:6D84B4; } .buttons button { float:right; } toList span {   width:auto; margin:0 3px 3px 0; padding:3px 20px 4px 8px;   border:1px solid 9DACCC; border-radius:3px; position:relative;   float:left; font-size:11px; font-weight:normal; text-indent:0;   background-color:E2E6F0; color:1C2A47; } toList span a {   position:absolute; right:7px; top:1px; color:666;   font-weight:bold; font-size:12px; text-decoration:none; } .ui-menu .ui-menu-item { white-space:nowrap; padding:0 10px 0 0; }  Save this file as autocompleteTheme.css in the css folder, and link to the new file  from the   of our new page:     [ 235 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets  When we run the page in a browser, we should find that we can type into the   , select a name from the suggestions menu, and get a nicely formatted and  styled name added to the fake input. The actual e-mail address should be added to  the hidden text field, which we can see using Firebug or some other DOM explorer:  Displaying HTML in the list of suggestions By default, the autocomplete widget will only display plain text for each suggestion in  the list. Of course, this plain text is within HTML elements created by the widget, but  nevertheless, if we try to use HTML within our data source, then it will be stripped  out and ignored. However, Scott González has written an extension that allows us to  use HTML for each suggestion in the list instead of plain text, if the need arises.  This could be handy if we wanted to highlight to the visitor the parts of the  suggestion that matched what they had typed in the  . We will need  the extension for this example, which can be found at https:  github.com  scottgonzalez jquery-ui-extensions blob master autocomplete jquery. ui.autocomplete.html.js.  [ 236 ]   The file can be saved in our local js directory and should be linked to from the page  after the source file for the autocomplete:      Change the final   element in autocomplete7.html, so that it appears  as follows:  Chapter 9   function $ {   var data = [     { value: "Aberdeen", label: "Aberdeen" },     { value: "Armagh", label: "Armagh" },     { value: "Bangor", label: "Bangor" },     { value: "Bath", label: "Bath" },     { value: "Canterbury", label: "Canterbury" },     { value: "Cardiff", label: "Cardiff" },     { value: "Derby", label: "Derby" },     { value: "Dundee", label: "Dundee" },     { value: "Edinburgh", label: "Edinburgh" },     { value: "Exeter", label: "Exeter" },     { value: "Glasgow", label: "Glasgow" },     { value: "Gloucester", label: "Gloucester" },     { value: "Hereford", label: "Hereford" },     { value: "Inverness", label: "Inverness" },     { value: "Leeds", label: "Leeds" },     { value: "London", label: "London" },     { value: "Manchester", label: "Manchester" },     { value: "Norwich", label: "Norwich" },     { value: "Newport", label: "Newport" },     { value: "Oxford", label: "Oxford" },     { value: "Plymouth", label: "Plymouth" },     { value: "Preston", label: "Preston" },     { value: "Ripon", label: "Ripon" },     { value: "Southampton", label: "Southampton" },     { value: "Swansea", label: "Swansea" },     { value: "Truro", label: "Truro" },     { value: "Wakefield", label: "Wakefield" },     { value: "Winchester", label: "Winchester" },     { value: "York", label: "York" }   ],   autoOpts = {     html: true,     source: function req, resp  {       var suggestions = [],       regEx = new RegExp "^" + req.term, "i" ;       $.each data, function i, val {         if  val.label.match regEx   {           var obj = {};  [ 237 ]   The Button and Autocomplete Widgets            obj.value = val.value;           obj.label = val.label.replace regEx, " " + req.term +               " " ;           suggestions.push obj ;         }       } ;       resp suggestions ;     }   };   $ "city" .autocomplete autoOpts ; }  jQuery ;  Save this file as autocomplete8.html. In this example, we've gone back to using  a local array of objects, but we've moved it out of the configuration object for the  autocomplete into its own variable called data. Both the value and label properties  in each object hold the same data to begin with.  In our configuration object, we specify a new option html, which is used in  conjunction with the html extension. We set the value of this option to true.  As before, we use a function as the value of the source option in this example.  Within the function provided as the value of source, we first create a new empty  array and define a new regular expression object, which will case-insensitively match  whatever is typed into the  , at the start of a string.  We then iterate over each object in our data array and test whether our regular  expression matches any of the label values in the objects in our array. If any items  do match, we create a new object and give it value and label properties; the  value  which is added to the   when a suggestion is selected  is simply the  corresponding value from our data array, and the label  what is displayed in the  suggestion menu  is a new string that contains a   element wrapping the text  entered into the  .  Finally, we call the resp callback, passing in the newly constructed suggestions  array. We should always ensure that this callback is called, as this is required by the  widget. It doesn't matter if the suggestions array is empty, the important thing is that  the callback is called.  So now, each item in the suggestions menu will have a   element, wrapping  the text that was typed into the  . We can use it to style this text slightly  differently, such as with the following    added to the   of the page :      span { color:green !important; }    [ 238 ]   This should now make the suggestion menu appears like this:  Chapter 9  Summary We covered two widgets in this chapter; both of them are new to the library and  both work with   elements of some description. The button widget can be  used to turn  ,  , and    of type button, submit, or reset  into  attractively and consistently styled-rich widgets.  The autocomplete widget is attached to an   of the type text and is used  to show a list of suggestions when the visitor begins typing into the  . The  widget is preconfigured to work with a local array of data or a URL that outputs data  in the expected format. It can also be configured to work with data that is not output  in the expected format, provided we process the data prior to it being passed to the  widget, in order to be displayed in the suggestions menu, making this an extremely  versatile and powerful widget.  This now brings us to the end of the section covering the visible widgets we see  and interact with on the page. In the next few chapters, we'll look at the interaction  helpers, which add different types of behavior to the elements on our pages, starting  with the draggable and droppable components.  [ 239 ]    Drag and Drop  So far in this book, we've covered the complete range of fully released interface  widgets, and over the next four chapters, we're going to shift our focus to the core  interaction helpers. These components of the library differ from those that we've  already looked at, in that they are not physical objects or widgets that exist on   the page.  These are low-level interaction components as opposed to the high-level widgets that  we looked at in the first part of this book. They help the elements used on your pages  to be more engaging and interactive for your visitors, which adds value to your site  and can help make your web applications appear more professional. They also help  to blur the distinction between the browser and the desktop, and provide greater  usability to make web applications more efficient, effective, and natural. In this chapter, we'll be covering two very closely related components—draggables  and droppables. The draggables API transforms any specified element into  something that your visitors can pick up with the mouse pointer and drag around  the page. Methods that are exposed allow you to restrict the draggables movement,  make it return to its starting point after being dropped, and much more.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     How to make elements draggable    The options available for configuring draggable objects    How to make an element return to its starting point once the drag ends    How to use event callbacks at different points in an interaction    The role of a drag helper    Containing draggables    How to control draggability with the component's methods    Turning an element into a drop target   Drag and Drop     Defining accepted draggables    Working with droppable classnames    Defining drop tolerance    Reacting to interactions between draggables and droppables  The droppables API allows you to define a region of the page or a container of  some kind, for people to drop the draggables on to, in order to make something else  happen, for example, to define a choice that is made, or add a product to a shopping  basket. A rich set of events are fired by the droppable that lets us react to the most  interesting moments of any drag interaction.  The deal with drag and droppables Dragging-and-dropping as behaviors go hand-in-hand with each other. Where one  is found, the other is invariably close by. Dragging an element around a web page is  all very well and good, but if there's nowhere for that element to be dragged to, the  whole exercise is usually pointless.  You can use the draggable class independently from the droppable class, as  pure dragging for the sake of dragging can have its uses, such as with the dialog  component. However, you can't use the droppable class without the draggable.  You don't need to make use of any of draggable's methods of course, but using  droppables without having anything to drop on to them is of no value whatsoever.  Like with the widgets, it is possible, however, to combine some of the interaction  helpers; draggables and droppables go together obviously. But draggables can also  be used with sortables, as we'll see in Chapter 12, Selecting, as well as resizables.  Draggables The draggables component is used to make any specified element or collection of  elements draggable, so that they can be picked up and moved around the page by a  visitor. Draggability is a great effect, and is a feature that can be used in numerous  ways to improve the interface of our web pages.  Using jQuery UI means that we don't have to worry about all of the tricky differences  between browsers that originally made draggable elements on web pages a nightmare  to implement and maintain.   [ 242 ]   Chapter 10  A basic drag implementation Let's look at the default implementation by first making a simple   element  draggable. We won't do any additional configuration. Therefore, all that this code  will allow you to do is pick up the element with the mouse pointer and drag it  around the viewport.  In a new file in your text editor, add the following code:                     Draggable                                                                                                                        function $ {           $ "drag" .draggable  ;         }  jQuery ;                Save this as draggable1.html in your jqueryui folder. As with the widget-based  components of jQuery UI, the draggable component can be enabled using a single  line of code. This invokes the draggable's constructor method draggable and turns  the specified element into a drag object.  [ 243 ]   Drag and Drop  We need the following files from the library to enable draggability on an element:     jquery-x.x.x.js    jquery.ui.core.js    jquery.ui.widget.js    jquery.ui.mouse.js    jquery.ui.draggable.js  We're using a plain   with a background image specified in the CSS file that  we're linking to in the   of the page. Use the following style sheet for the  drag element:  drag {   width:114px; height:114px; cursor:move;   background:url .. img draggable.png  no-repeat; }  Save this as draggable.css in the css folder. When you view the page in a browser,  you'll see that the image can be moved around to your heart's content, as shown in  the following screenshot:  Configuring draggable options The draggable component has a wide range of configurable options, giving us a  very fine degree of control over the behavior that it adds. The following table lists   the options that we can manipulate to configure and control our drag elements:  [ 244 ]   Option addClasses  Default value Used to…  true  appendTo  axis  cancel   "parent"   false   ":input,  option"  connectToSortable  false  containment  false  cursor  "auto"  cursorAt  false  delay  disabled distance  grid  handle  helper  0  false 1  false  false  "original"  Chapter 10  Add the ui-draggable class to the drag  object. Set to false to prevent this class  being added. Specify a container element for drag objects  with a helper attached. Constrain drag objects to one axis of motion.  Accepts the strings x and y as values, or the  Boolean false. Prevent certain elements from being dragged,  if they match the specified element selector.  Allow the drag object to be dropped on to  a sortable list and become one of the sort  elements. Prevent drag objects from being dragged out  of the bounds of its parent element. Specify a CSS cursor to be used while the  pointer is over the drag object.  Specify a default position at which the cursor  appears relative to the drag object, while it is  being dragged. Specify a time in milliseconds that the start of  the drag interaction should be delayed by. Disable dragging on the draggable. Specify the distance in pixels that the pointer  should move with the mouse button held  down on the drag object, before the drag  begins. Make the drag object snap to an imaginary  grid on the page. Accepts an array containing  x and y pixel values of the grid. Define a specific area of the drag object that is  used to hold the pointer on, in order to drag. Define a pseudo-drag element that is dragged  instead of the drag object. Can accept the  string values original or clone, or can  accept a function that returns the helper  element.  [ 245 ]   Drag and Drop  Option iframeFix  Default value Used to… false  opacity refreshPositions  revert  false false  false  revertDuration  500  scope  "default"  scroll  true  scrollSensitivity  20  scrollSpeed snap  snapMode  20 false  "both"  snapTolerance  20  stack  false  zIndex  false  Stop all   elements on the page from  capturing mouse events, while a drag is in  progress.  Set the opacity of the helper element. Calculate the positions of all drop objects  while the drag is in progress. Make the drag object return to its start  position once the drag ends, when set to  true. Can also accept the strings valid and  invalid, where the revert is only applied  if the drag object is dropped on a valid drop  object or vice-versa, respectively. Set the number of milliseconds it takes for the  drag object to return to its starting position.  Set the scope of the drag object with respect  to the drop objects that are valid for it.  Make the viewport automatically scroll when  the drag object is moved within the threshold  of the viewport's edge. Define how close in pixels the drag object  should get to the edge of the viewport, before  scrolling begins. Set the speed at which the viewport scrolls. Cause drag objects to snap to the edges of  specified elements. Specify which edges of the element the  drag object will snap to. Can be set to either  inside, outside, or both. Set the distance from snapping elements that  drag objects should reach, before snapping  occurs.  Ensure that the current drag object is always  on top of other drag objects in the same  group. Accepts an object containing group  and or min properties. Set the zIndex of the helper element.  [ 246 ]   Chapter 10  Using the configuration options Let's put some of these options to use. They can be configured in exactly the same  way as the options exposed by the widgets that we looked at in previous chapters,  and also usually have both getter and setter modes.  In the first example a moment ago, we used CSS to specify that the move cursor  should be used when the pointer hovers over our draggable  . Let's change  this and use the cursor option of the draggables component instead.  Remove cursor:move from draggable.css, and resave it as draggableNoCursor. css. Also change the   tag in draggable1.html, to reference the new file:     Then change the final   element to the following:       function $  {     var dragOpts = {       cursor: "move"     };     $ "drag" .draggable dragOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as draggable2.html, and try it out in your browser. An important point  to note about this option is that the move cursor that we have specified is not applied  until we actually start the drag. When using this option in place of simple CSS, we  should perhaps provide some other visual cue that the element is draggable.  Let's look at a few more of draggable's many configuration options. Change the  configuration object in draggable2.html to the following:  var dragOpts = {   cursor: "move",   axis: "y",   distance: "30",   cursorAt: {     top: 0,     left: 0   } };  [ 247 ]   Drag and Drop  This can be saved as draggable3.html. The first new option that we've configured  is the axis option, which has restricted the draggable to moving only upwards or  downwards in the page, but not side-to-side across it.  Next, we've specified 30 as the value of the distance option. This means that the  cursor will have to travel 30 pixels across the drag object, with the mouse button  held down, before the drag will begin.  The final option, cursorAt, is configured using an object literal, whose properties  can be top, right, bottom, or left. The values supplied to the properties that we  choose to use are the values relative to the drag object that the cursor will assume  when a drag occurs.  However, you'll notice in this example that the value for the left option seems to  be ignored. The reason for this is that we have configured the axis option. When  we begin the drag, the drag object will automatically move, so that the cursor is at 0  pixels from the top of the element, but it will not move, so that the cursor is 0 pixels  from the left edge as we have specified, because the drag object cannot move left.  Let's look at some more of draggable's options in action. Change draggable3.html,  so that the configuration object appears as follows:  var dragOpts = {   delay: 500,   grid: [100,100] };  Save the file as draggable4.html. The delay option, which takes a value in  milliseconds, specifies the length of time that the mouse button must be held   down with the cursor over the drag object, before the drag will begin.  The grid option is similar in usage to the steps option of the slider widget. It is  configured using an array of two values representing the number of pixels along  each axis that the drag element should jump, when it is dragged. This option can   be used safely in conjunction with the axis option.  Resetting dragged elements It is very easy to configure drag objects to return to their original starting position  on the page once they've been dropped, and there are several options that can be  used to control this behavior. Change the configuration object that we used with  draggable4.html, so that it appears as follows:  var dragOpts = {   revert: true };  [ 248 ]   Chapter 10  Save this as draggable5.html. By supplying true as the value of the revert option,  we've caused the drag object to return to its starting position at the end of any drag  interaction. However, you'll notice that the drag element doesn't just pop back to its  starting position instantly. Rather, it's smoothly animated back, with no additional  configurations required.  Another revert-related option is the revertDuration option, which we can use  to control the speed of the revert animation. Change the configuration object in  draggable5.html, so that it appears as follows:  var dragOpts = {   revert: true,   revertDuration: 100 };  Save this as draggable6.html. The default value for the revertDuration is  500 milliseconds, so by lowering it to 100, the relative speed of the animation  is considerably increased.  The actual speed of the animation will always be determined on the fly, based on  the distance from the drop point to the starting point. The revertDuration option  simply defines a target for the animation length in time.  Drag handles The handle option allows us to define a region of the drag object that can be used to  drag the object. All other areas cannot be used to drag the object. A simple analogy is  the dialog widget. You can drag the dialog around only if you click and hold on the  title bar. The title bar is the drag handle.  In the following example, we'll add a simple drag handle to our drag object. Put a  new empty   element inside the drag element:        Then, change the configuration object to the following:  var dragOpts = {   handle: "handle" };  Save this as draggable7.html. We've given the new   an id attribute and then  specified this id as the value of the handle option in our configuration object.  [ 249 ]   Drag and Drop  The handle is styled with a few simple style rules. Add the following new styles   to draggableNoCursor.css:  handle {   width:30px; height:30px; border-bottom:2px solid ff0000;    border-left:2px solid ff0000; position:absolute;      right:10px; top:10px; cursor:move; }  Save this as dragHandle.css in the css folder. Don't forget to link to the new style  sheet from the   of draggable7.html:     When we run the page in a browser, we see that the original drag object is still  draggable, but only when the handle is selected with the pointer as seen in the  following screenshot:  Helper elements Several configuration options are directly related to drag helpers. A helper is a  substitute element that is used to show where the object is on screen, while the   drag is in progress, instead of moving the actual draggable.  A helper can be a very simple object in place of the actual drag object. This can help  cut-down on the intensity of the drag operation, lessening the load on the visitor's  processor. Once the drag has completed, the actual element can be moved to the   new location.  [ 250 ]   Let's look at how helpers can be used in the following example. Remove the     we used for the handle and revert back to the draggable.css style sheet  in draggable7.html, then change the configuration object to the following:  Chapter 10  var dragOpts = {   helper: "clone" };  Save this file as draggable8.html. The value clone for the helper option causes  an exact copy of the original drag object to be created and used as the draggable.  Therefore, the original object stays in its starting position at all times.  This also causes the clone object to revert back to its starting position, an effect  which cannot be changed, even by supplying false as the value of the revert  option. The following screenshot shows the clone option in action:  In addition to the string clone and the default original, we can also use a function  as the value of this option. This allows us to specify our own custom element to use  as the helper.  Change the final   element in draggable8.html to the following:       function $  {     function helperMaker   {       return $ " ", {         css: {           border: "4px solid ccc",           opacity: 0.5,           height: 110,           width: 120         }       } ;  [ 251 ]   Drag and Drop      }     var dragOpts = {       helper: helperMaker     };     $ "drag" .draggable dragOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this file as draggable9.html. Our helperMaker   function creates a new    element using standard jQuery functionality, and then sets some CSS  properties on it to define its physical appearance. It then, importantly, returns the  new element. When supplying a function as the value of the helper option, the  function must return an element  either a jQuery object, as in this example, or an  actual DOMNode .  Now when the drag begins, it is our custom helper that becomes the drag object.  Because the custom element is much simpler than the original drag object, it can   help improve the responsiveness and performance of the application it is used in.  The following screenshot shows our custom helper:  Helper opacity We used the css jQuery method in this example during the  creation of the custom helper. However, we can also use the  opacity option of the drag object to set the opacity of helper  elements as a cross-platform solution.  Constraining the drag Another aspect of drag scenarios is that of containment. In our examples so far, the    of the page has been the container of the drag object. There are also options  that we can configure to specify how the drag object behaves with regard to another  container element.  [ 252 ]   Chapter 10  We'll look at these in the following examples, starting with the container option,  which allows us to specify a container element for the drag object. In the    of draggable9.html, add the following link to the style sheet that we'll be using  in this example:     Then, wrap the drag element within a container   as follows:               var dragOpts = {   containment: "parent" };  Then, change the configuration object to the following:  Save this variant as draggable10.html. On the page, we've added a new    element as the parent of the existing drag element. In the code, we've used the value  parent for the containment option, so the element that is the direct parent of the  drag object  the   with the id of container in this example  will be used as  the container.  The parent   needs some basic styling to give it dimensions and so it can be  seen on the page. Add the following code to draggable.css and resave the file as  draggableContainer.css. Remember, this string is not the id of an element, or a  jQuery selector  although selectors are also supported .  container {   height:250px; width:250px; border:2px solid ff0000; }  When you run the page in your browser, you'll see that the drag object cannot exceed  the boundary of its container.  Along with the string parent that we used in this example, we could also specify a  selector, for example:  var dragOpts = {   containment: "container" };  [ 253 ]   Drag and Drop  There are three additional options related to drag objects within containers and these  are all related to scrolling. However, you should note that these are only applicable  when the document is the container.  The default value of the scroll option is true, but when we drag the    to the edge of the container, it does not scroll. You may have noticed in previous  examples, where the drag object was not within a specified container, the viewport  automatically scrolled. We can fix this by setting the CSS overflow style to auto in  a style sheet if necessary.  Snapping Drag elements can be given an almost magnetic quality by configuring snapping.  This feature causes dragged elements to align themselves to specified elements,  while they are being dragged.  In the next example, we'll look at the effects that snapping has on the behavior of the  drag object. Get rid of the container we added in the previous example, and add a  new empty   element directly after the drag element, as follows:  Then, change the configuration object, so that it appears as follows:         var dragOpts = {   snap: "snapper",   snapMode: "inner",   snapTolerance: 50 };  Save this as draggable11.html. We also need some additional styles; add the  following code to the bottom of draggable.css:  snapper {    width:300px; height:300px; border:1px solid ff0000; }  Save this file as draggableSnap.css in the css directory. Don't forget to add a link  to the new style sheet in the   of the page:     We've supplied the selector snapper as the value of the snap option in our  configuration object, and have added a   element with a matching id to the  page. Therefore, our drag object will snap to this element on the page, while the  object is being dragged.  [ 254 ]   Chapter 10  We also set the snapMode option to inner  the other possible values are outer and  both , so snapping will occur on the inside edges of our snapper element. If we  drag the element towards the outer edge of the snapper element and get within the  tolerance range, the element will snap to the inner edge.  Finally, we've set the snapTolerance to 50, which is the maximum distance  in  pixels  the drag object will need to get to the snapper element, before snapping will  occur. As soon as a drag object is within this range, it will snap to the element.  When we drag the image within 50 pixels of the edge of the snapper element,  the drag object will automatically align itself to that edge, as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 255 ]   Drag and Drop  Draggable event callbacks In addition to the options that we have already looked at, there are three more that  can be used as callback functions to execute code after specific custom events occur.  These events are listed in the following table:  Event drag start stop  Fired when… The mouse is moved while dragging Dragging starts Dragging stops  When defining callback functions to make use of these events, the functions will  always receive two arguments automatically, the original event object as the first  argument and a second object containing the following properties:  Property helper position  absolutePosition  Usage A jQuery object representing the helper element A nested object with properties top and left, which is  the position of the helper element relative to the original  drag element A nested object with properties top and left, which is  the position of the helper element relative to the page  Using the callbacks and the two objects that are passed as arguments is extremely  easy. We can look at a brief example to highlight their usage. Remove the snapper    in draggable11.html, and change the configuration object as follows:  var dragOpts = {   start: function e, ui  {     ui.helper.addClass "up" ;   },   stop: function e, ui  {     ui.helper.removeClass "up" ;   } };  Save this as draggable12.html. We also need a new style sheet for this example;  add the following code to draggable.css:  drag.up {    width:120px; height:121px;    background:url .. img draggable_on.png  no-repeat; }  [ 256 ]   Chapter 10  Save this version of the style sheet as draggableEvents.css in the css directory,  and don't forget to update the link in the   of the page to point to the new  style sheet.  In this example, our configuration object contains just two options—the start and  stop callbacks. We set literal functions as the values of these options. What all the  functions do in this example is add or remove a classname respectively.  The classname adds a slightly different background image to the draggable   element, which when applied appears as shown in the following before and   during screenshot:  Let's move on to a slightly more complex example where we can make use of the  second object passed to our callbacks. We need a couple of new elements on the  page; change the   of the page, so that it contains the following elements:               Then change the final   element, so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     var dragOpts = {       stop: function e, ui  {         var rel = $ " ", {           text: "The helper was moved " + ui.position.top + "px down,               and " + ui.position.left + "px to the left of its               original position."         } ,         offset = $ " ", {  [ 257 ]   Drag and Drop            text: "The helper was moved " + ui.offset.top + "px from               the top, and " + ui.offset.left + "px to the left               relative to the viewport."         } ;         $ "results" .empty  .append rel .append offset ;       }     };     $ "drag" .draggable dragOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as draggable13.html. We've defined a callback function as the value of the  stop option, so it will be executed each time a drag interaction stops. Our callback  function receives the event object  which we don't need but must specify in order  to access the second object  and a ui object containing useful information about the  draggable helper.  All our function needs to do is, create two new   elements, concatenating the  values found in the ui object: ui.position.top, ui.position.left, ui.offset. top, and ui.offset.left. It then inserts the new elements into the results  .  Here's how the page should look after the draggable has been dragged:  Draggable's methods The draggable interaction helper does not expose any unique methods of its own,  only the common API methods, which are, destroy, disable, enable, option,  and widget.  [ 258 ]   Chapter 10  Droppables In a nutshell, the droppables component of jQuery UI gives us a place for drag  objects to be dropped. A region of the page is defined as a droppable, and when a  drag object is dropped onto that region, something else is triggered. You can react   to drops on a valid target very easily, using the extensive event model exposed by  this component.  Let's start with the default droppable implementation. In a new file in your text  editor, add the following page:                     Droppable                                                                                                              function $ {         $ "drag" .draggable  ;         $ "target" .droppable  ;       }  jQuery ;              [ 259 ]   Drag and Drop  Save this as droppable1.html. The extremely basic style sheet that is linked to,  in this example, is simply an updated version of draggable.css, and appears  as follows:  drag {   width:114px; height:114px; margin-bottom:5px; z-index:2;   cursor:move; background:url .. img draggable.png  no-repeat; } target {   width:200px; height:200px; border:3px solid 000;   position:absolute; right:20px; top:20px; z-index:1; }  Save this as droppable.css in the css folder. When the page is run in a browser,  it should look like the following screenshot:  In this example, the droppable is created  we can see this with the class name   ui-droppable that is added to the specified element when the page loads .  Even though we haven't added any additional logic to our script, events are firing  throughout the interaction on both the drag object and the drop target. A little later  in the chapter, we'll look at these events in more detail to see how we can hook into  them, to react to successful drops.  The files we used for this basic droppable implementation are as follows:     jquery-x.x.x.js    jquery.ui.core.js    jquery.ui.widget.js  [ 260 ]   Chapter 10     jquery.ui.mouse.js    jquery.ui.draggable.js    jquery.ui.droppable.js  As you can see, the droppables component is an extension of draggables, rather  than a completely independent component. Therefore, it requires the jquery. ui.draggable.js file in addition to its own source file. The reason our droppable  does nothing, is because we haven't configured it, so let's do that next.  Configuring droppables The droppable class is considerably smaller than the draggable class, and there are  fewer configurable options for us to play with. The following table lists those options  available to us:  Option accept  Default "*"  activeClass  false  addClasses disabled greedy  true false false  hoverClass  false  Used to… Set the draggable element s  that the droppable will  accept. Set the class that is applied to the droppable, while an  accepted drag object is being dragged. Add the ui-droppable class to the droppable. Disable the droppable. Stop drop events from bubbling when a drag object is  dropped onto nested droppables. Set the class that is applied to the droppable, while  an accepted drag object is within the boundary of the  droppable. Define sets of drag objects and drop targets.  scope tolerance  "default" "intersect" Set the mode that triggers an accepted drag object   being considered over a droppable.  Configuring accepted draggables In order to get a visible result from the droppable, we're going to use a couple of  the configurable options together in the following example, which will highlight the  drop target when an accepted drag object is interacted with. Change the elements   on the page in droppable1.html, so that they appear as follows:            [ 261 ]   Drag and Drop  Next, change the final   element to the following:       function $  {     $ ".drag" .draggable  ;     var dropOpts = {       accept: "drag1",       activeClass: "activated"     };     $ "target" .droppable dropOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as droppable2.html. The accept option takes a selector. In this example,  we've specified that only the drag object that has an id of drag1 should be accepted  by the droppable.  We've also specified the classname activated as the value of the activeClass  option. This classname will be applied to the droppable when the accepted drag  object starts to be dragged. The hoverClass option can be used in exactly the same  way to add styles, when an accepted drag object is over a droppable.  We need a new style sheet for this example; modify droppable.css so that it  appears as follows:  .drag {   width:114px; height:114px; margin-bottom:5px; z-index:2;   cursor:move; background:url .. img draggable.png  no-repeat; } target {   width:200px; height:200px; border:3px solid 000;   position:absolute; right:20px; top:20px; z-index:1; } .activated {   border:3px solid 339900; background-color:ccffcc; }  Save this file as droppableActive.css in the css folder, and link to it in the    of the page:     [ 262 ]   When we view this page in a browser, we should find that when we move the first  drag object, which is defined as accepted, the droppable picks up the activated  class and turns green. However, when the second drag object is moved, the drop  target does not respond. The following screenshot shows how the page should look,  while the first drag object is being dragged:  Chapter 10  In addition to a string value, the accept option can also take a function as its value.  This function will be executed once for every drag object that is on the page. The  function must return either true, to indicate that the drag object is accepted, or  false to indicate that it's not.  To see the function value of the accept option in action, change the final    element in droppable2.html to the following:       function $  {     $ ".drag" .draggable  ;     function dragEnrol el  {       return  el.attr "id"  === "drag1"  ? true : false;     }     var dropOpts = {       accept: dragEnrol,       activeClass: "activated"     };     $ "target" .droppable dropOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    [ 263 ]   Drag and Drop  Save this variation as droppable3.html. On the surface, the page works exactly  the same as it did in the previous example. But this time, acceptability is being  determined by the JavaScript ternary statement within the dragEnrol function,  instead of a simple selector.  Note that the function we use with the accept option is automatically passed by  a jQuery object representing the drag object as an argument, so we can call jQuery  methods on this object. This makes it easy to obtain information about it, such as its  id as in this example. This callback can be extremely useful when advanced filtering  beyond a selector is required.  Tolerance Drop tolerance refers to the way a droppable detects whether a drag object is over it  or not. The default value is intersect. The following table lists the modes that this  option may be configured with:  Mode fit  intersect  pointer  touch  Implementation The drag object must be completely within the boundary of the  droppable for it to be considered over it At least 25 percent of the drag object must be within the boundary of  the droppable before it is considered over it The mouse pointer must touch the droppable boundary before the  drag object is considered over the droppable The drag object is over the droppable as soon as an edge of the drag  object touches an edge of the droppable  So far, all of our droppable examples have used intersect, which is the default value  of the tolerance option. Let's see what difference the other values for this option  make to an implementation of the component. Revert to the drag and target  elements from droppable2.html, and then use the following configuration object:  var dropOpts = {   hoverClass: "activated",   tolerance: "pointer" };  Save this as droppable4.html. This time we use the hoverClass option to specify  the classname that is added to the droppable. We then use the tolerance option  to specify which tolerance mode is used.  The part of the drag object that is over the droppable is irrelevant in this example; it  is the mouse pointer that must cross the boundary of the droppable, while a drag is  in progress for our over class to be activated:  [ 264 ]   Chapter 10  For good measure, the following screenshot shows how the touch mode works.  Here, the drag element itself need only touch the edge of the droppable, before  triggering our over class:  Droppable event callbacks The options that we've looked at so far configure various operational features of the  droppable. In addition to these, there are almost as many callback options, so that we  can define functions that react to different things occurring to the droppable and its  accepted drag objects. These options are listed in the following table:  Callback option activate deactivate drop  Invoked when… An accepted drag object begins dragging An accepted drag object stops being dragged An accepted drag object is dropped onto a droppable  [ 265 ]   Drag and Drop  Callback option out  over  Invoked when… An accepted drag object is moved out of the bounds   including the tolerance  of the droppable An accepted drag object is moved within the bounds   including the tolerance  of the droppable  Let's put together a basic example that makes use of these callback options. We'll add  a status bar to our droppable that reports the status of different interactions between  the drag object and the droppable. In droppable4.html, add the following new  element directly after the target element:      Then, change the final   element to this:       function $  {     $ "drag" .draggable  ;     var dropOpts = {       accept: "drag",       activate: eventCallback,       deactivate: eventCallback,       drop: eventCallback,       out: eventCallback,       over: eventCallback     },     eventMessages = {       dropactivate: "A draggable is active",       dropdeactivate: "A draggable is no longer active",       drop: "An accepted draggable was dropped on the droppable",       dropout: "An accepted draggable was moved off the droppable",       dropover: "An accepted draggable is over the droppable"     };     function eventCallback e  {       var message = $ " ", {         id: "message",         text: eventMessages[e.type]       } ;       $ "status" .empty  .append message ;     }     $ "target" .droppable dropOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    [ 266 ]   Save this file as droppable5.html. We also need some new styles for this example.  Create a new style sheet in your text editor, and add to it the following selectors   and rules:  drag {   width:114px; height:114px; margin-bottom:5px; z-index:2;   cursor:move; background:url .. img draggable.png  no-repeat;  Chapter 10  } target {   width:250px; height:200px; border:3px solid 000;    position:absolute; right:20px; top:20px; z-index:1; } status {   width:230px; padding:10px; border:3px solid 000;   position:absolute; top:223px; right:20px; color:000; } message { margin:0px; font-size:80%; }  Save this file as droppableEvents.css in the css directory. Don't forget to update  the   in the   of the page, to point to the new style sheet:     The   of the page contains, along with the droppable, a new status bar, which  in this case is a simple   element. In the script, we define our configurable  options, specifying that the function eventCallback should be executed when  each of the events are detected.  Next, we define an object literal, in which the key for each property is set to one of  the event types that may be triggered. The value of each property is the message   that we want to display for any given event.  We then define our callback function. Like other components, the callback functions  used in the droppables component automatically pass two objects—the event object  and an object representing the drag element.  We use the type property of the event object to retrieve the appropriate message  from the eventMessages object. We then use standard jQuery element creation and  manipulation methods to add the message to the status bar.  [ 267 ]   Drag and Drop  Here's how the status bar should look following an interaction:  After playing around with the page, it may appear that one of our messages is not  being displayed. When the drag object is dropped onto the droppable, our drop  message is not shown.  Actually, the message is shown, but because the deactivate event is fired  immediately after the drop event, the drop message is overwritten right away. There  are a number of ways we could work around this; the simplest, of course, would be  not to use the drop and deactivate options together.  Although we only make use of the event object  e  in this example, a second object  is also passed automatically to any callback functions we use with the event options.  This object contains information relevant to the droppable such as the following:  Property ui.draggable ui.helper ui.position ui.offset  Value The current drag object The current drag helper The current relative position of the helper The current absolute position of the helper  Scope Both the draggables and droppables feature the scope configuration option that  allows us to easily define groups of drag objects and drop targets. In this next example,  we can look at how these options can be configured and the effect that configuring  them has. We'll link to another new style sheet in this example, so in the   of  droppable5.html, change the   element, so that it appears as follows:     [ 268 ]   We need a number of new elements for this example. Change the   of the page  in droppable5.html, so that it contains the following elements:  Chapter 10  To make these elements behave correctly, change the final   element  to the following:   A   B       A     a1     a2     a3         B     b1     b2     b3          function $  {      var dragOpts_a = {       scope: "a"     },     dragOpts_b = {       scope: "b"     },     dropOpts_a = {       hoverClass: "over",       scope: "a"     },     dropOpts_b = {       hoverClass: "over",       scope: "b"     };     $ ".group_a" .draggable dragOpts_a ;     $ ".group_b" .draggable dragOpts_b ;     $ "target_a" .droppable dropOpts_a ;     $ "target_b" .droppable dropOpts_b ;   }  jQUery ;    [ 269 ]   Drag and Drop  Save this file as droppable6.html. Next, we need to create the new CSS file; in a new  page in your text editor, add the following code:  target_a, target_b, group_a, group_b {   width:150px; height:150px; padding:50px;    margin:0 20px 20px 0; border:2px solid black; float:left;   font-family:Georgia; font-size:100px; color:red;    text-align:center; } group_a, group_b {   width:518px; height:115px; padding:5px 0 5px 5px;   margin-bottom:20px; clear:both;   } p { float:left; margin:0 20px 0; } .group_a, .group_b {   width:94px; height:94px; padding:20px 0 0 20px;   margin-right:20px; float:left; font-family:arial;   font-size:14px; color:red; text-align:left;   background:url .. img draggable.png  no-repeat;   } .over { background-color:ccffcc; }  Save this as droppableScope.css in the css folder.  The page has two drop targets and two groups of three drag objects, all of which are  labeled to show the group they belong to. In the script, we define two configuration  objects for the two groups of draggables, and two configuration objects for the drop  targets. Within each configuration object, we set the scope option.  The values we set for the scope of each drop target matches the scope of each drag  object. Therefore, if we want to use scope, it must be defined for both the drag object  and drop target. If we try to set the scope of a droppable, but don't give at least one  drag object the same scope, an error is thrown.  Setting the scope gives us another technique for defining which drag objects are  accepted by which drop targets, but it is provided as an alternative to the accept  option; the two options should not be used together.  [ 270 ]   The following screenshot shows how the page should appear:  Chapter 10  Greedy The final option that we are going to look at in connection with the droppable  component is the greedy option. This option can be useful in situations where there  is a droppable nested within another droppable. If we don't use this option, both  droppables will fire events during certain interactions.  The greedy option is an easy way to avoid event-bubbling problems in an efficient  and cross-browser manner. Let's take a closer look at this option with an example.  Change the   in droppable6.html, so that it links to a new style sheet:     [ 271 ]   Drag and Drop  Then change the  , so that it contains the following elements:                  Finally, change the last   element, so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     $ ".target" .css { opacity:"0.5" } ;     var dragOpts = {       zIndex: 3     },     dropOpts = {       drop: dropCallback,       greedy: true     };     function dropCallback e  {       var message = $ "  ", {         id: "message",         text: "The firing droppable was " + e.target.id       } ;       $ "status" .append message ;     }     $ "drag" .draggable dragOpts ;     $ ".target" .droppable dropOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this example as droppable7.html. The CSS for this example is simple and  builds on the CSS of previous examples.  drag {   width:114px; height:114px; margin-bottom:5px; cursor:move;   background:url .. img draggable.png  no-repeat;   } outer {   width:300px; height:300px; border:3px solid 000;   float:right;   background-color:99FF99; } inner {   width:100px; height:100px; border:3px solid 000;   position:relative; top:100px; left:100px;  [ 272 ]   Chapter 10    background-color:FFFF99; } status {   width:280px; padding:10px; border:3px solid 000;   float:right; clear:right; color:000; } message { margin:0px; font-size:80%; }  Save this as droppableNesting.css in the css folder.  In this example, we have a smaller droppable nested in the center of a larger  droppable. Their opacity is set using the standard jQuery library's css   method.  In this example, this is necessary, because if we alter the zIndex of the elements, so  that the drag object appears above the nested droppables, the target element is not  reported correctly.  In this example, we use the zIndex option of the draggables component to show  the drag object above the droppables, while a drag is in progess. The dropCallback  function is used to add a simple message to the status bar, notifying us which  droppable was the target of the drop.   Our droppables configuration object uses the drop option to wire-up our callback  function. However, the key option is the greedy option that makes whichever target  the draggable is dropped on, to stop the event from escaping into other targets.  If you run the page, and drop the drag object onto one of the droppables, you should  see something as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 273 ]   Drag and Drop  The net effect of setting the greedy option to true is that the inner droppable  prevents the event from propagating into the outer droppable and firing again.  If you comment out the greedy option and drop the draggable onto the inner  droppable, the status message will be inserted twice, once by the inner droppable  and once by the outer droppable.   Droppable methods Like the draggable component, droppable has only the common API methods shared  by all library components. This is another component that is primarily option-driven.  The methods available to us are the same ones exposed by draggable, namely the  standard methods shared by all library components.  A drag and drop game We've now reached the point where we can have a little fun by putting what we've  learned about these two components into a fully working example. In our final drag  and drop example, we're going to combine both of these components to create a  simple maze game.  The game will consist of a draggable marker that will need to be navigated through  a simple maze to a specified droppable at the other end of the maze. We can make  things a little more challenging, so that if any of the maze walls are touched by the  marker, it will return to the starting position.  The following screenshot shows what we're going to build:  [ 274 ]   Let's start with the markup. In a new page in your text editor, add the following code:  Chapter 10                           jQuery UI Draggable Maze Game                                                                                                                                  Save this file as dragMaze.html. On the page, we have our outer container that we've  given an id of maze. We have   elements for the starting and ending positions,  as well as for the drag marker. Our map will need walls. Rather than hand-coding  the 46 required walls for the map pattern that we're going to use, I thought we could  use jQuery to do this for us.  We left an empty   element at the bottom of our page. Let's fill that up next  with the following code:   function $  {   var dragOpts = {     containment: "maze"   },   dropOpts = {     tolerance: "touch",  [ 275 ]   Drag and Drop      over: function e, ui  {       $ "drag" .draggable "destroy" .remove  ;       $ " ", {         id: "drag",         css: {           left: 0,           top: 0         }       } .appendTo "maze" ;       $ "drag" .draggable dragOpts ;     }   },   endOpts = {     over: function e, ui  {       $ "drag" .draggable "destroy" .remove  ;       alert "Woo! You did it!" ;     }   };   for  var x = 1; x < 47; x++  {     $ " ", {       id: "a" + x,       class: "wall"     } .appendTo "maze" ;   }   $ "drag" .draggable dragOpts ;   $ ".wall" .droppable dropOpts ;   $ "end" .droppable endOpts ;     }  jQuery ;  We also need to style up the walls of the maze, but we can't use any simple  JavaScript pattern for this. Unfortunately, we have to hardcode them. In another   new file in your text editor, add the following selectors and rules:  maze {   width:441px; height:441px; border:10px solid 000000;   position:relative; background-color:ffffff; } drag {   width:10px; height:10px; z-index:1;    background-color:0000FF;  } start {   width:44px; height:10px; background-color:00CC00;   position:absolute; top:0; left:0; z-index:0; }  [ 276 ]   Chapter 10  end {   width:44px; height:10px; background-color:FF0000;   position:absolute; top:0; right:130px; } .wall { background-color:000000; position:absolute; } a1 { width:10px; height:133px; left:44px; top:0; } a2 { width:44px; height:10px; left:0; top:167px; } a3 { width:44px; height:10px; left:44px; top:220px; } a4 { width:89px; height:10px; left:0; bottom:176px; } a5 { width:94px; height:10px; left:0; bottom:88px; } a6 { width:10px; height:41px; left:40px; bottom:0; } a7 { width:10px; height:48px; left:88px; top:44px; } a8 { width:78px; height:10px; left:54px; top:123px; } a9 { width:10px; height:97px; left:88px; top:133px } a10 { width:10px; height:45px; left:40px; bottom:98px; } a11 { width:88px; height:10px; left:89px; bottom:132px; } a12 { width:10px; height:97px; left:132px; bottom:35px; } a13 { width:10px; height:44px; left:89px; bottom:142px; } a14 { width:92px; height:10px; left:40px; bottom:35px; } a15 { width:89px; height:10px; left:88px; top:34px; } a16 { width:10px; height:145px; left:132px; top:76px; } a17 { width:44px; height:10px; left:132px; top:220px; } a18 { width:133px; height:10px; left:132px; bottom:175px; } a19 { width:10px; height:107px; left:176px; bottom:35px; } a20 { width:10px; height:150px; left:176px; top:34px; } a21 { width:35px; height:10px; left:186px; top:174px } a22 { width:35px; height:10px; left:186px; bottom:88px; } a23 { width:122px; height:10px; left:186px; top:88px; } a24 { width:10px; height:44px; left:220px; top:0px; } a25 { width:10px; height:55px; left:220px; top:174px; } a26 { width:10px; height:45px; left:220px; bottom:130px; } a27 { width:133px; height:10px; right:88px; top:44px; } a28 { width:10px; height:168px; right:166px; top:98px; } a29 { width:44px; height:10px; right:176px; top:130px; } a30 { width:10px; height:98px; right:166px; bottom:35px; } a31 { width:133px; height:10px; right:88px; bottom:35px; } a32 { width:10px; height:133px; right:78px; top:44px; } a33 { width:44px; height:10px; right:88px; top:128px; } a34 { width:131px; height:10px; right:35px; top:171px; } a35 { width:43px; height:10px; right:123px; top:220px; } a36 { width:10px; height:91px; right:123px; bottom:85px; } a37 { width:131px; height:10px; right:35px; bottom:123px; } a38 { width:10px; height:55px; right:79px; top:220px; }  [ 277 ]   Drag and Drop  a39 { width:44px; height:10px; right:0; top:122px; } a40 { width:10px; height:54px; right:79px; bottom:35px; } a41 { width:79px; height:10px; right:0; bottom:79px; } a42 { width:10px; height:45px; right:35px; top:44px; } a43 { width:43px; height:10px; right:35px; top:88px; } a44 { width:79px; height:10px; right:0; top:220px; } a45 { width:10px; height:44px; right:35px; bottom:132px; } a46 { width:10px; height:50px; right:35px; bottom:0; }  Save this file as dragMaze.css in the css folder.  Let's review what the new code does. First, we define a simple configuration object  for the drag object. The only option we need to configure is the containment option  that constrains the draggable marker element within the maze. We can then go ahead  and create the draggable behavior with the draggable constructor method.  Next, we define the configuration object for the walls. Each wall is treated as a  droppable. We specify touch as the value of the tolerance option, and add a  callback function to the over option. Therefore, whenever the drag object touches  a wall, the function will be executed.  All we do in this function is destroy the current drag object and remove it from   the page. We then create a new drag object back at the starting position and make  it draggable once more. There is no cancelDrag method that causes the drag object  to act as if it had been dropped and revert to its starting position, but we can easily  replicate this behavior ourselves.  We then add another droppable configuration object that configures the ending point  of the maze. All we configure for this droppable is a function to execute, when the  draggable is over this droppable. In this function, we remove the drag object again  and present the user with an alert congratulating them.  We then use a simple for loop to add the walls to our maze. We use the plain-vanilla  for loop in conjunction with jQuery to create 46   elements, and add id and  class attributes to each one, before appending them to the maze container. Finally,  we make the drag object draggable and the walls and the end target droppables.   We can now attempt to navigate the marker from the starting point to the finish by  dragging it through the maze. If any wall is touched, the marker will return to the  starting point. We could make it harder  by adding additional obstacles to navigate,  and so on , but for the purpose of having fun with jQuery UI draggables and  droppables, our work here is complete.  [ 278 ]   Chapter 10  Summary We looked at two very useful library components in this chapter—the draggable  and droppable components. Draggables and droppables, as we saw, are very closely  related and have been designed to be used with each other, allowing us to create  advanced and highly-interactive interfaces.  We've covered a lot of material in this chapter, so let's recap on what we have  learned. We saw that the draggable behavior can be added to any element on  the page with zero configuration. There may be implementations where this is  acceptable, but usually we'll want to use one or more of the component's extensive  range of configurable options.   In the second part of this chapter, we saw that the droppables class allows us  to easily define areas on the page that draggables can be dropped onto, and can  react to things being dropped on them. We can also make use of a smaller range of  configurable droppable options to implement more advanced droppable behavior.  Both components feature an effective event model for hooking into the interesting  moments of any drag and drop interaction. We also saw that each component has  a simple set of methods for enabling or disabling drag or drop, and also a destroy  method for removing the functionality  but not the underlying elements  from   the page.  Our final example showed how both the draggables and droppables components can  be used together to create a fun and interactive game. Although the game was very  basic by modern gaming standards, it nevertheless provides a sound base that we  can easily build upon to add features.  In the next chapter, we'll take a look at the resizable component, which allows users  to resize selected elements using a familiar drag-based interface.  [ 279 ]    The Resizable Component  We have already seen resizables in action briefly when we looked at the dialog  widget, earlier in the book. In this chapter, we're going to focus on it directly.  However, the dialog is a perfect example of how useful the resizable component   can be in a real-world implementation.  The resizable widget adds the same functionality as that, which is automatically  added to   elements in WebKit browsers such as Safari or Chrome,  or newer versions of Firefox. In these browsers, a resize handle is added to the  bottom-right corner, which allows the element to be resized. With the jQuery UI  resizable component, we can add this behavior to almost any element on the page.  In this chapter, we'll be looking at the following aspects of the component:  Implementing basic resizability   	  	 The configurable options available for use  	 Specifying which resize handles to add  	 Managing the resizable's minimum and maximum sizes  	 The role of resize helpers and ghosts  	 A look at the built-in resize animations  	 How to react to resize events  	 Determining the new size of a resizable  	 Using a resizable with other library widgets  The resizable is a flexible component that can be used with a wide range of   different elements. Throughout the examples in this chapter, we'll mostly be   using simple   elements, so that the focus remains on the component and  not on the underlying HTML. We will also look at some brief examples using     and   elements, towards the end of the chapter.   The Resizable Component  The resizable component works well with other components and is very often used  in conjunction with draggables. However, while you can easily make draggable  components resizable  think dialog , the two classes are in no way related.  A basic resizable Let's implement the basic resizable, so we can see just how easy making elements  resizable is, when you use jQuery UI as the driving force behind your pages. In a  new file in your text editor add the following code:                     Resizable      <link rel="stylesheet"         href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                                                                     <script        src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.resizable.js">                    function $ {         $ "resize" .resizable  ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as resizable1.html. The basic widget method, used with no arguments  for the default implementation, uses the same simplified syntax as the rest of the  library. This requires just one line of code for the example to work.  [ 282 ]   Along with the CSS framework files that we need for any resizables implementation,  we also use a custom style sheet to add basic dimensions and borders to our  resizable  . Use the following CSS in a new file in your text editor:  Chapter 11  resize {   width:200px; height:200px; margin:30px 0 0 30px;   border:1px solid 7a7a7a; }  Save this file as resize.css in the css folder. We've given the resizable element's  dimensions in our CSS, because without them the   will stretch the width  of the screen. We've also specified a border to clearly define it, as the default  implementation only adds a single resize handle to the bottom-right corner of the  targeted element. The following screenshot shows how our basic page should look,  after the   has been resized:  The files required for the resizable component are as follows:   	 jquery-x.x.x.js  	 jquery. ui.core.js  	 jquery. ui.widget.js  	 jquery.ui.mouse.js  	 jquery.ui.resizable.js  The component automatically adds the three required elements for the drag handles.  Although the only visible resize handle is the one in the bottom-right corner, both  the bottom and right edges also allow for resizing.  [ 283 ]   The Resizable Component  Resizable options The following table lists the configurable options that we have at our disposal when  working with the resizable component:  Option alsoResize  Default value false  animate  false  animateDuration  slow  animateEasing  swing  aspectRatio  false  autoHide  false  cancel  ':input,option'  containment  false  delay  0  disabled distance  ghost  grid  false 1  false  false  Used to… Automatically resize specified elements  in sync with the resizable. Animate the resizable element to its  new size. Set the speed of the animation. Values  can be integers, specifying the number  of milliseconds, or one of the string  values slow, normal, or fast. Add easing effects to the resize  animation. Maintain the aspect ratio of the resize  element. Accepts numerical custom  aspect ratios in addition to Boolean  values. Hide the resize handles until the  resizable is hovered over with the  mouse pointer. Stop specified elements from being  resizable. Constrain the resizable within the  boundary of the specified container  element. Set a delay in milliseconds from when  the pointer is clicked on a resizable  handle to when the resizing begins. Disable the component at page load. Set the number of pixels the mouse  pointer must move with the mouse  button held down before resizing  begins. Show a semi-transparent helper  element while the resizing is taking  place. Snap the resize to imaginary grid lines  while resizing is taking place.  [ 284 ]   Option handles  Default value 'e, se, s'  helper  false  maxHeight  maxWidth  minHeight  minWidth  null  null  null  null  Chapter 11  Used to… Define which handles to use for  resizing. Accepts a string containing  any of the following values: n, ne, e,  se, s, sw, w, nw, or all. The string could  also be an object where the properties  are any of the above and the values are  jQuery selectors matching the elements  to use as handles. Add a class name to the helper element  that is applied during resizing. Set the maximum height the resizable  may be changed to.  Set the maximum width the resizable  may be set to. Set the minimum height the resizable  may be changed to. Set the minimum width the resizable  may be set to.  Configuring resize handles Thanks to the handles configuration option, specifying which handles we would  like to add to our target element is exceptionally easy. In resizable1.html, change  the final   element, so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     var resizeOpts = {       handles: "all"     };     $ "resize" .resizable resizeOpts ;   }  jQUery ;    Save this as resizable2.html. When you run the example in a browser, you'll see  that although the component looks exactly as it did before, we can now use any edge  or corner to resize the  .  [ 285 ]   The Resizable Component  Adding additional handle images One thing you'll notice straight away is that although the element is resizable  along any axis, there's no visual cue to make this obvious; the component will  automatically add the resize stripes to the bottom-right corner, but it's up to us   to add the rest.  There are several different ways to do this. Although the method doesn't add images  to the other three corners, it does insert DOM elements with classnames, so we can  easily target these with CSS and provide our own images. This is what we'll do next.  In a new page in your text editor, add the following style rules:  resize {   width:200px; height:200px; margin:30px 0 0 30px;   border:1px solid 7a7a7a; } .ui-resizable-sw, .ui-resizable-nw, .ui-resizable-ne {   width:12px; height:12px;   background:url .. img handles.png  no-repeat 0 0; } .ui-resizable-sw { left:0; bottom:0; } .ui-resizable-nw {   left:0; top:0; background-position:0 -12px; } .ui-resizable-ne {   right:0; top:0; background-position:0 -24px; }  Save this file in the css folder as resizeHandles.css. We provide our own image  for this example, which is a sprite file containing copies of the standard bottom-right  image flipped and reversed  this can be found in the code download .  Our selectors target the classnames that are automatically added to the handle  elements, by the control. Link to the new style sheet in the   of resizable2. html and resave it as resizable3.html:     [ 286 ]   The new style sheet should give our element the following appearance:  Chapter 11  Another configuration option related to resize handles and how they are displayed is  autoHide. Let's take a quick look at this option next. Change the configuration object  in resizable3.html to the following:  var resizeOpts = {   handles: "all",   autoHide: true  }  Save this version as resizable4.html. We've added the autoHide option and set its  value to true in this example. Configuring this option hides all of the resize handles  until the mouse pointer moves onto the resizable element. This is great for a minimal  intrusion of the additional DOM elements when there is pictorial content inside the  resizable element.  Defining size limits Restricting the minimum or maximum sizes that the target element can be resized  to, is made exceptionally easy with four configurable options, which we will see  in action in the next example. It's better to have some content in the container for  this example, so add some layout text in a   element within our resizable in  resizable4.html:   Lorem ipsum etc, etc…   [ 287 ]   Change the configuration object that we used in resizable4.html to as follows:  The Resizable Component  var resizeOpts = {   maxWidth: 500,   maxHeight: 500,   minWidth: 100,   minHeight: 100 };  Save this as resizable5.html. This time, the configuration object uses the  dimension-boundary options to specify the minimum and maximum height and   width that the resizable may be adjusted to. These options take simple integers   as their values.  As we can see, when we run this example, the resizable now adheres to the sizes we  have specified, whereas in previous examples, the resizable element's minimum size  was the combined size of its resize handles, and it had no maximum.  So far, our resizable has been an empty   and you may be wondering how  the resizable handles minimum and maximum sizes, when there is content  within the target element. The restrictions are maintained, but we'll need to add  overflow:hidden to the CSS. Otherwise, the content may overflow the resizable,  if there is too much for the minimum size to handle.  Of course, we can also use overflow:auto as well to add a scrollbar, when there is  too much content, which would sometimes be the desired behavior.  Resizing ghosts Ghost elements are very similar to the proxy element that we used when we  looked at the draggables component in the previous chapter. A ghost element   can be enabled with the configuration of just one option. Let's see how this is done.  Change the configuration object we used in resizable5.html to the following:  var resizeOpts = {   ghost: true };  Save this file as resizable6.html. All that is needed to enable a resize ghost is  to set the ghost option to true. The effect of the resizable ghost is very subtle.  It is basically a clone of the existing resizable element, but is only a quarter of the  opacity. This is why we've left the layout text from the previous example within   the resizable element.  [ 288 ]   We're also linking to a new style sheet in this example, which is exactly the same as  resize.css with a background color specified:  Chapter 11  resize {   width:200px; height:200px; margin:30px 0 0 30px;   border:1px solid 7a7a7a; overflow:hidden;   background-color:999; }  Save this as resizeGhosts.css in the css folder. The next screenshot shows how  the resizable ghost will appear while it is visible:  In some versions of Internet Explorer, ghost elements may  cause issues when transparent PNGs are within the resizable.  The ghost element is just a helper element that has been made semi-transparent. If  this is not suitable and further control over the appearance of the helper element is  required, we can use the helper option to specify a classname to be added to the  helper element, which we can then use to style it. Change the configuration object in  resizable6.html, so that it appears as follows:  var resizeOpts = {   ghost: true,   helper: "my-ui-helper" };  [ 289 ]   The Resizable Component  Save this revision as resizable7.html. We've simply specified the classname that  we'd like to be added as the value of the helper option. We can target the new  classname from a CSS file. Open resize.css and add the following code to it:  .my-ui-helper { background-color:FFFF99; }  Save the new style sheet as resizeHelper.css and don't forget to link it at the top  of resizable7.html:     The only thing we do in this example is give the helper a simple background color.  This is how it looks when the new page is run and a resize is in action:  The ghost and helper options don't have to be used together; we can use either one  separately, but if we use the helper option without the ghost option, we do not get  the semi-transparent content within the resize helper.  Containing the resize The resizable component makes it easy to ensure that a resized element is contained  within its parent element. This is great if we have other content on the page that  we don't want moving around all over the place during a resize interaction. In  resizable7.html, change the elements on the page so that they appear as follows:           [ 290 ]   Finally, change the configuration object to use the containment option:  Chapter 11  var resizeOpts = {   containment: ".container" };  Save this as resizable8.html. On the page, we've added a container element for the  resizable and have switched from using a   to an image as the resizable element.  Once again, we need some slightly different CSS for this example. In a new file in  your text editor, add the following code:  .container {   width:600px; height:600px; border:1px solid 7a7a7a;   padding:1px 0 0 1px; } resize { width:300px; height:300px; }  Save this as resizeContainer.css in the css folder and change the   in the    of the page from resizeHelper.css to the new style sheet:     The containment option allows us to specify a container for the resizable, which will  limit how large the resizable can be made, forcing it to stay within its boundaries.  We specify a jQuery selector as the value of this option. When we view the page, we  should see that the image cannot be resized to larger than its container.  Handling aspect ratio In addition to maintaining the aspect ratio of the resizable element, we can also  define it manually. Let's see what control this interaction gives us over the resize.  Change the configuration object used in resizable8.html to the following:  var resizeOpts = {   containment: ".container",   aspectRatio: true };  Save this file as resizable9.html. Setting the aspectRatio option to true ensures  that our image will maintain its original aspect ratio. So in this example, the image  will always be a perfect square.  [ 291 ]   The Resizable Component  For a greater degree of control, we can instead specify the actual aspect ratio that the  resizable should maintain:  var resizeOpts = {   containment: ".container",   aspectRatio: 0.5 };  By specifying the floating-point value of 0.5, we're saying that when the image is  resized, the x axis of the image should be exactly half of the y axis.  Care should be taken when deviating from the aspect ratio  of any images.  Resizable animations The resizable API exposes three configuration options related to animations—animate,  animateDuration, and animateEasing. By default, animations are switched off  in resizable implementations. However, we can easily enable them to see how they  enhance this component.  In this example, change the markup from the previous couple of examples, so that  the resizable element goes back to a plain  :      We should also switch back to the resizeGhost.css style sheet:     Now, change the configuration object to use the following options:  var resizeOpts = {   ghost: true,   animate: true,   animateDuration: "fast" };  Save this as resizable10.html. The configuration object we use in this example  starts with the ghost option.  When using animations, the resizable element is not resized until  after the interaction has ended, so it's useful to show the ghost as  a visual cue that the element will be resized.  [ 292 ]   Chapter 11  All we need to do to enable animation is set the animate option to true. That's it; no  further configuration is required. Another option we can change is the speed of the  animation, which we have done in this example, by setting the animateDuration  option. This accepts any of the standard values that can be used with jQuery's  animate   method.  When we run this page in a browser we should find that when we resize the element,  it isn't set to its new size as soon as we let go of the mouse button, but smoothly  animates to its new size.  Simultaneous resizing We can easily make several elements on the same page individually resizable, by  passing references to them to the resizable widget method. But, in addition to doing  this, we can make use of the alsoResize property to specify additional elements  that are to be resized together as a group, whenever the actual resizable element is  resized. Let's see how.  First, we'll need to reference to a new style sheet once again:     Next, we'll need to change the elements in the   of the page  as follows:       I am the main resizable!         I will also be resized when the main resizable is resized!     Then change the configuration object to the following:  var resizeOpts = {   alsoResize: "simultaneousResize" };  The id of our resizable element has also changed in this example, so be sure to  update the selector accordingly:  $ "mainResize" .resizable resizeOpts ;  Save this file as resizable11.html. We provide a selector as the value of the  alsoResize option, in order to target the second   element. The secondary  element will automatically pick up the resizable attributes of the actual resizable.   So, if we limit the resizable to having just an e handle, the secondary element will  also only resize in this direction.  [ 293 ]   The Resizable Component  The new style sheet referenced in this example should contain the following code:  mainResize {   width:100px; height:100px; margin:0 0 30px;   border:2px solid 7a7a7a; text-align:center; } simultaneousResize {   width:150px; height:150px; border:2px solid 7a7a7a;   text-align:center; } p { font-family:arial; font-size:15px; }  Save this file as resizeSimultaneous.css in the css folder. When we run the file,  we should see that the second   element is resized at the same time as the first:  Preventing unwanted resizes There may be times when we'd like to make an element resizable, but it also has  other functionality, perhaps it listens for click events too. In this situation, it may be  desirable to prevent the resize unless it is definitely required, enabling us to easily  differentiate between clicks and true drags. We can use two options to achieve this.  First, in resizable11.html, revert to the original style sheet resize.css:     We can also return to the simple empty resizable  :      [ 294 ]   Chapter 11  Then change the configuration object to the following:  var resizeOpts = {   delay: 1000 };  Save this version as resizable12.html. The delay option accepts an integer that  represents the number of milliseconds that need to pass with the mouse button held  down, after clicking on a resize handle before the resize will begin.  We've used 1000 as the value in this example that is equal to one second. Try it out  and you'll see that if you click on a resize handle and release the mouse button too  soon, the resize won't take place.  Along with delaying the resize, we could also use the distance option instead to  specify that the mouse pointer must move a certain number of pixels, with the button  held down after clicking on a resize handle, before the resize occurs.  Change the configuration object in resizable12.html, so that it appears as follows:  var resizeOpts = {   distance: 30 };  Save this as resizable13.html. Now when the page is run, instead of having  to wait with the mouse button held down, the mouse pointer will need to travel   30 pixels with the mouse button held down, before the resize occurs.  Both of the these options present certain usability issues, especially when set to high  as in these examples. They both make it harder to resize an element along more than  one axis at a time. They should be used sparingly, with as low values as possible.  Resizable callbacks Like other components of the library, resizable defines a selection of custom events,  and allows us to easily execute functions when these events occur. This makes the  most of interactions between your visitors and the elements on your pages. Resizable  defines the following callback options:  Option create resize start stop  Triggered when… The resizable is initialized The resizable is in the process of being resized A resize interaction begins A resize interaction ends  [ 295 ]   The Resizable Component  Hooking into these custom methods is just as easy for resizables as it has been for the  other components of the library we have looked at. Let's explore a basic example to  highlight this fact.  In resizable13.html, change the second   to point to a new style sheet  as follows:     Then change the final   element so that it appears as follows:        function $  {     function reportNewSize e, ui  {       var width = Math.round ui.size.width ,       height = Math.round ui.size.height ;       $ " ", {         "class": "message",         text: "New size: " + height + "px high, " + width + "px             wide",         width: width       } .appendTo "body" .fadeIn  .delay 2000 .fadeOut  ;     }     var resizeOpts = {       stop: reportNewSize     };     $ "resize" .resizable resizeOpts ;    }  jQUery ;    Save this as resizable14.html. In resize.css, add the following selector  and rules:  .message {   display:none; border:1px solid 7a7a7a; margin-top:5px;   position:absolute; left:38px;fontSize:80%; font-weight:bold;   text-align:center;  }  Save this as resizeStop.css in the css folder.  We define a function called reportNewSize; this function  along with all of the other  event handlers  is automatically passed two objects. The first is the event object and  the second is an object containing useful information about the resizable.  [ 296 ]   Chapter 11  We can use the size property of the second object to find out what the width and  height the resizable has been changed to. These values are stored as variables within  the function. We use the JavaScript Math.round   function to make sure that we end  up with an integer.  We then create a new   element and give it a classname for styling. We also set  the text of the new element to display the width and height variables along with a  brief message. We also set the width of the new element to match the resizable.  Once created, we append the message to the page and then fade it in with jQuery's  fadeIn   method. We then use the delay   method to pause for 2 seconds before  fading the message out again.  The following screenshot shows how our page looks before the   fades away:  Resizable methods This component comes with the four basic methods found with all of the interaction  components of the library, namely the destroy, disable, enable, and option  methods. Unlike most of the other components, the resizable component has no  custom methods unique to it. For clarification on these basic API methods, see the  API introduction section in Chapter 1, Introducing jQuery UI.  [ 297 ]   The Resizable Component  Resizable tabs In our final resizable example, let's look at combining this component with one of  the widgets that we looked at earlier. This will help us see how compatible it is with  the rest of the library. We'll be working with the tabs component in the following  example. The following screenshot shows the page we will end up with:  In your text editor, add the following code:                     Tabs      <link rel="stylesheet"         href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">             myTabs { width:400px; height:170px; }                                        Tab 1             Tab 2                           This is the content panel linked to the first tab; it             is shown by default.  [ 298 ]   Chapter 11                          This content is linked to the second tab and will be             shown when its tab is clicked.                                                                                                     function $ {         var tabs = $ "myTabs" .tabs  ,         resizeOpts = {           autoHide: true,           minHeight: 170,           minWidth: 400         };         tabs.resizable resizeOpts ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as resizableTabs.html. Making the tabs widget resizable is extremely  easy and only requires calling the resizable method on the tab's underlying  .  We're using a single configuration object in this example. The tabs component can be  initialized with zero configuration. Apart from setting the autoHide option for the  resizable in our configuration object, we also define minWidth and minHeight values  for usability purposes.  [ 299 ]   The Resizable Component  Summary In this chapter, we covered resizables. This is a component that allows us to easily  resize any onscreen element. It dynamically adds resize handles to the specified sides  of the target element and handles all of the tricky DHTML resizing for us, neatly  encapsulating the behavior into a compact, easy-to-use class.  We then looked at some of the configurable options that we can use with the widget,  such as how to specify which handles to add to the resizable, and how the minimum  and maximum sizes of the element can be limited.  We briefly looked at how to maintain an image's aspect ratio, or how to work with  custom ratios, while it is being resized. We also explored how to use ghosts, helpers,  and animations to improve the usability and appearance of the resizable component.  We also looked at the event model exposed by the component's API and how we  can react to elements being resized in an easy and effective way. Our final example  explored resizable's compatibility with other components of the library.  [ 300 ]   The Selectables Component  The selectables component allows you to define a series of elements that can be  chosen by dragging a selection square around them or by clicking them as if they  were files on the desktop. In this way, elements on the page can be treated as objects,  allowing either single elements or groups of them to be selected.  Topics that will be covered in this section include:     Creating the default implementation    How selectable class names reflect the state of selectables    Filtering selectable elements    Working with selectable's built-in callback functions    A look at selectables' methods  A selection square has been a standard part of modern operating systems for a long  time. For example, if you wanted to select some of the icons on your desktop, you  could hold the mouse button down on a blank part of the desktop and drag a square  around the icons you wanted to select.  The selectables interaction helper adds this same functionality to our web pages,  which allows us to build more user-friendly interfaces without needing to use  external environments like Flash or Silverlight.  Basic implementation A demonstration that you can play with will tell you more about the functionality  provided by this library component than merely reading about it. The first thing  we should do is invoke the default implementation to get a glimpse of the basic  functionality provided by this component.    The Selectables Component  In a new file in your text editor, add the following code:                     Selectable      <link rel="stylesheet"       href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                      This list item can be selected         This list item can be selected         This list item can be selected         This list item can be selected         This list item can be selected                                                       <script       src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.selectable.js">                    function $ {         $ "selectables" .selectable  ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as selectable1.html in the jqueryui folder. We simply call the  selectable widget method on the parent   element and then all of its child    elements are made selectable. This allows selection by clicking on them or using the  selection square  like you would on your desktop .  [ 302 ]   Note that there is no styling associated with the selectables component. Default  behavior includes clicking on individual elements, causing them only to be selected,  and clicking outside of the selected elements to deselect them. Holding down the  Ctrl key will enable multi-select. The following screenshot shows the selection square  enclosing the list items:  Chapter 12  The minimum set of library files we need for a selectable implementation is  as follows:     jquery-x.x.x.js    jquery.ui.core.js    jquery.ui.widget.js    jquery.ui.mouse.js    jquery.ui.selectable.js  Along with building selectables from list items, we can also build them from other  elements, such as a collection of   elements. Add the following link to the    of the selectable1.html:     Also replace the list elements in selectable1.html with the following code:       This div can be selected     This div can be selected     This div can be selected     This div can be selected     This div can be selected     [ 303 ]   The Selectables Component  Save this as selectable2.html. Everything is essentially the same as before.  We're just basing the example on different elements. However, due to the nature   of these elements, we should add a little basic styling so that we can see what we're  working with.  In a new file in your text editor, add the following code:  selectables div {   width:170px; height:25px;   padding:5px 0 0 10px; margin:10px 0 0 10px;   border:1px solid 000; }  Save this as selectable.css in the css folder. It's not much, but it helps to clarify  the individual selectables in the example, as shown in the following screenshot:  Selectee classnames The elements that are made selectable are all initially given the class ui-selectee,  and the parent element that contains them is given the class ui-selectable. While  elements are selected they are given the class ui-selected.  While the selecting square is around selectable elements, they are given the class  ui-selecting, and for a brief moment, when an element is deselected it is given the  class ui-unselecting. These classnames are added purely for our benefit, so that we  can highlight different states that the selectable may be in.  [ 304 ]   This extensive class system makes it very easy to add custom styling to show when  elements are either in the process of being selected or have been selected. Let's  add some additional styling now to reflect the selecting and selected states. Add the  following new selectors and rules to selectable.css:  Chapter 12  selectables div.ui-selecting {   border:1px solid 66CC00; } selectables div.ui-selected {   background:66CC00; color:fff; }  Save this selectableStates.css in the css folder. Change the link to the  style sheet reference in the   of selectable2.html, then save this file  as selectable3.html:     With the addition of this very simple CSS, we can add visual cues to elements which  are part of the current selection, both during and following a select interaction. The  following screenshot shows some elements in the process of being selected on the  left, and the same elements having been selected on the right:  [ 305 ]   The Selectables Component  Configurable options of the selectable  component The selectable class is quite compact, with relatively few configurable options  compared to some of the other components that we've looked at. The following  options are available for configuration:  Option autoRefresh  Default value true  cancel  ":input,option" Prevent the specified elements from being   Used to Automatically refresh the size and position of  each selectable at the start of a select interaction.  selected with a click. The default string contains  the :input jQuery filter, which matches  all  ,  ,  , and    elements along with the standard  option element selector. Set the delay in milliseconds before the element  is selected. The mouse button must be held  down on the element for this length of time  before the selection will begin. Disable selection when the page initially loads. Set the distance the mouse pointer must travel,  with the mouse button held down, before  selection will begin. Specify child elements to make selectable. Set the tolerance of the selection square. Possible  values are touch or fit. If fit is specified the  element must be completely within the selection  square before the element will be selected.  delay  0  disabled distance  false 0  filter tolerance  "*" "touch"  Filtering selectables There may be situations when we don't want to allow all of the elements within the  targeted container to be made selectable. In this situation we can make use of the  filter option to nominate specific elements, based on a CSS selector, that we want  selecting to be enabled on. In selectable3.html change the collection of    elements so that it appears as follows:       This div can't be selected     This div can't be selected   [ 306 ]   Chapter 12     This div can be selected     This div can be selected     This div can be selected      Then change the final   element to the following:       function $  {     var selectableOpts = {       filter: ".selectable"         }     $ "selectables" .selectable selectableOpts ;    }  jQuery ;    Save this version as selectable4.html. In the underlying markup, we have given a  class to each element except for the first. In the JavaScript, we define a configuration  object containing the filter option. The value of this option is the class selector  of the elements that we want to be selectable; elements without this class name are  filtered out of the selection:  As shown in the previous screenshot, the selection square is over the unselectable  element, but it's not picking up the ui-selecting class like the others. The  component completely ignores the filtered selectable and it does not become   part of the selection.  [ 307 ]   The Selectables Component  Canceling the selection Along with indirectly making elements unselectable using the filter option, we can  also directly make elements unselectable using the cancel option. This option was  also exposed by the interaction helper we looked at in the last chapter, Resizable,  although we didn't look at it in any detail. Now is the perfect opportunity to have a  play with it.  Add the class name unselectable to the first element in the container in  selectable4.html:   This div cannot be selected   Change the configuration object from the last example so that it uses the   cancel option:  var selectableOpts = {   cancel: ".unselectable" }  Save this as selectable5.html. Instead of passing the class name of the selectable  elements to the configuration object, we pass the class name of the unselectable  element to it, but as we see when we run the example, it is only unselectable in  certain situations.  The first element, with the class name unselectable, is still given the class  ui-selectee. However, it is only selectable with the selection square; it cannot  be selected by clicking, even with the Ctrl key held down.  Selectable callbacks In addition to the standard configurable options of the selectable API, there are  also a series of event callback options that can be used to specify functions that are  executed at specific points during a select interaction. These options are as listed in  the following table:  Option selected  selecting  start  Triggered when The select interaction ends and each element added to the selection  triggers the callback. Each selected element triggers the callback during the   select interaction. A select interaction begins.  [ 308 ]   Chapter 12  Option stop  unselected  Triggered when This is fired once, regardless of the number of items selected, as the  select interaction ends. Any elements that are part of the selectable, but are not selected during  the interaction will fire this callback.  unselecting Unselected elements will fire this during the select interaction.  Selecting really only becomes useful when something happens to the elements once  they have been selected, which is where this event model comes into play. Let's put  some of these callbacks to work so that we can appreciate their use.  Change the configuration object in selectable5.html so that it contains the  following code:  var selectableOpts = {     selected: function e, ui  {         $ ui.selected .text "I have been selected!" ;     },     unselected: function e, ui  {         $ ui.unselected .text "This div was selected" ;     },     start: function e  {         if  !$ "tip" .length  {             $ " ", {                 "class": "ui-corner-all ui-widget ui-widget-header",                 id: "tip",                 text: "Drag the lasso around elements, or click to                    select",                 css: {                     position: "absolute",                     padding: 10,                     left: e.pageX,                     top: e.pageY - 30,                     display: "none"                 }             } .appendTo "body" .fadeIn  ;         }     },     stop: function   {         $ "tip" .fadeOut "slow", function   {             $ this .remove  ;         } ;     } };  [ 309 ]   The Selectables Component  Save this as selectable6.html. To the HTML elements, we've added id attributes  so that we can easily target specific elements. In the  , we've added  functions to the selected,  unselected, start, and stop options. These will be  executed at the appropriate times during an interaction.  As with other components, these functions are automatically passed two objects. The  first is the original browser event object and the other is an object containing useful  properties of the selected element. However, not all callbacks can successfully work  with the second object—start and stop, for example. When the ui object is used  with either of these events, the object is empty.  When a   is selected, we change its inner text to reflect the selection using the  selected event callback. We can use the selected property to get the element that  was selected in order to change its text content to a new message. When an element  is deselected, we set the text back to its original value using the same technique.  We can also alter the text of any selectable that was previously selected using the  unselected event.  At the start of any interaction, we create a little tooltip that is appended to the    of the page, slightly offset from the mouse pointer, using the start event.  We use a basic conditional to check that the tool tip does not already exist to   prevent duplicate tips. We can make use of the framework classes ui-corner-all,  ui-widget, and ui-widget-header to do most of the styling for us. The few styles  we require that are not provided by the theme are added using the css   method.  We can get the pointer coordinates using the e  event  object, which is passed as the  first argument to our callbacks, in order to position the tool tip. At the end of the  selection, we remove the tool tip using the stop property. The following screenshot  shows the results of different interactions:  [ 310 ]   The selecting and unselecting callbacks work in exactly the same way as those  we just looked at, but are fired as elements are added or removed to the selection. To  see them in action change the configuration object in selectable6.html so that it  appears as follows:  Chapter 12  var selectableOpts = {     selecting: function e, ui  {       $ ui.selecting .text "I am part of the selection" ;     },     unselecting: function e, ui  {       $ ui.unselecting .text "I was part of the selection" ;       } };  This time we use the selecting and unselecting properties to specify callback  functions, which again change the text content of the elements at certain times  during an interaction. We repeat the procedure from the last example, this time   we're just using different callbacks and properties of the objects passed to them.  The second object passed to any of the selectable callbacks contains a property  relating to the type of custom event. For example, the selected callback receives  an object with a selected property, which can be used to gain information about  the element that was added to the selection. All callbacks have a matching property  that can be used in this way.  Working with vast amounts of selectables The jQuery UI library, like jQuery itself, is already extremely efficient. It uses the  ultra effective Sizzle selector engine  via jQuery  and each component has been  optimized as much as possible.  However, there is only so much that the creators of the library can do. In our  examples so far, we've used a maximum of five selectable elements, which isn't   really many at all. What if we were to use 500 instead?  When working with great numbers of selectables there is still something we can do  to make sure that the select interactions are as efficient as possible. The autoRefresh  option is set to true by default, which causes the sizes and positions of all selectable  elements on the page to be recalculated at the beginning of every interaction.  [ 311 ]   The Selectables Component  This can cause delays on pages with many selectable elements on it, so the  autoRefresh option can be set to false when dealing with large collections of  elements. We can also use the refresh method to manually refresh the selectables  at appropriate times in order to improve the speed and responsiveness of the  interactions. On most pages we would not need to worry about configuring this  option and can leave it at its default setting.  Let's take a look at how this option can help our pages in certain situations. In   the   of selectable7.html change the   for the custom style sheet  to the following:     Then change the selectables container element so that it appears as follows  with  the comment shown below being changed so that the file actually contains 200  selectable elements :       Selectable         Then change the configuration object as follows:  var selectableOpts = {   autoRefresh: false }  Save this page as selectable8.html. Our page should now contain 200 individual  selectables within the selectables container. We've also added a class name to  the outer container so that the container is cleared properly when we float our  selectables  which we will do in a moment .  If the container is not cleared correctly the selection  square will not work.  We also need a new style sheet in this example that consists of the following code:  selectables div {  width:70px; height:25px; padding:5px 0 0 10px;                        border:1px solid 000;                          margin:10px 0 0 10px; float:left;   } .ui-selected { background-color:00FF66; }  Save this in the css folder as selectableMany.css. It's purely for layout purposes,  so we don't need to discuss it further.  [ 312 ]   We can use Firebug to profile a selection of all 200 selectables with and without the  autoRefresh option enabled  remember, it's enabled by default, so our example will  disable it . The results will probably vary between tests, but you should find that  the profile  in both milliseconds and the number of calls  is consistently lower with  autoRefresh set to disabled.  Chapter 12  Selectable methods The methods that we can use to control the selectables component from our code  are similar to the methods found in other interaction helpers and follow the same  pattern of usage. The only unique method exposed by the selectables component is  listed as follows:  Method Refresh Manually refreshes the positions and sizes of all selectables.   Usage  Should be used when autoRefresh is set to false.  In addition to this unique method, the selectables component  like every other  component  makes use of the common API methods destroy, disable, enable,  option, and widget.  Refreshing selectables Setting the autoRefresh property to false can yield performance gains when there  are many selectables on the page, especially in IE. However, there will still be times  when you will need to refresh the size and positions of the selectables, such as when  this component is combined with the draggables component.  Let's take a look at the refresh method as it leads on perfectly from the last example.  Add the following new   element directly after the selectables container:   Refresh   We'll also need to link to the draggable source file for this example:       Then change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     var selectableOpts = {       autoRefresh: false  [ 313 ]   The Selectables Component      };     $ "selectables" .selectable selectableOpts ;     $ "selectables div" .draggable  ;      $ "refresh" .click function   {       $ "selectables" .selectable "refresh" ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as selectable9.html. We've added a new   to the page and we  now link to the draggable source file as well as selectable's. Each of the 200 elements  is made both draggable and selectable.  Our click handler that is attached to the   will simply call the refresh  method manually on the selectables container. When we run the page in a   browser we should first make a selection of a group, but not all, of the selectable.   We should then deselect the elements and move some of them around. We can   move other elements that weren't selected into the selection group as well. Really  shuffle them up!  When we try to select the same group again, we find that the wrong elements are  being selected:  The component hasn't refreshed the positions of the selectables, so it still thinks  that all of the selectables are in the same place as they were when the first selection  was made. If we click on the refresh button and make a third selection, the correct  elements will now be selected.  [ 314 ]   A selectable image viewer In our final selectable example, we're going to make a basic image viewer. Images  can be chosen for viewing by selecting the appropriate thumbnail. Although this  sounds like a relatively easy achievement, in addition to the actual mechanics of  displaying the selected image, we'll also need to consider how to handle multiple  selections. The following screenshot shows an example of what we'll end up with:  Chapter 12  Let's get started with the code. In a fresh page in your text editor, add the   following page:                     Selectable   [ 315 ]   The Selectables Component      <link rel="stylesheet"       href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                   <div id="imageSelector"        class="ui-widget ui-corner-all ui-helper-clearfix">       <div id="status"         class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-all">Crab                                                                                                                  <img class="right" id="boomerang"              src="img boomerang.jpg">                                                              <script       src="development-bundle ui jquery.ui.selectable.js">                          Save this as imageSelector.html. On the page we have a parent   with an  id of imageSelector into which all of our other elements go.  Within the parent, we have a   that will act as a status bar to display the names  of individually selected images, and a   that will act as the viewing panel and  will display the full-sized version of the image. Finally, we have our thumbnail  images, which will be made selectable.  [ 316 ]   Styling the image selector Our example is also heavily reliant on CSS to provide its overall appearance. In a  new file in your text editor, create the following new style sheet:  Chapter 12  imageSelector {   width:676px; height:497px; border:1px solid adadad;   margin:0 auto; position:relative; background-color:dfdede; } status {    width:380px; height:21px; padding:10px; position:absolute;   left:17px; top:17px; font-size:19px; text-align:center;   background-color:adadad; border:1px solid adadad;   text-transform:capitalize; } viewer {   width:400px; height:400px; border:1px solid fff;   position:absolute; left:17px; top:78px; } thumbs {   width:222px; height:460px; position:absolute; right:17px;   top:17px; } thumbs img {    width:100px; height:100px; float:left; margin:0 18px 18px 0;   cursor:pointer; border:1px solid fff; } thumbs img.right { margin-right:0; } thumbs img.ui-selected { border:1px solid 99ff99; } tabs {   padding:0; border:none; position:absolute; left:17px;   background:none; } tabs .ui-tabs-panel { padding:0; } tabs .ui-tabs-nav {   padding:0; border:none; position:relative; top:54px;   background:none; } tabs .ui-tabs-nav li { margin:0; } tabs .ui-tabs-nav li a {   padding:5px 4px; font-size:11px; text-transform:capitalize; } tabs .ui-tabs-nav li.ui-tabs-selected a,  tabs .ui-tabs-nav li.ui-state-disabled a, tabs .ui-tabs-nav li.ui-state-processing a {   font-weight:bold; }  [ 317 ]   The Selectables Component  Save this in the css folder as selectableViewer.css. Most of the styles are  arbitrary and are required purely for layout or visual appearance. We're using   some of the framework classes in our mark-up in order to add the rounded corners,  so the amount of CSS we need to write is minimal. The last few selectors are required  in order to override some of the tab widget's default styling.  Adding the behaving Next we need to add the script that makes the image selector work, so directly after  the final   element add the following code:       function $  {      var selectOpts = {       stop: function e, ui  {         $ "imageSelector"          .children  .not "thumbs" .remove  ;          $ " ", {           id: "viewer"         } .insertBefore "thumbs" ;          if  $ ".ui-selected", "thumbs" .length == 1  {           singleSelect  ;         } else {           multiSelect  ;         }       }     };      function singleSelect   {       var id = $ ".ui-selected", "thumbs" .attr "id" ;        $ " ", {         id: "status",         text: id,         "class": "ui-widget-header ui-corner-all"       } .insertBefore "viewer" ;        $ " ", {         src: "img " + id + ".jpg",         id: id       } .appendTo "viewer" ;     }  [ 318 ]   Chapter 12      function multiSelect   {       $ " ", {         id: "tabs"         } .insertBefore "viewer" ;        var tabList = $ " ", {         id: "tabList"       } .appendTo "tabs" ;        $ ".ui-selected", "thumbs" .each function   {         var id = $ this .attr "id" ,             tabItem = $ " " .appendTo tabList ,             tabLink = $ " ", {             text: id,             href: "tabpanel_" + id           } .appendTo tabItem ,           panel = $ " ", {             id: "tabpanel_" + id           } .appendTo "viewer" ;          $ " ", {           src: "img " + id + ".jpg",           id: id         } .appendTo panel ;       } ;        $ "viewer" .css "left", 0 .appendTo "tabs" ;       $ "tabs" .tabs  ;     }      $ "thumbs" .selectable selectOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    The first thing we do is define the configuration object for the selectables. We use  the stop callback function to do some prep work such as removing the contents  of the image selector container  except for the thumbnails  and creating an empty  viewer container. We then use an if conditional to call either the singleSelect    or multiSelect   functions.  We define these two functions next. One of these functions will be invoked  every time a selection is made. If a single thumbnail image is selected, the first  function is called, and if more than one of the elements are selected the second   function will be called.  In the singleSelect   function we first cache the id of the selected element; we'll  be referring to this several times so it's more efficient to store it in a variable.  [ 319 ]   The Selectables Component  Next we create a new status bar and set its innerText to the id value that was  cached a moment ago, remember this will be the id attribute of whichever thumbnail  is selected. We give the new element some of the framework classes to style the  element and then insert it into the image selector container.  The last thing we do in this function is create the full-sized version of the thumbnail.  To do this we create a new image, set its src attribute to match the large version  of the thumbnail that was selected  both the large and thumbnail versions of   each image have the same filename . The full-size image is then inserted into   the viewer container.  Next we define the multiSelect   function. This time we start by creating a  new   element, give it an id of tabs and insert it before the viewer container.  Following this we create a new   element as this is a required component of  the tabs widget  that we looked at in Chapter 3 . This element is appended to the  tabs container we created a moment ago.  We then use jQuery's each   method to iterate over each of the thumbnails that were  selected. For each item we create a series of variables, which will hold the different  elements that make up the tab headings. We cache the id attribute of each image  and create a new   and a new   element. The link will form the clickable tab  heading and is given the id of the thumbnail as its text content.  We then create the new tab panel that will match the tab heading that we just  created. Notice that we create a unique id for the content panel based on the  thumbnail's id attribute and some hardcoded text. Note that the id will precisely  match the href attribute that we set on the   element. Each new image is created  in the same way as in the singleSelect   function.  After the each   method, we set a CSS property on the viewer container to tidy up  its appearance and then append it to the tabs container. Finally the tabs   method  is called on the tabs container, transforming it into the tabs widget. At the end of the  script the thumbnails are made selectable.  When we run the example in a browser, we should see something similar to what is  shown in the previous screenshot. When a single thumbnail is selected the full-size  version of the image will be displayed. When multiple images have been selected,  tabs are created at the top of the viewer, which allow all of the selected images to   be shown.  [ 320 ]   Chapter 12  Summary The selectables component provides a powerful set of behaviors for selecting  elements on the page, much like how we would select them in a file explorer,   such as explorer on Windows or finder on the Mac.  We first looked at the default implementation and then moved on to look at the  configurable options, along the numerous callback properties, which can be used   to perform different actions at different points in an interaction.  Next we looked at how the performance of a page can be improved when there are a  large number of selectables on the page, and how the single unique method exposed  by the component, refresh, is used.  Lastly we looked at a fun example that brought together what we had learned  throughout the chapter and combined the selectables component with the   tabs component to create an image viewer capable of handling single or   multiple selections.  [ 321 ]    The Sortables Component  The final interaction helper that we're going to look at is the sortables component.  This component allows us to define one or more list of elements  not necessarily  actual   or   elements , where the individual items in the list s  can be re- ordered by dragging.  We'll be looking at the following aspects of the component in this chapter:     The default sortable implementation    Basic configurable properties    Working with placeholders    Sortable helpers    Sortable items    Connected sortables    Sortables' wide range of built-in event handlers    A look at sortables' methods    Submitting the sorted result to a server    Adding drag elements to a sortable  The sortables component is like a specialized implementation of drag-and-drop,   with a very specific role. It has an extensive API, which caters for a wide range   of behaviors.   The Sortables Component  The default implementation A basic sortable list can be enabled with no additional configuration. Let's do this  first, so that you can get an idea of the behavior enabled by this component. In   a new file in your text editor, add the following code:                     Sortable      <link rel="stylesheet"        href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                      Sortable 1         Sortable 2         Sortable 3         Sortable 4         Sortable 5                                                                            function $ {         $ "sortables" .sortable  ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as sortable1.html. On the page, we have a simple unordered list with five  list items. Code-wise, the default implementation is the same as it has been for each  of the other components. We simply call the sortable widget method on the parent    element of the list items that we want to make sortable.  [ 324 ]   Thanks to the sortables component, we should find that the individual list items can  be dragged to different positions in the list, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 13  A lot of behaviors are added to the page to accommodate this functionality. As  we drag one of the list items up or down in the list, the other items automatically  move out of the way, creating a slot for the item that is currently being sorted to be  dropped on.  Additionally, when a sortable item is dropped, it will slide quickly, but smoothly  into its new position in the list. The library files that were needed for the basic  implementation are as follows:     jquery-x.x.x.js    jquery.ui.core.js    jquery.ui.widget.js    jquery.ui.mouse    jquery.ui.sortable.js  As I mentioned earlier, the sortables component is a flexible addition to the library  that can be applied to many different types of elements. For example, instead of  using a list, we could use a series of   elements as the sortable list items, in place  of the   element in the previous example:       Sortable 1     Sortable 2     Sortable 3     Sortable 4     Sortable 1     [ 325 ]   The Sortables Component  This can be saved as sortable2.html. As you can see, the behavior exhibited by  this version is exactly the same as it was before. All that's changed is the underlying  markup. We've added some of the CSS framework classes in order to add some   basic styling to our elements, and we can also use a custom style sheet to add a few  extra styles.  Create a new file and add the following styles:  sortables { width:300px; } sortables div { padding:2px 0 2px 4px; margin-bottom:8px; }  Save this in the css folder as sortable.css. Link to the CSS file in the   of  sortable2.html:     With our new style sheet, the page should now appear as follows:  Configuring sortable options The sortables component has a huge range of configurable options, much more than  any of the other interaction components  but not as many as some of the widgets .  The following table shows the range of options at our disposal:  Option appendTo  axis  cancel  Default value "parent"  false  ":input,  button"  Used to… Set the element that helpers are  appended to, during a sort. Constrain sortables to one axis of  movement. Possible values are the  strings x or y. Specify elements that cannot be sorted, if  they are the elements being sorted.  [ 326 ]   Option connectWith  Default value false  containment  false  cursor  cursorAt  "auto"  false  delay  0  disabled distance  false 1  dropOnEmpty  true  forceHelperSize  false  forcePlaceholderSize  false  grid  handle  helper  false  false  "original"  [ 327 ]  Chapter 13  Used to… Enable one-way sorting from the current  list to the specified list. Constrain sortables to their container  while they are being sorted. Values  can be the strings parent, window, or  document, or can be a jQuery selector or  element node. Define the CSS cursor to apply while  dragging a sortable element.  Specify the coordinates that the mouse  pointer should be at, while a sort is  taking place. Accepts an object with the  keys top, right, bottom, or left with  integers as the values. Set the time delay in milliseconds before  the sort begins, once a sortable item has  been clicked  with the mouse button  held down . Disable the widget on page load. Set how far in pixels the mouse pointer  should move, while the left button is  held down before the sort begins. Allow linked items from linked sortables  to be dropped onto empty slots.  Force the helper to have a size when set  to true. Force the placeholder to have a size  when set to true. The placeholder is  the empty space that a sortable can be  dropped on to. Set sortables to snap to a grid while  being dragged. Accepts an array with  two items—the x and y distances  between gridlines. Specify an element to be used as the  drag handle on sortable items. Can be a  selector or an element node. Specify a helper element that will be  used as a proxy, while the element is  being sorted. Can accept a function that  returns an element.   The Sortables Component  Option items  Default value ">*"  opacity  false  placeholder  revert  scroll  scrollSensitivity  scrolSpeed  false  false  true  20  20  tolerance  "intersect"  zIndex  1000  Used to… Specify the items that should be made  sortable. The default makes all children  sortable. Specify the CSS opacity of the element  being sorted. Value should be an integer  from 0.01 to 1, with 1 being fully  opaque. Specify a CSS class to be added to empty  slots.  Enable animation when moving  sortables into their new slots, once they  have been dropped. Enable page scrolling when a sortable is  moved to the edge of the viewport. Set how close a sortable must get, in  pixels, to the edge of the viewport,  before scrolling should begin. Set the distance in pixels that the  viewport should scroll, when a sortable  is dragged within the sensitivity range. Control how much of the element   being sorted must overlap other  elements, before the placeholder is  moved. Another possible value is the  string pointer. Set the CSS zIndex of the sortable or  helper, while it is being dragged.  Let's work some of these properties into our previous example to get a feel for the  effect they have on the behavior of the component. First wrap the sortables  container in a new  :             Sortable 1            Sortable 2            Sortable 3            Sortable 4        [ 328 ]        Sortable 5              Then change the final   element in sortable2.html, so that it appears  as follows:  Chapter 13       function $  {     var sortOpts = {       axis: "y",       containment: "container",       cursor: "ns-resize",       distance: 30     };     $ "sortables" .sortable sortOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as sortable3.html. We also need to add a little padding to our new  container element. Update sortable.css, so that it contains the following new code:  container { padding:10px 0 20px; }  Resave this file as sortableContainer.css and update the   in the    of sortable3.html, so that it points to the new style sheet.  We use four options in our configuration object; the axis option is set to y, to  constrain the motion of the sortable currently being dragged to just up-and-down.  The containment option specifies the element that the sortables should be contained  within. The sortables will now not be able to move outside of the bounds of the  container element.  Sortable spacing Care should be taken when using the containment option.  This is specifically why we added some padding to the container  element in our style sheet. Without this padding, the first sortable  element is flushed against the top of the container and the last  element is flushed against the bottom. In order to be able to push  a sortable element out of the way, there must be some space  above or below it.  [ 329 ]   The Sortables Component  We also specify the cursor option that automatically adds the CSS ns-resize  cursor. Like with the draggable component that we looked at in Chapter 10,  Drag and Drop,the cursor is not actually displayed until the sort begins.  Finally, we configure the distance option with a value of 30, which specifies that  the mouse pointer should move 30 pixels before the sort begins. The distance  option works in the same way with sortables as it did with draggables, and is great  for preventing unwanted sorts, but in practice, we'd probably use a much lower  threshold than 30 pixels.  Let's look at some more options. Change the underlying   elements in  sortable3.html, so that they appear as follows:       Sortable 1               Sortable 2               Sortable 3               Sortable 4               Sortable 5               We can get rid of the container element for this example. We also need a modified  style sheet for this example. Change sortable.css, so that it includes the following  new styles:  sortables span { margin:2px 2px 0 0; float:right; }  Save the new style sheet as sortableHandles.css in the css folder and update the    element to point to the new style sheet.  Finally, change the configuration object as follows:  var sortOpts = {   revert: "slow",   handle: "span",   delay: 1000,   opacity: 0.5 };  [ 330 ]   Chapter 13  Save this as sortable4.html. We've made a slight change to the page. Within each  sortable element is a new   element that will be used as the sort handle. We  give this element some CSS framework classes in order to reduce the CSS we need   to add manually.  The revert option has a default value of true, but can also take one of the speed  integer or string values  slow, normal, or fast  that we've seen in other animation  options in other components.  The delay option accepts a value in milliseconds that the component should wait,  before allowing the sort to begin. If the mouse pointer is moved away from the  handle while the left-button is held down, the sort will still occur after the specified  time. If the mouse-button is released, however, the sort will be canceled.  The value of the opacity option is used to specify the CSS opacity of the element  that is being sorted, while the sort takes place. The value should be a floating-point  number between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to full opacity and 0 specifying  no opacity.  Another option we've used is the handle option, which allows us to define a region  within the sortable, which must be used to initiate the sort. Dragging on other parts  of the sortable will not cause the sort to begin.  You can see how the handle will appear in the following screenshot:  Make my handles bigger For usability reasons, we should probably use a bigger handle  than the one used in the previous example.  [ 331 ]   The Sortables Component  Placeholders A placeholder defines the empty space or slot that is left, while one of the sortables  is in the process of being moved to its new position. The placeholder isn't rigidly  positioned. It will dynamically move to whichever sortable has been displaced, by  the movement of the sortable that is being sorted.  There are two options that are specifically concerned with placeholders—the very  aptly named placeholder option and the forcePlaceholderSize option. Let's take  a look at these two options in action. Remove the   elements from the sortable    elements in sortable4.html and then change the configuration object, so that  it appears as follows: var sortOpts = {   placeholder: "empty ui-corner-all",   forcePlaceholderSize: true };  Save this as sortable5.html. Next, we should add the new selector and rules to a  CSS file. Change sortable.css, so that it contains the following styles:  .empty { border:1px solid 029000; background-color:cdfdcd; }  Save this as sortablePlaceholder.css in the css folder.  The placeholder option allows us to define a CSS class that should be added to  the placeholder element. This is a useful property that we can use often in our  implementations. Remember this is a classname, not a class selector, so no period   is used at the start of the string. It can accept multiple classnames. The forcePlaceholderSize option ensures that the placeholder is the same size  as the actual sortables. If we left this option at its default value of false, in this  example, the placeholder would just be a thin line made up of the padding that   we applied to the sortable   elements. When we run the new HTML file in a browser, we should be able to see the specified  styles applied to the placeholder, while the sort is taking place:  [ 332 ]   Chapter 13  Sortable helpers We looked at helper proxy elements back when we looked at the draggables  component earlier in the book. Helpers can also be defined for sortables that function  in a similar way to those of the draggable component, although there are some subtle  differences in this implementation.  With sortables, the original sortable is hidden when the sort interaction begins, and  a clone of the original element is dragged instead. So with sortables, helpers are an  inherent feature.  Like with draggables, the helper option of sortables may take a function as its value.  The function, when used, will automatically receive the event object and an object  containing useful properties from the sortable element as arguments.  The function must return the element to use as a helper. Although it's very similar to  the draggable helper example, let's take a quick look at it when used in conjunction  with sortables. In sortable5.html, change the last   block, so that it  appears as follows:       function $  {     var helperMaker = function e, ui  {       return $ " ", {         text: $ ui .text  ,         "class": "ui-corner-all",         css: {           opacity: 0.5,           border: "4px dashed cccccc",           textAlign: "center"         }       } ;     },     sortOpts = {       helper: helperMaker     };     $ "sortables" .sortable sortOpts ;   }  jQwery ;    Save this file as sortable6.html. We define a helperMaker function that creates  and returns the element to be used as the helper, while the sort is in progress. We  set some basic CSS properties on the new element, so that we don't need to provide  additional rules in the style sheet.  [ 333 ]   The Sortables Component  The following screenshot shows how the helper will appear while a sort is   taking place:  Sortable items By default, all children of the element that the sortable method is called on, are  turned into sortables. While this is a useful feature of the component, there may be  times when we don't necessarily want all child elements to become sortable.  The items option controls which child elements of the specified element should be  made sortable. It makes all child elements sortable using the string >* as its default  value, but we can alter this to specify only the elements we want. Change the  sortable   elements in sortable6.html, so that the last element has a  new classname:       Sortable 5    Then, change the configuration object to make use of the items option:  var sortOpts = {   items: ">:not .unsortable " };  Save this as sortable7.html. In the  , we've specified the selector ">:not . unsortable " as the value of the items option, so the element with the classname  unsortable will not be made sortable, while the rest of the   elements will.  When we run the page in a browser, we should find that the last item in the  collection cannot be sorted, and other sortable items cannot be moved into the   space that the last item occupies.  [ 334 ]   Chapter 13  Connected lists So far, the examples that we have looked at have all centered on a single list of  sortable items. What happens when we want to have two lists of sortable items,   and more importantly, can we move items from one list to another?  Having two sortable lists is of course extremely easy and involves simply defining  two containers and their child elements, and then passing a reference to each  container to the sortable   method.  Allowing separate lists of sortables to exchange and share sortables is also extremely  easy. This is thanks to the connectWith option that allows us to define an array of  sortable containers, who can share their sortable contents.  Let's look at this in action. Change the underlying markup on the page, so that it  appears as follows:       Sortable 1A     Sortable 2A     Sortable 3A     Sortable 4A     Sortable 5A         Sortable 1B     Sortable 2B     Sortable 3B     Sortable 4B     Sortable 5B     Save this as sortable8.html. Everything on the page is pretty similar to what we  have worked with before. We also need a new style sheet for this example. In a new  page, add the following styles:  sortablesA, sortablesB {   width:300px; margin-right:50px; float:left; } .ui-widget div { padding:2px 0 2px 4px; margin-bottom:8px; }  [ 335 ]   The Sortables Component  Save this as sortableConnected.css in the css folder. Don't forget to point to the  new style sheet in the   of the new page. Finally, change the last    element, so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     var sortOpts = {       connectWith: ["sortablesA", "sortablesB"]      };     $ "sortablesA, sortablesB" .sortable sortOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    We still define a single configuration object, which can be shared between both sets  of sortable elements. The connectWith option is able to accept multiple selectors if  they are passed in as an array, and it's this option that allows us to share individual  sortables between the two sortable containers.  This configuration option only provides a one-way transmission of sortables, so if  we were to only use the configuration object with sortablesA and specify just the  selector sortablesB, we would only be able to move items from sortablesA to  sortablesB, not the other way.  Specifying both sortables' id attributes in the option and selecting both of the  containers when calling the sortable   method, allows us to move items  between both elements, and allows us to cut down on coding.  When we run the page in a browser, we find that not only can the individual items  be sorted in their respective elements, but that items can also be moved between  elements, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 336 ]   Reacting to sortable events In addition to the already large list of configurable options defined in the sortables  class, there are also a whole lot more in the form of event callbacks, which can be  passed functions to execute at different points during a sortable interaction. These  are listed in the following table:  Chapter 13  Event activate beforeStop change  create deactivate out over  receive remove sort start stop update  Fired when… Sorting starts on a connected list. The sort has stopped, but the original slot is still available. The DOM position of a sortable has changed and the sort is still  in progress. The widget is initialized. Sorting stops on a connected list. A sortable is moved out of a connected list. A sortable is over a connected list. This is great for providing  visual feedback while a sort is taking place. A sortable is received from a connected list. A sortable is moved from a connected list. A sort is taking place. A sort starts. A sort ends. The sort has ended and the DOM position has changed.  Each of the components that we've looked at in the preceding chapters has defined  it's own suite of custom events, and the sortables component is no exception.  Many of these events will fire during any single sort interaction. The following list  shows the order in which they will fire:  1.  start 2.  sort 3.  change 4.  beforeStop 5.  stop 6.  update  As soon as one of the sortables is picked up, the start event is triggered. Following  this, on every single mouse move, the sort event will fire, making this event  very intensive.  [ 337 ]   The Sortables Component  As soon as another item is displaced by the current sortable, the change event is  fired. Once the sortable is dropped, the beforeStop and stop events fire, and if  the sortable is now at a different position, the update event is fired last of all.  For the next few examples, we'll work some of these event handling options   into the previous example, starting with the start and stop events. Change  the configuration object in sortable8.html, so that it appears as follows:  var sortOpts = {   connectWith: ["sortablesA", "sortablesB"],   start: function e, ui  {     $ " ", {       id: "message",       text: ui.helper.text   + " is active",       css: {         clear:"both"       }     } .appendTo "body" ;   },   stop: function   {     $ "message" .remove  ;   } };  Save this as sortable9.html. Our event usage in this example is minimal. When  the sort starts, we simply create a new paragraph element and add some text to it,  including the text content of the element that is being sorted. The text message is then  duly appended to the   of the page. When the sort stops, we remove the text.  Using the second object passed to the callback function is very easy, as you can see.  The object itself refers to the parent sortables container, and the helper property  refers to the actual item being sorted  or its helper . As this is a jQuery object, we   can call jQuery methods, such as text, on it.  When we run the page, the message should appear briefly until the sort ends, at  which point it's removed.  [ 338 ]   Let's look at one more of these simple callbacks, before we move on to look at the  additional callbacks used with connected sortables. Change the final    element in sortable9.html to the following:  Chapter 13       function $ {     var getPlaces = function e, ui  {       var extraMessage =  e.type === "sortreceive"  ? " in a new           list" : "";       $ "message" .remove  ;       $ " ", {         id: "message",         text: [           "Item now at position ",            ui.item.index   + 1 .toString  ,           extraMessage         ].join " " ,         css: {           clear: "both"         }       } .appendTo "body" ;     },     sortOpts = {       connectWith: ["sortablesA", "sortablesB"],       beforeStop: getPlaces,       receive: getPlaces     };     $ "sortablesA, sortablesB" .sortable sortOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as sortable10.html. In this example, we work with the receive and  beforeStop callbacks to provide a message, indicating the position within the list  that any sortable is moved to, as well as which list it is in. We also make use of the  ui.item property from the object, which is automatically passed to any callback  functions used by the events.  We first define a variable called extraMessage, which is initially set to an empty  string. We then define a function called getPlaces. This function will be used as a  callback function for sortable events and will, therefore, automatically receive e and  ui objects.  Within the function, we first check whether the event object's type property has a  value of sortreceive; if it does, we know that a sortable has moved lists and can,  therefore, set the extra part of the message.  [ 339 ]   The Sortables Component  We then remove any pre-existing messages, before creating a new   element and  setting a message, indicating its new position in the list. We can obtain the new  position of the element that was sorted using the item property of the second object  passed to our callback in conjunction with jQuery's index   method, which we  convert to a string and concatenate into a message.  In our configuration object, we connect the two lists using the connectWith option  as before, and make use of both the receive and beforeStop options, which both  point to our getPlaces function.  The receive event is fired whenever a sortable container receives a new sortable  element from a connected list. The beforeStop event is fired just before the sort  interaction ends. In terms of event order, in this example the beforeStop event is  fired first, followed by the receive event.  The receive event will only be fired if a sortable element moves to a new sortable  container. The following screenshot shows how the page should look following a  sort interaction:  Connected callbacks Six of the available callbacks can be used in conjunction with connected sortables.  These events fire at different times during an interaction, alongside the events that  we have already looked at.  Like the standard unconnected events, not all of the connected events will fire in   any single interaction. Some events, such as over, off, remove, and receive will  fire only if a sort item moves to a new list.  [ 340 ]   Other events, such as the activate and deactivate, will fire in all executions,  whether any sort items change lists or not. Additionally, some connected events,  such as activate and deactivate, will fire for each connected list on the page.  Provided at least one item is moved between lists, events will fire in the   following order:  Chapter 13  1.  start 2.  activate 3.  sort 4.  change 5.  beforeStop 6.  stop 7.  remove 8.  update 9.  receive 10.  deactivate  Let's now see some of these connected events in action. Change the final    element in sortable10.html, so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     var sortOpts = {       connectWith: ["sortablesA", "sortablesB"],       activate: function   {         $ " ", {           text: $ this .attr "id"  + " has been activated",           css: {             clear:"both"           }         } .appendTo "body" ;       },       deactivate: function   {         $ " ", {           text: $ this .attr "id"  + " has been deactivated",           css: {             clear:"both"           }         } .appendTo "body" ;       },       receive: function e, ui  {         $ " ", {  [ 341 ]   The Sortables Component            text: ui.item.text   + " was moved from " +               ui.sender.attr "id"  + " into " + $ this .attr "id" ,           css: {             clear:"both"           }        } .appendTo "body" ;      }     };     $ "sortablesA, sortablesB" .sortable sortOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as sortable11.html. The activate and deactivate events are fired for  each connected list at the start of any sort interaction. Within our callback functions,  $ this  refers to each sortable container. We can easily determine which sortable  list the item originated in using the sender property of the second object, passed  to our function.  When we run the page in a browser, we see that as soon as a sort begins, both of   the sortables are activated, and when the sort ends, both of them are deactivated.   If an item is moved between lists, the message generated by the receive callback  is shown:  Sortable methods The sortables component exposes the usual set of methods for making the  component do things, and like the selectables component that we looked at before,  it also defines a couple of unique methods not seen in any of the other components.  The following table lists sortables' unique methods:  [ 342 ]   Chapter 13  Method cancel  refresh refreshPositions serialize  toArray  Used to… Cancel the sort and cause elements to return to their  original positions. Reload the set of sortables. Trigger a cache refresh of the set of sortables. Construct a query string that can be used to send a  new sort order to the server, for further processing or  storage. Serialize the sortables into an array of strings.  Serializing The serialize and toArray methods are great for storing the new order of the  sortables. Let's see this in action. Change the underlying markup on the    of the page in sortable11.html to as follows:      <div id="sortablesA_1"      class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-all">Sortable 1A    <div id="sortablesA_2"      class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-all">Sortable 2A    <div id="sortablesA_3"      class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-all">Sortable 3A    <div id="sortablesA_4"      class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-all">Sortable 4A    <div id="sortablesA_5"      class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-all">Sortable 5A     Then change the final   element, so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     var sortOpts = {       stop: function e, ui  {         var order = $ "sortablesA" .sortable "serialize" ;         $ "message" .remove  ;         $ " ", {           id: "message",           text: order,           css: {             clear:"both"           }  [ 343 ]   The Sortables Component          } .appendTo "body" ;       }     };     $ "sortablesA" .sortable sortOpts ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as sortable12.html. We've dropped the second set of sortables for this  example and have added id attributes to each of the sortable items in the format of  the name of the parent sortable and a number, separated by an underscore.  We use the stop event to execute an anonymous function, after each sort interaction.  Within this function, we store the result of the serialize method in a variable, and  then display this variable in a new   element on the page:  As you can see, the format of the serialized string is quite straight-forward. The  sortable items appear in the order that the items appear on the page, and are  separated by an ampersand. Each serialized item is made up of two parts—a hash of  the id attribute of each sortable item followed by an integer representing the item's  new order.  In the previous example, all we do is display the serialized string on the page, but  the string is in the perfect format for use with jQuery's ajax method to pass to a  server for further processing.  [ 344 ]   Chapter 13  The serialize method is also able to accept a configuration object to tailor how the  serialization occurs. The options we can configure are listed in the following table:  Option attribute  Default value id  connected expression  false " .+ [-=_] .+ "  key  The first part of the  id attribute of each  sortable item  Used to… Specify the attribute to use when parsing each  item in the list of sortables and generating the  hash. Include all connected lists in the serialization. Specify the regexp to use to parse the sortable  list. Specify the string to be used as the first part of  each item in the serialized output.  The toArray method works in a similar way to serialize, except that with toArray,  the output is not a string, but an array of strings.  Widget compatibility In the previous chapter, we saw that both the resizable and the selectable  components worked well with the tabs widget  and we already know how   well the dialog and resizables components go together . The sortable component   is also highly compatible with other widgets. Let's look at a basic example. In a   new page in your text editor, add the following code:                     Sortable Tabs      <link rel="stylesheet"       href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                                  Sort Tab 1               Sort Tab 2               Sort Tab 3                   The first tab panel         The second tab panel         The third tab panel         [ 345 ]   The Sortables Component                                                                                  function $ {         var sortOpts = {           axis: "x",           items: "li"         };         $ "tabs" .tabs  .sortable sortOpts ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this page as sortable13.html. There is nothing in the code that we haven't  seen before, so we won't go into any great detail about it. Note that only the tabs    and sortable   methods are called on the same element—the outer containing    element.  When we run the page in a browser, we should find that the components work in  exactly the way that we want them to. The tabs can be sorted horizontally to any  order, but as the tabs are linked to their panel by href, they will still show the correct  panel, when selected.  Sorting the tabs works on the mousedown event and selecting the tabs works on the  mouseup event, so there are no event collisions and no situations arising where you  want to select a tab, but end up sorting it. The next screenshot shows how the tabs  may appear after sorting:  [ 346 ]   Adding draggables When we looked at draggables and droppables, earlier in the book, we saw that  there was a configuration option for draggables called connectToSortable. Let's  take a look at that option now that we've been introduced to the fundamentals of the  sortables component. In this example, we'll create a sortable task list that can have  new tasks dragged into it. The resulting page will appear as follows:  Chapter 13  In a new file in your text editor, add the following code:                       Sortable        <link rel="stylesheet"          href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">                  [ 347 ]   The Sortables Component               Click here to add a new task...                                       Design new site            Call client            Order pizza                                                                                          Save this as sortable14.html. On the page, we have a couple of   elements;  the first contains a single item which provides an instruction to the visitor and the  second is the task list. The second list is wrapped in a container  , mostly for  styling purposes.  We also use a new style sheet for this example. Add the following code to a new  page in your text editor:  drag { padding:0 0 0 11px; margin:0; float:left; } drag li { font-style:italic; color:999; } drag li input { width:175px; } taskList {   width:250px; height:400px; clear:both;   background:url .. img paper.jpg  no-repeat; } tasks {   width:170px; padding:89px 0 0; margin:0; float:right; } tasks li, drag li {  [ 348 ]   Chapter 13    height:28px; padding-top:5px; list-style-type:none; } add {   display:none; width:24px; height:24px; position:absolute;   left:218px; top:13px;   background:url .. img add.png  no-repeat; } add.down { background:url .. img down.png  no-repeat; }  Save this as sortableTasks.css in the css folder. Mostly this is just decorative,  superficial stuff for the purposes of the example.  Finally we can add the script that wires it all up. Add the following    element, after the library resources:       function $ {     var dragItem = $ "drag li" ,     addButton = $ "add" ,     sortOpts = {       axis: "y",       stop: function   {         addButton.css "display", "none" ;         dragItem.text "Click here to add new task..."             .draggable "option", "disabled", true             .removeClass "ui-state-disabled" ;       }     },     dragOpts = {       connectToSortable: "tasks",       helper: "clone",       disabled: true     };     $ "tasks" .sortable sortOpts ;     dragItem.draggable dragOpts .live "click", function   {        if  $ "tasks" .children  .length > 7  {         alert "too many tasks already!" ;       } else {         var input = $ " ", {           id: "newTask"         } ;         $ this .text "" .append input ;         input.focus  ;         addButton.removeClass "down" .css "display", "block" ;       }     } ;  [ 349 ]   The Sortables Component      addButton.live "click", function e  {       e.preventDefault  ;       if  $ "drag input" .val   !== ""  {         dragItem.text $ "newTask" .val               .draggable "option", "disabled", false ;         $ "drag input" .remove  ;         addButton.addClass "down"             .attr "title", "drag new task into the list" ;       }     } ;   }  jQuery ;    We first cache a couple of selectors that we'll be using frequently throughout the  script, then define the configuration object for the sortables. We restrict sorting to the  vertical axis and specify a callback function for the stop event.  Within this function, we hide the add button and reset any text that has been added  to the draggable, then use the option method of the draggable to disable dragging  on the element, so that the text label cannot be dragged into the task list.  Additionally, when we set the disabled option of the draggable, it adds a CSS  framework class that reduces the opacity of the draggable. This is not necessary for  our example, so we also remove this classname.  Following this, we define the draggable configuration object and set the  connectToSortable option to an id selector that matches the parent sortables  container, and the helper option to clone. The dragging is initially disabled. We then  initialize the sortable and draggable components.  We add a click handler to the draggable element using jQuery's live   method.  When the draggable   is clicked, it checks that there aren't too many tasks in the  list already, and if not, it will create a new   field and append it to the   in  the first  . The hidden add button is also displayed. The visitor can then enter a  new task and make the new task draggable, by clicking the button. The text box and  icon will appear as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 350 ]   We also add a click handler for the add button that we create, again using jQuery's  live   method. This function checks that the   contains some text, and  provided it does, it then gets the text and then removes the text field. The text is then  added to the draggable   element, and the   is made draggable by setting the  disabled option to false. Finally, the   is removed, and the message and  button are set back to their original state.  Chapter 13  Summary We've finished our tour of the interaction components of the library, by looking at  the sortables component. Like the other modules that we looked at before, it has  a wide range of properties and methods that allow us to configure and control its  behavior and appearance in both simple and more complex implementations.  We started off the chapter with a look at a simple, default implementation with no  configuration to see the most basic level of functionality added by the component.  We looked at some of the different elements that can be made sortable and added  some basic styling to the page.  Following this, we looked at the range of configurable options that are exposed by  the sortable API. The list is extensive and provides a wide range of functionality   that can be enabled or disabled with ease.  We moved on to look at the extensive event model used by this component that gives  us the ability to react to different events, as they occur in any sort operation, initiated  by the visitor.  Connected lists offer the ability to be able to exchange sortable items between lists  or collections of sortables. We saw the additional options and events that are used  specifically with connected sortable lists.  In the last part of the chapter, we looked at the methods available for use with the  sortables component, and focused on the highly useful serialize method, and also  had a quick look at its compatibility with other members of the jQuery UI library  in the form of the sortable tabs example. We've now looked at all of the current  interaction components found in the library. In the next and final chapter, we'll   look at all of the different animation effects that jQuery UI brings to the table.  [ 351 ]    UI Effects  We've so far looked at a range of incredibly useful widgets and interaction helpers.  All are easy to use, but at the same time are powerful and highly configurable. Some  have had their subtle nuances, which have required consideration and thought  during their implementation.  The effects provided by the library, on the other hand, are for the most part  extremely compact, with very few options to learn and no methods at all. We   can use these effects quickly and easily, with minimum configuration.  The effects that we'll be looking at in this chapter are as follows:     Blind    Bounce    Clip    Drop    Explode    Fold    Highlight    Pulsate    Scale    Shake    Slide    Transfer   UI Effects  The core effects file Like the individual components themselves, the effects require the services of a  separate core file. It provides essential functionality to the effects, such as creating  wrapper elements and controlling the animations. Most, but not all, of the effects  have their own source files, which build on the core foundation to add functionality  specific to the effect.  All we need to do to use an effect is include the core file  jquery.effects.core. js  in the page, before the effect's source file. Unlike the jquery.ui.core.js file,  however, the jquery.effects.core.js file has been designed to be used, in part,  completely standalone.  When using the core effect file on its own, we can take advantage of color  animations. This includes changing the background color of an element to another  color  and not just a snap change, but a smooth morphing of one color into another ,  class transitions, and advanced easing animations.  Using color animations Let's look at creating color animations. First, create the following new page:                     Color Animations                              Name:             Age:             Email:            Submit                                        function $ {         $ "form" .submit function   {           $ "input" .each function   {              $ this .val  .length == 0  ? $ this .animate {  [ 354 ]   Chapter 14                backgroundColor:"ff9999",               borderTopColor: "ff0000",               borderRightColor: "ff0000",               borderBottomColor: "ff0000",               borderLeftColor: "ff0000"             }  : $ this .animate {               backgroundColor:"ccffcc",               borderTopColor: "00ff00",               borderRightColor: "00ff00",               borderBottomColor: "00ff00",               borderLeftColor: "00ff00"             } ;           } ;         } ;       }  jQuery ;              Save the page as effectColor.html. As you can see, all we need are jQuery and  the jquery.effects.core.js file to create attractive color transitions. On the page,  we have a simple   element enclosing three container elements and three sets  of   and   elements. The animate method is part of jQuery rather  than jQuery UI specifically, but the jquery.effects.core.js file extends jQuery's  animate method, by allowing it to specifically work with colors and classes. When the Submit button is clicked, we simply use the animate method to apply a  series of new CSS properties to the target elements, based on whether the text inputs  have been filled out or not. If they have been completed, we color them green, and  if not, we color them red. We also use a basic style sheet in this example. In another  new page in your text editor, add the following basic selectors and rules:  div { margin-bottom:5px; } label { display:block; width:100px; float:left; } input { border:1px solid 000000; }  Save this as effectColor.css in the css folder. When we view this page in our  browser, we should see that any fields that are left blank, smoothly turn red when  the Submit button is clicked, while fields that are not empty, smoothly turn green.  It's most attractive, however, when a field changes from red to green.  [ 355 ]   UI Effects  The following screenshot shows the page once the Submit button has been clicked:  The style attributes that color animations can be used on are as follows:     backgroundColor    borderTopColor    borderRightColor    borderBottomColor    borderLeftColor    color    outlineColor  Colors may be specified using either RGB, hexadecimal  in the format xxx[xxx] , or  even standard color names. Although there can be cross-browser issues when using  color names, they are best avoided in most cases.  Using class transitions In addition to animating individual color attributes, jquery.effects.core.js also  gives us the powerful ability to animate between entire classes. This allows us   to switch styles smoothly and seamlessly without sudden, jarring changes. Let's   look at this aspect of the file's use in the following example.  Change the   in the   of effectColor.html to point to a new style sheet:     Then change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     $ "form" .submit function e  {       e.preventDefault  ;  [ 356 ]   Chapter 14        $ "input" .each function   {         if  $ this .hasClass "error"   {            $ this .val  .length == 0  ? null :               $ this .switchClass "error", "pass", 2000 ;         } else if  $ this .hasClass "pass"   {            $ this .val  .length != 0  ? null :               $ this .switchClass "pass", "error", 2000 ;             } else {            $ this .val  .length == 0  ? $ this               .addClass "error", 2000  : $ this               .addClass "pass", 2000 ;         }       } ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as effectClass.html. The jquery.effects.core.js file extends the  jQuery class API, by allowing us to specify a duration over which the new classname  should be applied, instead of just switching it instantly. We can also specify an  easing effect.  The switchClass method of the jquery.effects.core.js file is used when  the fields already have one of the classnames and need to change to a different  classname. The switchClass method requires several arguments; we specify the  classname to remove, followed by the class name to add. We also specify a duration  as the third argument.  Essentially, the page functions as it did before, although using this type of class  transition allows us to use non-color-based style rules as well, so we can adjust  widths, heights, or many other style properties if we want to. Note that background  images cannot be transitioned in this way.  As in the previous example, we have a style sheet attached. This is essentially the  same as in the previous example, except with some styles for our two new classes.  Add the following selectors and rules to the bottom of effectColor.css:  .error { border:1px solid ff0000; background-color:ff9999; } .pass { border:1px solid 00ff00; background-color:ccffcc; }  Save the updated file as effectClass.css in the css folder.  [ 357 ]   UI Effects  Advanced easing The animate method found in standard jQuery has some basic easing capabilities  built-in, but for more advanced easing, you have to include an additional easing  plugin  ported to jQuery by GSGD .  See the easing plugin's project page for further information:  http:  gsgd.co.uk sandbox jquery easing .  The jquery.effect.core.js file has all of these advanced easing options built in,  so there is no need to include additional plugins. We won't be looking at them in any  real detail in this section; however, we will be using them in some of the examples  later on in the chapter.  Highlighting specified elements The highlight effect temporarily applies a light yellow coloring to any element that  it's called on  the effect is also known as Yellow Fade Technique  YFT  . Let's put a  simple example together, so we can see the effect in action:     The   element that refers to the effect's source file, so that it uses the  jquery.effects.highlight.js file:       Then remove the   from the   of the page and replace it with the  following markup:   Choose the correct download below:               Hint   Lastly, change the final   element so that ends up as follows:       function $  {     $ "hint" .click function   {       var os = navigator.userAgent;       if  os.search  windows i  !== -1  {  [ 358 ]   Chapter 14          var el = $ "win" ;       } else if  os.search  mac i  !== -1  {         var el = $ "mac" ;       } else if  os.search  linux i  !== -1  {         var el = $ "linux" ;       }       $ el .effect "highlight" ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this page as effectHighlight.html. The code that invokes the highlight effect  takes the same familiar form as other library components. The effect method is  called and the actual effect is specified as a string argument to the method.  We simply sniff the userAgent string and see if a search for either windows, mac, or  linux returns a positive integer. If a positive integer is found, the userAgent string  contains the search word; if -1 is returned, the search term was not found.  We also need to create the new style sheet, not for the effect to work, but just to  tidy things up a little. In a new page in your text editor, add the following selectors  and rules:  a { padding:10px; float:left; } a img { display:block; border:none; } button {   display:block; position:relative; top:10px; clear:both;  }  Save this file as effectHighlight.css in the css folder. View the example and click the Hint button. The icon for whichever operating  system you are using should be highlighted briefly:  [ 359 ]   UI Effects  While our example may seem a little contrived, it is easy to see the potential for this  effect as an assistance tool on the front-end. Whenever there is a sequence of actions  that needs to be completed in a specific order, the highlight effect can instantly  give the visitor a visual cue as to the step that needs to be completed next.  Additional effect arguments Each of the effect methods, as well as the argument that dictates which effect is  actually applied, can take up three additional arguments that control how the effect  works. All of these arguments are optional, and consist of the following  in the   listed order :  1.  An object containing additional configuration options. 2.  An integer representing in milliseconds, the duration of the effect, or a string   specifying one of slow, normal, or fast.  3.  A callback function that is executed when the effect ends.  The highlight effect has only one configurable option that can be used in the object  passed as the second argument, and that is the highlight color.  Let's add some of these additional arguments into our highlight example to clarify  their usage. Change the call to the effect method in the final   element in  effectHighlight.html, so that it appears as follows:  $ el .effect "highlight", {}, function   {   $ " ", {     text: "That was the highlight"   } .appendTo "body" .delay 2000 .fadeOut  ; } ;  Save this as effectHighlightCallback.html. Perhaps the most striking feature of  our new code is the empty object passed as the second argument. In this example, we  don't use any additional configurable options, but we still need to pass in the empty  object, in order to access the third and fourth arguments.  The callback function, passed as the third argument, is perhaps the least useful  callback in the history of JavaScript, but it does serve to illustrate how easy it is   to arrange additional post-animation code execution following an effect.  [ 360 ]   Bouncing Another simple effect we can use with little configuration is the bounce effect. To see  this effect in action change the contents of the   in effectHighlight.html  to the following:  Chapter 14           We also need to use the source file for the bounce effect; change the reference to the  jquery.effects.highlight.js file, so that it points to the bounce source file:       Save this as effectBounce.html. We need to add a tiny bit of styling to really see  the effect in full, but it's probably not worth creating a whole new style sheet so  simply replace the   element in the   of the page with the following:      ball { position:relative; top:150px; }    Finally, change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     $ "ball" .click function   {       $ this .effect "bounce", { distance: 140 } ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Using the bounce effect, in this example, shows how easy it is to add this simple  but attractive effect. We configure the distance option to set how far the element  travels. Other options that can be configured are listed in the following table:  Option direction distance times  Default value "up" 20  5  Used to… Set the direction of the bounce. Set the distance in pixels of the first bounce. Set the number of times the element should  bounce.  [ 361 ]   UI Effects  You'll notice when you run the example that the bounce effect has an ease-out easing  feature built into it, so the distance of the bounce will automatically decrease as the  animation proceeds.  One thing to note is that with most of the different effects, including the bounce  effect  but not the highlight effect we looked at earlier , the effect is not actually  applied to the specified element. Instead a wrapper element is created and the  element targeted by the effect is appended to the inside of the wrapper. The   actual effect is then applied to the wrapper.  This is an important detail to be aware of, because if you need to manipulate the  element that has the effect applied to it in mid-animation, then the wrapper will  need to be targeted instead of the original element. Once the effect's animation has  completed, the wrapper is removed from the page.  Shaking an element The shake effect is very similar to the bounce effect, but with the crucial difference of  not having any built-in easing. So, the targeted element will shake the same distance  for the specified number of times, instead of lessening each time  although it will  come to a smooth stop at the end of the animation .  Let's change the previous example so that it uses the shake effect instead of the  bounce effect. Change effectBounce.html so that it uses the shake source file  instead of the bounce source file:       Then change the click-handler in the final   element at the bottom of the   , so that it appears as follows:  $ "ball" .click function   {   $ this .effect "shake", { direction: "up" }, 100 ; } ;  Save this as effectShake.html. This time we've made use of the direction  configuration option and the duration argument. The configuration option controls  the direction of the shake. We set this to override the default setting for this option,  which is left. The duration we use, speeds up the animation.  [ 362 ]   This effect shares the same options as the bounce effect, although the defaults are set  slightly differently. The options are listed in the following table:  Chapter 14  Option direction distance times  Default value "left" 20 3  Used to… Set the direction of the shake. Set the distance of the shake in pixels. Set the number of times the element should  shake.  Transferring an element's outline The transfer effect is different from others, in that it doesn't directly affect the targeted  element. Instead, it transfers the outline of a specified element to another specified  element. To see this effect in action, change the   of effectShake.html so that  it contains the following elements:                    BFG GTX 280 OC 1GB GDDR3 Dual DVI HDTV Out PCI-E Graphics Card            Cost: $350        Buy                         Basket total:  0            Save this as effectTransfer.html. We've created a basic product listing; when the  Buy button is clicked, the transfer effect will give the impression of the product being  moved into the basket. To make this happen, change the final   element, so  that it contains the following code:       function $ {     $ "buy" .click function   {       $ "productContainer img" .effect "transfer", {          to:"basket"       }, 750, function   {         var currentTotal = $ "total" .text  ,         numeric = parseInt currentTotal, 10 ;         $ "total" .text numeric + 1 ;  [ 363 ]   UI Effects        } ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Of course, a proper shopping cart application would be exponentially more complex  than this, but we do get to see the transfer effect in all its glory. Don't forget to  update the effect's source file:       We also need some CSS for this example, so create the following new style sheet:  container { width:607px; margin:0 auto; } productContainer img {   width:92px; height:60px; border:2px solid 000000;   position:relative; float:left; } productContainer p {   width:340px; height:50px; padding:5px;   border:2px solid 000; border-left:none; margin:0;   font-family:Verdana; font-size:11px; font-weight:bold;   float:left; } pprice {   height:35px; width:70px; padding-top:20px; float:left; } purchase {   height:44px; width:75px; padding-top:16px;   border:2px solid 000; border-left:none; float:left;   text-align:center; } basketContainer {   width:90px; margin-top:100px; float:right; } basket {   width:65px; height:31px; position:relative; left:13px;   background:url .. img basket.gif ; } .ui-effects-transfer { border:2px solid 66ff66; }  Save this as effectTransfer.css in the css folder. The key rule in our new style  sheet is the one that targets the element which has a class of ui-effects-transfer.  This element is created by the effect and together with our styling produces the green  outline that is transferred from the product to the basket.  [ 364 ]   Run the file in your browser. I think you'll agree that it's a nice effect which would  add value to any page that it was used on. Here's how it should look while the  transfer is occurring:   Chapter 14  The transfer effect has just two configurable options, one of which is required and  that we have already seen. For reference, both are listed in the following table:  Option className  Default value "ui-effects-transfer" Apply a custom classname to the effect   Used to…  to  "none"  helper element. Set the element the effect will be transferred  to. This property is mandatory.  The four effects that we've looked at so far all have one thing in common—they can  only be used with the effect method. The remaining effects can be used not only  with the effect method, but also with jQuery's toggle and the show hide methods.  Let's take a look.  Element scaling The scale effect is highly configurable and is used to shrink an element. It is very  effective when used to hide elements. In this example we'll use the hide   method  to trigger the effect, instead of using the effect method.  [ 365 ]   UI Effects  We'll use a few of the CSS framework classes in this example, as well as a few custom  styles; so add two new   elements to the   of effectTransfer.html:  <link rel="stylesheet"   href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">    Then, replace the underlying markup in the   with the following:            A dialog box             Close                   Close the dialog to see the scale effect        Don't forget to change the   element for the effect, to the scale effect's  source file:       Finally, change the last   element, so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     $ "close" .click function e  {       e.preventDefault  ;       $ this .closest ".ui-widget" .hide "scale", {}, 900 ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save the new page as effectScale.html. The custom style sheet we use is  as follows:  .ui-widget { padding:3px; width:300px; } .ui-widget-header, .content { padding:5px 10px; } .ui-widget-header a { margin-top:2px; float:right; }  Save this file as effectScale.css in the css folder. These styles are used to give the  example a vaguely dialog-like appearance.  [ 366 ]   In the script, we simply add a click handler for the close icon and call the effect    method on the outer container of the dialog box. An empty object is passed as the  second argument to the method, and a relatively long duration is passed as the third  argument, as this effect proceeds quite rapidly. The following screenshot shows the  effect in action:  Chapter 14  Using the hide   method instead of the effect method is advantageous to us in  this example, because we want the dialog box to remain hidden after the effect has  completed. When the effect   method is used instead, bits of the widget remain  visible at the end of the animation.  The percent configuration option must be configured  when using the effect method in conjunction with the  scale effect.  There are several configuration options which can be used with scale; these are as  listed in the following table:  Option direction  Default value "both"  from  {}  percent  0  origin  ["middle","center"]  Used to… Set the direction to scale the element in. May  be a string specifying either both, vertical,  or horizontal. Set the starting height and width of the  element to be scaled. Set the vanishing point, used with show  hide animations. Set the end size of the scaled element.  [ 367 ]   UI Effects  Element explosion The explosion effect is truly awesome. The targeted element is literally exploded into  a specified number of pieces, before disappearing completely. It's an easy effect to  use and has few configuration properties, but the visual impact of this effect is huge,  giving you a lot of effect in return, for very little code. Let's see a basic example.  Create the following new page:                     Explode               Click the grenade to pull the pin!                                                    function $ {         $ "theBomb" .click function   {           $ this .hide "explode" ;         } ;       }  jQuery ;              Save this as effectExplode.html. As you can see, the code is extremely simple and  can be used completely out of the box with no additional configuration. This effect  has only one configurable property, which is the pieces property, and it determines  how many pieces the element is exploded into. The default is 9. The effect works  equally as well with the effect   method as it does with the hide   method.  Once the specified element has been exploded, it will be hidden from view by having  its style attribute set to display:none. This is the default behavior. However, it will  still remain in the DOM of the page. The following screenshot shows the explosion   in progress:  [ 368 ]   Chapter 14  Physicists sometimes speculate as to why the arrow of time seems to only point  forwards. They invariably ask themselves philosophical questions like why do we  not see grenades spontaneously forming from a large cloud of debris?  Actually the object  is usually an egg, but I don't think an egg-based example would have had quite the  same impact!   jQuery UI cannot help our understanding of entropy, but it can show us what a  grenade spontaneously reassembling might look like. We'll need to hide the    in order to show it. The easiest way to do this is with an inline style attribute:     Then, change the final   element so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     $ "theBomb" .show "explode" ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this variant as effectExplodeShow.html. This time we use the show   method  instead of the hide   method to trigger the animation, which occurs once the page  has loaded.  The animation is the same, except that it is shown in reverse and this time, the  grenade is not hidden from view once the animation ends. Like the other effects,  explode can also make use of specific durations and callback functions.  [ 369 ]   UI Effects  The puff effect Similar to the explode effect, but slightly more subtle is the puff effect, which  causes an element to grow slightly before fading away. Like explode, there are   few configuration options to concern ourselves with.  Consider a page that has AJAX operations occurring on it. It's useful to provide a  loading image that shows the visitor that something is happening. Instead of just  hiding an image like this when the operation has completed, we can puff it out of  existence instead.  Remove the   and change the   from the previous example, so that it points  to a new image:     Then change the effect's source file to the scale effect:       Finally, change the last   element, so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     $ "loader" .click function   {       $ this .hide "puff" ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as effectPuff.html. We're actually not detecting whether a given process  has finished loading in this example. It would require too much work just to see   the effect we're looking at. Instead, we tie the execution of the effect into a simple  click-handler.  You'll notice that we used the jquery.effect.scale.js source file for this effect.  The puff effect is the only effect that does not have its own source file, and instead   it's a part of the very closely related scale effect's source file.  Like the explode effect that we looked at in the last section, this effect has just one  configuration option that can be passed in an object as the second argument of the  effect method. This is the percent option and controls the size the image is scaled  up to. The default value is 150 percent. Like the explode effect, the target element  is hidden from view once the animation ends. This happens whether effect   or  hide   is used.  [ 370 ]   The effect stretches the targeted element  and its children, if it has any , while at the  same time reducing its opacity. It works well on proper images, background colors,  and borders, but you should note that it does not work so well with background  images specified by CSS. Nevertheless, it's a great effect. The following screenshot  shows it in action:  Chapter 14  The pulsate effect The pulsate effect is another effect that works with the opacity of a specified element.  This effect reduces the opacity, temporarily, a specified number of times, making the  element appear to pulsate.  In the following basic example, we'll create a simple countdown time that counts  down from 15. When the display reaches 10 seconds, it will begin to flash red. In  effectPuff.html, change the link in the   of the page to point to a new  style sheet:     Then remove the loading   from the page and add the following element in  its place:   15   Next, change the source file of the effect so that the jquery.effects.pulsate.js  file is used:       Finally, change the last   element so that it appears as follows:       function $  {     var age = 15,     countdown = $ "countdown" ,     adjustAge = function   {  [ 371 ]   UI Effects        countdown.text age-- ;       if  age === 0  {         clearInterval timer ;       } else if  age < 10  {         countdown.css {           backgroundColor: "ff0000",           color: "fff"         } .effect "pulsate", { times: 1 } ;        }     },     timer = setInterval function   { adjustAge   }, 1000 ;     }  jQuery ;    Save this as effectPulsate.html. The page itself contains just a simple    element with the text 15 inside it. The code first sets a counter variable and then  caches a selector for the  . We then define the adjustAge   function.  This function first decreases the text content of the countdown element and at the  same time, reduces the value of the counter variable by one. It then checks whether  the counter variable has reached 0 yet; if yes, it clears the interval we are about to set.  If the counter variable is greater than 0 but less than 11, the function applies a  background color of red to the element and white to the element's text content,   and then runs the pulsate effect.  We use the times configuration option to specify how many times the element  should pulsate. As we'll be executing the method once every second, we can set   this to just pulsate once each time. This is the only configurable option.  After our adjustAge function, we start the interval using JavaScript's setInterval  function. This function will repetitively execute the specified function after the  specified interval, which in this example is 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second. We avoid  using the window object by using an anonymous function to call our named function.  The new style sheet is very simple and consists of the following code:  countdown {   width:100px; border:1px solid 000; margin:10px auto 0;   font-size:60px; text-align:center; }  Save this in the css folder as effectPulsate.css.  [ 372 ]   Dropping elements onto the page The drop effect is simple. Elements appear to drop off  or onto  the page, which is  simulated by adjusting the element's position and opacity.  This effect exposes the following configurable options:  Chapter 14  Option direction distance  easing  Default value "left" The outer width or height of  the element   depending on the  direction  divided by 2  none  mode  "hide"  Used to… Set the direction of the drop. Set the distance the element  drops.  Set the easing function used  during the animation. Set whether the element is  hidden or shown.  There are many situations in which the drop effect would be useful, but the one that  instantly springs to mind is when creating custom tooltips. We can easily create a  tooltip that appears when a button is clicked, but instead of just showing the tooltip,  we can drop it onto the page. We'll use the button widget and the position utility in  this example, as well as the effect.  Add a link to the CSS framework file and change the style sheet link in the   of  effectPulsate.html:  <link rel="stylesheet"     href="css smoothness jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css">    Remove the countdown   from the page, and add the following  element instead:      Click me!    Now we need to change the effect's source file and add the source files for the  position and button widgets:           [ 373 ]   UI Effects               Lastly, change the final   element, so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     $ "button" .button  .click function   {       var button = this,       positionOpts = {         of: button,         my: "right center",         at: "left center",         offset: "-30 0"       },       tip = $ " ", {         id: "tip",         text: button.title       } ,       tri = $ " ", {         id: "tri"       } .appendTo tip ;       tip.appendTo "body" .position positionOpts           .show "drop", { direction: "up" }, function   {         $ this .delay 1000 .fadeOut  ;       } ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this file as effectDrop.html. When the button is clicked, we first store a  reference to the DOM node of the button. We then add a configuration object for   the position utility, in order to position our tooltip to the right of the button.  We then create a new   element to use as the tooltip, which has its text content  set to the title text of the button. We also create another element used to create a  triangular CSS shape to give the tooltip a pointer. This element is appended to   the tooltip.  [ 374 ]   Once created, the tooltip is appended to the   of the page and is then shown  using the drop effect. The direction configuration option is used to make the  tooltip appear to drop down; we have to specify the opposite direction here,   because our tooltip is absolutely positioned.  There is also some minimal CSS required for this example, in addition to the styles  provided by the CSS framework, to style the tooltip. Create the following style sheet:  Chapter 14  tip {    display:none; padding:10px 20px 10px 10px;   position:absolute; background-color:cecece; } tri {   border-top:20px solid transparent;   border-right:30px solid cecece;   border-bottom:20px solid transparent; position:absolute;   left:-30px; top:0; }  Save this in the css folder as effectDrop.css. The styling here is purely  for aesthetics.  When you run the file in your browser, you should see your tooltip, as in the   following screenshot:  Sliding elements open or closed The remaining effects of the jQuery UI library all work by showing and hiding  elements in different ways, rather than using opacity like most of the effects we   have already looked at.  The slide effect is no exception and shows  or hides  an element by sliding it into   or out of  view. It is similar to the drop effect that we just looked at. The main  difference is that it does not use opacity.  [ 375 ]   UI Effects  The slide effect contains the following configuration options:  Option direction distance  easing  Default value "left" The outer width or height of the  element  depending on the direction   none  mode  "show"  Used to… Set the direction of the slide. Set the distance the element  slides. Set the easing function used  during the animation. Set whether the element is  hidden or shown.  These are the same configuration options used by the drop effect that we looked at in  the previous example, except that some of the default values are different.  For our next example, we can create exactly this kind of functionality. In   effectDrop.html, change the   element in the   of the page from  effectDrop.css to effectSlide.css:     Then remove the   from the   of the page and add the following HTML in  its place:            Basket     <a id="toggle" title="Show basket contents"        class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-triangle-s" href="">       Open                                                Product name           Brief descriptive subtitle           £xx.xx                                     Product name           Brief descriptive subtitle           £xx.xx   [ 376 ]   Chapter 14                                     Product name           Brief descriptive subtitle           £xx.xx                       The outer element in this collection is an  , which is the perfect element for  a mini-basket widget that sits in the right-column of a site. Within this element, we  have a   that serves as the heading for the basket. The heading contains a link,  which will be used to show or hide the contents of the basket. The contents of the  basket will consist of an unordered list of products within a container  .  Don't forget to change the   element for the effect's source file to use  jquery.effects.slide.js, and remove the   files for jquery.ui.core. js, jquery.ui.widget.js, jquery.ui.position.js, and jquery.ui.button.js:       The final   element will need to be changed to the following code:       function $ {     $ "toggle" .live "click", function e  {       var slider = $ "basket" .find "div" ,       header = slider.prev  ;       if  !slider.is ":visible"   {         header.addClass "ui-corner-top"             .removeClass "ui-corner-all" ;       }       slider.toggle "slide", {         direction: "up"       }, "slow", function   {         if  slider.is ":visible"   {           header.css "borderBottomWidth", 0 .find "a"               .addClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-n"               .removeClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-s" ;         } else {           header.css "borderBottomWidth", 1               .addClass "ui-corner-all"   [ 377 ]   UI Effects              .removeClass "ui-corner-top" .find "a"               .addClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-s"               .removeClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-n" ;         }       } ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as effectSlide.html. All of the functionality resides within a click- handler, which we attach to the icon in the basket header. When this element is  clicked, we first initialize the variables slider and header, as these are the  elements that we will be manipulating.  We then check whether the slider  which is the basket contents container  is  hidden; if it is hidden, we know that it is about to be opened and so remove the  rounded corners from the bottom of the header. This is so that the slider element  sits flush up to the bottom of the header, even while it is sliding open.  We then use jQuery's toggle   method to call the effect, which we specify using  the first argument of the method. We then set the configuration option, direction,  in an object passed as the second argument. The duration of the animation is  lengthened using the string slow as the third argument, and an anonymous callback  function is used as the fourth argument. This function will be executed at the end of  the slide animation.  Within this function, we check the state of the slider to see if it is hidden or open. If  it is open at the end of the animation, we remove the border from the bottom of the  header and then change the icon in the header, so that it points up to indicate that  the basket can be closed by clicking the icon again.  If the slider is now closed, we add the bottom border and rounded corners to the  header once again, and change the icon back to an arrow pointing down.  We also use a little CSS in this example. Create the following style sheet:  basket { width:380px; float:right; } basket h1 { padding:5px 10px; margin:0; } basket h1 a { float:right; margin-top:8px; } basket div { display:none; } basket ul { margin:0; padding:0; list-style-type:none; } basket li { padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid aaa; } basket li:last-child { border-bottom:none; } basket li:after {   content:""; display:block; width:100%; height:0;  [ 378 ]   Chapter 14    visibility:hidden; clear:both; } basket img { margin:2px 10px 0; float:left; } basket h2 { margin:0 0 10px; font-size:14px; } basket h3 { margin:0; font-size:12px; } basket span { margin-top:6px; float:right; }  Save this as effectSlide.css in the css folder. We don't need much CSS in this  example, because we are using the CSS framework classes.  The effect in progress should appear as in the following screenshot:  In this example, we could easily just use jQuery's native slideToggle   method; the  main benefit of using jQuery UI's slide effect is that we can also slide left or right.  Using easing I said earlier that the jquery.effects.core.js file had the built-in ability to  seamlessly use easing with the effects. Let's see how easy this is to achieve. Change  the last   element in effectSlide.html, so that it appears as follows:       function $ {     $ "toggle" .live "click", function e  {       var slider = $ "basket" .find "div" ,  [ 379 ]   UI Effects        header = slider.prev  ,       easing =  slider.is ":visible"   ?        "easeOutQuart" :        "easeOutBounce";       if  !slider.is ":visible"   {         header.addClass "ui-corner-top"             .removeClass "ui-corner-all" ;       }       slider.toggle "slide", {         direction: "up",         easing: easing       }, "slow", function   {         if  slider.is ":visible"   {           header.css "borderBottomWidth", 0 .find "a"               .addClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-n"               .removeClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-s" ;         } else {           header.css "borderBottomWidth", 1               .addClass "ui-corner-all"               .removeClass "ui-corner-top" .find "a"               .addClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-s"               .removeClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-n" ;         }       } ;     } ;   }  jQuery ;    Save this as effectsSlideEasing.html. See how easy that was? All we need to do  is add the easing option within the effect's configuration object and define one or  more of the easing methods as the option value.  In this example, we specify a different easing method for each toggle state, by setting  a variable which uses the JavaScript ternary condition to set an easing function,  depending on whether the slider is visible or not.  When the basket slides down, it bounces slightly at the end of the animation with  easeOutBounce. When it slides back up, it will gradually slow down over the  course of the animation using easeOutQuart.  The full range of easing methods we can make use of with the any of the   effects are shown on an excellent page on the jQueryUI site and can be seen   at: http:  jqueryui.com demos effect easing.html.  [ 380 ]   Chapter 14  The window-blind effect The blind effect is practically the same as the slide effect. Visually, the element  appears to do the same thing, and the two effects' code files are also extremely  similar. The main difference between the two effects that we need to worry about is  that with this effect we can only specify the axis of the effect, not the actual direction.  The blind effect has the following configuration options:  Option direction easing mode  Default value "vertical" none "hide"  Used to… Set the axis of motion. Set the easing function used during the animation. Set whether the element is hidden or shown.  The direction option that this effect uses for configuration only accepts the values  horizontal or vertical. We'll build on the last example to see the blind effect in  action. Change the   resource for the blind effect in effectSlide.html,  so that it refers to the jquery.effects.blind.js file:       Now change the toggle   method, so that it uses the blind effect, and change the  value of the direction configuration option:  slider.toggle "blind", {    direction: "vertical"  }, "slow", function   {   if  slider.is ":visible"   {     header.css "borderBottomWidth", 0 .find "a"         .addClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-n"         .removeClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-s" ;   } else {     header.css "borderBottomWidth", 1         .addClass "ui-corner-all"         .removeClass "ui-corner-top" .find "a"         .addClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-s"         .removeClass "ui-icon-circle-triangle-n" ;   } } ;  Save this as effectBlind.html. Literally, all we've changed is the string specifying  the effect, in this case to blind, and the value of the direction property from up to  vertical. Notice the subtle difference when we view the file between sliding the  element and blinding it up.  [ 381 ]   UI Effects  When the login form slides up, the bottom of the element remains visible at all times,  as if the whole basket is moving up into or out of the header. With the blind effect,  however, the element is shown or hidden starting with the bottom first, just like a  window blind opening or closing.  Clipping elements The clip effect is very similar to the slide effect. The main difference is that instead of  moving one edge of the targeted element towards the other, to give the effect of the  element sliding out of view, the clip effect moves both edges of the targeted element  in towards the center.  The clip effect has the same configuration options as the blind effect and these  options have the same default values. At the end of Chapter 5, The Dialog, we created an example that showed a full-size  image in a dialog when a thumbnail image was clicked. When the close button on   the dialog was pressed, the dialog was simply removed from the page instantly.   We could easily use the clip effect to close our dialog instead.   In diaog14.html, add the source files for the clip effect after the existing library files:           Then, change the dialog configuration object so that it appears as follows:  var dialogOpts = {   modal: true,   width: 388,   height: 470,   autoOpen: false,   open: function   {     $ "ajaxDialog" .empty  ;       $ " " .attr "src", filename .appendTo "ajaxDialog" ;     $ "ajaxDialog" .dialog "option", "title", titleText ;   },   close: function   {     $ this .parent  .hide "clip" ;   } };  [ 382 ]   Save this as effectClip.html. In this simple addition to the existing file, we use  the clip effect in conjunction with the close event callback to hide the dialog from  view. The default configuration value of vertical for the direction option and the  default speed of normal are both fine, so we just call the hide method, specifying clip  with no additional arguments.   The following screenshot shows the dialog being clipped:  Chapter 14  Folding elements Folding is a neat effect that gives the appearance that the element it's applied to is  being folded up like a piece of paper. It achieves this by moving the bottom edge  of the specified element up to 15 pixels from the top, then moving the right edge  completely over towards the left edge.  [ 383 ]   UI Effects  The distance from the top that the element is shrunk to in the first part of this effect is  exposed as a configurable property by the effect's API. So, this is something that we  can adjust to suit the needs of our implementation. This property is an integer.  We can see this effect in action by modifying the dialog example once again. In  effectClip.html, change the effect source file for clip to fold:       Then change the close event callback to the following:  close: function   {   $ this .parent  .hide "fold", { size: 200 }, 1000 ; }  Save this as effectFold.html. This time we make use of the size configuration  option to make the effect stop in the first fold, 200 pixels before the top of the  dialog. We also slow the animation down a little, by setting the duration to 1000  milliseconds. It's a really nice effect; the following screenshot shows the second   part of the animation:  [ 384 ]   Chapter 14  Summary In this chapter, we've covered the complete range of UI effects available in the  jQuery UI library. We've seen how easy it is to use the jquery.effects.core.js  base component to construct attractive color animations and smooth class transitions.  We also saw that the following effects can be used in conjunction with the simple  effect API:  An important point is that most of the individual effects can be used not only   with the effect API but can also make use of show hide and toggle logic, making  them incredibly flexible and robust. The following effects can be used with this  advanced API:     Bounce    Highlight    Shake    Transfer     Blind    Clip    Drop    Explode    Fold    Puff    Pulsate    Scale    Slide  We also saw that the jQuery UI effects' core files also include all of the easing  functions used in the jquery.easing.js plugin that must be used with jQuery  when we are not using jQuery UI.  This now brings us to not only the end of this chapter, but also the end of the book.  There is a saying that I'm sure almost all of you will have heard before. It's the give a  man a fish..., saying. I hope that during the course of this book, I've taught you how to  fish, instead of just giving you a fish.
