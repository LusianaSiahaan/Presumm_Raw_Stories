At that time, it was a very exciting discovery for me to be able to  reproduce the basic functions of a nerve cell of a living being using a com- puter program. Such a neural network is shown in simplified form in Fig. 1.  It contains many parallel inputs, all of which act on a first hidden layer. This  layer consists of nodes and each node receives information from all the avail- able inputs.  Fig. 1  Representation of the structure of a neural network  https:  en.wikipedia.org  wiki Artificial_neural_network, accessed in April 2020   v   vi   Preface  Each node processes and weighs this information, passing it on to every   node in the following layer. In the end, you end up at an output layer.  This  output  layer  is  now  ready  to  be  used  as  an  additional  input  layer.  Through  these  feedback  loops,  the  neuronal  network  learns  from  its  own  results.  These networks of nodes were mirrored by the structures of the nerve cells  I had learned about as a student. Each individual node is structured like a  nerve cell  Fig. 2 .  I remember being impressed by the incredible diversity and ability of nature  to deal with information. Every piece of external information is processed  with different weightings in each nerve cell and leads to a message, the so-  called  activation  function,  which  is  then  forwarded  to  all  nodes  of  the  next layer.  50 years ago, it was clear to us that this was a pretty clever construction  with a lot of potential for application. Some renowned scientists predicted a  great future for advances following this theoretical framework. However, this  proved to be wrong in the following decades. The time had not yet come. It  was far too complex technically and therefore seemed unlikely to have any  significant effect on ongoing technical development, at least for the foresee- able future.  The reality turned out to be different. Back  then,  it  gained  respect  for  nature’s  enormous  achievement  and  its  wasteful  effort.  I  learned  that  the  hamstring  reflex  of  the  frog’s  leg  alone   Fig. 2  Structure of the replica of a nerve cell  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Artificial_ neural_network, accessed in April 2020      Preface   vii  contains over a dozen highly complex parallel control loops, each full of neu- ronal pathways consisting of countless layers of neuronal networks.  I came to the following conclusion: With technology, we can make things  easier. You don’t have to make it so complicated to just stabilize the hamstring  reflex in a frog’s leg.  Again, reality turned out to be different. Of course, in my cybernetics lectures 40 years ago, I often told my students  about all manner of possibilities. For example, I recently found this sketch in  my records, detailing a possibility for the automatic settlement of traffic fines   Fig. 3 .  I was of the opinion at the time that this would come very quickly. And  although it has been technically feasible for 40 years, to my knowledge there  is still no system in which direct deposits of fines are coupled with the devices  in one’s own home. This would allow all family members to have complete  transparency and to get notified immediately which family member drove too  fast where.

Artificial intelligence today is a powerful tool  whose basic mathematical construction has existed for two generations. Only  now does it lead to dramatic changes in the reality of our lives and work.  The  continuing  increase  in  computer  capacity  has  made  it  possible  to  exchange and process almost unlimited amounts of data worldwide. At the  same time, the computers are getting smaller and smaller and here too the end  is not yet in sight.  On the other hand, there is always the phenomenon that technical devel- opments are possible but do not prevail and spread. In this respect, any pre- diction as to when which form of artificial intelligence will penetrate which  part of our lives has an enormous degree of uncertainty.  Here is what we can say based on the development so far: When artificial  intelligence systems spread, they do so extremely quickly and worldwide. We  can observe that in several areas. But when artificial intelligence has to do with  the real things of this world, it often takes much longer than expected.  With these preliminary remarks, I now invite you to begin a journey with  me. In addition to theoretical facts, I have also written down my personal expe- riences and assessments in this non-fiction book. The positive attitude towards  digital transformation with artificial intelligence corresponds to my conviction.  A great deal is written and discussed about the negative and risky aspects.  That is why we will not deepen these aspects but focus on the opportunities.  On this journey, we will see how this world has been and will be changed by  the gamechanger artificial intelligence. The challenge of the coming decades  will be to ensure that this change succeeds for the good of mankind.

I sit in the middle of a snowstorm in a cozy chalet in the Swiss mountains  and look banned at my birdhouse, which I have just filled with fresh food.  The thermometer is showing 10 degrees Fahrenheit. However, it doesn't take  10 min for the first bird to fly in and discover the food. It then takes another  10 min until about 20 more birds fly around the feeding all at once.  Suddenly,  it  shoots  through  my  head:  How  would  20  small  drones,  equipped with systems of strong artificial intelligence,1 try to get the food  from the feeder without human intervention? I observe the speed and agility  of the birds, their seemingly chaotic strategy of approaching the feeder, and  come to the following conclusion:  By the time we have reached the point where all 20 drone systems will  empty the feeder, collision-free, in a very small space, without external input,  and with the same speed and agility as these birds, it will take quite a while,  certainly more than a generation.  As long as these kinds of interactions “only” take place in virtual spaces   like the internet , making them work is still relatively simple. But when it   1 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Strong_AI, accessed in April 2020.

Henning  comes to introducing artificial intelligence systems into “physical reality,” it  becomes arduous. The “last mile” to realize complex AI support for mechani- cal systems is especially difficult and tedious.  Until AI systems in such devices as drones have the intelligence, agility,  speed, and dexterity of these birds, a lot of work in research and development  is still required.  But the world is working on it. For example, a major aircraft manufacturer  is in the process of designing a parcel center equipped to handle 10,000 ship- ments per day. All shipments are to be carried by drones. This would require  about five take-offs and landings per minute. The coordination problem is  gigantic from a software design perspective—not even considering that the  “small side problem” of loading drones with fully automatic AI-controlled  transport robots in such a confined space is not yet solved.  And then there is the problem of air traffic control when so many drones  are buzzing through the airspace. Already, a Silicon Valley group of companies  is trying to simulate how such an AI-controlled system might work.  My message to the reader is twofold:  If one goes into detail, the implementation of artificial intelligence systems  AI  systems  is extremely difficult and laborious. If it succeeds, however, there will  be  radical  breakthroughs  across  worldwide  applications  in  an  extremely  short time.  Rapid dissemination will be accelerated, when usefulness is proven, and  people waive all privacy concerns because of the benefits they receive. You  might raise an eyebrow at this but surely, you usually check off those ubiqui- tous Terms of Use disclaimers very quickly without reading them, don’t you?   AI Is a Gamechanger  When technologies “surprisingly” find a mass application in a very short time  and processes, habits, learning processes, and order systems are turned upside  down, we speak of a so-called disruptive innovation—a gamechanger.  It is often assumed that disruptive innovations are a new phenomenon only  when they occur in connection with the internet, digital transformation, and  artificial intelligence.  Yes, the digital transformation of our lives is a dramatic transformation.   But is such a revolution so unique in the history of mankind?   1   It’s All About Us   3  Let’s travel back in time together. Around 1750, the first industrial revolution began with the invention of  the  steam  engine,  i.e.  the  systematic  use  of  water  and  steam  power.  This  became the basis of mechanical production.  The  next  milestone  came  at  the  beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century  through electrical energy. This allowed energy to be transported to any loca- tion. This structure laid the foundation for mass production and division of  labor. At the beginning, in a period of only 10 years from 1903 to 1913, this  enabled  the  change  from  horse-drawn  carriage  mass  transport  to  car  mass  transport.  In  the  beginning,  the  first  drivers  were  fined  because  they  had  exceeded the speed limit intended for horse-drawn carriages.  Another 70 years later, the digital revolution began, initially “only” related   to computer technology and communication technology.  Only today do we feel the full extent of this digital revolution, because it  covers  the  information  revolution,  in  which  everything  is  connected  with  everything  and  the  world  begins  to  grow  together  into  one  huge  “brain.”  Autonomous systems and systems of autonomous systems are growing across  a worldwide network, in both factories and administrations. And here’s the  bottom line: What seemed 50 years ago as a strange dream of computer sci- ence can suddenly be realized2.  Machines and systems have—at least at a low level—their own consciousness  and  can  independently  determine  for  goals  and  solutions  that  nobody  has  taught them before.  The special thing about it is that the objects of this world are linked with   each other as in the “Internet of Things”  IoT , all around the globe.  Today, there are already vehicles with the so-called autopilots, in which the  experiences of the vehicles with road courses and curves are exchanged over- night among all vehicles of this class all over the world. They are already learn- ing valuable lessons from each other through a worldwide network. With the  enhanced  interconnectivity  provided  by  5G  technology  and  the  power  of  future quantum computers, these exchanges will be possible in a few minutes.3  2 For more information on the concept of consciousness see Chap. 4. 3 Sabina Jeschke: 3 Shadoes of AI – 5G and Quantum Computing setting the stage for next generation  AI. Keynote Wirtschaftspolitik aus erster Hand at Leibniz-Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung   ZEW    Feb.  fifth,  2020 ,  Mannheim.  http:  www.sabina-jeschke.de Talks 2020 2020-02- 05_ZEW_ talk.pdf, accessed in April 2020.   4     K. Henning  If such an interconnected vehicle drives on a dirt road, it might have trou- ble navigating through unknown curves. But if you take the same turn a week  later, the handling is already quite good, because the car has exchanged its  experiences with all other cars of this class in the world. Driving experiences  with similar curves were compared with each other. Every vehicle in the world  is then better prepared to handle similar curves.  There is no doubt that this upheaval is gigantic. It is in its dimension, in its  extent, and in its nature not comparable with the first industrial revolution  around 1750 and the energy revolution around 1900. A lot of people haven’t realized that “big bang” yet. Going back further in our history, you will come across the upheaval the  world  has  undergone  since  the  introduction  of  mass  printing.  One  might  naturally think of Luther and the effects of the reformation. But the roots of  this  movement  began  100  years  earlier  with  a  disruptive  innovation  of  Gutenberg’s printing press, the effects of which are perhaps most comparable  with the dimensions of the digital transformation with artificial intelligence  of today  Eisenstein, 2009; Mai, 2016 .  Over a period of 10 years from 1450 to 1460, Gutenberg turned the world upside  down with the invention of the letterpress machines.  Gutenberg was inspired by an idea. It was the idea of a world being designed  by reason and logic. To get this idea off the ground, he was convinced that the  power of images had to be abolished and that the power of the written word  should be accessible to everyone.  And this required the ability to print a text in large quantities and in the  same quality without errors. It only took a decade for the first printing press  to become operational. And it was a development that rose almost out of  nowhere.  Copper  stamping  with  presses  was  invented  in  Nuremberg  for  military  purposes. This made it the basis for the so-called patrize,4 i.e. the first let- ter stamp.  Gutenberg was a radical entrepreneur. He needed a lot of money for this  development and gradually committed most of his retirement savings to the  project.  4 A patrix is the embossing stick during printing, i.e. the counterpart to the printed letter.   1   It’s All About Us   5  The first patrize was a “ holy mirror,” an ornate “single letter,” which he sold  in large numbers on the occasion of the pilgrimage to Aachen Cathedral.5 The  rush to touch the holy relics had become so large that the chapter of the cathe- dral of Aachen decided to sell mirror images of the relics as souvenirs instead.  This provided Gutenberg with much needed interim financing.  But his goal was to have movable letters. He invented the type case. He  invented the “floating” letter. He invented the letterpress machine. He was  the first one to use paper print instead of parchment. He solved the problem  of stable and replicable mass production of texts.  Additionally, he had to entice employees away from transcribing texts by  hand; an industry that almost no longer existed in Europe a generation after  the first mass printing of books.6  Gutenberg was a typical production engineer, in love with scaling, to be  able to produce everything in high quality in large quantities. He invested and  invested— almost regardless any losses.  For  his  first  book,  he  had  chosen  a  work  that  has  remained  one  of  the  world’s bestsellers to this day—the Bible. His aim was to publish the book  with as few pictures as possible.  And all this at a time when Europe was just about to disintegrate; there  were  three  differing  popes  simultaneously  vying  for  supremacy  within  the  Roman Catholic Church.  Ultimately, it took him only 10 years, until 1460, to produce this dramatic  innovation; and barely 10 years later Europe would be littered with letterpress  machines with movable type. Within just 20 years, written text was widely  available  to  anyone,  anywhere  in  Europe.  It  is  estimated  that  before  1450  barely 10% of monks in the monasteries could read; and scant few could do  so outside the monasteries. That’s why everything was transmitted through  pictures—hence  the  importance  of  representations  of  biblical  stories  in  churches.  Within  less  than  a  generation  a  general  literacy  was  established  among   European societies. The monopoly of the few aloud to others was broken.  Ironically, Gutenberg became the victim of his own invention when his  hometown Mainz was defeated in a local war in which for the first time, leaf- lets were used on a massive scale to mount an effective campaign of psycho- logical warfare.  5 The  Aachen  pilgrimage.  https:  heiligtumsfahrt-aachen.de en aachen-pilgrimage ,  accessed  April 2020. 6 In a similar way today translation with AI substitute the major part of the translation business.

Henning  With the printing press, the technological driver for the transition into the  age of reason was born. But first, Europe would undergo a period of serious  unrest. One of the most important of which would occur nearly 50 years after  Gutenberg’s  death,  when  in  1517  Martin  Luther  published  his  95  theses  against the selling of indulgences in Wittenberg.  Certainly,  Luther  was  not  aware  of  his  long-term  impact.  There  were  unwanted feedback processes, remote actions, and side effects. The beginning  of the enlightenment was on the rise: the written word and reason were in the  ascendancy. Pictures disappeared on a large scale from daily life. Luther may  not have intended to promote the split of the church; however, his actions led  to secessions from the Catholic Church. Thus, many Christian denomina- tions arose, which were shaped by the primacy of the written word before  pictures and myths.  Europe was still not done with its share of strife. As a result of the mental  and spiritual unrest, the political order disintegrated, leading to the Thirty  Years’ War  1618–1648 . It would take about 100 years after the breakthrough  of reason, made possible by mass printing, for Europe to find its way back to  new systems of social and political order.  Back to today:   The Age of Digital Transformation Has Begun  I am convinced that the biggest disruptive innovation since Gutenberg is taking  place today. That's the real big bang many people haven’t heard yet.  Like then, the whole social order, the way people live, work, and what they  believe is being turned upside down. Back then, it was limited largely to the  states of Europe—today, it simultaneously affects all societies, all the way to  the farthest corners of the earth  Henning, 2018 .  Today’s  global  changes  do  not  only  affect  digital  networking.  It’s  about   more than that!7  7 Henning,  Klaus:  How  artificial  intelligence  changes  our  world.  http:  www.futur2.org article wie-  kuenstliche- intelligenz-unsere-welt-veraendert , accessed in April 2020.   1   It’s All About Us   7     The machines, cars, and objects of everyday life will be given their own  consciousness, which, together with that takes place within minutes, repre- sents a completely new dimension.     This  digital  transformation  into  digital  agents,  digital  shadows,  digital  twins, etc. is a global and local revolution that will radically transform all  areas of our lives. It is inevitable.     The digital universe with intelligent machines and networks poses a huge   opportunity to reinvent our living, working, and learning environments.  Today it is artificial intelligence that penetrates all machines, systems, and  devices, all offices, and all areas of private life. Machines, devices, digital plat- forms, and smartphones increasingly have their own consciousness and make  their own creative decisions, which nobody has taught them before.  We  now  have  the  chance  to  shape  the  digital  transformation  with  artificial  intelligence in a responsible way—before others do it irresponsibly. We are in  this together; and we still have the time!   2  The Objects of This World Become   Intelligent  Contents  Digital Companions   Omnipresent and Unobtrusive   Useful and Indispensable   And What About Data Privacy?

In addition to water, food, and education comes the need for a mobile phone,  Wi-Fi, and a charger for electricity.4  I recently experienced a total blackout of my smartphone on a trip abroad  to the middle of Eastern Europe. That was a real shock: flight tickets, train  tickets, my next appointments, telephone, communication of any kind, none  of that was possible anymore. I was suddenly completely on my own. That  was when I realized just how connected the whole world has become.  That’s how it is with our digital companions: They are extremely useful and  that’s why we use them. Right now, our digital companions are still rather  stupid.  Once  they  become  intelligent,  they  will  think  for  themselves  and  make independent decisions that no one has suggested to them before. They’ll  do what is allowed, and what is not.  Here is an example: One of our digital companions will be the autonomous  car, an intelligent robot on wheels. Such an autonomous car, which thinks for  itself, will of course drive faster than 30 in the 30 miles speed limit zone, if  everyone else also drives faster. It will follow rules as much or as little as we do.  Therefore, we will have to have a traffic offender index for fully automatic  cars. Consequently, these cars will also download apps for speed camera warn- ings.  The  ethical  and  regulatory  issues  involved  will  lead  to  many  more  discussions.  Such a digital companion can also be 3D glasses which instruct the crafts- man on how best to mount a window. These glasses present a digital overlay  of what I am doing right now, whether I am doing it well, and a simulation of  what I have to do next. The system will also help me learn from my mistakes.  Besides, it will help me with my weaknesses. If it is well done, a real win–win  situation!  In the future, these digital companions will be omnipresent, unobtrusively pen- etrating all aspects of our personal and professional lives.  Now you may object: With all the risks attached, we must forbid these digi- tal companions to think for themselves. Well, do you really think that it would   4 Dietrich Identity GmbH: The Maslow Pyramid of Needs in Times of Generation Z. https:  www.diet- richid.com wissensartikel die-maslowsche-beduerfnispyramide-zeiten-der-generation ,  in  April 2020.  accessed    2  The Objects of This World Become Intelligent   11  be of any interest to the rest of the world if we prevent machines and equip- ment from thinking for themselves within the borders of our own country?   Omnipresent and Unobtrusive  Such intelligent objects will become at least as intelligent as some of the more  highly developed animals, such as ravens, horses, or dogs. Whether we like  it or not.  Some people may now think of science fiction movies. But you don’t even  have to go that far. Digital real or virtual digital companions will spread step  by step, omnipresent and unobtrusive, in many areas. And in certain areas  they will simply be capable of doing more than what we humans are capable  of. This is because they can collect and process vast amounts of data in the  shortest possible time.  Today, many of the newer smartphones already have an internal AI machine  to automatically create photo sequences accompanied by appropriate music.  This  “For  You”  function  has  now  reached  a  point  where,  for  example,  it  reminds you of previous mountain tours with a photo sequence the moment  you find yourself in the same area again. The AI system was not ordered sepa- rately—it was simply included. Most users of the corresponding smartphones  are not even aware that this function exists. The AI system is purely local and  not connected with a database in a “cloud”—a virtual mass storage device.  Most people who use the AI “For You” are enthusiastic about it and use it  constantly because it is more attractive and entertaining than clicking through  many photos manually. And if you don’t like the style, you can choose another  one, for example, “cheerful” or “epic.” However, some of those users don’t  even realize that there is an AI algorithm working in the background.  AI applications unobtrusively sneak into our everyday lives and will soon  be omnipresent. By 2030, much of it will have become “normal” and we will  use such intelligent functions in many places.   Useful and Indispensable  These digital companions will have creative ideas and develop new concepts;  in  short,  they  will  behave  in  a  way  they  have  not  learned  from  anyone.  Combining of a lot of data, using neural networks and the increasingly sophis- ticated algorithms of artificial intelligence, these digital companions will be    12     K. Henning  able to learn independently, reflect on what has been learned, and develop  new behavioral strategies without much trouble.  Many intelligent digital companions will make their own decisions.  That is why, in the longer term, objects of this world that work with such  strong  artificial  intelligence5  must  also  become  legal  entities  in  their  own  right, as the European Parliament has rightly brought into the debate.6 There  must be ethical standards and values for the algorithms of such digital com- panions.7 Then it will be a good thing.  We don’t need digital fools. We need digital companions that are capable of being useful partners.  For example, if you have to commute into the city at 7 am in the morning,  it will be no problem at all for an intelligent navigation device to look at traffic  and weather data of the last 10 years and then perhaps give you the following  recommendation: Wait  5  min  before  you  leave  today.  Then  it  will  be  less  stressful, and you won’t lose any time. Because the system knows that 5 min  later the traffic jam will have decreased to such an extent that you will reach  your destination faster. Such an assessment is impossible for us humans. I am  sure we will use such technology when it becomes available. The reason for  that is:  Usefulness triumphs over data protection.  5 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Strong_AI, accessed in April 2020. 6 Janosch Delcker: Europe divided over robot “personhood”  Nov. fourth, 2018 . https:  www.politico. eu article europe-divided-over-robot-ai-artificial-intelligence-personhood , accessed in April 2020. 7 Committee  on  Legal  Affairs  of  the  European  Parliament,  2015 2103 INL    Jan.  27th,  2017 :  Recommendation to the Civil Law Rules on Robotics, Liability, AC to AF. https:  www.politico.eu arti- cle europe-divided-over-robot-ai-artificial-intelligence-personhood , accessed in April 2020.   2  The Objects of This World Become Intelligent   13  As such, the useful idiots in our cars and in our pockets gradually become  indispensable partners with whom we wouldn’t want to live without. Anyone  who has ever learned to appreciate the quality of Google Maps’ congestion  forecasts don’t care anymore that users are tracked digitally—who cares where  I go? The main thing is to get past the traffic jam ahead of me. The excellent  navigational systems of many vehicle manufacturers use exactly this Google  data as a foundation. This data then forms a complete picture of user behav- ior. This is called a digital shadow.  We happily give away our data for the benefit of using such applications. It  is of no use believing that I can keep my data to myself anyway. Far too often,  I have agreed to give out information about myself free of charge. In most  cases,  we  are  tired  of  reading  the  general  terms  and  conditions.  Have  you  completely read how your data is handled during your most recent visits to  websites on the internet? Or did you just scroll down and checked the box?  However, this development has a considerable downside. Those who have the  data are gaining more and more control as well as social, economic, and politi- cal influence.   And What About Data Privacy?  It will be interesting to see how long we are willing to actually give away our  data for free. It is possible that data markets will develop in which I pay for  the right to receive a service in exchange for my data, i.e. I enter into a swap.  It is undoubtedly problematic if free apps collect data that they do not need  for their functionality, only to then resell it to third parties.  In  any  case,  my  smartphone,  even  without  any  active  function,  already   allows someone to track me anywhere I go.  I noticed recently that I have three navigation devices in operation when  driving my car. First the manufacturer’s onboard navigation system, then a  traffic forecast app on my mobile phone which is also tied into a database  of live traffic obstructions and controls. And third, my car is also connected  to the manufacturer’s service hotline so that I can get help quickly in case  of an emergency. Finally, there is also the engine control unit and other  control devices in the vehicle that can be used to subsequently read out trip  histories.  A worldwide network has already been formed of all the digital shadows of  people,  machines,  vehicles,  and  devices  that  communicate  very  intensively  with each other all the time. We put a high value on the comfort of having the    14     K. Henning  train booking system readily available on an app and the ability to get that  information in real-time.  A kind of digital shadow economy has emerged. Mass data is the essential basis of artificial intelligence.  No data protection law will be able to stop this development. In case you  don’t believe that, just listen to what constitutional rights experts have to  say. They will tell you which data can be obtained without violating data  protection regulations, which are particularly strict in Germany. In an infor- mation paper of the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution  it says8:  People still play a large, if not the most important, role in cases of industrial  espionage… Most information is unintentionally revealed when dealing with  other people.  In this respect, the challenge of data protection is nothing new. There has  always been not only industrial espionage, but also, for example, the curious  neighbor who is always extremely interested in who does what with whom  and when in the village. What is new is the extent to which data can be col- lected. In that context, we often lack the understanding and appropriate strat- egies to protect our own data.   A Paperback Encyclopedia Is  Outdated Technology  Another example: Which one of us still uses a paperback encyclopedia? That’s  yesterday’s technology. Maybe the older ones among us still use them. But my  grandchildren stand amazed in front of an encyclopedia and ask, “Grandpa,  what is this? Did you really use something like that”?  8 Elsasser,  Thomas:  Dangers  of  industrial  espionage.  Annual  Conference  of  Xenium  AG.  Munich  16.10.2015.   2  The Objects of This World Become Intelligent   15  Brockhaus, a German publisher,9 missed this development and was forced  to  discontinue  its  encyclopedia  series  in  2013.  Encyclopedias  grew  out  of  fashion precisely the moment when confidence in Wikipedia’s data became  greater than confidence in the data of a paperback encyclopedia that is out- dated after only a few years.  The Encyclopedia as a physical book has become a chapter of history les- sons. If I am looking for some information, I search via Wikipedia or enter  my question directly into Google or YouTube. I think it works extremely well  because it is successful even when I’m looking for a rare spare part for a house- hold machine.  For today’s kids, everything comes from the internet. Let me tell you a  joke—which you may not even be able to laugh about: A two-year-old boy  visits his mother in the hospital who has just given birth to another child. The  boy asks: “Mom, where did you get this download”?  Back to the topic at hand: Today, almost all our children learn biology,  physics,  and  above  all  math  with  the  “simpleclub”10  platform—at  least  in  Germany.  And  the  music  our  kids  listen  to  simply  gets  downloaded  or  streamed  online—it comes from YouTube or from companies like Spotify. Many peo- ple don’t even know what a CD is anymore, let alone a cassette.   Working in the Digital Age  Let’s stay with the company Spotify for a moment. It was founded in 2006, so  it is just 11 years old and has a market value of 3 billion euros today. Spotify  has 200 million people as users in 78 countries.11  This  rapidly  growing  company  also  has  a  very  different  organizational   structure than traditional companies:  Classical Hierarchies: negative. Usual boss roles: negative. Normal project management: negative.  9 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Brockhaus_Enzyklopädie, accessed in April 2020. 10 https:  de.wikipedia.org wiki Simpleclub;  https:  www.youtube.com channel UCdQvwubOWGRB  8JyoEC7lSbA, accessed in April 2020. 11 The  Verge:  Spotify  gets  serious  about  podcasts  with  two  acquisitions.  https:  www.theverge. com 2019 2 6 18213462 spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition, accessed in April 2020.   16    K. Henning  Everything in this company is built on the principles of the so-called Agile  methodology12; because otherwise you would be far too slow to develop new  services and products.  According to the principles of Agile, there is no longer a classical division  of labor. Working in largely autonomous teams has priority. Typical depart- ments in project structures are nowhere to be found. Annual working time  models often apply instead of fixed weekly working times.  The digital revolution does not stop at the smartphone. It has long since con- quered the factory halls and is already conquering into all areas of our lives and  work today.  Here are a few examples: There is no longer any reason to design public transport with buses and  trams. Instead, we could imagine a small fully automatic eight-seater,13 a kind  of mountain gondola on four wheels that travels the route in 30 second inter- vals. One could then simply call them via an app and the next bus gondola  with free seats stops in front of you. The same principle could be applied  to cabs.  The fully automatic car will also allow people to make use of their car after  the fourth glass of beer without any risk. How many of you think this will be  very useful? I’m certainly looking forward to it.  What about queues at the registration office? This is completely unneces- sary because you can schedule everyone for a specific appointment using an  app. Soon, artificial intelligence systems will be able to manage such things  much better than today’s systems.  Why  do  we  still  have  traditional  retirement  and  nursing  homes?  Technologically speaking, we can reintegrate everything that is necessary to  take care of the elderly into existing family structures. In many cases, mobile  nursing and medical care are already the better choice. Medical monitoring,  even at the level of intensive care, is already technically possible today in any  private home that has a reasonable LTE or DSL connection.  An example of this ongoing transformation is a company based in Aachen,  which  operates  over  40  ambulances  in  various  cities  in  Germany  via   12 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Agile_software_development, accessed in April 2020. 13 Such fully automatic minibuses are currently being developed by an automotive supplier from southern  Germany.  https:  www.automobil-industrie.vogel.de zf-plant-joint-venture-mit-ego-mobile-a-609633 ,  accessed in April 2020.   2  The Objects of This World Become Intelligent   17  tele- emergency doctors. This meets with great acceptance  as of 2020 .14 These  tele-emergency doctors, based in the company’s headquarter, are connected to  the places where the accident happened via broadband communication. They  have access to all relevant medical data of the accident victims and see the  injuries in detail via video. They can control the admission to the best suited  hospital depending on the injuries and in coordination with specialists much  better than it was previously possible without that level of coordination. These  systems are currently being introduced in many other regions of Germany.  The  same  company  is  also  working  intensively  on  the  development  of  robots  for  the  healthcare  industry.  This  even  includes  the  development  of  robots for dementia patients. As one can imagine, it is far less embarrassing to  tell a robot than a human what it is, you may have forgotten. Certainly, the  robot doesn’t get angry because it has to repeat the same thing 50 times and is  not emotionally disappointed when the memory performance of its counter- part diminishes.   Artificial Intelligence Is  a Fundamental Gamechanger  Let’s get this straight:  idly throughout the world.  The digital revolution with artificial intelligence systems is spreading rap-  Artificial  intelligence  does  not  stop  at  any  cultural,  national,  or  political  boundaries.  However, artificial intelligence will still be shaped by the cultural, national,  or political beliefs of specific countries, as well as by the specific organizational  conditions of where it was developed. For example, the detailed specifications  of how autonomous vehicles should behave in traffic will differ  Maurer et al.,  2015 . Some will allow speeding. Others will demand a strict speed limit,  even if it disrupts the flow of traffic.  The same thing happened with the Corona crisis in the year 2020. All gov- ernments applied AI-tools to track the spread of the disease in order to follow   14 https:  www.telenotarzt.de en , accessed in April 2020.   18     K. Henning  the  flow  of  infections.  But  it  is  done  under  very  different  rules  of  implementation.15  At its core, we are dealing with an information revolution in which every- thing is connected to everything else. In Europe, this development is described  by the term “4.0.”  “Industry 4.0,”16 for example, cannot be reduced to industry. All processes  are connected to worldwide supply chains, both in terms of supply and cus- tomer service.  The same applies to “health 4.0.” Here, too, the processes are increasingly  interconnected worldwide. Today, an AI supported smartphone app is suc- cessful  in  the  identification  of  skin  cancer17  and  thus  sustainably  supports  cancer prevention. Similarly, worldwide databases enable an up-to-date com- parison of the relationship between prostate parameters and prostate cancer.  Just as autonomous cars exchange their experiences about the roads they tra- verse on a daily basis.  Similar factors apply to “mobility 4.0.” For example, I can already track the  progress  of  my  online  order  and  it  is  already  possible  to  deliver  parcels  with  drones. I can use Google Maps to see the current traffic jams on every street in  the  world—seriously,  all  around  the  globe.  New  mobility  chains  are  being  planned which would make autonomous electric air taxi “Car2go” hubs possible.  Booking would be handled through an app, and upon landing passengers could  expect  fully  autonomous  cars  to  be  waiting  to  drop  them  off  at  an  intercity  express  railway  station,  after  which  the  car  would  continue  along  to  its  next  scheduled destination. The search for a parking space would be a thing of the past. Furthermore, completely new perspectives are opening up for energy sup- ply. Decentralized energy supply with a local coupling of all types of energy is  technically possible. Why should the price of electricity not be settled via a  new approach, depending on the current availability of renewable energy in  order to enable a faster energy turnaround? Why shouldn’t all radiators in a  house  be  controlled  by  an  intelligent  pump?  This  intelligent  pump  could  replace the rather stupid thermostatic valve.18 AI systems can be used to record   15 How to Fight the Coronavirus with AU and Data Science  Feb. 15th,2020 : https:  towardsdatasci- ence.com how-to-fight-the-coronavirus-with-ai-and-data-science-b3b701f8a08a, accessed in April 2020. 16 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Industry_4.0, accessed in April 2020. 17 James Vincent: Artificial intelligence can spot skin cancer as well as a trained doctor.

This means that a great deal of energy—up to 20%—can be saved.  And why shouldn’t the fridge point out when it discovers mold? At the  same time, I could use a speech system to tell the refrigerator all the items that  I place in it, along with the expiration date. Some items will be scannable. The  refrigerator will then remind me when I forget to consume something. Such  systems already exist for blind people.  The message is not all of these things will happen exactly as described above.  Nor is the message that all such systems will be centrally controlled, and that  people lose their freedom. The message is rather: There are incredible oppor- tunities for creativity, new scopes for design, and an immense variety of new  possibilities to redesign life and work.  Will we use digitization and artificial intelligence for the good of the world, for  the good of people, and for our own good?   3  How Did Artificial Intelligence Come into  Being and Where Do We Stand Today?

This notion of the world as a giant machine runs through the entire  history of technical development. Of course, such a model describes only a  part of reality, as we know from many approaches to the theory of living sys- tems3   Hanna,  1988 .  But  initially,  this  evolution  was  characterized  by  a  mechanistic world view. It was only much later that we began to understand  that  the  behavior  of  organizations  cannot  be  described  by  a  mechanistic  approach alone. For an appropriate representation of organizations, the char- acteristics of living systems are much more suitable.  1 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Ada_Lovelace, accessed in April 2020. 2 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki René_Descartes, accessed in April 2020. 3 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki OSTO_System_Model;  model , accessed in April 2020.  https:  henning4future.com en osto-system-     The Editor s   if applicable  and The Author s , under exclusive license   to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 K.

Henning  A key invention from the mechanistic approach is the first practical pro- gramming language, which finally achieved its breakthrough with the inven- tion of the computer in the 1940s.   The Story of Inventions  By 1947, one of the first autopilot systems would be available to military avia- tors. Rudimentary systems like this one were the beginning of industrial auto- mation, but not yet the beginning of artificial intelligence.  What we now recognize as the birth of artificial intelligence was a science  conference at Dartmouth University in 1956.4 Scientists discussed conceptual  questions about computer languages, “self-improvement” of arithmetic oper- ations, and the relationship between randomness and creativity. One focus  was on “neural networks,” which have since been used to simulate a mathe- matical model of human brain structures.  In  the  1960s,  automation  technology  followed  with  industrial  robots,  mobile robots, and the first chatbot “Eliza,” a small software package with  which scientists tried to simulate a psychological consultation. Back in 1992,  this chatbot was already part of my compulsory university lecture “Computer  Science  in  Mechanical  Engineering”  for  first  year  students   Henning  &  Kutscha, 1994 :    1.

However, these  limited discourses already demonstrate the tendency to perceive machines as  living objects. My lawnmower robot is clearly stupid, but it’s called “Moritz.”  And when I get home, I ask “How’s Moritz”? Over the course of time, I have  noticed that almost all people who own a robot as a lawnmower give it a name. It  seems  obvious  that  it  is  very  important  whether  we  experience  our   machine counterparts as animals or persons rather than machines.  But all this is not yet artificial intelligence, even though we already occa-  sionally label it as such.  We have spoken of “AI systems” at least since the first fully autonomous car  completed a journey of over 212 km  132 miles  in 2005. Justifiably, because  systems were used that autonomously mapped their environment and used  the results to control performance on the road.   Self-Learning Machines  Since then, development has been going rapidly:     Digital assistants that can be operated using natural speech such as Siri,   Google Now, or Cortana have been in use worldwide since 2011.5     The IBM Watson AI machine,6 which beat its human competitors in a quiz  test  in  2011,  has  since  been  regarded  as  the  industry  standard  for  AI  machine. Watson is widely used across the globe.     In 2016, the AlphaGo AI machine won over the reigning human Go world  champion.  In  2017,  it  was  in  turn  defeated  by  the  newer  AlphaGo  Zero machine.  The development of the two AlphaGo AI machines is certainly a milestone   that we need to take a closer look at conceptually.  Go traces its origin back 2500 years to China. The game has simple rules  but an enormous amount of complexity. There are 2.57 × 10210 possible com- binations. This is a number with 211 digits before the decimal point and is  larger than the number of currently known atoms in the universe.  5 Mona Bushnell: AI Faceoff: Siri vs. Cortana vs. Google Assistant vs. Alexa  June 29th, 2018 . https:   www.businessnewsdaily.com 10315-siri-cortana-google-assistant-amazon-alexa-face-off.html,  accessed  in April 2020. 6 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Watson_ computer , accessed in April 2020.   24     K. Henning  For comparison: The complexity of the game Go is 10100 times greater than  the complexity of chess. However, from today’s point of view, it is no longer a  feat to build an AI machine that wins the chess world championship.  At its core, the AlphaGo machine consists of a combination of data-based  learning and reinforcement learning, i.e. a combination of “frontal teaching”  and learning by trial and error.  A so-called deep neural network was programmed, which consists of 12  layers. Each of these layers contains millions of neuron-like elements. The  structure of each individual element is similar to that of a living being—a  structure that has been very well researched. The machine was then trained by  giving  it  access  to  a  library  of  30  million  moves  made  by  human  players.  Using this information, it was able to predict approximately 60% of the moves  made by humans in previous games.  But that’s not enough to win the game. “Frontal teaching”  teach-In  is—as  in school—good, but not enough. To develop its own “non-human” strate- gies,  the  AlphaGo  machine  played  thousands  of  games  against  itself.  The  learning strategy used is the AI machine DeepMind7 from Google.  In this way, the AlphaGo machine trained itself. i.e. AlphaGo has under- gone a kind of self-organized driving school. Finally, in March 2016,8 it won  four out of five games against the then reigning world champion Lee Sedol. In  its winning run, the AlphaGo machine deployed moves that no human had  ever made before.  This seemed to be a dramatic milestone in the AI development. But then a   big surprise happened.9  AlphaGo Zero beats AlphaGo in 2017, which has beaten the world champion  in 2016.  Only one year later, on October 19th, 2017, a new machine—AlphaGo  Zero—beat its just one-year-old colleague. In contrast with AlphaGo, only  the rules of Go were given to this new machine. The “DNA” of the game  alone—its rules—were enough for it to beat its predecessor.  Using “self-study,” this machine gathered the necessary information from  its environment, trained itself, and showed that self-organized AI systems that   7 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki DeepMind, accessed in April 2020. 8 Metz, Cade: In two moves, AlphaGo und Lee Sedol redefined the future.

In AlphaGo  Zero, human inputs are nonexistent beyond providing the rules of the game. It is likely that in the future the same dispute will take place in artificial  intelligence as it already does education, where traditionalist teaching meth- odologies are pitted against more modern approaches informed by develop- mental psychology: teachers as the sole source of knowledge flowing down to  students versus teachers as moderators, enabling the creation of knowledge by  facilitating student-directed discussion and employing online tools like sim- pleclub. But more of that later.  Well,  where  do  we  stand  with  the  implementation  of  these  concepts  in  practice? In the following pages, we will look at a few examples that illustrate  the current situation and future outlooks.  Even weak artificial intelligence shows traces of intelligence.  Let’s start with an example of the so-called weak artificial intelligence.10 In  this case, intelligence is created by connecting independently acting software  agents,  i.e.  connecting  simple,  independent,  computing  units.  In  order  to  understand this “character” of intelligence, let’s consider the following pattern  of gray scales in Fig. 3.1.  One can’t make anything out at first glance. Only when one focuses on the  interactions between the elements and pays less attention to the individual  elements, the image of a face emerges—in this case the face of the author of  this book. One can achieve this by either taking off your glasses, squinting, or  placing the book in a distant corner of the room.  The information obtained from the interactions of the elements triggers  another process of interpreting reality. We look for patterns, not for details.11  In highly complex systems with high dynamics, the importance of the interac- tions between the system elements is more important than the analysis of the  individual properties of each element.  10 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Weak_AI, accessed in April 2020. 11 The  combination  of  complexity  and  dynamics  is  called  Dynaxity.  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Dynaxity. https:  henning4future.com en dynaxity , accessed in April 2020.   26     K. Henning  Fig. 3.1   Interactions are more important than the properties of the elements   Democratic Machine Control  This  approach  was  first  carried  out  in  the  Cybernetics  Lab  of  the  RWTH  Aachen University in 2017 with an industrial knitting machine. All control  devices  SPS controls, etc.  were removed.12 All that remained were sensors  and actuators through which to influence the machine. Then, the machine  was equipped with 200 software agents, i.e. independent computers.  The classic tasks associated with the business of knitting were convention- ally programmed and assigned to the software agents. There were agents for  order management, quality monitoring, resource management, maintenance,  communication, monitoring, perception, and voting.  12 Abbas, Bahoz: Distributed Multi-Agents for Planning and Control of Production Environments Based  on the Separation and Division of Powers. Dissertation. Aachen 2018.   3  How Did Artificial Intelligence Come into Being and Where Do Wet…   27  Votings? Voting for what? Do software agents elect their bosses? Yes, in this   experiment, they did exactly that in fixed terms.  To achieve this, a “social system” was developed for all 200 software agents,  which was based on the democracy model of Germany, i.e. with a strict sepa- ration of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, as well as layering  according to the federal, state, and municipal structures. The top level regu- lated the responsibilities, the middle level production planning and control,  and the lower level plant control. The horizontal separation of powers was  supplemented by a vertical separation of powers.  The legislatures are embodied in the elections made by the software agents  to determine their structure or the order management, which in turn deter- mines what is to be done when and what is not. The judiciary is embodied in  the way the software agents monitor production. Equipped with these fea- tures, the machine learns only through requirements, agreements, controls,  but always according to democratic principles.  At the beginning, I regarded the experiment with a maximum level of skep-  ticism; only to realize the following in the end:  The reliability of a machine controlled this way is significantly higher than  that  of  conventional  machines. To  check  this,  the  scientists  switched  off  a  randomly selected software agent 200 times—only to see its colleagues fully  compensate for the shutdown agent within an average of 0.8 s  with low dis- persion .  The  other  “software  colleagues”  quickly  took  over  the  shutdown  agent’s tasks without interrupting the functioning of the knitting machine.  The  second  astonishing  finding  is  that  the  start-up  process  was  self-  optimized without human intervention. This is an enormous improvement  because  the  start-up  of  such  machines  normally  requires  a  considerable  amount of human intervention.  A  “democratized”  machine  control  with  network  intelligence   weak  artificial  intelligence  already has a considerable advantage over the conventional cen- trally organized machine control.  Now, one could take this experiment even a step further: What would hap- pen if we used 400 software agents and introduced a two-shift operation? And  in addition, we could equip all 400 software agents with AI machines  for  example, an IBM Watson machine  in addition to their programmed manda- tory tasks. Then, we could let one shift work by the book, while the other 200  software agents use their Watson machines to monitor their colleagues’ work,  and after a few hours the two groups switch.   28    K. Henning  What  would  happen?  I  talked  about  this  for  some  time  with  Sabina  Jeschke,13 one of the leading AI experts, and we agreed: It could indeed hap- pen that the 400 software agents gradually remove themselves from their pre- scribed  goals  and  tasks  and,  for  example,  form  a  software  union  through  which new goals and task assignments are negotiated. It remains to be seen  how this will affect product quality.  Here  something  like  the  Götterdämmerung  of  the  central  control  of  machines  becomes  apparent.  This  could  mark  the  beginning  of  an  era  of  democratization of machine controls.  The example of the knitting machine also shows the difference between  weak and strong artificial intelligence. It becomes exciting to imagine the pos- sibilities  once  machines  can  independently  decide  on  their  own  goals  and  procedures to meet those goals.   Quality Progress in Production  The following example will of the repeat accuracy of welding seams. It shows  the  potential  of  applying  strong  artificial  intelligence.  The  background:  In  mass  production,  the  same  welding  seams  must  often  be  made  again  and  again. But welding is a process that can only be reproduced with difficulty. In  order to achieve this, you create extensive databases and try to analyze them  again and again. One uses data mining methods, for example, in order to  achieve improvements. If one achieves 60% repeat accuracy in relation to the  desired outcome, one would be quite pleased. The remaining 40% is left to  the experience of skilled workers who make corrections to the equipment.  If the question was whether AI methods could improve repeatability; the   answer was “Yes,” by about 50%. The obvious question would be, how so?  First, an idea was brought up from the gaming world, namely the game  Super Mario,14 in which a player has to overcome different flying or running  opponents over and over again. The player can then—as with most games— progress to different “levels.”  For this game, there exists a Super Mario AI machine that slowly upgrades  itself to the higher levels, using algorithms in addition to neural networks that  consider the specific task structure. The core of the approach is that the AI  machine makes new predictions of what could happen next after each step  and then decides.  13 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Sabina_Jeschke, accessed in April 2020. 14 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Super_Mario, accessed in April 2020.   3  How Did Artificial Intelligence Come into Being and Where Do Wet…   29  This principle was then applied to the problem of repeatability of industrial  welds and has since been implemented at the company in question. First, the  AI machine was provided with all available historical data and then trained to  use this information to make predictions. One has to imagine that despite the  large amount of data, the database of welding surfaces is hardly uniform, with  many jagged inconstancies, valleys, and peaks, all stemming from the inher- ent difficulties of working with molten metal. Nevertheless, the result was a  25% increase in repeatability.  Now,  every  welder  knows  that  the  quality  of  a  weld  seam  also  strongly  depends  on  environmental  conditions  such  as  temperature  or  humidity.  Therefore,  detailed  weather  data   pressure,  humidity,  temperature,  wind   from recent years were also made available to the AI system. Unsurprisingly,  not one person can ever be able to process and evaluate so many variables at  once. An AI machine can. The learning algorithm may be quite simple, but in  combination with the huge amount of data available to the algorithm, signifi- cant improvements are possible. In this case from 60 to about 90%.  In many “small” applications, artificial intelligence systems will produce consid- erable improvements in quality.   Robotic Teamwork  The breakthroughs of robotic teamwork in production, logistics, and assem- bly are well known.  The  worldwide  RoboCup  competitions  are  a  testament  to  these  break- throughs. In the RoboCup Logistics League,15 autonomous robots are given  logistical and assembly tasks that they have to perform as a robotic team—in  competition against other teams. The robots move autonomously, similar to a  motor scooter track at a fair  Fig. 3.2 .  The  team  of  RWTH  Aachen  University  won  the World  Championship   title four times between 2014 and 2017. What were the success factors?  The  individual  robot  acts  autonomously  as  a  “super-agent.”  The  system  consisted of five robots and was operating radically decentralized, displaying  the following characteristics:  15 http:  www.robocup-logistics.org , accessed in April 2020.   30     K. Henning  Fig. 3.2  RoboCup world championship 2017  Courtesy of the Cybernetics Lab of RWTH  Aachen University      There is no central control. We’ve already seen a similar development with   the knitting machine and its democratic control system.     The robots have no hard-coded components. All components can change   in their behavior and their structural parameters.     An intensive sharing of all information takes place. The robots are all com-  pletely transparent in their behavior for the benefit of their “colleagues.”    Decisions are made cooperatively. There’s no robot that has the last word.    While working, it can happen that a robot revises its behavior strategy and,  while doing so, restricts its activities strongly or completely. It’s taking a  creative  break,  so  to  speak.  And  the  robot  itself  decides  when  to  inter- vene again.  The decentralized control strategy marks a turning point for our under- standing of technical controls. Generations of engineers have been trained to  believe that this is not possible to achieve without a central control instance.  As complexity increases, this new concept is becoming increasingly impor- tant, because the variety of decision-making options is much greater in decen- tralized structures. The decentralized control strategy keeps the system from  causing conflicts in its hierarchical structure. This leads to a totally different    3  How Did Artificial Intelligence Come into Being and Where Do Wet…   31  Fig.  3.3  Autonomous  pallet  control   Courtesy  of  Torwegge  Intralogistics  GmbH  & Co KG   kind of factory organization. And indeed, the control strategy of the RoboCup  robots is already used in industrial practice  Fig. 3.3 .  What is so special about this concept is the speed with which it can be put  into  practice.  Within  6  months,  these  principles  got  converted  into  an  AI-controlled autonomous vehicle for pallet control.  Central control can be omitted with clever AI systems.  Perhaps  this  approach  also  contains  valuable  lessons  about  how  people  might better organize themselves to maximize their distribution of power and  responsibility. Of course, this is hard to imagine in humans. Nevertheless,  from  the  successes  of  the  RoboCup  robots  one  might  apply  the  following  concepts to cooperation between humans:     A  team  could  develop  its  way  of  working  without  direction  from  a   team leader.     The behavior of the team members is not determined by fixed roles but   adapts to the respective task and team situation.   32    K. Henning  tion takes place.  last word.     There are no secrets within the team. An intensive sharing of all informa-     Decisions are made cooperatively. There is no single person who has the      Whoever needs a break decides that for themselves.  If  one  considers  newer  methods  for  product  development—such  as  the  principle  of  the  Agile  methodology16—some  similarities  are  noticeable.  Perhaps  these  approaches  are  frontrunners  of  a  new  kind  of  interaction  between intelligent machines and humans.  Some indicators point into that direction: On factory floors, it is now possible  to gradually dismantle the protective fences separating robot from humans. The  interaction of humans and robots can be designed in such a way that the two do  not collide with each other. Robots and humans can work together in a confined  space during assembly work. Like two people, so to speak.  Another indicator is the replacement of the teach-in phase for robots capa- ble of self-learning. As early as 2015, it was shown that a humanoid robot  could learn to walk by itself without being explicitly taught how to do so.  Such a robot is a simplified reproduction of the human musculoskeletal sys- tem. You let the robot have a go at walking—like launching a horse.17  In the beginning, the robot falls down all the time. After an hour it can  walk a few steps. You allow the experiment to continue overnight. The final  result: the robot will eventually learn to walk perfectly.  With the robot learning to walk we see the same process played out in the  physical world as we did with the AlphaGo AI machine. The extensive teach- in  that traditionally needs to be done to get such systems “up and running” can be  replaced by learning through trial and error. The benefit being that, in contrast  to humans, the machine does not get frustrated by many failed attempts.  In many cases, AI machines can replace teach-in with “learning by doing.”  AI systems will thus penetrate all areas of our life and work. In some places  it will happen surprisingly fast and disruptive—in other places it will take  decades until a functional technology is in place.  16 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Agile_software_developmentAgile_management,  April 2020. 17 International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems, Istanbul 2015.

Pedagogical Procedures of AI   What’s Next?     34   35   37   38   39  Against the background of the experiential characteristics of artificial intelli- gence systems, the question arises: Can such systems develop their own con- sciousness above a certain performance level. The short answer: Yes, they can!  But what is consciousness and how is it defined?  Almost all scientific fields have their own model world for the definition  and description of consciousness. For the interaction of artificial intelligence  systems and humans, it seems important to consider the perspective of how  such systems are experienced by humans. Psychological, neuroscientific, and  scientific approaches provide a good starting point for understanding these  experiences.  Fundamentally,  it’s  about  how  a  system  processes  information  and  then  reacts to it. As long as a computer system “only” receives information and  processes it according to the “rules” of its developers in a way that the devel- oper can predict which results will be produced as a “reaction” of the system,  it remains an essentially deterministic process.

Henning, Gamechanger AI, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-3-030-52897-3_4  33   34    K. Henning  Even, if a system is able to create its own models of the environment from  the observed environment and to generate “reactions” from this, it is still not  very exciting.  However, it starts to get exciting when such a system begins to develop  further its own models and produces conclusions and behaviors that the cre- ator can no longer control and or expect. At this point, we can finally speak  of operative consciousness. Operative consciousness is a phenomenon that we  are very familiar with in animals.   Intelligent Animals  Ravens are able to invent creative solutions from their wealth of experience,  i.e. they create solutions that no one has taught them. This results in ravens  being able to solve unknown tasks by tapping into their “stock” of experience.  Their intelligence can be summarized in three categories:1     They understand their environment. For example, they can throw stones  into  water  in  order  to  trigger  movements  that  bring  floating  food  closer to them.     They are successful craftsmen. For example, they let cars drive over nuts   and then wait until the traffic light turns red to eat the cracked nuts.     They can plan. In one experiment, ravens were placed into an empty room  without food for 1 day, and a different room with plenty of food the next.  After a few days, both rooms were made available at the same time. The  ravens planned to ration their provisions accordingly and took part of the  food  into  the  empty  room.  Furthermore,  ravens  are  able  to  share  their  experiences with others and warn of situations that could be dangerous.  Already ravens have a first stage of consciousness.  This low level of independence is also the lowest level of consciousness. The  associated  intelligence  is  correspondingly  higher  in  more  highly  developed  animals.  It  is  no  longer  controversial  that  rhesus  monkeys  are  capable  of  reflecting on their own environment, i.e. they have their own “world view,”  which they are constantly developing, even if they are not observing anything.  1 Ravens  are  Intelligent  Opportunists.  https:  forestsociety.org something-wild ravens-are-intelligent-  opportunists, accessed in April 2020.   4  Can Machines Have Their Own Consciousness?   35  This does not necessarily require contact with the environment. One can  learn from indirectly observing, using these observations as if they actually  came from direct interactions with the environment. The result of the reflec- tion is therefore used again as input for another reflection. Thus, one comes  step by step to an “imagined world view.” And this idea of the world then  becomes an essential basis with which to plan and implement actions.  When you ask a rider if their horse has a consciousness of its own, the  answer is always “yes.” He or she experiences the horse as a counterpart with  its own consciousness. A rider also attributes feelings to their horse and expe- riences it as a living being with emotional states and expressions.  Animals and humans can thus stand in intelligent exchange and form an intel- ligent partnership.  If we now address the question of whether systems of artificial intelligence  have their own consciousness, we can take the described intelligence of ani- mals as a starting point. From this understanding of consciousness, one can  explore the question of how consciousness can form in systems of artificial  intelligence.   Strong Artificial Intelligence  In these AI systems, a distinction is made between weak and strong artificial  intelligence.2 To answer the question of AI machine consciousness, it is neces- sary  to  examine  those  systems  that  are  capable  of  forming  strong  artificial  intelligence. But what exactly is strong artificial intelligence?  Systems of strong artificial intelligence are characterized by their ability to  develop creatively and produce behaviors the developers could not program,  design, or even imagine. These are systems that can think and reflect about  their own state, so they know who they are and what they are for. Up to the  point where such systems can also know from themselves when it is time to  switch off, i.e. to bring about their own “death.”  Whether it will ever be possible to build systems that reach the “level” of  human consciousness is controversial. But there are at least valid arguments to  the effect that this cannot be ruled out in the long term. Authors like Stephen   2 Harlon Moss: Difference Between Strong AI and Weak AI. https:  www.difference.wiki strong-ai-vs-  weak-ai , accessed in April 2020.   36    K. Henning  Hawking3  think  this  is  possible  and  warn  against  it.  Others  like  Markus  Gabriel  Gabriel, 2018  consider it impossible.  Today, however, it is already the case that artificial intelligence systems are  more intelligent in a certain segment of human’s ability and act more intelli- gently than humans.  That this is possible is related to the fact that such systems can connect with  each other and link their data simultaneously and worldwide. One example of  this are globally connected travel systems that allow travelers to book hotels,  taxis, or make flight reservations from anywhere in the world, right down to  the last detail. In this way, a “Big Data” world is created that we humans are  not capable of carrying around ourselves, either as individuals or in direct  communication with others. This world of data is not only reflected in the  global internet, but also in a variety of Global Area Networks.4 The internet is  nothing more than one of the many Global Area Networks, some of which are  interlinked, but some of which are closed, company intra-nets.  On the other hand, the learning processes of AI systems are relatively easy  to describe and not as complex as the structures of our brain. But in combina- tion with the massive pools of data—the so-called data lakes—this is enough  to become an intelligent counterpart for us. We experience the AI system as a  counterpart with its own consciousness.  The combination of vast amounts of data and a simple construction of intelli- gence makes the special performance of AI systems possible.  Let’s  get  this  straight:  Consciousness  is  an  integral  part  of  systems  that  develop their own intelligence to a significant extent. In the current scientific  discussion, there is an exciting approach for differentiating levels of conscious- ness. The AI expert Sabina Jeschke and the Linguists Riccardo Manzotti talk  about the following:5,6  3 Stephen Hawking: Automation and AI Are Going to Decimate Middle Class Jobs.

This model focuses on the consciousness of thoughts.     Phenomenological consciousness  P-consciousness : This model focuses on   the subjective experience of pain, temperature, or colors.     Self-awareness: This is about the ability to differentiate oneself as a person  from other people and to recognize and develop one’s own identity—the  ego-consciousness  Jung, 1995 .   Machines with Ego-Consciousness?  For AI systems it is relatively easy to reproduce basic forms of human thought,  i.e. to develop A-consciousness. This is “only” about the reproduction of par- tial structures of information processing in the human brain. This succeeds  quite well with neuronal network feedback structures  deep learning .  P-consciousness is much more difficult because the intelligent systems for  pain detection and processing in the human body are not only located in the  brain. To build such “distributed” intelligent systems is far more complex.  Here the analogy to locally and logically distributed network structures, which  record and evaluate a common perception of a process, is obvious.  This also includes an intelligent structure of the “Internet of Things,” i.e. a  combination of intelligent AI systems that directly measure physical values  such as pressure, temperature, and air composition and independently develop  a model of the environment based on these measures. The AI system in these  cases is inseparably embedded in the object.  The question of the AI realization of the third type of consciousness, self-  awareness,  remains  unanswered.  Whether  AI  systems  can  1  day  gain  ego-  consciousness in the sense of a person who distinguishes themself from other  people is controversial in the literature. This is a very important issue which  will certainly remain unresolved for a long time to come.  In my opinion, AI systems will never confront us as persons with their own   ego-consciousness. But as I said, there are different opinions.  Let us return to the question of how systems of artificial intelligence develop   a thought consciousness. That alone is dramatic enough.  How do systems of the so-called strong artificial intelligence learn? Let us   approach this question in three steps.   38     K. Henning   Pedagogical Procedures of AI  First, such systems learn through a purely data-based methodology. In other  words,  they  learn  through  observation  as  well  as  explanation.  They  collect  data, and they are taught certain specific lessons. Design-engineers or pro- grammers enter rules or certain schemas relevant for solving problems the  system in question is designed to solve.  Such procedures are called “teach-in” procedures. In practice, this is noth- ing more than “frontal teaching.” The systems are given tasks that correspond  to the skills the developers have provided them with, and they are assessed  accordingly on their performance in these tasks.  From pedagogy we know that such learning systems, which consist only of   frontal teaching, are not very efficient.  Teach-in, comparable to frontal teaching, brings little intelligence to AI systems.  The second step considers that many approaches have emerged in the edu- cation sector based on the principle of “learning by doing”  trial and error .  Take the Montessori approach,7 for example, which is based on the idea  that a child should discover what they could learn and be offered correspond- ing learning spaces for different subjects. In a learning room for mathematics,  the child would be introduced to counting and arithmetic via a variety of  materials.  It has been shown that learning by trial and error involves certain risks, but   also has a very lasting effect.  Artificial intelligence systems also learn with this principle. It is known as  reinforcement learning. The method uses the result obtained—the output— as input again, just as if it was an external input. And this feedback loop cre- ates the feedback circuit of trial and error. A solution that goes in the right  direction is rewarded.  From chaos theory we know that even simple multiplying feedback algo- rithms lead to chaotic, unpredictable results. The simplest chaotic system is a  double pendulum, where the course of the pendulum already has a chaotic  non-reproducible  pattern.8  The  elementary  feedback  system  with  chaotic   7 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Montessori_education, accessed in April 2020. 8 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Double_pendulum, accessed in April 2020.   4  Can Machines Have Their Own Consciousness?   39  output is the so-called Verhulst’s growth equation, from which chaotic pat- terns, called fractals, can arise  Henning, 1993 .  The third step consists of combining teach-in procedures with reinforce- ment learning in artificial intelligence systems and linking them to a large  database.  Teach-in plus learning via trial and error plus huge amounts of data have made  the breakthrough of artificial intelligence possible.  The concept was developed more than 50 years ago. But only today has it  become reality, because the amount of available data and the performance of  computers have grown exponentially and will continue to grow. What 50 years  ago filled an entire bookshelf with punched cards as data carriers can fit on a  small SD card today.  Today’s computer technology is based on transistors as basic components.  It  is  predictable  that  there  will  eventually  be  limits,  simply  because  of  the  growing energy consumption of AI systems.9   What’s Next?  Nevertheless, there is no foreseeable limit to the development of computer  performance. This is because a new dimension opened up: Thomas Schimmel10  introduced a new “transistor” in 2018. This single atom transistor consumes  10,000 times less energy than the transistors of today’s silicon technology. If  one considers that today’s worldwide information processing done on com- puters accounts for about 10% of the electrical energy produced in industrial- ized  countries,  it  becomes  clear  that  a  new  era  of  computer  technology  is  foreseeable.11  Today,  AI  development  is  driven  by  new  algorithms.

And the third push will be  created by the upcoming quantum computing technology. This will lead us to  High Performance Computing systems  Bianchini et al., 2020 .  If we think of higher levels of consciousness, which, for example, are shaped  by the difference between the consciousness of humans and that of animals,  artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. In this respect, I am convinced  that this will not be achieved in the next century.  However, this does not change the fact that artificial intelligence systems  will be superior to humans in certain areas through the combination of clever  algorithms and vast amounts of data. We humans are not capable of simulta- neously processing as many globally available and retrievable data as this is  possible in the world of artificial intelligence.  For these intelligent algorithms, countless research groups worldwide are  working to improve the core of artificial intelligence. The most commonly  used principle is that of the neural network. In this process, known as deep  learning, the individual elements of an input are fed to a layer of nodes. Each  individual node has the same structure as a nerve cell  see Fig. 1 . Several of  such layers are connected sequentially up to one output. This output is then  used as input—again and again. These feedback loops are the key to enabling  such networks to continue learning from their experiences without necessarily  requiring new input from outside. This cybernetic principle is also known  from the functioning of biological cell structures.  If you want to apply this in practice, such a simple structure is of course not  enough. For example, to build a digital rear-view mirror for self-driving cars  that can see what happens behind my car in traffic, you need many such layer  structures in parallel that interact with each other and learn from each other  with nested feedback loops.  Even  then,  nothing  has  been  gained  because  the  developer  then  has  to  design the “DNA” of such a structure and define the framework conditions  that  apply  to  the  cooperation  of  the  different  neural  networks.  And  that’s  often not easy.  There is still a long way to go; the bottlenecks are in the details, not in the  basic structure. Like is so often the case with technological developments, it’s  like  running  a  long-distance  race.  Considering  a  race  over  a  length  of  100 miles, the last mile of reaching the finish line will take particularly long;  often just as long as the distance to that last mile mark.   4  Can Machines Have Their Own Consciousness?   41  Current developments show that learning based on human-generated deci- sions often leads to worse results than “pure” learning without human inter- vention. It is therefore possible that the interplay between machine learning  and human learning will develop in a completely new way.  We are only at the very beginning of this exciting development, to which  the younger generation has already adapted to a considerable extent, as we  will see in the next chapter.   5  The Homo Zappiens  Contents  Global and Local at the Same Time   Homo Zappiens at School   New Expectations Towards the Employer   Parallel Worlds   Communication with Images, Icons, and Emojis   Warning     43   46   47   48   49   51  The digital transformation of our lives began a generation ago. Communication  with short messages, parallel life across numerous social networks, and the  handling of automatic devices containing artificial intelligence have become  normal for the younger generation since childhood. A completely new under- standing of relationships between people and objects has developed.  A new type of human being is emerging that receives, filters, and processes  information globally and is nevertheless regionally established. At the same  time, awareness of global relationships and regional homeland connectivity is  growing.   Global and Local at the Same Time  It is becoming increasingly normal for us to be in globally distributed, virtual  work  environments.

A completely new understanding of global relationships is emerging, driven  largely by the networking of personal data throughout the processes of our  daily lives.  Working time and place of work are arbitrary.  This “global milieu” poses a great challenge to the entire educational pro- cess. The key to new learning processes becomes experience-oriented learning.  Learning must be fun  again , or learning does not happen.  During the Corona crisis, several of my grandkids found it much more  pleasant to work at home and occasionally attend interactive video sessions  with their teachers than sitting in a classroom.  In addition, we must learn to unlearn, as some authors say. The sociologist  and prominent thinker of system theory Niklas Luhmann writes  Lehmann,  2012 :1 “The main function of memory is therefore to forget, to prevent the  self-locking  of  the  system  from  the  accumulated  results  of  earlier  observa- tions.” In 2006, Wim Veen summarized the contours of this changed under- standing of the human being in the digitalized world in one term  Veen &  Vrakking, 2006 : Homo zappiens.  The rise of the global-regional “Homo zappiens” is not about the disap- pearance of “Homo sapiens,” but rather about two views of Homo zappiens  and Homo sapiens that explain what has changed in the younger generation  during the digital age.  As  children,  they  acquire  Homo  zappiens  skills  that  earlier  generations  acquired in the later decades of their lives or not at all. However, this does not  mean  that  this  development  is  only  beneficial.  It  raises  a  lot  of  questions.  What  are  the  consequences  of  excessive  media  consumption,  for  example?  However, it will not be possible to stop this development. It is much more  important to use and shape it in a positive way.  Recently, one of my grandkids needed tutoring. The tutor was having a  hard time with it and so was my grandson. Until the tutor suggested that my   1 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Niklas_Luhmann, accessed in April 2020.   grandson should listen to music in one ear during the tutoring lesson did the  lesson begin to yield results.  5  The Homo Zappiens   45  Homo zappiens learn in both highly parallel and non-linear ways.  What  are  the  important  characteristics  of  Homo  zappiens  compared  to  Homo  sapiens   Gabriel,  2018 ?  Homo  sapiens  have  the  power  to  control  themselves.  But  that  doesn’t  mean  they  automatically  do  the  right  thing.  Homo zappiens are not to be understood as the opposite of Homo sapiens,  but as a complement.  The Homo zappiens are accustomed to making decisions at high speed and  are permanently multitasking—doing several things at the same time. Homo  sapiens are slower and can concentrate on a single task for a long time.  Wim Veen’s reasoning is: That’s a good thing! The young generation has  already adapted to a world characterized by information overload. The task of  education is then to treat a six-year-old’s ability to multitask as an already  acquired competence. On this basis, the educational process should attempt  to reinforce the ability to concentrate on a single thing for a longer period  of time.  Homo  zappiens  doesn’t  start  reading  at  the  top  left  of  a  page  anymore.  “Icons first” applies. Already at preschool age, children learn to navigate the  internet with icons and pictures, even if they can’t read. Many three-year-old’s  have  more  experience  using  tablets  than  adults,  calling  up  their  apps  and  knowing exactly where to find their clips on YouTube.  Homo zappiens love jumpy, non-linear approaches and connect everything  before they look at individual elements. This is a skill that is perfectly suited  for mastering complex tasks. This corresponds exactly to the competence of  recognizing complex patterns by “blurred looking”  see Fig. 3.1 .  Homo zappiens way of working is heavily based on networking. Preferably,  learning takes place via searches, games, and a lot of imagination. The separa- tion of learning and playing is unknown to Homo zappiens and learning by  listening outright annoying. The power of imagination is sometimes so big  that life in virtual spaces—such as Pokémon2—becomes more of a “reality”  than reality itself.  Some time ago, an 11-year-old son and his father were together with me in  the mountains. The boy had little desire to go hiking. But the expectation that   2 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Pokémon, accessed in April 2020.   46    K. Henning  at a reservoir at an altitude of 8000 ft. he could find masses of particularly rare  Pokémon Go characters gave him a great deal of energy. In the evening, he  showed me how crowded my garden was with Pokémon characters. He has  opened up the mountain world through virtual reality. Because he suspected  a larger collection of Pokémon Go characters up on the mountain, he accepted  the climb. He was impressed not only by the virtual reality but also by the  beauty of the mountains. For him this is a second reality: Augmented Reality3  is the norm in his childhood.  Wim Veen would argue that, again this is a good thing, because the genera- tion of the digital age has already adapted to the requirements of a globally  networked information age and developed strategies for dealing with it that  are meaningful and necessary. But what has not followed development at all— according to the Dutch professor of education and technology Wim Veen—is  the educational process in schools and universities. Education must be based  on the skills that children already bring with them from their networked chil- dren’s room and life on the internet.   Homo Zappiens at School  To illustrate this point, Wim Veen conducted a school experiment in which  the goal was to learn how to interpret a poem. The sequence of several lessons  was essential an inverted version of a conventional teaching approach:  First, the students were asked to research in small teams on the internet inter- pretations and comments that already exist on the poem. They were instructed to  do so not only in Dutch, but also in German and in English. They were then to  produce a comparative assessment of the poem’s interpretations and present it in  class via PowerPoint presentations. Mind you: At that time, they had not yet read  the poem itself. After a detailed discussion on how good the interpretations of the  poem were, the text of the poem was gradually read in different languages. Only  at the very end of the teaching sequence did the students actually write a success- ful poem interpretation “monocausal” and “slowly.” The conclusion of Wim Veen:  The school system will have to be turned upside down. The problem is not the  students. Rather, it is necessary to change the pedagogical procedure in such a  way  that  Homo  zappiens  can  develop  further  based  on  his  already  acquired  competences.  3 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Augmented_reality, accessed in April 2020.   5  The Homo Zappiens   47  This picture is also confirmed in the studies on Generation Y  Millennials 4   born 1976–1998 . This is what the Münsterland Employers’ Association in  Germany writes about Generation Y:5     “Generation Y is always online, always available, always up to date. The   smartphone is no longer put away and is essential for all occasions.”     “They are always connected, work in teams, whether virtual or real, and  they like flat hierarchies. They are willing to work intensively, but of course  they also have to divide their energies, hence the great need for leisure and  family life.”   New Expectations Towards the Employer  However, this also creates other expectations towards the employer:     The ethical behavior of a company is considered more important than the  level of salary. For example, it can become a decision criterion whether a  company participates in CO2 compensation measures.     The  desire  to  have  children  has  clearly  shifted  back  to  earlier  years.  Combined with the regulation on parental leave for men, this creates a new  relationship to careers.     As a result, the need for part-time solutions is also growing for managers.  This was a taboo topic for a long time but is already practiced by many  companies today. There are also more and more solutions in which two  people share a fulltime position for a management task.     More flexibility is expected for home office solutions. This expectation goes  beyond the scope of traditional collective agreements. It goes even further:  employees can temporarily stay in another part of the world and work from  there every day.     The company is expected to have its own offers for childcare and to adjust  working hours according to the needs of families. In the diocese of Aachen,  for example, a company was honored that worked as a call center 24 7, i.e.  around the clock. The company introduced the rule that parents can bring  their  children  to  work  without  prior  notification  and  without  justification.  4 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Millennials, accessed in April 2020. 5 Employer  Münsterland:  Generation  Y:  New  ideas  about  the  world  of  work.  www.arbeitgeber-  muensterland.de blog generation-y-neue-vorstellungen-von-der-arbeitswelt, accessed in April 2020.   48    K. Henning     Sustainability of products and production conditions have gained a high  value. Management seminars6 clearly show that the question of the mean- ing of products and production conditions is increasing. Due to the short- age of labor caused by declining populations in industrial countries, young  people have many more options when they begin searching for jobs.     Flexibility is now demanded much more by employees than it is by the  employer. It used to be the other way around. An IT consulting company  in Southern Germany with over 500 employees has therefore given employ- ees the greatest possible freedom to divide their annual working hours as  they wish.  Generation Z7  born since 1998  shows a further development. This gen- eration was accustomed from birth to interact with the great complexity and  uncertainty  of  data,  abundantly  available  via  the  internet.  Generation  Z  attaches great importance to performance and job security or self-determined  entrepreneurship.  Generations  Y  and  Z   born  since  1976   want  a  different  life:  Family,  career,  health, friendships, the need for security are all part of the so-called work–life  balance, which should be in balance.  This  creative  power  of  Generations  Y  and  Z  is  becoming  stronger  and  stronger in the highly developed industrial countries, as young people are in  short supply due to falling birth rates. This is expected to lead to a dramatic  shortage of skilled workers  Jeschke et al., 2015 .   Parallel Worlds  Let’s take a look at the “scene” in which this generation moves. I am referring  to a book by Robert Campe  Campe, 2017 , 16 years old in 2017, who viv- idly describes the “whereabouts” of his generation on YouTube channels:  6 Systemic  Management.  https:  henning4future.com en syma-systemic-management ;  https:  www. syma-seminare.de , accessed in April 2020. 7 Luecturi.de, 14.01.2016: Digital Natives: The 4 Generation Z Challenges for Employers. https:  www. lecturio.de magazin generation-z , accessed in April 2020.   5  The Homo Zappiens   49   – Videos on current topics are best viewed on MrWissen2go.8 1.2 million   people subscribed  2020 .   – On Emrah9 you can find tips and tricks for everything.

Every month new YouTube channels appear, and existing ones disappear.  The professional Homo zappiens serves them all in parallel. Linear television,  where you watch whatever is on at the moment, is becoming less and less  accepted. Wim Veen demonstrates this in an experiment with students where  they watch several simple movies at once without any issues. They use the  image patterns to predict what the future course will be. And then they change  programs. You just watch what you want and when you want it—on YouTube,  Netflix, the archives of TV programs, or other platforms.  Being online on many  social  media channels simultaneously has become a nor- mal part of life.   Communication with Images, Icons, and Emojis  Even more important, however, is the fact that the world of icons has devel- oped into its own language. Every user of a smartphone will find a set of about  2000 emojis to replace letters, which can also be used to write. This also helps  a lot in work with refugees. Many conversations are initially only possible  with pictures or icons. A German design company13 developed a special tem- plate with icons on two A4 pages to facilitate conversation.  8 https:  www.youtube.com user MrWissen2go, accessed in April 2020. 9 https:  www.youtube.com user CrazyEmri2, accessed in April 2020. 10 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Bianca_Heinicke, accessed in April 2020. 11 https:  de.wikipedia.org wiki Freekickerz, accessed in April 2020. 12 https:  de.wikipedia.org wiki Simpleclub, accessed in April 2020. 13 http:  amberpress.eu buecher icoon-first-help-refugees-welcome , accessed in April 2020.   50    K. Henning  Fig. 5.1  You can talk with WhatsApp  Campe, 2017   Another example: Robert Campe reports on a dialogue in which his mother   writes him a longer message  Fig. 5.1  using emojis.  I use these lines again and again as a “reading test.” With ten-year-old read- ers, that’s no problem at all. They read such a sentence almost fluently, but  with certain inaccuracies. It is interesting in this context that emojis can look  very  differently  depending  on  the  operating  system  or  apps  used.  With  WhatsApp on a Samsung smartphone, you can switch between two different  emoji  sets,  some  of  which  allow  significantly  different  interpretations.  Nevertheless, this does not seem to lead to misunderstandings.  Just as in the epoch before Gutenberg everything had to be explained in  pictures because people could not read, today the world of pictures returns  with icons and emojis.  Most older people cannot read this sentence. So far, I have experienced it   only once that a 50-year-old could read this fluently.  This  kind  of  communication  changes  communication  in  general:  the  images  and  mythical  representations  are  coming  back.  That’s  no  surprise,  because we have learned to orient ourselves on the internet with many pic- tures and icons. However, images and myths are always more blurred and  unclear than text.  The images and myths are coming back.  Dear  reader,  perhaps  you  have  also  understood  approximately  what  the   icon sentence means. If you want to know more, the sentence is:  I’m not picking you up in the car because I’m going out for coffee. Take the bus  home and bring a cake from the shop at the train station.  Dealing with media has many new dimensions:   5  The Homo Zappiens   51     Conferences are possible “anytime, anywhere.”    Writing 200 relevant e-mails with valuable content per day is possible. I   have witnessed this firsthand.     Direct communication without secretaries is possible.    Writing  with  automatic  source  generation  actually  works. Yes,  there  are   also first attempts that AI systems write books.14     Informal networks are easily organized.    Flash mob events are fast, effective, and feasible at a large scale.    The library of management tools available to individuals and businesses is   growing. Leading via a variety of social media tools becomes normal.     I can “talk” via WhatsApp icons, etc.   Warning  On the other hand, the dangers of this development cannot be overlooked.  One of the critics—Manfred Spitzer—strongly warns against the exaggerated  use of social media  Spitzer, 2012 . His main criticism is that this approach  only superficially addresses the content. He argues that it diminishes one’s  own  creative  learning.  However,  this  cannot  be  prevented  by  prohibiting  social media. It is part of the responsibility of parents and teachers to show  ways  in  which  this  risk  can  be  reduced.  This  is  exactly  where Wim Veen’s  approaches have proven to be groundbreaking.  However, the risks in dealing with the digital possibilities are also consider- able  in  practice.  The  following  are  some  ironically  meant  “options”  in  the  sense of the “logic of failure.” In other words: How do I behave successfully  wrong? Here are some paradoxical recommendations:     Stop  talking  to  your  employees  and  communicate  only  via  e-mail,   WhatsApp, etc.     Always use as many cc’s as possible so that everyone stays informed what   you are up to—take care of your information duty through cc.     Only notify restructuring measures, dismissals, etc. electronically.    Use bcc purposefully so that your information policy remains your secret.    You  can  be  reached  24 7  and  react  after  10  minutes  at  the  latest  to  be   efficient.  14 Schäfer, Michael: Artificial Intelligence: First book of an algorithm published.

Avoid times only taking care of yourself.  There is much to learn to find a good balance between Homo zappiens and  Homo sapiens. Homo zappiens is no alternative to Homo sapiens. Rather, the  term describes the expansion and change of human learning and behavioral  processes in the digital transformation.  The  many  new  dimensions  of  learning  and  communicating  will  further  increase the complexity and dynamics. This will also lead to limits of mental  resilience. It is about the art of making selecting the various new possibilities  usable  in  a  targeted  way—like  going  shopping  in  a  supermarket. You  can  choose from an enormous selection, and you will choose “your” supermarket. In  this  way,  completely  new  and  diverse  habits  of  learning,  living,  and  working are emerging worldwide. Companies will adapt to the new expecta- tions of young workers. Schools will fundamentally rethink their teaching and  learning concepts and humans will learn to cope with the high amount of  information and the parallelism of processes that can be overwhelming. They  will also have to learn to find a new relationship between activity and leisure.   6  The Inverse Gutenberg Revolution  Contents  Social Bots   A Transparent Society   Ethical Boundaries     54   56   57  We just learned that images and myths are finding their way back into our  communication.  We  are  already  experiencing  this  in  WhatsApp  conversa- tions. But the world of text messages has also taken on a different character in  recent years. More and more people communicate with “picture messages” in  which logical connections play a minor role. Rather, we see simple statements  getting spread on the internet, via Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or any such  medium that has not even been invented yet.  There  is  more  to  that.  Our  mental  model  of  communication  is  being  changed sustainably. Pictures, short messages, and “impressions” are spread  on a massive scale. In this way, behaviors and ideas can spread quickly around  the world. This phenomenon is what is known as the “Meme” and goes back  to Richard Dawkins  Dawkins, 1989 .  That would not be so far-reaching in itself. What matters is that these “pic- ture messages” elude rational discourse. The dynamics of the “Likes”—I like  it or I don’t like it—determines the dynamics of the distribution and influ- ences my personal opinion. If it is targeted correctly, it will also be increas- ingly successful in shaping political opinions.  That in itself would not have very far-reaching effects.

If it is targeted correctly, it will  also be increasingly successful in shaping political opinions.  54     K. Henning   Social Bots  An essential dimension of this new way of communication is the following:  For the creation of such short messages and pictures I do not necessarily need  people who “create” these messages and pictures. This can also be done by  automatic machines and or intelligent AI systems.  Let’s take a closer look at that through the example of the “Twitter world.”  Approximately 15% of all Twitter accounts worldwide are not operated by  people,  but  are  automatic  accounts,  the  so-called  social  bots.  The  15%  amounts to about 48 million accounts.1 Such a social bot is an—increasingly  intelligent—computer program that replicates human behavior patterns in  social media. These social bots are on the move on the internet without human  intervention, in our case in the Twitter world.  A larger proportion of these 48 million accounts have “bad” intentions,  whereby “bad” is a very relative term. These “bad” automated accounts range  from the dissemination of right-wing extremist ideas to advertising for illegal  and immoral processes and election campaign machines.2  The more intelligent of these social bots can also reproduce images of living  people and let them talk. They can do this well enough that the viewer has no  chance of distinguishing this simulated person from a real one.  Thus,  the  Star  Trek  fiction  of  replicants  in  two-dimensional  space  has  become a reality in our world: People who talk and act like people but are no  real persons. More precisely, it is the image of the three-dimensional person  on the surface of the screen.  A well-known example of this was a group of students from a renowned  American university who intervened in the election campaign with a replicant  Barak Obama.3 The lip movements of the synthetic Obama were generated by  an AI machine with neural nets. The students then took sentences and phrases  from Obama’s speeches and used them to create lip movements. As a result,   1 Erxleben, Christian: Social Bots on Twitter: 48 million accounts are not people.

Such applications for creating videos with faces that look deceptively simi- lar to real people are now downloadable as a “Deep Fake App”4 for everyone  from the internet.  Is that politically justifiable? Should that be forbidden? If so, how? Three-dimensional holographic representations will follow. The same goes  for films in which, for example, a replicant Obama walks around. But I don’t  think it’s possible that one day a robot Obama will run around that I can’t  distinguish from a human anymore. To be on the safe side, I would have to  touch his skin...  Another  dimension  is  created  by  automatic  accounts  that  move  in  the  political scene. An example of such an intelligent social bot became known  where an automated social bot had gotten involved into the right-wing radical  scene. Consequently, its entire communication history was deleted. But the  memory patterns that this social bot had already formed remained. His “world  view” had become part of the bot’s DNA.5  The social bot, robbed of its memory in this way, was then—with its “view  of  the  world”—released  back  onto  the  net.  The  result  was  almost  to  be  expected: Within a very short time, the social bot’s comments were once again  right-wing  radical.  It  was  shut  down:  The  death  penalty  for  intelligent  machines, so to say, if these do not correspond to the desired world view.  This example shows the difference whether I “only” have a huge amount of  data or whether I can do something with this data in combination with an  intelligent AI machine.  Big Data alone delivers volumes of data in an increasingly shorter time.  This creates complexity and dynamics, a considerable increase in the so-called  dynaxity.6 The term dynaxity is composed of the two terms complexity and  dynamics and describes the combination of complexity and speed of change.  The degree of dynaxity is divided into four zones:  1  static,  2  dynamic,  3   turbulent, and  4  chaotic. While traditional methods of perception and con- trol are effective in zones 1 and 2, the transition to turbulent zone 3 represents  a serious paradigm shift. One aspect of this is the enormous increase in avail- able information, which is reflected in data dynamics.  4 https:  www.chip.de downloads Deepfakes-FakeApp_133452282.html, accessed in April 2020. 5 Vincent, James: Twitter taught Microsoft’s AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day.

Henning   A Transparent Society  This  data  dynamic  creates  a  transparent  society.7  Much  more  information  than ever before is becoming transparent, accessible to nearly everyone. This  effect of the transparent society also has positive effects. For example, Google  has succeeded in anonymously identifying all active mobile phones and smart- phones and deriving movement data from them. But this data wouldn’t have  had much value alone.  Only the use of AI algorithms, which evaluate these data with given goals,  results in a new dimension. In the case of Google, the traffic jam indicator of  Google Maps was created, which functions by collecting the movement data  of most mobile phones in the world. This makes the global traffic situation  around the globe completely transparent. From the couch in my living room  in Germany I can check what it would be like if I had to cross one of the  bridges from Newark to New York City. I can see what alternatives would be  possible at this moment. There is complete transparency of all the traffic jams  taking place on roads somewhere in the world right now. Including Hong  Kong. But not the traffic jams of Beijing and Shanghai, because the govern- ment is blocking access to this data. More about this later.  At  its  core,  the  combination  of  big  data  and  artificial  intelligence  creates  the  possibility of the predictable human being, a dimension that goes far beyond  the transparent human being.  In the political sphere, the same procedures allow direct intervention in  election campaigns. This also means that any regional and national election  campaign can at the same time become an international election campaign if  there is access to the global open network.  With this background it is no surprise that politics can be made with a  Twitter account. One can win a vote with pictures, myths, or short messages  that can consist of both true and fake news.  The worldwide dynamic of data that is available everywhere in combina- tion with automatic accounts has already created a new culture around the  globe: Highly efficient for useful processes such as traffic jam forecasting and  highly dangerous for political stability and democracy.  It  seems  as  if  the  significance  of  reason  is  diminishing.  Just  like  before  Gutenberg’s time, there is communication via images, myths, and short news   7 http:  www.davidbrin.com transparentsociety.html, accessed in April 2020.   6  The Inverse Gutenberg Revolution   57  that has a lasting impact on people’s lives and behavior. I call this the Inverse  Gutenberg Revolution.  We are still far from being able to perceive, evaluate, and control the power of  the  instruments  of  artificial  intelligence  that  are  already  available  and  in  use today.  One  could  compare  the  development  of  artificial  intelligence  with  the  invention of atomic energy. At that time, the inventors had an idea about the  opportunities and risks of this energy. They even spoke about it publicly. But  it took decades until their warnings were taken seriously.   Ethical Boundaries  Today, we already see that artificial intelligence has become an extremely pow- erful  weapon  that  is  used  in  all  areas  of  the  world—from  useful,  practical  application to new vehicle concepts, factories, and mobility concepts to the  global influence, manipulation, and control of people.  Do we hear and understand that all this is much more radical than, for   example, the upheaval from horse-drawn carriages to motor vehicles?  Do we still believe the AI experts who tell us it’s all not as big a deal and it   is all just computers and we’ve had them for over 70 years now?  In addition to redesigning our factories, our mobility systems, and our way  of communicating, it’s all about redesigning our social and political systems— worldwide. And that is where our democratic system is at stake. Let us shed  some light on the dimension by using the example of face recognition through  AI systems:  In the past, a computer system had to be loaded with a wide collection of  faces via the teach-in process in order to enable it to identify faces on its own.  This is a technique that police criminal investigation units have already been  using for decades.  Today, an AI system only needs the rules to search for the “round part” and  sort  the  Euclidean  distances  in  space:  “Measure  all  distances  in  the  three-  dimensional space and evaluate them at your own discretion.” The amazing  thing  is:  After  a  short  time,  the  system  can  distinguish  between  male  and  female faces. Of course, the system first distinguishes between A and B and  then needs to be instructed that A means “men” and B means “women.”   58    K. Henning  With  this  system,  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  now  carries  out  the  nations’ education for 1.5 billion people. They even complement the use of  facial recognition cameras, by monitoring payment behavior, for example. If  you behave well, you get bonus points; if you behave badly, you get malus  points. The underlying ethical standards—whatever they may be—are deter- mined by the state.  In China’s big cities, every person who crosses the street on the red light is   now “caught” and gets penalized.  One of my colleagues told me about an actress who was penalized for such  an offense, while she definitely hadn’t crossed the street at that particular time.  She complained and it turned out that at the time the camera had supposedly  recognized her face on the street, a bus had passed through the pedestrian  crossing in question. On the side of the bus at a height of 6 ft., a picture of  this actress could be seen—about the size of her head. And that was all the  camera needed to log a penalty in the system. Luckily, the situation was recti- fied, and the penalty was deleted.  According to our democratic understanding, most will argue that such a  state system is irresponsible and inhumane and violates the fundamental right  of human self-determination.  However,  there  is  evidence  of  a  surprising  “side  effect”  of  this  system.  Studies have shown that Chinese citizens think very positively about this sys- tem. One of the reasons is the hope of decline in corruption. But the system  was shut down by officials  2019 .8  Should the Chinese government have found a way to fight corruption sus- tainably? And if that turns out to be the case, how do we assess the value of  “corruption prevention” versus “data protection”?  And would the containment of the spread of the coronavirus in China in  2020 have been possible to the extent we saw without a sophisticated, nation- wide, AI-based digital control system?  If  we  think  of  a  continent  like  Africa  in  this  context,  perhaps  the  fight  against corruption could be a higher value than data protection—an ethical  and social issue that is not easy to resolve.  We don’t even have to wander into the distance to see the applications of  facial recognition. Some time ago I lent my skiing pass  which contained a  picture of myself  to my son. The next day, the pass was disabled. I found out   8 Stephen Chen: Is China’s corruption-busting AI system ‘Zero Trust’ being turned off for being too  efficient?

No  one was asked when this system was introduced. Neither did I sign any con- sent for the automatic face detection.  There are numerous initiatives on the question of how to rank the values of  artificial  intelligence  systems.  The  European  Parliament  intends  to  build  a  platform  on  which  all  current  algorithms  of  artificial  intelligence  can  be  found. The initiative is to result in an ethics charter for artificial intelligence.  In my opinion, we will need such ethical limits for the digital transformation  with artificial intelligence.9  For example, the protection of individual opinion-forming would require  automatic  social  bots  that  contain  “ethical  algorithms.”  Such  a  bot  hunter  would then have to use ethical criteria to search the internet for violations of  ethical principles. In case of doubt, such “policemen on the internet” would  form  working  groups  worldwide  and  elude  state  legislation.  It  is  therefore  urgently necessary to develop an international agreement on AI ethics tests  which  could  include,  among  other  things,  an  assessment  of  the  content  according to ethical moral principles, such as truthfulness, respect for human  dignity, etc.10  How difficult this is can be seen in the discussions about the worldwide  copyright law. On the one hand one tries to exercise control with the so- called upload filters. At the same time, it is precisely this control that allows  a significant increase in power for those who operate the upload filters.11 The  filter  algorithms  that  are  used  in  this  process  make  misjudgments,  just  like humans.  Similarly, problematic was ambivalent the development of the text genera- tor GPT2 by OpenAI,12 a non-profit research institute for artificial intelli- gence. The company pulled a version out of circulation that was too strongly  influenced by external opinions.  9 EU Commission plans comprehensive European initiative. https:  ec.europa.eu digital-single-market  en artificial-intelligence, accessed in April 2020. 10 Abbas, Bahoz: Artificial Intelligence in Politics - The Way to Free Individual Opinion Formation in  Social Media.

Henning  Considering the many risks that go along with using artificial intelligence,  we will have to discuss the ethics of AI systems with their own consciousness  in more detail  cf. Chap. 12 .  The  Inverse  Gutenberg  Revolution  links  everything  with  everything  and  will  lead to the fact that we will have to find and agree on a new—worldwide— order of values.  The core of today’s cultural revolution  the Inverse Gutenberg Revolution   consists of a development towards machines, devices, and service products  which, through the combination of mass data, neural networks, and learning  algorithms of artificial intelligence, have their own consciousness. They are in  a  lifelong  learning  process  and  may  even  decide  to  take  themselves  out  of  operation in time, in other words to “die.”   7  The Age of Hybrid Intelligence  Contents Technology–Organization–People  Driverless Trucks: Why Is It Taking So Long?  Added Value of the Man–Machine Interaction  Shadow Economy     62   63   65   67  With  the  background  of  the  Inverse  Gutenberg  Revolution,  the  question  arises how the interaction of humans and intelligent machines can be shaped. For decades, the paradigm of the HOT approach  First Human, Second   Organization, Third Technology  applied to me  Henning, 2014 :     First people,    then the organization,    then the technology.  This is based on the hypothesis that the focus lies primarily on people and  that the person responsible for the design of organizations and technology is  the human being. In principle, this is still valid.  Obviously, our behavior plays an important role in the design of organiza- tions and technology. It is astonishing that an organization such as the Office  for the Protection of the Constitution of Bavaria Germany1 points out that   1 Elsasser,  Thomas:  Dangers  of  industrial  espionage.

Henning  the core of any protective measure lies with the human being and after that  with the organizational structures. Only then do developed technology sys- tems makes sense.  However, the practice of technical innovation is different. The same phases   can be observed with every new technology.   Technology–Organization–People  In the first phase we usually fall in love with new technologies. In this phase,  the players believe that with this technology automatically everything will be  fine.  This  has  been  the  case  with  all  automation  waves  in  recent  decades.  Already at the end of the 1980s of the last century “Computer-Integrated  Manufacturing”  CIM  was proclaimed and the deserted, fully automatic fac- tory was expected shortly. A few years later, the concept “HCIM—human-  centered computer-integrated factory” boomed  Brandt, 2003 .  Then, people realize that some organizational changes are needed to make  the whole thing work. Normally, special departments are then founded, for  transformation, cultural change, or agility. This was also the case with the  innovation wave “knowledge management” in the 1990s of the last century   Henning,  Oertel,  &  Isenhardt,  2003 .  After  it  became  apparent  that  the  automatic knowledge databases did not solve the problem, a wave of organi- zational measures followed. Special departments for knowledge management  were founded.  Only when it becomes clear that the organizational adaptation measures  are not enough does one reflect on the human being and their significance in  the system. In a large-scale administrative reform project in Germany, the best  practice examples nationwide were made available online. In all those best  practice cases, the connection was always made to a person at the center of the  organization who could provide information from person to person.  Unfortunately, the practice usually proceeds in the following order: first   technology, then organization, then people.  The development of the AI wave in recent years is no different. In 2009,  one of my research teams drove over 3000 miles in traffic on the German  Autobahn with coupled truck convoys of various types  Henning et al., 2009;  Henning & Preuschoff, 2003 . Four trucks were coupled at intervals of 33 ft.,  with a load of 160 t at 50 miles h and only in the first truck was a driver  actively steering  Fig. 7.1 .   7  The Age of Hybrid Intelligence   63  Fig.  7.1  Automatic  truck  convoys   Haberstroh, 2014   in  flowing  traffic   in  Germany   in  2009    Driverless Trucks: Why Is It Taking So Long?  In the example of truck convoys, there have been years of discussions on legal  and transport policy principles that have resulted in several new research proj- ects. Nevertheless, these projects didn’t necessarily lead to new insights. In  one, after 10 years of initial road tests and over 20,000 miles worth of trips  carried out in traffic at a distance of 50 ft. between trucks,2 it was found that  the gap is too wide to achieve significant energy savings—a result that was  already clear in 2009. For this reason, a distance of only 33 ft. was chosen at  the time.  Everything  around  driverless  trucks  is  technically  solved  and  has  been  researched  several  times.  Nevertheless,  there  are  still  a  few  organizational  problems with case law and cross-border transport. This is nothing new: It  often takes a little longer for finished technologies to impact everyday life.  2 Joachim Becker: Dampers for the trucks on the string.

Henning  And then there is also the human factor. In the year 2017, a major debate  broke out that by the year 2030 up to 4.4 million of the expected 6.4 million  truck drivers in Europe and the USA will become unnecessary.3 At the same  time, there is already a shortage of 100,000 bus drivers in Germany.  But will truck drivers really become unnecessary? Could that really happen  within the next 8 years? No, that’s not going to work! Why? One must con- sider the question of acceptance in society. How long do we need until not  only engineers and computer scientists, but we as a society have the confi- dence that these 40-ton trucks are allowed to be all driverless on the roads at  50 miles per hour?  How long will it take before there are legal regulations to make this sce- nario a reality? According to all estimates this type of traffic will cause signifi- cantly  fewer  fatalities  than  conventional  traffic.  Perhaps  one  day  it  will  be  possible to prove that the operation of fully automatic cars on the roads is  safer than the operation of cars with human drivers.  We must also distinguish between various modes of transportation: Is the  truck driving on the motorway or on a country road? Does it move in a logis- tics center or in the middle of the city center? Of course, it is relatively easy  for the driver to get out of the truck at the gate of a logistics center and the  rest of the slow journey is fully automated with an AI system. This would  include shunting backwards to the ramp. But if we think of a snow-covered  country road where the edge markings aren’t visible anymore, combined with  poorly visible pedestrians on the road, then it becomes much more difficult  without a human driver.  Even if fully automatic driving of trucks on motorways is permitted  this  would already be technically possible to a large extent today , would freight  forwarders then allow freight to be transported by road without supervision?  Isn’t there a much more sensible way where the truck driver’s cabin could  contain office equipment? In this scenario, they could remotely carry out a  desk job in their company and continue driving the truck himself after leav- ing the motorway.  And what about the fully automatic refueling? Of course, we can build a  tank robot that opens the filler neck and refuels automatically. However, for  this to happen, there must be a reliable, nationwide network of automatic  tank robots that operates faultlessly along all possible routes.  3 Mortsiefer, Hendrik: Robotic trucks threaten millions of jobs.

How does the AI system recognize that the tire is burning? How does the AI  system decide if the truck is to be driven further so that the chassis does not  catch fire? In this case, how does the AI system recognize whether the rubber  blanket has burned down to such an extent that the truck can be stopped?  How do you deploy emergency warnings after a breakdown that leads to a  standstill on the side of the road?  There are also economic issues. The service life of a truck today is at least  8 years. Forwarding agencies calculate with this lifespan. They cannot afford  to take all conventional trucks out of service at once and replace them with  fully automated ones. Even if all the new trucks were only allowed to drive  fully automatically, the changeover would take at least 8 years—under the  assumption that we don’t want to ruin the freight forwarders. Quite apart  from the fact that, from a production point of view, it wouldn’t be possible to  do it any faster. Nobody wants to “quickly” build a truck factory and then  close it down again after some years. That wouldn’t pay off, and the trucks  would then become far too expensive.  Conversions of system and vehicle technologies always take decades, even if  one does not want to admit it.  Well, the idea of driverless trucks for all traffic areas won’t be realized all  that fast. It makes much more sense to link human and AI system in a mean- ingful and efficient way. This is because the combination of the work of AI  machines and that of human beings can be implemented much more quickly.   Added Value of the Man–Machine Interaction  For  example,  the  weekly  working  hours  of  truck  drivers  could  finally  be  reduced  to  a  reasonable  level.  And  the  truck  driver’s  workplace  could  be  upgraded and made more attractive.  In most areas of vehicle and system engineering, there will be used a “hybrid  intelligence” in which the capabilities of humans and AI machines are com- bined in a targeted manner. It is about building trust in human-centered AI.4  4 There is a lot of discussion about this approach in the European Union. https:  ec.europa.eu digital-  single- market en artificial-intelligence, accessed in April 2020.   66    K. Henning  At its core, this is not a new thought. The importance of human–computer  interaction has always been the decisive factor in the implementation of new  automation technologies.  But  the  relationship  between  people  and  AI  machines  and  vice  versa  changes fundamentally once AI machines have their own consciousness. The  result is a counterpart with whom communication takes place at eye level.  A  new  kind  of  partnership  between  the  human  being  and  the  AI  machine  emerges.  Humans often have a close partnership with animals. A rider and a horse  are a “system” with such hybrid intelligence, in which the horse does not work  like a machine, but like an intelligent counterpart with its own will and its  own decision-making capability. Only if the symbiosis between human and  horse is successfully will the team win a competition.  From my experience as a horse-drawn carriage driver I know that the inter- action becomes even more complex when you have four horses in front of you  instead of one. The four horses interact with each other as a team with all  kinds of cooperation problems that we humans also experience. With their  combined  100  hp.  “horsepower,”  they  are  much  stronger  than  me  on  the  coach box. The art is that I, physically much weaker than these horses are,  build up the horses’ confidence, so that they let themselves be guided by me.  As a coachman I perceive much less than the horses.  Certainly, we will also get “teams” of AI machines that interact with each  other. And these teams will run into team problems. It will be our task as  humans to reach a purposeful symbiosis with these teams of AI machines;  even if we are much weaker in handling data and generating corresponding  solutions compared to the network of AI machines that we will cooperating  with. Like a coachman with his four horses, we humans should learn to design  and manage these systems responsibly with our inherent strengths and allow  AI to take over control in areas where AI systems perform better.  Hybrid  intelligence  thus  creates  a  new  coexistence  of  people  and  intelligent  objects.  A new form of communication is being created between people and intel-  ligent objects. Let us take a closer look at these connections:   7  The Age of Hybrid Intelligence   67  When we talk about the real objects of this world, about us humans and  about AI machines, we should be aware of the fact that the digital world cre- ates a digital image of human actions and of machines activities. These images  then communicate with their “originals,” but also with each other.   Shadow Economy  For example, my  unfortunately still  rather stupid smartphone knows many  features of my own personality. It knows my name, where I am, how fast I am  moving, and in which car I was just in. It knows all my e-mail traffic, has  access to all my stored data, has my important passwords in a “safe,” has access  to my data stored in the company, it automatically compiles new video films  for me with an AI machine and constantly reminds me of things I may have  forgotten and so on.  It has become my second skin. Therefore, we speak of a “digital skin,” a   “digital twin,” or a “digital shadow.”5  The  term  digital  shadow  is  probably  the  most  appropriate.  A  shadow  is  omnipresent. It communicates constantly with me and I with it. It always  stands in a very defined relationship to me. But the image of myself is always  incomplete or distorted. When the sun goes down, for example, I see a 30 ft.  long shadow of myself, while some other times, I don’t even see my shadow at all. Another good comparison is the psychological image of a person’s shadow.  For  example,  my  smartphone  offers  me  videos  of  mountaineering  tours  I  made 5 years ago when I was climbing a mountain in the same area. As soon  as I am near that location again, the past emerges in my smartphone shadow.  The digital shadow becomes a dominant part of human and technical identity.  Likewise, different machines have their shadow image. There is a digital  shadow of every machine tool that knows who the machine is and what is  going on with it. In this way, the machine constantly communicates with its  digital shadow.  Even everyday things like shoes will be intelligent and have a digital shadow.  Both the virtual “shadow shoe” and the real shoe are delivered by the “AI  shoe” and are inseparably linked.  5 What is the digital shadow? https:  myshadow.org animation, accessed in April 2020.   68    K. Henning  The digital shadow of my future shoe will be able to connect to my smart- phone shadow and communicate with it to transmit my pulse, my sleeping  habit, or my body temperature without me noticing it.  The digital companions will not only exist for us humans with our smart- phones and other digital devices. All relevant objects of daily life will have  such digital companions.  A kind of “shadow economy” is created in which the digital shadows of people  and  machines  communicate  with  each  other.  The  digital  companions  will  become digital partners  Fig. 7.2 .  Fig.  7.2  Hybrid  intelligence   Images  courtesy  of  umlaut  transformation  GmbH  and  Torwegge Intralogistics GmbH & Co. KG   The medial support of this form of communication through video circuits,  virtual  spaces,  and  holographic  screens  will  become  better  and  better.  Nevertheless, nothing can replace human-to-human interaction.  This interaction must be rediscovered in its diversity, uniqueness, and sig- nificance. If we reduce it, repress it, neglect it, we should not be surprised if  the technical systems of this world will take over 1 day.  Human-to-human communication remains indispensable.   7  The Age of Hybrid Intelligence   69  Today for over 2.7 billion  and statistically speaking in the next 10 years for  all people , the smartphone has become or will become an irreplaceable part  of human existence.6 Without my smartphone almost nothing works any- more. Just as I found myself completely lost on one of my business trips in the  middle of Europe: flight tickets gone, schedule gone, phone gone, no phone  numbers available, orientation gone. I couldn’t resort to using street maps or  city maps, as I no longer take these things with me when I travel. Thank God  there was still communication from person to person.  However, human communication with its digital shadows is already omni- present today. This also includes the “shadows” of my person in the internet.  I leave a “digital footprint.” This digital footprint may last beyond my death.  My digital shadow could have “eternal life” while I myself am no longer alive,  at least not in this world.  The digital shadow becomes part of human existence.  As  described,  all  machines  and  objects  also  have  their  digital  shadows.  “Smart” clothing will surely become a mass product. And then every garment  will have a digital shadow. The parents of a child could then ask the digital  shadow of the anorak whether the child actually put on the anorak or was just  carrying it over their arm.  Likewise, the digital shadow of a bursting disk7 could be queried to see if a  rupture of this safety ring is imminent, even if this disk is installed at the other  end  of  the  world.  The  supplying  company  will  then  have  all  its  delivered  bursting discs in a worldwide learning community.  In the field of engine maintenance, General Electric has developed a digital  turbine twin that monitors turbine blade wear.8 This is not only useful for the  early detection of engine damage. Through its monitoring, the digital twin  also helps to optimize fuel consumption.  Digital shadows of machines and objects also form a shadow world.  6 Digital  2020  Global  Digital  Overview   January  2020 .  https:  www.slideshare.net DataReportal  digital- 2020-global-digital-overview-january-2020-v01-226017535, accessed in April 2020. 7 Bursting discs are safety devices for containers in order to protect them against overpressure or under- pressure. In the event of a crisis, the bursting disc breaks and permits pressure equalization. 8 Software Meets Physics How Digital Twins Will Improve Enterprise Application. Gartner DataAnalytics  Summit, 04.-06. March 2019, London.   70     K. Henning  However, this does not change the fact that, just like human-to-human  communication, machine-to-machine communication is irreplaceable. This  takes place mechanically, for example, between the components of a gearbox  via the “communication medium” gearwheel. And this gear will remain a gear  and cannot be replaced by an AI machine. Direct machine-to-machine com- munication will therefore be irreplaceable.  In addition to the fact that the intelligence of machines constitutes a com- pletely new era of the relationship between real machines and humans, com- munication  between  digital  shadows  themselves  also  plays  an  important  role among:     the digital shadows of people,    the digital shadows of machines, and    the digital shadows of people and machines.  The omnipresent and unobtrusive interaction between the shadows of machines,  technologies, and objects will dominate all aspects of communication.  There will be many fields in which a new partnership between people and  machines will show positive outcomes. Sometimes humans can do it better,  sometimes the machine can, sometimes working together is best. This combi- nation of humans and machines can lead to a “centauric intelligence.” Such  an intelligence consists of an almost endless combination of human work and  the work of intelligent machines. Anything that an intelligent machine or an  intelligent object can do better than us humans, the machine should do. A  good example of this is the “WALK AGAIN Center” in Berlin, where patients  with serious accident damage learn to walk again  Weidner et al., 2018 .  Many objects will gradually become intelligent and enter a lifelong learn- ing process with themselves, with their “technical neighbors” and with people. Some things—especially when it comes to strong forms of creativity, emo- tions, reflection, thinking about God and the world—will surely remain fields  where we  hopefully  remain superior.  To think, design, build, and above all test this hybrid intelligence and part- nership must be the task of the next-decades, so that technical developments  do not overrun us in a direction we do not want  Tegmark, 2017 .   8  The Digital System Landscape  Contents Augmented Reality, Blockchain, Bitcoins, and Voice Machines  Wires, Cables, Radio Masts, and Satellites  Security and Privacy?  The Emerging Second Internet  Digital Platforms     72   74   75   76   77  The globally branched network has created a digital system landscape consist- ing of three separate aspects:     Intelligence comes into all objects of this world.    The physical and digital worlds are closely and comprehensively interlinked.    However, this only works if there is an appropriate digital infrastructure   underneath.  Let us call the use of artificial intelligence in objects our first layer. We have  already seen in many examples how intelligence comes into the objects of this  world. This is manifested in the apps we might find on smartphones and note- books, but also in objects themselves.  Intelligent apps and objects will be everywhere.

Henning  Did you like it?  And I answer:  Yeah, but I’d like it a little sweeter and with passion fruit flavor.  That’s no problem - I can order you a bottle a little sweeter by tomorrow. No,  only until the day after tomorrow, because I just realized that we’ve never made  the taste of passion fruit before. But within 48 hours, you’ll have the passion  fruit bottle here.  Companies are already in the process of transferring the idea of “one-piece  flow” from industrial manufacturing to consumer goods and are transforming  their entire IT structures, bottling plants, and production facilities to make  this possible.  In the services sector, many of these links are already standard. For exam- ple, automatic survey via text message often says: “Were you satisfied with  your pizza order?” or “Were you satisfied with the WhatsApp call quality?”  The  linkage  between  the  physical  and  digital  worlds  is  still  subject  to  bottlenecks.   Augmented Reality, Blockchain, Bitcoins,  and Voice Machines  The second layer deals with the basic structures that link the real and the digi- tal world. The principle of digital shadows  digital twins  has already been  discussed in detail.  In addition, there is technology that encompasses virtual and augmented  reality. For example, you can finally loosen screws in hidden places in the  engine compartment, because with virtual glasses you can see both your own  hand with the real screwdriver and the target position of the digital shadow of  the screwdriver. And when I have finished with the first screw, the virtual  screwdriver already moves to where the next screw is, so I know where to work  with the real screwdriver.   8  The Digital System Landscape   73  This second layer includes technologies such as blockchain,1 which enables  a worldwide chain of custody to be established for data. The trick is to store  information about all data transactions in as many nodal points as possible  worldwide, and with those data points also the entire history of the creation  of this data. None of these transactions can be changed later in time because  they are registered in all nodes. If you want to change a transaction of the past  at  a  certain  node,  i.e.  manipulate  it,  all  other  nodes  will  get  notified  of  a  potential fraud. The attempt to falsify the past will fail. The whole thing is a  kind of eternal memory, as the history of any transaction is distributed across  a wide variety of locations, rendering it far more resilient over time. If some- one makes a new transaction, all existing nodes must agree by verifying the  history of the prior transactions. The moral principle of this security concept  is Whoever lies once, gets fired. The central advantage and at the same time  the central risk of blockchain lies in the fact that—due to the inherent falsifi- cation protection—a trustworthy intermediary partner is no longer required  for transactions.  The possible applications of blockchain are enormous. The best-known is  perhaps Bitcoin, an online form of money called a “cryptocurrency.” It is an  alternative to “normal” money, despite all the risks that come with a new,  uncontrolled financial system. The Bitcoin system does have wide fluctuations  in value. However, compared to some countries with extremely high inflation,  it is a comparatively secure currency. In addition, Bitcoin has become a com- mon means of payment on the so-called dark web where criminals use it as an  untraceable form of payment to hide their activities from authorities.  Blockchain technology leads to a new security concept for global transactions in  goods, services, and money.  The way we talk with our digital partners is another important element of  this digital system landscape. Everybody is familiar with how annoying it can  be to use automatic speech recognition and speech machines. Again, we don’t  need digital fools, we need intelligent devices.  But there is a problem if speech machines are designed as AI systems as  these, AI systems will also need their own consciousness. The ability to speak  in dialogue is anything but trivial.  1 Rob Marvin: Blockchain: The Invisible Technology That’s Changing the World. https:  au.pcmag.com  features 46389 blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-worldverlag.de index.php atp_ edition article view 2352, accessed in April 2020.   74     K. Henning  For this purpose, two AI systems were developed at one of the large internet  companies, which were to be taught to speak in proper dialogue with each  other. Both systems did exactly that, but not as the developers had hoped. The  developers suddenly discovered that the two AI machines had developed a  syntax, i.e. a grammar, and were busily exchanging the corresponding charac- ter sets. Every language has both syntax and semantics. The semantics include  an understanding and an agreement over the meaning of the syntax.  And that exactly turned out to be the problem: The developers couldn’t  determine whether there were semantics behind the syntax. It could also have  been that the two AI machines simply exchanged character sets. But the sci- entists became increasingly suspicious that there were actual semantics behind  it, which the developers did not understand. Possibly, the two machines had  developed  their  own  language,  but  with  the  disadvantage  that  the  outside  world could not understand them.  What to do? The developers decided to shut down the two AI machines  because the actual goal of developing a human-like language had been missed.  So, once again “death penalty” for AI machines that did something the inven- tors did not want. The “mistake” of the developers was that at the “birth” of  the two AI machines they had forgotten to set a rule as a “law”: You can’t  develop your own language. Or: Each new language must include an auto- matic translator. Or: Speaking in a language that is not understandable to the  real world is forbidden.  Even more fundamental than how individual applications work, of course,  is the digital infrastructure upon which they operate. This is the third layer. It  provides the technology on which all these services, apps, and communication  channels can run.   Wires, Cables, Radio Masts, and Satellites  First, a powerful physical structure via wire- and cable-connected communi- cation  is  required.  The  progress  in  these  areas  is  enormous  and  an  end  to  development is not yet in sight.  If the digital infrastructure is insufficient, nothing works.  Just 40 years ago, the two thin wires of a telephone line were only good for  making phone calls. At our Swiss house, in the 90s, such a two-wire line fed    8  The Digital System Landscape   75  into the house via telephone poles. I was proud at the time that these two  wires could also establish a fax connection that could be used to send written  pages. Today, using the same two thin wires and modern DSL technology, not  only  the  telephone  but  also  high-speed  internet  via  Wi-Fi  router  can  be  accessed by a large number of users. In addition to over 100 television pro- grams. All of this with just two copper wires.  Of course, this connectivity will enter a new dimension with the imple- mentation of fiber optic cables. However, it is obvious that the existing basic  technologies—such  as  the  technologies  that  run  over  two-wire  lines—are  growing  at  least  as  fast  as  new  technologies  with  a  more  powerful  basic  structure.  The same happens with wireless communication. In the already mentioned  house in the Swiss mountains, in 1990, I was glad that I could drive two miles  up to 3000 ft. with my mobile phone  one of the first in the D1 network   from where you could see into the valley and establish a connection. Down in  this valley, there was even a radio tower. Today, I can save the two-mile hike  and find four different providers on my smartphone, which I can use in almost  every part of the valley up to 6000 ft. And the GPS system on my smartphone  knows where I am. The upcoming 5G technology will take data and device  connectivity  to  a  new  level.  Additionally,  quantum  computing  capabilities  will open up new dimensions in the use of AI systems.2   Security and Privacy?  Many families now share their locations with each other and can follow where  everyone is, for example, when they travel to foreign countries. This has the  disadvantage that this data—at least with current technologies—is available  to people who maybe should not have it. But:  Usually, usefulness and convenience prevail over the need for data protection.  The related question of security is another crucial dimension of the digital   infrastructure.  2 Sabina Jeschke: 3 Shadoes of AI – 5G and Quantum Computing setting the stage for next generation  AI. Inaugural Lecture at the Technical University of Berlin  22.01.2020 .

Henning  Do I use the public internet or my own protected Global Area Network?  How do I build suitable security architectures? What does the blueprint of  software  systems  that  already  generate  safety  through  their  own  structure  look like?  What happens when a new generation of computers appears, the so-called  quantum computers? Theoretically, all existing passwords could be cracked in  the blink of an eye. At the same time, those quantum computers would gain  a monopoly in the market for secure passwords.  If we put all our data in the cloud: Where is the data physically located?  Who has the power of access in the event of conflict between countries and  companies? What is legally understood by data? What does a security struc- ture of the data centers look like  meaning the physical form of such facilities ? We will need a new culture of borders. But this will no longer refer to the  “old” typologies of borders. We will need to rediscover the value of a border is  a central necessity. We need to redefine the balance between openness to the  world, privacy, and regional security.  The question of borders is not being resolved by the digital age. But there will  be borders of a different kind.  The digital infrastructure of today’s internet has a fundamental problem.  It’s not real time. The time it takes to transmit messages and data is far too  long and there is no precise timing cycle. But that’s what you need for real-  time AI systems. This is no problem yet for a hard-wired robot team on the  manufacturing floor. But if this is to be done with wireless satellite communi- cation, it becomes a problem.   The Emerging Second Internet  In fact, a second internet is emerging, which is especially designed for real-  time applications. “Near Orbit Satellites” are intended to solve the problem.  Such microsatellites generally weigh around 150 pounds, consume no more  than 50 W, and are currently about half a cubic meter in volume. So, a rela- tively small box circles the earth in less than 100 min at a distance of about  380 miles. This sphere is called the LEO region  Low Earth Orbit . So far,  similar satellites have only been used for special missions, such as polar explo- ration or the identification of space junk. Many countries on earth are active  in the development of such microsatellites.   8  The Digital System Landscape   77  The new internet is supposed to consist of several hundreds of such satel- lites, which will form a complete network above the earth. Several launch  vehicles will each fire 10–20 into space. The delays of the signal times will  then be so short that real-time data communication with intelligent objects  on earth becomes possible.  This could then be used to control heating systems or track the switches of   rail networks or entire transport chains in real time.  Small  Near  Orbit  satellites  will  enable  a  real-time  internet  for  the  intelligent  objects of this world.  Now, this is no longer a dream of the future, because China—alongside  Canada  2020 —is heavily involved in this development with the aim of link- ing logistical systems across their huge countries. But with access to the satel- lites, one can also tap into data of the whole world as these satellites do not  stand “stationary” in the sky but circle around the earth within just a few  minutes. It is no surprise that China is also interested in Europe.  Such minisatellites will become even smaller and more efficient in terms of  size and energy consumption. Then they could also be installed as a “mini-  satellite” in cars. This would provide a counterpart on earth to the microsatel- lites  in  space,  i.e.  a  second  real-time  network.  This  development  is  also  progressing at full speed.  There is no doubt that the dramatic development of intelligent objects will  take on another dimension. All these objects will be connected to each other  accurately and to the second in a new real-time internet. We are only at the  very beginning and will likely consider it normal in another 30 years.   Digital Platforms  The  networked  basic  technologies  are  transformed  into  a  variety  of  digital  platforms that can be used to collect data and make it available. For each  topic, based on the physical building blocks of the digital infrastructure, a  digital user platform can then be set up without great effort. These platforms  are the real revolution of business models. They enable the use of AI machines  in a worldwide context in all specific application areas of the world economy   see Chap. 9 .   78     K. Henning  Worldwide digital infrastructure networks enable digital platforms. Those who  are not linked to the platforms of this world that are relevant to them will be  left behind by those who use them.  Let’s be clear about this: Intelligence will be everywhere in the apps and objects of this world. Physical and digital worlds will be increasingly linked via digital shadows    digital twins , virtual and augmented reality, and near orbit satellites.  But everything will depend on the underlying digital infrastructure that  makes it all possible. Digital platforms will play a decisive role here because  they will also create supranational power structures and spheres of influence. Based on this overview of the technical dimensions of a digital system land- scape, we can now take a look at what business models of the future will look  like and how our work will change.   9  On the Way to New Business Models  Contents New Business Models for Taxis and Hotels  Traditional Business on New Paths  Outsiders Penetrate Traditional Industries  Frontrunner in the Machinery and Plant Industry     80   81   82   83  The new possibilities of connecting all processes of life and work in a digital  shadow world have a massive influence on the way people trade with each  other and exchange goods. The key is digital platforms, a kind of marketplace  for goods and services. As in real life, there are small and large marketplaces,  ranging from a single market stall to an entire department store. Finally, this  leads  to  global  platforms  such  as  Amazon  or  Alibaba,  where  you  can  buy  almost anything from any location.  An American colleague who has moved to Germany has kept his American  credit card and with that he pays all his private house management. He even  orders the plumber for the repair of a defective faucet in his house in Germany  on the American Amazon platform and receives a binding delivery time—as  with the parcel service—for when the installer will show up to repair the fau- cet. Of course, the plumber lives only a few miles away from the faulty tap.  The new business models all use digital platforms in some way. These plat- forms follow the same principles as a modern factory: processes, data, produc- tion systems, and human work are closely linked to their digital shadows.

Henning  link will now be extended to all processes, data, vehicles, packages, and other  relevant items up to the customer.  Whoever masters the platforms makes the deal.  Digital business does not only enable commercial relationships for digital  products and services. Crucially, you can “attach” any “normal business pro- cess” to such a platform. This is where it gets exciting.   New Business Models for Taxis and Hotels  The world’s largest taxi company does not have its own taxis or drivers. You  could call it a government of tens of thousands of vehicles and drivers who  receive  their  assignments  worldwide  through  customer  orders  on  a  digital  platform. Conventional national and regional taxi associations reacted far too  late.  Although,  some  countries  simply  prohibited  the  platform  –  either  to  protect  traditional  taxi  drivers  or  for  ethical  reasons  regarding  minimum  wages and working conditions.  Nevertheless, at many airports I can use my smartphone to compare real-  time prices charged by Uber versus what a local official taxi company offers.  Without such platform-enabled technologies, it is no longer nearly as lucra- tive to operate a taxi company as it was in the past.  This also means that the customer increasingly expects that after ordering a  taxi they can immediately see on their smartphone where the assigned taxi is,  what the license plate is, and when it will arrive.  Once, while waiting for a cab, I noticed that the given time of arrival of a  taxi was not becoming shorter; the taxi was at a certain place and did not  move. Via Google Maps, I found out that at this exact spot there was a café.  The taxi driver had obviously treated himself to a cup of coffee, although he  had accepted the trip. I challenged him after his late arrival by confronting  him with the fact that he had obviously taken a break in Café X. It was true. You  would  think  that  the  digital  shadows  make  it  much  harder  to  lie   because everything becomes much more transparent. But do we want that?  The situation is no different with the major hotel chains. The world’s largest  provider of overnight accommodation, Airbnb, has no hotels of its own. At  the same time, with enormous profit margins, this company has won over  millions  of  people  around  the  world  to  open  their  homes  to  guests.  A    9  On the Way to New Business Models   81  completely new market for overnight stays emerged. For many people this has  opened up new sources of income. It has also brought people closer together  in a global context. Competitive platforms for special groups of consumers  shoot out of the ground. It is a single success story up to a contribution to  international understanding across culture. At the same time, however, living  space is being misused worldwide.   Traditional Business on New Paths  But again: Do we want this transparency, which leads to the possibility that  the data related to all my movements across the world become more or less  publicly available?  Normally,  the  platform  company  does  not  have  special  know-how  about  the  object of trade. It only establishes the connection to the customer.  It is only logical that the world’s largest online retailer1 Amazon has almost  no  stores  of  its  own,  but  only  a  number  of  large  logistical  nodes.  Behind  Amazon, with over 232 billion dollars in sales in 2018 ranks Apple. However,  Apple  operates  its  own  shops  in  the  core  segment  of  smartphones.  The  American group Walmart, which is third in the world, also operates its own  stores down to the retail level. The formerly classic German mail order com- pany Otto, which ranked fourth in 2020, shows that German companies can  also play their part in the online retailer market.  It is possible to link the traditional business with new business models.  The ability to display business via digital platforms is also a trend-setting   option for medium-sized companies.  Every boutique, no matter how small, will not survive long without an  additional online shop. This also applies to the crafts. For example, a violin  maker  from  Germany  contacted  one  of  the  platform  operators  and  asked  them to take care of sales. The owner has thought about which violins he  would like to build and in what quantity and the platform partner has taken   1 Ten of the day  o.V. : The 10 largest online shops in the world. https:  www.tenoftheday.de die- 10-  groessten-online-shops-der-welt , accessed in April 2020.   82     K. Henning  care of the distribution very cost-effectively. The outcome is that the small  violin maker has gained planning security and has become known worldwide.   Outsiders Penetrate Traditional Industries  But it also shows that an outsider can penetrate large, high-performance, and  traditional industries. Outsiders are able to quickly and seriously turn the old  market structures upside down. Who would have thought that an American  search engine company named Google would suddenly develop an autono- mously driving vehicle? They used German suppliers for this purpose and got  suitable engineers from Germany.  But what does this have to do with platform technology? Such vehicles are  linked with each other. Each vehicle is constantly learning from the others.  Together, these fully automatic vehicles learn about every driving situation of  every vehicle. Just like the AlphaGo machine defeated human players with  this strategy. The car is the “minor matter” here. First and foremost, this is a  large platform via which many self-driving cars constantly learning from each  other  Heide & Henning, 2006 .  Of course, the question arises what the identity of future car manufacturers  will look like. Is the car still the object of the company at all? Superficially, yes.  But the ability to sell cars will largely depend on how they are seen in the digi- tal world. There are several options and not one solution.  For example, a car company could opt for the identity of “providing mobil- ity.”  The  wording  already  suggests  that  this  concept  perhaps  also  includes  bicycles, electric scooters, and air taxis. And indeed, some manufacturers are  testing fully electric air taxis with and without pilots. Airbus is even thinking  about a self-propelled car drone, i.e. a vehicle that operates as a driverless car  and also as a drone.2 One is reminded of a movie from the 1950s where a  Volkswagen car could fly—the “Fliwatüüt.”3  A second possibility would be for a car company to position itself as a data  giant.  The  possibility  to  record  the  routes  of  the  millions  of  vehicles  sold  would put the company is a very privileged situation. It would know all the  distances  travelled  by  customers  during  the  life  of  their  vehicle.  The  data  obtained could be of much more valuable than the cars sold. The sale of cars   2 Air taxi of the future?

The procurement of data becomes the  major business.  A third possibility would be the guiding principle “Enabling people’s life- style and individuality.” The consequences of a model that goes in this direc- tion can be seen in the case of a Northern European car manufacturer. The  Volvo 360c study4 presents a vehicle that is intended as a substitute for flying  over short distances of up to 500 miles. This car design allows me to get into  a fully automatic car in the evening where dinner is prepared. Then, I can  watch TV and go to sleep. The next morning, breakfast gets delivered to my  car  near  the  destination.  Finally,  the  vehicle  drives  me  to  my  destination,  drops me off, and looks for a parking space.  These examples illustrate how digital platform technology can be used for  intelligent objects and machines. It is remarkable that companies at the fore- front of this development are joined by traditional companies that one would  not expect there at first glance.  For example, there is a medium-sized family business that deals with equip- ment used for gripping, clamping, turning, and dosing in industrial produc- tion. You could also buy a welding tong from the same company. With over  1000 employees, the company is among the best in the world in preventive  maintenance and demand forecasting. For example, if there is an indication of  a malfunction, the information is sent from the cloud storage to the compa- ny’s own control system, which evaluates it and passes it on to the company’s  service experts in the event of an incident. The specialists are notified by text  message  and  receive  the  information  on  their  mobile  phone,  tablet,  or  computer.   Frontrunner in the Machinery and Plant Industry  At another company, which manufactures escalators, service technicians have  a so-called digital toolbox on their smartphones, as well as maps and plans  with 24 7 access. The technicians receive real-time information on the health  status of all their associated systems. The customer also has access to this data.  For example, if an escalator fails, the supplier’s app immediately sends an alert  to the customer and even informs them if there is already a technician on  the way.  4 Volvo  360c  -  when  the  car  turns  into  a  bedroom.  https:  www.theverge.com 2018 9 5 17822398  volvos- 360c-concept-autonomous-car-electric-future, accessed in April 2020.   84    K. Henning  It is becoming increasingly evident to what extent these technologies inter- fere with existing workplace structures. For the customer, the constant avail- ability of data and information provides a great advantage and a high value,  with the added benefit that digital networks and AI machines do not need  time off.  But what happens to the working rhythm of humans? What happens to  human work over the course of this development? Are we about to abolish  human labor?   10  Artificial Intelligence Is a Gamechanger   of All Jobs  Contents  Areas of Tension   How Fast Will All of This Go?   But What Happens to the Workplaces?     85   88   88  As with all innovation cycles, digital transformation with intelligent machines  and objects also leads to massive changes in the working environment. Are we  going to run out of human labor? Or is it just changing massively?   Areas of Tension  First, we want to consider some unsolvable areas of tension, namely     between nations and cultures,    between people and new technologies,    between the different scientific disciplines,    between virtuality and reality, and    between people and objects with their own consciousness.  The former three have always been inextricable areas of tension that must  be reinterpreted in the context of digital transformation with artificial intel- ligence. The latter two are new areas of tension previously unfamiliar to us in  the history of mankind.

Henning, Gamechanger AI, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-3-030-52897-3_10  85   86    K. Henning  Driven by the possibilities of digital networks and the interconnection of  events  around  the  world,  more  and  more  multinational  organizations  are  emerging, and there are more and more companies that are quite small but do  business on a global level. This trend continues to drive complexity and dyna- mism worldwide.  For example, small aid organizations with a dozen employees can do a lot  of good around the world. However, digital communication also makes it easy  to establish profitable trafficking organizations for refugees. This dichotomy  played  out  on  a  global  scale  will  irreversibly  influence  working  and  living  conditions.  Increasingly, national identities and cultures are colliding—often without  restraint. Conversely, the often unfulfilled need for purely national identity  and the need for home and belonging are growing rapidly within a manage- able framework.  We will have to learn to perceive, endure, and steer these contrasts between   global freedom and the narrowness of cultures and nations worldwide.  The potential for tension between nations and cultures is getting bigger and  bigger and is irresolvable.  The well-worn tensions between people and new technologies remain fun- damentally  unchanged.  However,  we  as  societies  have  still  not  understood  how to overcome the phase of infatuation with new technologies more quickly  and how to become realistic.  The transition to alternative energy supplies is not doable as fast as the ide- alists among us imagine. And the new design of a combine harvester under  the influence of digitalization will take 8 years instead of ten.  What has changed is our dependence on technical systems. There will be   fewer and fewer jobs without intelligent technical systems.  The tension between people and technologies remains unchanged—first in love  with new technology, then disillusioned, then realistic.  The areas of conflict between the various scientific disciplines and between  many occupational profiles will increase. Because the great innovations and  new  tasks  arise  precisely  from  the  interaction  between  different  disciplines  and  occupational  groups.  The  resulting  new  “subjects”  and  the  new  job    10  Artificial Intelligence Is a Gamechanger of All Jobs   87  profiles associated with them can no longer be fitted into the old “boxes” and  drawers of the existing disciplines.  This  is  inconvenient,  but  an  unavoidable  consequence  of  the  massively  increased complexity and dynamics enabled by digital transformation. As a  result, vocational training and university degrees will be adapted more quickly  and more often to the requirements of the future work environment and the  resulting occupational profiles.  The new is emerging between the different scientific disciplines.  For example, a specialist in preventive maintenance must have skills in not  just  software  development,  but  in  robot  technology,  control  engineering,  ergonomics, psychology, and law. This applies regardless of whether they work  as an engineer or as a technician.  Completely new job profiles will also be required for this digital transfor- mation.  For  example,  managers  of  the  digital  transformation  are  needed.  These  also  have  to  bring  competences  from  many  disciplines—leadership  competence, computer science, law, and mechatronics. And they must be able  to think and act strategically.  The omnipresent and unobtrusive presence of digital shadows, video worlds  of the real and simulated world, and the online gaming world in which today’s  young  generation  grows  up,  creates  a  new  understanding  of  reality.  It  is  becoming  increasingly  difficult  to  distinguish  between  reality  and  its  simulation.  If I wear glasses for “augmented reality,” is the simulated screwdriver the  relevant reality because it determines and guides my actions? Or is it still my  own hand that I perceive while my hand is holding a real screwdriver? Such  augmented reality workplaces will enable attractive novel workplace structures.  The  tension  between  the  virtual  and  reality  creates  a  new  understanding  of  reality.  The biggest new area of tension is the fact that new objects with their own  consciousness populate this planet. This new omnipresent identity of intelli- gent counterparts in the internet in the form of real objects will probably have  the most impact in changing future working environments. We have already  considered in detail how a new understanding of partnership—a hybrid intel- ligence—can develop between people and the new AI objects with their own  consciousness.   88     K. Henning   How Fast Will All of This Go?  Relevant studies show that AI systems in all their forms are already in use, at  least in industrial application. While systems with weak artificial intelligence,  such as rule-based systems, are already the norm, AI systems with strong arti- ficial intelligence  teach-in combined with reinforcement learning  are still  rare. However, reasonable forecasts assume that by 2035, systems of strong  artificial intelligence with a high degree of maturity and diffusion will have  been introduced.1  Both the degree of maturity and penetration of artificial intelligence systems  will increase dramatically until 2035, i.e. in the next 15 years.  A significant level of awareness of such systems will be reached. If all these  intelligent objects begin to think together worldwide, the first forms of global  consciousness in a network of AI machines are conceivable. There’s not much  time between now and then.   But What Happens to the Workplaces?  Entire professions will disappear, but completely new ones will also emerge— at all levels of competence.  First, simple office jobs are under massive pressure because many activities  related to the aggregation of data and figures will be eliminated. This will have  a dramatic effect on banks, for example. At the same time, the demand for  employees who can interpret, evaluate, and comment on the data, numerical  evaluations, and documents produced by AI systems will increase.  But highly qualified jobs are also affected in some fields. For a few years now,  it has been easier to diagnose skin cancer with an analysis by an AI system  than by laboratories and doctors.2 With a simple app everyone is now able to  do it themselves with their smartphones, at least as a solid pre-check.3 The  same applies to the work of document preparation at notaries’ offices or con- sulting firms, tasked with the evaluation of data.  1 Internal study of the Cybernetics Lab of RWTH Aachen University, 2015. 2 Asley Welch: AI better than dermatologists at detecting skin cancer, study finds. https:  www.cbsnews. com news ai-better-than-dermatologists-at-detecting-skin-cancer-study-finds , accessed in April 2020. 3 Amanda Capritto: four ways to check for skin cancer with your smartphone  Jan, 1st, 2020 . https:   www.cnet.com how-to how-to-use-your-smartphone-to-detect-skin-cancer , accessed in April 2020.   10  Artificial Intelligence Is a Gamechanger of All Jobs   89  Platform technologies will assume complex administrative tasks. For exam- ple, many operational controlling tasks can be taken over by AI technologies  that use such platform technologies to collect, evaluate, and summarize data  into written reports, similar to parts of a report from an auditing company.  The jobs of workers in logistics and production will change massively. Many  will be eliminated in certain areas—just think of small fully automatic buses  in cities replacing bus drivers. But many new activities and job profiles around  maintenance, repair, and monitoring of such systems will emerge. Engineers  and technicians as “technical doctors” will be sought after on a massive scale  and are already in short supply worldwide.  Social robots will find their way into healthcare and the household. They will  be able to perform complex tasks such as transporting food in hospitals or as  exoskeletons for patients who cannot go to the restroom unaided. Nurses will  have support robots to lift patients and psychiatric patients will have digital  partners for behavioral control and therapy. This can significantly reduce the  number of closed stations in mental institutions. Will we use these opportuni- ties and create more space for person-to-person communication between the  sick and those who treat them?  Finally,  the  virtual  and  extended  environments  enable  the  seamless  involvement of people over long distances. You can physically be in Europe  or  the  Americas  and  still  virtually  participate  in  the  commissioning  of  a  plant in China. Via robot technology human presence is also possible in  rooms that normally cannot be entered by humans, such as buildings con- taminated by high level of radioactivity. A wealth of new fields of work are  emerging.  All  workplaces  will  be  affected  by  the  digital  transformation  through  AI  sys- tems.  Working  conditions  will  change:  Information  and  data  are  available  everywhere  and  at  any  time—even  while  protecting  business  and  private  interests.  As a result, it is no longer necessary for an employee to be physically present  at a certain location at a certain time in order to obtain data and information. Around an individual person, the number of interlinked objects and the  amount of data available are growing very strongly. Likewise, the number of  stationary and mobile objects with a digital shadow surrounding people is also  increasing rapidly.  All this will dramatically change working models. New forms of “collective  labor agreements” will emerge that go far beyond the standard nine-to-five job    90    K. Henning  or shift work, including home office agreements. Over the past few years, we  already see a significant increase in part-time jobs, while simultaneously the  number of parallel employment contracts or service agreements related to a  single person is growing.  The possibilities for human self-determination are thus growing consider- ably. However, so does the personal responsibility of the human being as well.   11  Everything Is Linked to Everything   and Becomes Transparent  Contents AI Is Used Everywhere in the Product Development Process  Logistics as a Service  Smartphones Are Becoming Hotspots in the Service Industry     92   95   96  When everything is linked to everything else, the value chains also become  transparent. Let’s consider the consequences from three possible angles:1     Transparency in the product development process,    Transparency in logistics,    Transparency in services.  First, transparency is a good thing because it allows processes to be tracked  more closely. Moreover, it allows an up-to-date description of the state of a  product at any time during the product development process, a logistical pro- cess, and a service.  Everything grows together as in a biological structure, where every pain,  every movement, every feeling are known to the whole body and not only to  a certain part. And usually, a body reacts systemically. The entire body poten- tially reacts to an event at a specific part of the body.  1 https:  henning4future.com wp-content uploads 2020 04 article-How-AI-changes-the-world.pdf,  accessed in April 2020.

Henning  However, when thinking about the value chains of our economic coexis- tence,  it  is  precisely  this  transparency  that  can  become  problematic.  Who  ends  up  having  the  power  along  the  value  chain?  How  are  control  and  decision- making powers distributed? Does the customer have all the power?  Or central data giants?   AI Is Used Everywhere in the Product  Development Process  Let us first take a look at the product development process: In the field of  planning and development, hybrid intelligence between humans and intelli- gent machines will play a main role.  In the case of large urban development projects, it could be a good idea to  use an automatic planning machine with artificial intelligence in parallel to  the working group on this topic. Perhaps this machine could be more objec- tive and play a role as a neutral mediator between different interest groups,  processing all available data.  Another aspect is integrated planning, in which real and simulated worlds   flow together.  In this way, every stage of the planning of a residential building can be  represented realistically in the virtual world. You can walk in virtual “cages”  and holodecks2 through buildings that do not yet exist.  Moreover, this technology can also be transferred to the construction pro- cess, so that the site manager can follow the construction progress in detail in  the virtual world.  In  planning  and  development,  AI  machines  also  offer  the  possibility  of  efficient backward learning based on experiences with earlier products, plants,  or structures.  Any  breakdown  events  that  occur  worldwide,  for  example,  to  a  certain  crane system can be simulated virtually if the crane system is equipped to  assess its own condition via a digital shadow. In this way, questions such as  overload or design errors can be answered transparently. In the latter case, it  would then be a case for the development department to learn creatively from  the mistakes of the past.  The entire chain from development to maintenance becomes intelligent.  2 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Holodeck, accessed in April 2020.   11  Everything Is Linked to Everything and Becomes Transparent   93  In  production,  the  decisive  change  will  be  that  every  step  in  a  factory  assembly line can be displayed as a point in space. If humans wear data suits  and machines are equipped with appropriate sensors, robots and humans can  move in the same space with far more freedom than at present.  A decentralized, flexible, and non-hierarchically controlled distribution of  tasks can take place. For example, AI machines can make proposals for adap- tive machine control that can be negotiated between machines and humans.  We have seen that in the case of the knitting machine equipped with democ- ratized control.  In production, a new distribution of tasks and control philosophy are created.  The  working  process  for  humans  can  also  be  reimagined,  among  other  things  with  the  help  of  exoskeletons  that  are  integrated  into  work  suits.  Already  today,  aerospace  factories  in  Germany  have  such  power-enhanced  workwear for overhead work. In test laboratories these support systems are  now being equipped with intelligent systems that do not replace human per- formance, but rather, depending on the daily performance and fatigue level of  the worker, either increase strength or correct movement.  In  another  area,  the  so-called  ramp-up  processes,  new  approaches  are  emerging. Every series manufacturer fears this phase of the production start-  up in which everything should theoretically be ready, but it is not.  A car manufacturer recently planned 100 functions in a vehicle for the digi- tal  coupling  of  the  vehicle  with  its  environment.  These  functions  concern  both the functions of the vehicle as well as the entertainment of the occupants  of the vehicle. At the start of production, 80 of these had to be abandoned  because they were not yet finished. The other 20 were still causing problems. In such complex ramp-up processes, automated test environments that test  series production in advance as digital shadows are indispensable. It is pre- cisely here that an automated test machine with its own intelligence will lead  to transformational changes in future development.  Ramp-up processes will also become much more efficient with AI systems.  As important as the ramp-up process, are also the expected changes in after-   sales and maintenance.   94     K. Henning  Many existing vehicle control systems monitor the condition of the vehicle  and “detect” faults. They do this to the extent that they report them and, in  the event of serious defects, automatically set the route to the nearest work- shop in the navigation system. If necessary, the vehicle is put into an emer- gency mode in which the non-“vital” systems are switched off.  However, these systems remain rather unsophisticated and lack convenient  ways for drivers to interact with the digital shadows the systems depend on to  function. The system and the user have no true means of communication and  the driver still can’t negotiate with them.  Such systems also make the life cycle of a product transparent. The manu- facturer can “track” all its products at the customer’s site. If the products have  their own intelligence, i.e. if they “carry” their own digital shadow as part of  the product, you don’t need a data interface to the customer for communica- tion. The software agent of the digital shadow can be connected directly to the  company network.  If  the  product  knows  what’s  wrong  with  it,  it  also  knows  when  it  needs  maintenance.  Of course, unresolved legal questions arise on this subject—we will touch   on this later.  However,  for  the  customer,  these  digital  shadows  are  also  an  enormous  advantage. Let us assume that a software-controlled component  for example,  a pump, a valve, or a compressor  comes to a sudden standstill because the  sampling  frequencies  in  the  data  transmission  to  the  main  device  are  dis- turbed and the component therefore no longer functions  Heide, 2004 . The  error can have catastrophic consequences if, for example, it is not possible to  automatically transition the system to a state which prevents the system from  overheating.  Such an alarm could also be applied in a manufacturer’s AI system which  monitors all components delivered and installed worldwide by this company.  This could cover several million installations. Linking all these components  with near orbit satellite technology would not be a problem. That way, the  millions of control components installed would become a worldwide learning  community. The central AI system could then develop a new software update  in hybrid intelligence with the human software developers. Of course, this  would not be applied to the millions of components all at once. It would first    11  Everything Is Linked to Everything and Becomes Transparent   95  be field tested with several hundred components before new software updates  get rolled out worldwide.  The possibilities for companies to establish themselves in the worldwide market  with AI-supported special solutions are almost unlimited.   Logistics as a Service  The  consequences  for  logistics  are  similar  to  those  in  production.  These  approaches are traded under the term “Logistics as a Service”  LaaS . Behind  this are platform technologies that make it possible for every activity in the  supply chain  from disposition to delivery, status during transport, expected  delivery time  to become completely transparent.  The customer becomes more powerful. Even more so as the generation that  has  grown  up  in  the  digital  world  knows  the  internet  only  for  ordering  processes.  The  so-called  B2B  business3—the  business  relationship  between  several  companies that transport products—is increasingly moving in the direction  of B2C business, i.e. a direct business relationship between manufacturer and  end customer. At the same time, platform providers such as Uber,4 Airbnb,  and Booking.com are very successful. When ordering a car, I can simply type  into the app which features and what features I want, and I get offered a car  via the respective web platform, independent of the provider. Such platforms  are increasingly taking on the role of direct contact with the end customer. As  a result, the provider loses contact with the customer.  In logistics, the direct worldwide tracking of all processes by the customer is  possible. Intermediary trade is being hit by AI systems.  This approach is also increasingly unsettling car dealers as the first manu- facturers have started selling their cars via various forms of direct networks.  The middleman, the dealership, is left out of these new relationships.  3 B2B stands for “Business to Business” and B2C for “Business to Customer”. 4 Volvo wins major order for robotics from Uber. Between 2019 and 2021, the Swedish manufacturer will  sell up to 24,000 cars to the driving service provider Uber, which are designed for autonomous driving.  https:  www.nzz.ch mobilitaet auto-mobil volvo-erhaelt-grossauftrag-fuer-robotaxis-von-uber-  ld.1330412, accessed in April 2020.   96     K. Henning  Dedicated, customer-oriented communication remains an important aspect  of purchasing, while traditional corporate communication is losing importance.  On the other hand, trusting communication becomes vital as the boundaries  between marketing, sales, and customer service become increasingly blurred.  Of course, not everything is available via the internet. But a lot of things  are. It is no longer a dream of the future that I order a new faucet online and  instead of a direct delivery, I receive the data I need so that I can have the  faucet 3D printed in my workshop. 3D printing is a technique that allows to  print three-dimensional layers of a polymeric material—a malleable paste— layer by layer. Like a copy machine, but for spatial objects. This is not a dream  of the future, but the state of the technology today.   Smartphones Are Becoming Hotspots  in the Service Industry  The  services  of  the  future  will  come  out  of  your  pocket.  The  smartphone  becomes the central point of contact for all information. Everything that has  to  do  with  sales,  brokerage,  travel  agencies,  tourist  guidance,  etc.  loses  its  monopolistic significance. Customers with smartphone access are often much  better informed than employees in the offices of traditional service compa- nies. They are increasingly losing their business models.  The experts are losing their information power.  This also turns the insurance business upside down. Insurance “on demand”  is booming. Let’s imagine I just want to insure a three-day mountain tour  with a mountain guide. No problem—this is solved within 5 min online. I  want to insure against missing my flight, booked at a “fixed price without  refund”? No problem, that’s only three clicks.  Insurance policies are increasingly being booked “on demand” on the inter- net at very short notice. For the insurance companies themselves, however,  this means that completely new internal processing structures must be cre- ated. And new risk calculations are needed. Entire areas have been eliminated  and new ones have to be created.  A new world of insurance is emerging.   11  Everything Is Linked to Everything and Becomes Transparent   97  Similarly, companies that build radar speed control systems could offer to  carry  out  facial  recognition  themselves  to  match  drivers  to  their  driver’s  license. Seconds later, the traffic ticket could appear in the display of the vehi- cle, which the driver then only has to approve. Just as in the scenario I already  presented in my lectures on cybernetics in 1985.5 In China the recording of  traffic violations by AI systems has been introduced in many cities and is part  of a state-wide point system.  With a final example, I would like to get to the heart of the entire chain of   intelligent links between ordering and use of the goods ordered:  Not many steps are missing until it is possible to order a sports shoe that  has its own identity from the moment of ordering it. After my online order,  the shoe knows who I am, where I live, and what special functionalities it  should have. For example, I could have my pulse or the number of steps or the  impact forces of my foot monitored.  The virtual shoe is the digital shadow of the real shoe. Based on my order,  it knows what the real shoe should look like and which mechanical properties  it must have.  The order reaches the factory, where new virtual shoes are constantly arriv- ing through orders that are now finding their way through production with- out central control. Comparable to a flock of 1000 birds all wanting to use a  bird feeder at once. Thus, the virtual shoes will gradually be created from their  real “twins.” To do this, they must coordinate with all other incoming orders  to determine who uses which production step and when. All of this works  without a central control because each virtual shoe has enough intelligence to  coordinate with the other shoes. Just like birds do when they all want to use  one feeder.  Once the real shoe is completed as a twin of the virtual shoe, the real shoe  receives an “embedded intelligence” which contains embedded intelligence  sensor and software agents in the physical shoe. These agents establish contact  between the real shoe and its environment. The real shoe is permanently con- nected to its digital twin, the virtual shoe.  In any case, the real shoe then sets off on its journey, maybe it even gets  lifted fully automatically into the provided truck by AI transport pallet vehi- cles.  This  truck  could  then  drive  fully  automatically  to  its  destination,  for  example, to a logistics hub.  From the logistics hub, the packaged shoe could be flown directly to my   front door with a parcel drone due to its low weight.  5 Henning,  Klaus:  Kybernetische  Verfahren  der  Ingenieurwissenschaften   Cybernetic  Procedures  in  Engineering Sciences . Mainz, Aachen 1986.   98     K. Henning  The customer finally receives both the virtual and the real shoe. They can  then decide whether the virtual shoe remains coupled with the supplier or  whether they want to couple it with their other shoes, with the shoes of other  people, or with an orthopedic doctor who will analyze the collected data.  This scenario has already been implemented in many of its elements. There  is still a lack of consistency throughout the entire value chain. But that’s just  a matter of a few years.  In the future, many products will come to me by themselves.  Services are therefore becoming increasingly complex and diverse to the  benefit of the customer. Many of these service models would be inconceivable  without digital networks and integrated AI processes. Many things are gener- ated fully automatically. This includes trend analyses. It will be easy to see the  best time to visit a gym, supermarket, or restaurant. With one click you can  see the visitor statistics depending on the time.  The entire communication between customer and supplier is increasingly  established via the internet. Customer and supplier no longer need to meet  physically. This makes it even important that a personal conversation is pos- sible if the customer wishes to do so. In the case of complaints and delivery  defects as well as maintenance, direct communication from person to person  must be enabled efficiently.  In summary:  at any time.     Data  and  information  about  everything  are  available  everywhere  and      In order to obtain data and information, a physical presence at a certain   place at a certain time is less and less necessary.     The value chains of product creation, logistics, and services will be perme- ated with intelligent digital shadows in all elements, at all locations, in the  overall processes and in every small detail.     In addition to fully automated communication chains, it is a competitive  advantage if parallel communication channels for direct human-to-human  communication exist as a hybrid intelligence.   12  The Ethical and Legal Implications  Contents The Machine Becomes a Legal Entity  What Ethical Standards Do We Want?     100   102  Digital shadows will permeate to a considerable extent of all value-added pro- cesses of products and services, both large and small. In 15–30 years, these AI  systems will be widespread and highly mature, and will characterize wide areas  of industry, public and private life. This will fundamentally change the way  we think and act. Competence development, educational pathways, legal sys- tems, and public order systems must be rethought. Moral and ethical issues  need to be addressed.  Artificial intelligence will take over many work processes. This also applies   to public administrations, law firms, courts, and notaries.  The creation of new documents from existing ones or the retrieval of judg- ments in connection with a legal problem is no problem for a suitably trained  AI system.  The AI machine will be able to prepare the legal contract document to a wide  variety of cases.  However, the AI system also bears its own responsibility for what it does.

It is no problem for a “dementia robot” to be a meaningful digital shadow  in the spaces of its physical partner. As a robot it will accompany the patient  like a familiar pet and will not become annoyed by having to repeat the same  thing 50 times. Yes, it will also adapt to the patient’s “world view” and modify  its behavior to the degree of dementia, train the patient with questions, but  above  all  ensure  that  the  dwindling  memory  capacity  is  replaced  by  the  machine’s own “brain” where necessary. The demented person thereby experi- ences a kind of expansion of their own brain and can compensate for deficits.  The dementia robot can have a patience that the humans are incapable of.  My late mother-in-law would have used it with enthusiasm. She lived alone  in her house and to fight the progression of dementia she had gotten used to  writing everything on sticky notes and hanging them on the walls. The whole  house was full of notes like “Lock the door tonight.” “I want to call my sister.”  “Is the stove off?” “Did I lock the front door?” It would be easy for an automated  caretaker to manage all these ideas in place of sticky notes. Instead of writing  them down, the caretaker robot could simply listen to what the patient was say- ing—reminding her of certain tasks  like asking if she locked the door  when  appropriate. If necessary, the robot could simply lock the door itself. For tasks  beyond the physical capabilities of the robot, a neighbor could be called to help. However, this raises questions about the “personality” of AI systems and the  responsibility for misconduct and accidents caused by them. Who takes over  liability in the event of a fault?   The Machine Becomes a Legal Entity  In an accident with a fully automatic vehicle of a taxi company, a cyclist was  run over.1 To be on the safe side, the vehicle also had a driver who was sup- posed to monitor the journey. The cyclist died as a result of the accident. In  the court case, the driver was acquitted because the vehicle’s cameras could  prove that the driver had no chance to see the cyclist.  1 Tempe  police  chief  says  early  probe  shows  no  fault  by  Uber.  https:  www.sfchronicle.com business  article Exclusive-Tempe-police-chief-says-early-probe-12765481.php, accessed in April 2020.   12  The Ethical and Legal Implications   101  And the vehicle? Was it a design fault? Perhaps the camera that discovered  the cyclist was not part of the vehicle’s AI system at all, but a “digital fool”  who only takes pictures? In this case it would be a question of producer liabil- ity.  The  general  question  is:  When  is  an  automatic  vehicle  liable  for  its  misconduct?  However, if the camera systems are part of the vehicle’s integral AI system,  which is responsible for all driving situations and driving states, then the vehi- cle must adhere. The AI system needs its own insurance.2 The developer has  no chance to predict all situations in which an intelligent AI machine must  act and determine the expected action. It makes sense for an intelligent AI  machine to think for itself and act on its own responsibility. But it must also  become its own legal entity. It is therefore necessary to redesign legal systems  both nationally and internationally.  Autonomous cars, forklifts, and healthcare robots raise new questions for insur- ance companies, laws, and ethics. Intelligent machines with their own conscious- ness must become their own legal entities accountable to corresponding laws.  This also applies to the much-discussed accident dilemma. The imaginary  accident situation looks like this: A fully AI-controlled autonomous vehicle  finds itself in a critical situation in which it can only decide to hit an 80-year-  old person or a six-year-old child. What should it do?  The crucial thing about this situation is that a human driver is in shock in  such  situations  of  fractions  of  a  second  and  in  most  cases  cannot  be  held  responsible  for  having  run  over  the  child  in  order  to  save  the  80-year-  old person.  In the case of the AI machine, however, the ethical  and legal  question of  the decision arises because the AI system will not be in shock. And if it is  capable of reacting fest enough, then it is also responsible for its decision. But  what ethics and what legal standard do we give the AI machine in its “driving  school”?  There are many ethical and legal questions relating to actions over which the  humans cannot decide because they are incapable of it.  2 Wildemann,  Horst:  The  Limits  of  Artificial  Intelligence.  https:  www.welt.de wirtschaft bilanz arti- cle188571271 Maschinelles-Lernen-Die-Grenzen-kuenstlicher-Intelligenz.html=-  proudly  presents,  accessed in April 2020.   102     K. Henning  The fact that AI systems allow us to observe actions that we as humans are   not able to do has even more far-reaching consequences.  Similar to the problem of non-reproducible weld seams  see Chap. 3 , we  can use AI algorithms to predict impending crimes with a very high probabil- ity in order to carry out preventive burglary diagnostics. However, this raises  the question of whether the intent to commit crime is a punishable offense.  This question has, of course, always played a role in legal assessments. But  the scale and accuracy of such crime prediction reach a completely different  dimension through AI systems. Therefore, the question of preventative police  action must be clarified from a legal point of view.  AI  agents  can  also  be  used  for  preventive  police  operations.  Is  mere  intent  a  punishable offense?  There will be many cases in which it makes sense to use a digital “crime  shadow,” i.e. an AI crime agent, instead of the real police officer or detective.  But this too will have to become a separate legal entity. Here it will come to a  hybrid intelligence of human and AI criminal agents.  These examples make it clear that in the long run there is no way around  the fact that AI algorithms need ethical standards. But these must also be  agreed internationally.   What Ethical Standards Do We Want?  The system of order introduced in China of awarding or subtracting points,  respectively, for either acceptable or unacceptable public behavior, will prob- ably not become the European or American way. But we will certainly have to  fundamentally rethink, for example, the way we monitor traffic.  This topic has been a national topic in Germany since autumn 2018. The  cornerstone paper of the Federal Government on Artificial Intelligence says,  among other things:3,4  3 https:  ec.europa.eu knowledge4policy publication germany-artificial-intelligence-strategy_en,  accessed in April 2020. 4 https:  www.bmwi.de Redaktion EN Pressemitteilungen 2018 20181116-federal-government-  adopts-artificial-intelligence-strategy.html, accessed in April 2020.   12  The Ethical and Legal Implications   103     It is important to promote the responsible and public interest use of artifi- cial  intelligence  in  cooperation  with  science,  industry,  the  state  and  civil society.     We need a Europe and American response to data-based business models.  We need to find new ways to create data-based value that reflects our eco- nomic, moral, and social structure.     The use of artificial intelligence for human beings must be at the center of   attention—at the personal, individual, and social level.     It must be examined whether ethical and legal limits to the use of artificial  intelligence fit and whether the regulatory framework for a high degree of  legal certainty needs to be further developed.  Similarly,  the  American  National  Artificial  Intelligence  Research  and   Development Strategy Plan states, among others  strategies 2–4 :5     The aim is to develop the best methods for collaboration between humans      It is important to understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal   and AI systems.  implications.     Safety and security of AI systems must be ensured by improving explain-  ability, transparency, and trust.  In a report of February 2017, the European Parliament calls for the long-  term “creation of a special legal status for the most autonomous robots as  ‘electric persons’” in order to differentiate them from humans.6  The discussion is in full swing. And that’s a good thing. New legal systems  and new social order systems do not emerge overnight. Like the discussion  about genetic engineering, such process takes time. We still have that time  although not more than 15–30 years.  Under the influence of AI systems with their own consciousness, the political  regulatory systems must be redesigned.  5 The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan: 2019 update. https:   www.whitehouse.gov wp-content uploads 2019 06 National-AI-Research-and-Development-Strategic- Plan-2019-Update-June-2019.pdf, accessed in April 2020. 6 Committee  on  Legal  Affairs  of  the  European  Parliament,  2015 2103 INL    Jan.  27th,  2017 :  Recommendation to the Civil Law Rules on Robotics, Liability, AC to AF. https:  www.politico.eu arti- cle europe-divided-over-robot-ai-artificial-intelligence-personhood , accessed in April 2020.   104    K. Henning  It is only the beginning of the Inverse Gutenberg Revolution. During the  first Gutenberg revolution, some 600 years ago, it took almost 200 years for a  relative stability to reappear in the European system of order after the “revolu- tion of reason.” This time, the effects are global; and the timeline is likely to  be  much  faster.  Back  then,  even  the  30  years  from  the  invention  of  book  printing to general reading ability was still fast enough to seem a serious “dis- ruptive shock” to the status quo.  We will have to develop a new culture of borders. My generation was busy  overcoming  borders  and  abolishing  borders.  Even  the  borders  of  the  Iron  Curtain have fallen, and the Berlin Wall is gone.  However, we notice that the approach of boundlessness is reaching its lim- its. For example, the high global transparency of data has improved commu- nication between people to such an extent that smuggling gangs can optimize  refugee  flows  using  the  internet.  However,  the  best  escape  routes,  border  crossings, and weather data can also be easily determined. Without such net- working through smartphones and social media, the mass flight to Europe in  the years 2014–2016 would not have been possible. The same applies to refu- gee flows from South to North America.  The value of a border for the adequate protection of people and national or  regional identity must be rediscovered. In most areas we do not know yet  what new meaningful boundaries look like in the age of digital transforma- tion with artificial intelligence.  However, if this fails, the number of physical boundaries for the protection  or defense of people worldwide will grow again—and that is certainly not the  appropriate answer to the worldwide transparency of data and processes.  The discussion about the ethical standards for artificial intelligence is in full  swing. Terms like robocalypse make the rounds. There is talk of the curse and  blessing  of  artificial  intelligence.  While  some  plan7  the  robot  factories  in  space, others warn against a totalitarian surveillance state8 and a deadly arms  race with autonomous weapons. But there are also worldwide initiatives that  work  to  ensure  that  artificial  intelligence  serves  the  well-being  of  people   Tegmark, 2017 .  Many questions remain unanswered. What does the legal entity of an arti- ficial intelligence system look like? How can I communicate standards and  values if the influencing factors for such systems are not known? In dealing  with artificial intelligence, we still lack the concepts to regulate it.  7 Space Tango start-up is planning a robot factory in space  2020 . https:  spacetango.com , accessed in  April 2020. 8 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Max_Tegmark, accessed in April 2020.   12  The Ethical and Legal Implications   105  But the current rating system for likes and clicks, in which like-minded  people can win worldwide majorities online in a matter of minutes, is cer- tainly not a forward-looking concept. The science journalist Ranga Yogeshwar9  argues that the resulting “filter bubbles” are poison for a democratic society.  Perhaps the first thing we should remember is the writer and biochemist  Isaac Asimov, who demanded “basic rules” for the use of robots back in 1942   Asimov, 2008 :    1.  A robot shall not  knowingly  injure any human being or  knowingly  allow   any human being to be harmed by inaction.    2.  A robot must obey the commands given to it by a human - unless such a com-  mand would collide with rule one.    3.  A robot must protect its existence if this protection does not collide with rule   one or two.  We should do better than our ancestors in the Gutenberg era. We should design  the process of change triggered by artificial intelligence proactively and keeping  with our social values. Before others do so irresponsibly.  9 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Ranga_Yogeshwar, accessed in April 2020.   13  Guidelines for the Necessary Redesign  of Our Regulatory Systems in Industry   and Society  Contents The Power of Shaping the Future  The Value of Trust  The Value of Agility  The Value of Mindfulness  Integrated Design of Core Processes     108   112   113   115   116  We have now seen the potential opportunities and risks that might arise from  the worldwide use of AI systems with their own consciousness. Most of these  developments are unstoppable, at least as much so as the upheavals in people’s  lives caused by the advent of mass printing 600 years ago.  It’s about regaining the courage to embrace the power of creating and designing.  We have seen that this is a unique opportunity to redesign all aspects of our  private, professional, and social lives from the bottom up. But it can also fail  if  we  take  too  long,  and  the  global  dynamics  are  determined  by  others.  Societies or certain groups of people could approach the question of the use  of  artificial  intelligence  with  a  different  view  of  the  world  and  a  different  understanding of values. It is obvious that artificial intelligence and digital  transformation represent an opportunity that needs to be handled responsi- bly. What are we supposed to do now?

Henning   The Power of Shaping the Future  I recall an interesting interaction I had with a friend of mine who is a 16-year-  old student.1 He was tasked with writing a paper on the neuroevolution of  software programs with artificial intelligence. The paper was due in 3 weeks.  He decided to build a small machine as the basis of his work. He programmed  a small “AlphaGo Zero,”2 a gaming machine solely provided with the rules of  the game that must learn everything else itself. Of course, he equipped his  program with a simple neural net, as you could already find in the textbooks  of 30 years ago.  The  foundation  of  his  program  were  14  individual  virtual  battle  tanks  which entered a competition in pairs, competing to see which of the two were  better at hitting simulated targets. After the first two, the next two took their  shots, then the third pair, etc., so that every tank eventually competes against  each other. After the first round is complete, the next round of learning starts,  we would call this the next “generation” of the learning cycle. While he was  writing  his  paper,  the  small  AI  machine  ran  day  and  night  on  his  laptop,  because although the laptop was powerful, it turned out to be a little over- whelmed by the task.  By the time the student had finished his paper, the learning process of the  AI simulation was advanced enough that it could show results: The simulation  had actually learned to develop itself further, solely by trial and error, i.e. with  reinforcement learning, the reform pedagogical approach.  He also learned that it is crucial to set the right rules at the beginning of the  machine’s  learning  process  and  how  sensitive  the  activation  functions  are.  These are used in the artificial “neurons” to determine which criteria should  be used to align the game with its objectives. For this he applied the principle  of mutation and selection in the program but had to start from scratch several  times. The general conditions were such that the game could not develop, and  for  example,  all  the  tanks  turned  in  circles  and  wouldn’t  do  anything  else  because they were slaved to the initial search function.  We  discussed  this  and  he  said  that  the  reward  functions  for  the  system  would  be  comparable  to  the  ten  commandments  of  the  Bible,  which—as  rules—should guide people in their personal development.  I was amazed. But I was even more amazed when I learned that the com- puter science teacher to whom he had to deliver the work was very skeptical   1 Roth, Lukas: Self-learning algorithms through neuroevolution.

I realized that my friend, the student, became the teacher  of his teacher. This presupposes that the teacher has the insight and willing- ness to recognize his student as a teacher. In this sense, a student also has  creative power in his “profession.”  Where we work and live, we can be “powerful” and shape the future.  It is necessary to understand this so that we do not unconsciously wield  power. My creative power transferred in my profession is my contribution to  the further development of the world—be it the digital transformation, or the  care of a person, or the repair of shoes.  The theologian Romano Guardini says: “The power of creation is a good   gift of God - through it I am a co-creator of this world”  Guardini, 1957 .3  In this sense we could then also say that artificial intelligence is a gift of  God, given that we also exercise the power to create and set the right frame- work conditions.  Artificial intelligence is a gift of God.  The question is whether this still makes sense given the complexity and  dynamism of the world  Henning, 1993 . World development is character- ized by the fact that contradictions are growing  Fig. 13.1 . Our ability to act  has much improved—we understand, and we can do more thanks to techno- logical advancements. At the same time, our ability to perceive is constantly  increasing. We can perceive and observe more and more processes in this world. The perceptual space, i.e. everything we could perceive, grows much more  strongly  than  our  ability  to  perceive.  That  means,  the  difference  between  “what we should perceive” and “what we can perceive” grows disproportion- ately. Even for the sake of pure self-protection, we are dependent on not per- ceiving  everything  that  we  could  perceive.  The  filtering  strategy  of  Homo  zappiens is especially helpful for this purpose.  In other words, although our ability to act is getting better and better, the  amounts of things we perceive but cannot manage to act upon increase dis- proportionately. And the perceptual space grows disproportionately in com- parison to the perceptive ability.  3 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Romano_Guardini, accessed in April 2020.   110     K. Henning  Fig. 13.1  Growing power and powerlessness  The power of shaping the world around us grows, while at the same time   the powerlessness grows.  What are we to do? In order to shape this future responsibly, agile structures and forms of work  are needed in which people courageously proceed, try out new things, and  launch new products, services, forms of work, and ways of life based on trust- ing cooperation despite all the complexity and dynamism that surrounds us.  Anyone who does not try to shape our future on a small or large scale, being  agile, fast, flexible and full of trust, has not understood the signs of the times.  The shaping of our future—with artificial intelligence as the gamechanger— presupposes, that we can deal with the growing dynaxity  Valtinat, Rick, &  Henning, 2006 .4 A distinction is made between the dynaxity static, dynamic,  turbulent, and chaotic zones. At the latest in the turbulent zone, a high level  of factual as well as emotional competence is required for this.  4 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Dynaxity  April 2020.  https:  henning4future.com en dynaxity ,   accessed   in    13  Guidelines for the Necessary Redesign of Our Regulatory Systems…   111  With increasing dynaxity, we humans tend to retreat into the “cozy corner”  where we can all love one another and where we repress the truth. “It’s not  going to be that bad with artificial intelligence.” “Oh, no, you’re exaggerating,  it’s the scientists with their airy ideas.” or “I won’t live to see it, anyway, why  should I care.” Unfortunately, there are also remarks like: “I don’t want and  need a smartphone.”  This  attitude  usually  tips  over  when  reality  catches  up  and  the  mood  changes. Now only facts, data, and the bitter reality count. If we do not suc- ceed in designing the systems of artificial intelligence proactively in a respon- sible manner, the bitter reality will catch up with us faster than we would like.  Then, Europe and the Americas could be overwhelmed by Chinese proce- dures and value systems for the use of artificial intelligence, for example.  The happy medium lies in the balance between truth and love, honest and  emotional, full of trust as well as with a lot of control, capable of conflict and  reconciling. The increasing complexity and dynamics cannot be countered by  simplification, repression, nationalism, or populism.  The values of trust, agility, and mindfulness are key to shaping the future of  digital transformation.  It is important to find and rediscover a balance between love and truth in  all areas of life. The necessary must be done. At the same time, the people  concerned should be taken along in a mindful and loving manner.  It is the task of managers and responsible persons in all areas of our society,  either parents in their educational role, or teachers, group leaders, social work- ers, doctors, managers, politicians, etc., to “live” such a path.  Trust, agility, and mindfulness are the three values that seem necessary to  successfully shape the transformation process in such a way that they are all  lived and implemented simultaneously.  These three values are based on decades of experience in dealing with tur- bulence in organizations.5 There are certainly numerous other important val- ues, but the exchange of experiences with those affected has shown me again  and again that these three values are decisive if transformation processes of a  turbulent nature are to take place successfully and with as few undesirable side  effects as possible.  Let’s take a closer look at these three values:  5 Over many years, we have searched for success factors in change projects that we have accompanied.  Backgrounds to it. In: Henning, Klaus: The art of the small solution  Henning, 2014 .   112     K. Henning   The Value of Trust  At first glance, a culture of trust is nothing new. At second glance, however,  that means:  Trust in hybrid intelligence, not only between people, but also between  organizations, and trust in what happens between machines. This tension also  describes the trust between the three legal categories—people, organizations,  machines. They must be reassigned not only ethically, but also legally. Binding  rules for dealing with each other must be agreed upon.  Between people and organizations, we are familiar with that. People are  also legal entities. Organizations also exist as legal entities—as a corporation,  a limited liability company, or an association. Machines with their own con- sciousness  have  yet  to  become  legal  entities.  The  new  legal  category  of  AI  systems with own consciousness will appear. Just as the legal coexistence of  people and organizations sometimes works well and other times not so well,  the same will be the case in the triangular relationship between man, organiza- tion, and machine.  It is not only about the legal aspect, but about all aspects of the varied coex- istence  between  people,  organizations,  and  machines  with  their  own  con- sciousness, because from a systemic point of view they are all “living beings.” In  particular,  the  machines  with  own  consciousness  must  be  educated.  Similar to a dog that must go to a training before it can become an avalanche  search dog, for example. Likewise, the fully autonomous car, the robot on  four wheels, must pass through a driving school where it learns in the com- pany of other fully autonomous cars before it gets released onto the road or  onto the public. You don’t leave a little kid out on the street alone either. But  at  an  agreed  time  of  competence  development  and  learning  processes,  the  machine will grow up with its own consciousness and can and must become  responsible for itself. Such a legal entity may need to be capitalized for liability  purposes or appropriate insurance schemes may be developed.  If such a machine is a legal entity, it will also be subject to criminal law. It  cannot be ruled out that among the many autonomous cars a few will develop  into rogue drivers through experience and exchange of experience. If they are  intensively oriented towards rogue human drivers and are in an international  network of AI rogues, this can happen quickly.  In such cases there will certainly have to be criminal charges against auton- omous AI machines, just as I can sue an automobile company for violating the  emission values. And a trial against an AI car will then also result in the pos- sible  suspension  of  their  license  or  imposition  of  the  “death  penalty,”  i.e.    13  Guidelines for the Necessary Redesign of Our Regulatory Systems…   113  withdrawing the vehicle from circulation. The moral problem of the death  penalty will not arise with artificial intelligence machines. Unless the life or  work of many people is threatened by switching off an intelligent machine.  Just as the closure of a company ordered by a court can deprive many people  of their livelihood.  Building  this  new  culture  of  trust  between  people,  organizations,  and   machines is quite a big task.  We need a culture of trust—vertical and horizontal—between people, machines,  and organizations.  Added to this are the dimensions of vertical and horizontal trust. Many  social systems in the private and professional sectors are characterized by strict  hierarchies and departments. You don’t trust your neighbor. You don’t trust  the  colleague  in  the  neighboring  office. You  don’t  trust  the  customer. You  don’t trust the supplier.  The same thing happens between the hierarchies. You don’t trust the bosses.  You don’t trust the staff. You don’t trust the kids. You don’t trust the parents. The  digital  transformation  with  artificial  intelligence,  however,  will  link  everything with everything. Things become transparent across all hierarchies  along the entire value chain around the world.  In this context, it becomes clear what is meant by the statement: A culture  of trust— vertically and horizontally—between people, machines, and orga- nizations is necessary.   The Value of Agility  It is similar with the second value, agility  Weiler, Savelsberg, & Dorndorf,  2018 . What does agility mean today?  The term has acquired a new quality through experience in the design of  very complex software systems. In 2002, as part of a consulting project, we  extended it to a design principle for change processes in systems with high  turbulence6—according to the Agile Manifesto for Software Development:7  6 https:  henning4future.com en agile-manifesto , accessed in April 2020. 7 According  to  the  Agile  Manifesto  of  Software  Development—https:  henning4future.com en agile-  manifesto , accessed in April 2020.   114     K.

Therefore, although the second things have their value, we assign a higher   value to the first mentioned things.  It needs agility as a design principle for all areas of life and work in all organiza- tions of public and private life.  This approach fits well into Stafford Beer’s8 understanding of organization   Borowski,  2011 .  He  has  derived  an  approach  from  the  structures  of  the  human brain with the “Viable System Model.” It explains how organizational  principles of the brain can be transferred into the organizational cooperation  of  humans.  Stafford  Beer  distinguishes  three  levels: Values,  principles,  and  “norms.”  At the value level, these are the values of trust, agility, and mindfulness. The  value agility is well described by the agile manifesto as described above. At the  level of norms, however, something very important is at stake: the principle of  small steps with small solutions  Henning, 2014 .  As an organizational principle, the next step takes place based on a com- mon  view  of  the  future  by  agreeing  on  binding  deadlines  and  resources.  However, it does not specify how far I will go. The only rule that applies is:  “Run  as  fast  and  well  as  you   with  your  team   can  -  within  the  limits  of  resources in terms of people, time, budget, technology and within the agreed  deadline.”  This operational level is very close to the organizational principle of learn- ing  and  experience,  allowing  trial  and  error.  It  resembles  the  operation  of  machines with their own consciousness. But it is also derived from the basic   8 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Viable_system_model, accessed in April 2020.   13  Guidelines for the Necessary Redesign of Our Regulatory Systems…   115  knowledge about the functioning of the brain. Recursive cycles of knowledge  lead quickly, but in small steps, to success.  The brain always works in a team. Each layer of neural networks consists of  a myriad of parallel nodes that exchange data and even attenuate each other   lateral inhibition . However, it is precisely through their work “in a team”  that they quickly gain sharpness in the reproduction of the observation made. If we apply this approach to the interaction between people, organizations,  and intelligent machines, it becomes clear that it is a question of working  together at eye level. For example, the administrations are concerned with  interdepartmental action. In industry, it is all about the cooperation of mar- keting, sales, maintenance, development, and testing. What a long way still  lies ahead of us to an agile cooperation...  But  there  are  encouraging  examples  of  how  companies  and  states  are  becoming agile. The company Spotify, which has a completely agile structure,  should  once  again  be  mentioned  as  an  example.  It  consists  of  extremely  autonomous agile teams grouped into “tribes” that have enabled rapid and  enormous growth.9  And there is the example of Estonia with its 1.3 million inhabitants. It has  become a model for the digitalization of public administration worldwide.10  A great deal can be handled on the internet. This allows Estonian citizens to  sign digitally without any problems; they can manage their medical records  themselves. An entrepreneur can also handle the complete establishment of a  company with all legal transactions on the internet.  This concept of “e-residency” could be imported into other countries and   to mega-cities. We don’t have to reinvent everything ourselves.   The Value of Mindfulness  Thirdly, it requires a high emotional ability of awareness. Of the three values  for digital transformation, the value of mindfulness is certainly the most dif- ficult to implement.  This value requires the ability to relax and learn to endure the complexity  and dynamics of my environment without repressing it, without becoming   9 Spotify  Engineering  Culture,  27.02.2017.  https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=4GK1NDTWbkY,  accessed in April 2020. 10 Adi Gaskell  Jun 23, 2017 : How Estonia Became The Digital Leader Of Europe https:  www.forbes. com sites adigaskell 2017 06 23 how-estonia-became-the-digital-leaders-of-europe c0f3b12256da ,  accessed in April 2020.   116     K. Henning  angry or depressed. But above all it’s about not falling into a panic of action,  according to the motto “Nobody but me can do it”  Henning, 2015 .11  Objective wide and emotional perception with a big heart requires relaxed   perception. It takes more than that:  Managing systems with high dynaxity requires intelligence, sensitivity, and  “laziness”; the latter in the sense of relaxed perception, the ability to reflect  and anchor oneself in one’s own sense of life—relaxed, resting in oneself, find- ing oneself, meditating, praying.  What is needed is the art of mindfulness and awareness, which does not sup- press growing dynaxity. It rather perceives it in a relaxed way, endures it, and  renounces the reflex of action: “Now something has to be done very quickly!”  If the three values of trust, agility, and mindfulness are brought together  and if we begin to implement them together in a goal-oriented manner, there  is a good chance that the digital transformation with AI systems will succeed.   Integrated Design of Core Processes  It is important to bring three things in the direction of the desired goals and  to  design  the  framework  conditions  between  people,  organizations,  and  machines,  i.e.  hybrid  intelligence   Fig.  13.2    Hanna,  2013;  Henning  &  Meinecke, 2017 :     The task-core processes of people, organizations, and AI systems must be  oriented towards a jointly agreed and lived goal, namely the purpose of an  organization.     The attitudes, ethical values, and behavioral culture for all three “systems”— i.e. the individual core process—must also be oriented towards the com- mon goal. This concerns not only the human being, but also the “individual”  process of an organization and the individual process of an AI machine  with its own consciousness.     The Social Core Process, which constitutes the coexistence in hybrid intel- ligence, i.e. the coexistence of people among each other, machines among  each other, the coexistence between people and machines, is—after all— the decisive factor for a successful transformation. But this also includes the   11 https:  henning4future.com en the-ego-trap-7-ways-to-ruin-your-business , accessed in April 2020.   13  Guidelines for the Necessary Redesign of Our Regulatory Systems…   117  Fig. 13.2  The core processes of the OSTO system model  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  OSTO_System_Model;  https:  henning4future.com en osto-system-model ,  accessed  in  April 2020.   coexistence of the digital shadows, of all participants and their communica- tion with each other and their respective real partners.  We should design this hybrid intelligence in a positive way:     The  system  boundaries  of  states,  public  order  systems,  companies,  and  institutions of all kinds  public offices, churches, associations  will change  dramatically under the influence of artificial intelligence.     Democratic control structures—perhaps modelled after the social market  economy and the German model of democracy—must find their way into  the systems of artificial intelligence.  It affects all levels—the individual person, the family, the municipal struc- tures, the companies, the authorities, the large corporations, our legal sys- tems, and the state. That is the task of the Inverse Gutenberg Revolution. It is  a century task that will hopefully not take 100 years so that we have less tur- bulence than our predecessors during the Gutenberg Revolution.   14  Epilogue: Does Artificial Intelligence Make   God Redundant?  Yuval Harari  Harari, 2018 , one of the world’s most famous historians, writes  in his book “21 Lessons for the twenty-first Century”: “Morality does not  mean ‘adhering to divine commandments’. It means to reduce suffering.”  But do we still need the question of God at all if we expand our conscious- ness through the amount of intelligent AI machines? Yuval Harari sees us on  a path where humans become gods. The “Homus Deus”  Harari, 2015 , the  all-knowing and understanding human being, who will ultimately be able to  solve all basic human questions, will emerge.  In the history of mankind, people have repeatedly tried to answer the ques-  tion about God. However, this is not so easy.  The French philosopher and theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin shaped  the term noosphere in his book “The Origin of Life” in 1950. By this he  means  a  spiritual  sphere  that  shapes  the  development  of  culture  and  individuality.  Looking  towards  the  future,  he  wrote  at  a  time  when  nobody  thought  about digital transformation by machines with artificial intelligence  Teilhard  de Chardin, 2002, 2005 :  From man  from the last and highest point of this evolution of the first degree   ... it is about structures that are calculated, complement each other and connect  with each other. Are we not dealing with an evolution that combines its forces  into an entirely new kind of advance, which only became possible because this    evolution became aware of itself? With a second-degree evolution, a con- scious evolution?    The Editor s   if applicable  and The Author s , under exclusive license   to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 K.

Henning  If one follows this thought, then one could regard the current development  towards hybrid intelligence as an extension of the human brain. This is very  close  to  the  approach  of  Yuval  Harari  and  the  discussions  about  cyborgs   cybernetic organism .1 This refers to mixed beings in which robots and AI  systems become part of the same organism.  Is the human being at the end of the development of a single hybrid intel- ligence, regardless of whether the cooperating AI systems are in the human’s  environment or are even implanted as technical systems in the human being?  The  theologian  Volker  Jung  writes   Jung,  2018 :  “Digitalization  deifies  humans and robs him of himself at the same time. What remains unclear in  Harari’s construction is what room for scope of action really exists.”  If one looks at the world from the modules of matter, energy, and informa- tion, then the decisive room for scope of action is handling of information as  the  decisive  shaping  force.  This  approach  is  described  in  the  Bible  at  the  beginning of the Gospel of John where the emergence of the world begins  with the sentence: “In the beginning was the word.” For the word “logos”  used in Greek, however, the word “information” fits much better. It is helpful  to regard the word “information” in the scientific sense as a measure of chaos  and order  Henning, 1980 .  From this point of view, God dwells in the diversity of information within  the human themselves. “And the word became flesh and dwelt among us.”  The  thoughts  of  God,  also  known  as  the  “Holy  Spirit,”  then  dwell  in  the  human brain. But since we now know that our consciousness—at least as far  as P-consciousness is concerned— is also distributed in the body, God dwells  in everything that can develop its own consciousness. In this sense, there is a  hybrid intelligence between God and the human.  If divine presence “dwells” in the consciousness of the human, then it could  also  dwell  in  the  consciousness  of  animals  and  in  the  consciousness  of  machines.  If we follow the idea of the second-degree evolution by Teilhard de Chardin,  then God would also dwell in the objects with their own consciousness. Then,  it would also be possible for the “Holy Spirit” to spread in the networks of  objects with their own consciousness. Hybrid intelligence between humans  and AI systems would then also be an interesting partner at the level of faith. When it comes to “reducing suffering” through globally agreed ethical val- ues, i.e. a new morality, then perhaps it would not be entirely wrong to think  about a hybrid intelligence of humans and systems of artificial intelligence in   1 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Cyborg, accessed in April 2020.   14  Epilogue: Does Artificial Intelligence Make God Redundant?   121  communion with God. After all, the Gospel of John says that the Son of God,  Jesus Christ, had placed himself in the midst of the suffering of the world.  We would then have found an approach to reducing the suffering of this  world in the hybrid intelligence of the human, machine, and God in a kind  of shared enlarged consciousness.
