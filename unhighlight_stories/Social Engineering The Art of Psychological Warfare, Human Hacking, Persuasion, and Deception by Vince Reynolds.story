Introduction 	 Nowadays,	a	huge	number	of	people	have	become	too	acquainted	with	hackers who	 exploit	 sensitive	 data	 and	 protected	 computer	 systems	 of	 various organizations,	 including	 banks,	 businesses,	 and	 even	 government	 agencies.	 More	 often	 than	 not,	 you	 will	 hear	 about	 hackers	 and	 become	 motivated	 to forestall	their	ploys.		Most	organizations	counter	the	exploits	of	hackers	through investments	in	new	and	up-to-date	technologies	to	strengthen	their	defenses. On	the	other	hand,	there	is	a	new	breed	of	attackers	who	use	their	expertise	to	go past	 the	 solutions	 and	 tools	 of	 organizations.	 	 This	 new	 breed	 of	 attackers	 is referred	 to	 as	 social	 engineers,	 who	 are	 likewise	 known	 as	 hackers;	 however, their	primary	objective	is	to	tap	into	one's	weakness,	that	is,	human	psychology.	 Social	engineers	make	use	of	media	such	as	phone	calls	as	well	as	social	media to	 trick	 people	 so	 that	 they	 can	 gain	 access	 to	 important	 and	 sensitive information. Social	 engineering	 involves	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 malicious	 activities,	 which	 are executed	in	various	ways	such	as	pretexting,	phishing,	quid	pro	quo,	baiting,	and tailgating	among	others. Pretexting	is	a	form	of	social	engineering	in	which	attackers	create	a	fabricated situation	 or	 good	 pretext,	 which	 they	 use	 to	 steal	 one's	 personal	 information.	 More	 often	 than	 not,	 attackers	 who	 use	 pretexting	 are	 mistaken	 as	 scammers who	 usually	 pretend	 that	 they	 need	 personal	 information	 for	 confirming	 their target's	identity. Attackers	who	have	advanced	skills	in	social	engineering	using	pretexting	try	to persuade	 their	 targets	 to	 do	 certain	 actions	 in	 order	 to	 gain	 access	 to	 an organization	and	exploit	its	structural	flaws.		For	instance,	an	attacker	may	take the	 form	 of	 an	 external	 IT	 services	 auditor	 to	 try	 and	 manipulate	 the	 physical security	staff	of	an	organization	so	that	he she	can	gain	access	to	the	building. Social	 engineering	 attacks	 via	 pretexting	 depend	 on	 the	 creation	 of	 a	 delusive sense	of	trust	with	the	target.		The	attacker	is	required	to	create	a	credible	story, leaving	little	or	no	room	for	doubt	on	his her	target;	thus,	the	attacker	can	gain information	that	is	both	sensitive	and	non-sensitive.		There	was	a	case	wherein	a group	 of	 attackers	 took	 the	 form	 of	 modeling	 agency	 representatives	 and invented	fabricated	stories	as	well	as	interview	questions.		The	attackers	targeted   women	whom	they	manipulated	to	sending	nude	photos	of	themselves. Phishing	 is	 considered	 as	 the	 most	 common	 type	 of	 social	 engineering,	 which attackers	 use	 today.	 	 Phishing	 scams	 have	 distinct	 characteristics	 such	 as obtaining	 personal	 information,	 including	 names,	 social	 security	 numbers,	 and addresses	 of	 targets;	 incorporating	 fear,	 a	 sense	 of	 urgency,	 and	 threats	 to manipulate	 targets	 to	 act	 fast;	 and	 using	 embed	 links	 or	 link	 shorteners	 to redirect	targets	to	suspicious	websites	through	URLs	that	may	appear	authorized or	legit. Although	some	phishing	emails	are	crafted	poorly,	that	is,	the	messages	include grammatical	 errors	 and	 misspelled	 words,	 they	 can	 still	 direct	 targets	 to	 fake websites.		Phishing	emails	are	intended	to	steal	the	login	credentials	and	other personal	information	of	targets. More	often	than	not,	attackers	who	use	phishing	emails	pair	malware	with	their phishing	 ploys	 in	 order	 to	 obtain	 users'	 information.	 	 For	 instance,	 a	 reported scam	involved	attackers	who	sent	phishing	emails	to	targets.		The	targets	were prompted	to	install	cracked	APK	files	from	Google	Play	Books.		However,	the files	were	already	pre-loaded	with	malware. Quid	pro	quo	is	another	form	of	social	engineering.		It	involves	a	promise	from the	 attackers	 that	 the	 target	 will	 receive	 a	 benefit	 in	 exchange	 for	 a	 particular piece	of	information.		The	benefit	that	attackers	promise	their	targets	is	in	the form	of	services	instead	of	goods. More	 often	 than	 not,	 attackers	 who	 use	 quid	 pro	 quo	 ploys	 pose	 as	 fraudsters who	act	as	people	for	IT	services.		The	attackers	usually	make	as	many	spam calls	as	possible	to	direct	numbers	from	an	organization	and	offer	their	targets	IT assistance.	 	 They	 will	 then	 promise	 a	 quick	 fix	 of	 a	 certain	 IT	 issue	 while prompting	their	targets	to	disable	their	AV	program.		Once	the	targets	agree,	the fraudsters	 install	 malware	 that	 take	 the	 form	 of	 software	 updates	 on	 the computers	of	their	targets. There	are	also	cases	wherein	attackers	use	less	sophisticated	ploys	of	quid	pro quo.		For	instance,	attackers	know	that	many	people,	specifically	office	workers, would	be	willing	to	share	their	passwords	in	exchange	for	a	bar	of	chocolate	or even	a	cheap	pen. Another	form	of	social	engineering	is	baiting,	which	is	similar	to	phishing	and quid	pro	quo	in	many	ways.		Attackers	who	use	baiting	employ	online	schemes that	 entice	 their	 targets	 to	 surrender	 their	 login	 credentials	 to	 a	 suspicious   website	in	exchange	for	a	good	or	an	item.		More	often	than	not,	attackers	offer their	targets	with	free	movie	or	music	downloads. However,	baiting	is	not	limited	to	online	schemes.		Attackers	who	use	this	type of	 social	 engineering	 can	 also	 exploit	 the	 human	 curiosity	 through	 physical media.		There	was	a	case	in	which	a	founder	of	an	organization	along	with	his team	infected	and	dispersed	a	number	of	USBs	with	a	Trojan	virus	around	the parking	lot	of	his	organization.		Most	of	the	employees	picked	up	and	plugged the	 USBs	 into	 their	 gadgets	 such	 as	 computers,	 laptops,	 and	 tablets	 out	 of curiosity.	 	 Once	 they	 plugged	 the	 USBs,	 a	 keylogger	 was	 activated	 and	 the founder	was	able	to	access	the	login	credentials	of	his	employees. Tailgating,	 also	 known	 as	 “piggybacking,”	 is	 a	 social	 engineering	 form	 that involves	attackers	who	have	no	proper	authentication	in	an	organization.		The attackers	follow	employees	to	obtain	access	in	a	restricted	area. A	tailgating	attack	often	involves	attackers	who	pose	as	delivery	drivers	waiting at	an	organization's	parking	lot.		When	the	attackers	see	an	employee	gaining	the security's	approval,	the	attackers	who	usually	carry	“goods	for	delivery”	ask	the employee	 to	 hold	 the	 door.	 	 Thus,	 they	 gain	 access	 from	 someone	 who	 is authorized	to	get	into	the	building. Social	engineers	often	use	tailgating	in	small	organizations	or	companies	given that	most	large	companies	require	employees	to	swipe	their	identification	cards.	 However,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 small	 to	 mid-sized	 companies,	 attackers	 can	 easily converse	with	employees	to	show	the	security	a	sense	of	familiarity,	getting	past the	latter	as	well	as	the	front	desk. A	 known	 security	 consultant	 used	 tailgating	 to	 access	 into	 several	 floors	 of	 a building,	 including	 one	 that	 housed	 the	 data	 room	 of	 a	 financial	 firm.	 	 The consultant	was	able	to	access	the	building's	third	floor	meeting	room	wherein	he worked	for	a	few	days	in	order	to	obtain	information. Clearly,	social	engineering	attacks	are	far-flung	and	considered	as	an	enormous threat	to	various	organizations.		Social	engineering	can	cost	targets	thousands,	if not,	millions	of	dollars	annually	as	it	attacks	people	with	access	or	knowledge	to an	organization's	sensitive	information.		Today,	most	attackers	leverage	various tactics	 and	 social	 networking	 schemes	 in	 order	 to	 obtain	 professional	 and personal	information	of	their	targets.		The	people	who	are	most	susceptible	to social	 engineering	 attackers	 are	 the	 new	 employees,	 followed	 by	 contractors, human	resources,	executive	assistants,	IT	personnel,	and	business	leaders.   Unfortunately,	 some	 organizations	 do	 not	 have	 an	 awareness	 and	 prevention program	to	counter	social	engineering.		In	addition,	there	are	organizations	who do	not	have	security	policies	or	employee	training	that	prevent	tactics	of	social engineering. This	 book	 offers	 valuable	 information	 about	 social	 engineering.	 	 In	 the	 first chapter,	you	will	learn	what	social	engineering	is	and	what	social	engineers	want as	well	as	the	different	ploys	that	attackers	use.		The	second	chapter	of	this	book offers	pertinent	information	on	the	basic	psychological	tactics	that	attackers	use to	implement	their	social	engineering	schemes.			 	 	 	   Chapter	1:	What	is	Social	Engineering?  	 Social	engineering	is	a	method	of	gaining	access	to	systems,	data,	or	buildings through	 the	 exploitation	 of	 the	 human	 psychology.	 	 Instead	 of	 using	 technical techniques	 or	 breaking	 in,	 social	 engineering	 involves	 non-technical	 schemes that	attackers	employ.		For	instance,	an	attacker	may	call	a	target	or	an	employee and	disguise	as	an	IT	support	person	instead	of	finding	a	software	vulnerability in	the	target's	company.		The	attacker	will	then	trick	the	target	into	giving	his her password.		The	primary	objective	of	social	engineers	is	to	gain	the	trust	of	as many	targets	as	possible	in	a	certain	company. In	 the	 '90s,	 Kevin	 Mitnick,	 a	 famous	 hacker,	 popularized	 the	 term	 “social engineering,”	although	the	concept	of	tricking	a	person	into	divulging	sensitive information	has	already	been	around	for	many	years.	 	   Types	of	Social	Engineers There	are	many	forms	of	social	engineering.		It	is	either	friendly	or	malicious and	can	build	up	and	tear	down	a	target.		It	is	important	to	have	knowledge	on the	different	types	of	social	engineers	to	determine	how	one	can	deal	with	them. Hackers Hackers	 are	 considered	 the	 most	 popular	 and	 prominent	 type	 of	 social engineers.	 	 Even	 if	 software	 vendors	 develop	 hardened	 and	 more	 difficult	 to break	software	systems,	hackers	are	able	to	hit	on	them.		Network	and	software attack	 variables,	 including	 hacking,	 are	 fast	 becoming	 a	 part	 of	 social engineering	 skills.	 	 More	 often	 than	 not,	 this	 type	 of	 social	 engineers	 use	 a combination	of	personal	and	hardware	skills	and	use	hacking	in	either	minor	or major	breaches	across	the	globe. Penetration	Testers Skilled	penetration	testers	or	pentesters	are	quite	similar	to	hackers	as	they	use hacking	 skills	 to	 penetrate	 a	 company's	 or	 target's	 security	 system.	 	 Pentesters are	 those	 who	 have	 malicious	 black	 hat	 skills;	 however,	 they	 do	 not	 use	 the information	they	have	obtained	to	harm	a	target	or	for	personal	interest. Identity	Thieves Identity	theft	refers	to	the	utilizing	information	of	an	individual's	name,	address, bank	 account	 numbers,	 social	 security	 number,	 and	 birth	 date	 without	 the knowledge	of	the	owner.		This	is	a	crime	that	ranges	from	wearing	a	uniform	to impersonating	an	individual	to	more	complicated	attacks.		Identity	thieves	carry out	a	number	of	social	engineering	skills.		Today,	identity	thieves	have	become more	creative	and	unique	in	the	ploys	they	carry	out. Spies Spies	are	those	who	use	the	skills	of	social	engineering	as	a	substantial	part	of their	 lives.	 	 They	 usually	 employ	 the	 principles	 of	 social	 engineering	 in	 their ploys.		Spies	are	considered	science	experts	as	they	are	taught	various	methods of	 tricking	 or	 fooling	 their	 targets	 into	 believing	 something	 that	 they	 are	 not.	 Furthermore,	spies	from	all	over	the	world	are	taught	and	trained	with	the	skills of	social	engineering	so	that	they	can	build	credibility	and	successfully	inquire about	their	targets.   Disgruntled	Employees More	 often	 than	 not,	 members	 of	 organizations	 who	 become	 dissatisfied	 or disgruntled	 likewise	 become	 rebellious	 toward	 their	 employers.	 	 Furthermore, most	employers	are	unable	to	determine	the	dissatisfaction	of	their	employees	as the	 latter	 naturally	 hides	 their	 concerns	 to	 protect	 their	 jobs.	 	 As	 such,	 the relationship	 between	 employers	 and	 employees	 is	 one-sided.	 	 Regrettably, employees	who	have	become	tremendously	disgruntled	with	their	employers	or the	organization	find	it	easier	to	execute	malicious	acts	such	as	theft,	vandalism, security	breach,	and	other	offenses. There	 are	 some	 signals	 that	 employers	 can	 use	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 discerning whether	a	member	of	their	staff	becomes	disgruntled	and	inclined	to	carrying	out social	engineering	ploys.  1.	 Disgruntled	 employees	 are	 well-informed	 and	 aware	 that	 those	 who frequently	call	in	sick,	file	leave	of	absence	a	lot,	and	go	home	on	a	half- day	among	others	are	likely	to	be	the	usual	suspects	of	wrongdoings	in organizations.	 	 Hence,	 disgruntled	 employees	 are	 inclined	 to	 initiating extra	work,	task,	or	duty,	working	for	long	hours,	or	simply	attempting to	catch	the	attention	of	the	higher-ups	in	the	organization.		This	type	of behavior	is	referred	to	as	the	protective	behavior	pattern.  2.	 If	employees	become	upset	over	minor	or	major	things	that	threaten	to ruin	their	fraud	or	scam,	they	are	indeed	disgruntled	and	likely	to	lead into	 social	 engineering	 ploys.	 	 They	 may	 also	 say	 negative	 statements regarding	 the	 organization	 or	 management	 so	 that	 co-workers	 would sympathize	with	them	once	they	are	caught	committing	their	misdeeds.	 For	instance,	disgruntled	employees	may	say	that	the	top	management	is corrupt,	unfair,	or	unappreciative	and	try	to	encourage	other	employees.	 Once	the	disgruntled	employees	are	caught,	they	would	simply	say	that their	 misdeed	 is	 nothing	 compared	 to	 the	 inequity	 of	 the	 top management	towards	its	employees.  3.	 Disgruntled	 employees	 are	 likely	 to	 demonstrate	 the	 antisocial	 loner personality.	 	 While	 this	 personality	 may	 or	 may	 not	 be	 inherent, disgruntled	 employees	 tend	 to	 become	 loners	 as	 they	 think,	 plan,	 and execute	 their	 crimes.	 	 Again,	 these	 employees	 would	 often	 blame	 all their	misdeeds	to	the	organization	or	top	management.		This	personality is	 developed	 when	 an	 employee	 constantly	 complains	 about	 the workplace,	 co-employees,	 or	 the	 top	 management.	 	 Eventually,	 this   4.	 Disgruntled	  employees	 are	  would	 lead	 them	 into	 thinking	 that	 they	 are	 alone,	 hence,	 becomes antisocial.		They	become	impersonal	and	cold	towards	their	colleagues. lifestyle inappropriately.		They	may	have	a	sudden	increase	in	their	assets,	travel a	lot,	purchase	luxurious	items,	and	even	open	offshore	bank	accounts, which	 do	 not	 add	 up	 to	 their	 actual	 salary.	 	 In	 this	 case,	 employers should	 take	 note	 of	 how	 these	 employees	 can	 afford	 such	 lifestyle.	 Furthermore,	 disgruntled	 employees	 who	 carry	 out	 social	 engineering ploys	are	primarily	motivated	by	ego	and	money.																	  change	  likely	  their	  to	  Executive	Recruiters	 Recruiters	 are	 required	 to	 master	 the	 aspects	 and	 skills	 of	 social	 engineering.	 They	 need	 to	 become	 experts	 in	 the	 skill	 of	 elicitation	 along	 with	 the	 various psychological	 social	 engineering	 principles.	 	 As	 such,	 they	 are	 proficient	 in understanding	and	discerning	what	motivates	their	targets.		More	often	than	not, recruiters	attack	both	the	job	poster	and	the	job	seeker. Scam	Artist Scam	artists,	also	known	as	con	artists,	take	on	greed	as	well	as	other	principles that	may	attract	their	target's	desires	and	beliefs	to	make	money.		Scam	artists have	 the	 ability	 to	 discern	 the	 signals,	 which	 make	 their	 targets	 a	 good	 prey.	 They	 are	 adept	 in	 establishing	 situations	 that	 are	 irresistible	 and	 full	 of “opportunities”	for	their	targets. Governments Governments	are	often	overlooked	as	social	engineers;	yet,	they	are	proficient	in controlling	 the	 people	 they	 govern	 and	 the	 messages	 they	 convey.	 	 Most governments	make	use	of	authority,	social	proof,	and	scarcity	to	ensure	that	they are	able	to	control	their	targets.		On	the	other	hand,	this	social	engineering	skill is	not	always	considered	negative	given	that	some	of	the	messages	relayed	are beneficial	 for	 the	 targets.	 	 In	 addition,	 governments	 make	 use	 of	 social engineering	 elements	 to	 make	 the	 message	 more	 convincing,	 appealing,	 and accepted. Salespeople Salespeople	are	similar	to	recruiters	because	they	are	also	experts	in	a	number	of people	skills.		According	to	most	sales	gurus,	an	effective	salesperson	does	not   control	people,	but	make	use	of	their	skills	to	determine	the	needs	of	their	clients and	find	out	if	they	would	be	able	to	fill	those	needs.		The	art	of	sales	involves various	 social	 engineering	 skills,	 including	 elicitation,	 information	 gathering, psychological	principles,	and	influence	among	others.   Psychologists,	Doctors,	and	Lawyers Most	people	might	be	surprised	to	know	that	people	in	these	career	fields	belong to	the	types	of	social	engineers.		This	group	carries	out	similar	techniques	used by	the	other	types	of	social	engineers.		For	instance,	this	group	uses	elicitation, psychological	principles,	interrogation,	and	proper	interview	tactics	to	obtain	as well	as	manipulate	their	clients	or	targets	into	the	direction	they	want	to	lead. Therefore,	 people	 can	 find	 an	 aspect	 of	 social	 engineering	 in	 various	 kinds	 of field,	 whether	 or	 not	 they	 may	 appear	 as	 well-educated	 professionals	 such	 as doctors	and	lawyers.		This	goes	to	show	that	social	engineering	is	also	a	science, involving	equations	that	exist	to	allow	a	person	to	apply	social	engineering	skills that	 result	 in	 their	 objectives.	 	 One	 equation	 may	 be	 translated	 as:	 pretext	 + attachment	to	greed	+	manipulation	=	target	victimized. 	   Goals	of	Social	Engineers The	 main	 goal	 of	 most	 social	 engineers	 is	 to	 possess	 a	 target's	 personal information,	which	can	lead	them	to	identity	or	financial	theft	or	get	them	ready for	a	more	intensive	attack.		More	often	than	not,	social	engineers	find	ways	to install	 malware	 into	 a	 company's	 system	 in	 order	 to	 gain	 access	 to	 computer accounts,	personal	data,	and	other	sensitive	information.		In	some	cases,	social engineers	 look	 for	 ways	 that	 translate	 to	 competitive	 advantage.	 	 Some	 of	 the most	 common	 items	 that	 are	 valuable	 to	 social	 engineers	 include	 passwords, keys,	account	numbers,	access	cards,	identity	badges,	any	personal	information, details	 of	 computer	 systems,	 phone	 lists,	 information	 about	 non-public	 URLs, servers,	 intranet,	 servers,	 and	 names	 of	 targets	 with	 access	 privileges	 among others. 	   Social	Engineering	Ploys Unfortunately,	 there	 is	 a	 great	 number	 of	 exploits	 associated	 with	 social engineering.	 	 Attackers	 may	 trick	 their	 targets	 into	 visiting	 a	 fake	 Web	 page, leaving	a	door	open	for	them,	downloading	a	document	that	includes	malicious code,	or	even	inserting	a	USB	in	the	computer	so	that	they	could	gain	access	to the	 targets'	 corporate	 network.	 	 Some	 of	 the	 typical	 ploys	 related	 to	 social engineering	include: Friending.	This	ploy	involves	a	social	engineer	gaining	the	trust	of	their	target and	 prompts	 to	 click	 on	 attachments	 or	 links,	 which	 contain	 malware.	 	 This malware	usually	includes	a	threat	that	is	detrimental	to	a	corporate	system.		Once the	social	engineer	gains	access	to	the	corporate	system	and	finds	its	weakness through	 the	 malware,	 they	 may	 begin	 to	 exploit.	 	 For	 instance,	 the	 social engineer	may	start	an	online	conversation	with	targets	and	impel	them	to	divulge useful	and	sensitive	information. 	 Impersonal	 or	 Social	 Network	 Squatting.	 This	 ploy	 involves	 a	 social	 engineer tweeting	their	target	and	the	target's	friends	or	other	contacts	using	the	name	of someone	whom	that	target	knows.		The	social	engineer	then	asks	the	target	for	a favor,	 such	 as	 providing	 data	 from	 work	 or	 sending	 a	 spreadsheet.	 	 It	 is important	 to	 take	 note	 that	 social	 engineers	 can	 manipulate	 or	 spoof	 anything seen	on	a	computer	system. 	 Posing	as	an	Insider.	This	ploy	involves	a	social	engineer	posing	as	an	IT	help desk	contractor	or	worker	in	order	to	obtain	information	such	as	passwords	from targets.		In	a	study	for	vulnerability	assessments	that	involved	employees	from	a certain	company,	90%	of	the	workforce	trusted	the	accomplices	who	posed	as co-employees.	 	 As	 such,	 the	 accomplices	 were	 able	 to	 obtain	 personal information	and	other	sensitive	information	about	the	company. 	 	   Chapter	2:	Social	Engineering	–	Basic Psychological	Tactics  	 Social	engineering	involves	basic	psychological	tactics	that	attackers	employ	for gaining	 the	 trust	 of	 their	 targets	 as	 well	 as	 getting	 what	 they	 want.	 	 It	 is necessary	that	you	know	the	social	engineering	underlying	principles	so	that	it could	be	easier	to	recognize	when	you	are	being	targeted	by	an	attacker. A	social	engineer	exudes	control	and	confidence.		Naturally,	people	who	are	into carrying	out	something	misleading	or	deceptive	act	confidently	and	in	control.	 For	instance,	a	social	engineer	may	try	to	pose	as	an	individual	from	a	service company	 or	 even	 forge	 a	 badge	 just	 to	 gain	 access	 in	 a	 secure	 building.	 	 The social	 engineer	 simply	 needs	 to	 act	 as	 if	 they	 belong	 there.	 	 Thus,	 as	 a	 social engineer	 conveys	 control	 and	 confidence,	 they	 are	 able	 to	 put	 others	 in	 the building	at	ease. Take	the	case	of	the	security	people	in	concerts.		The	security	people	do	not	look for	 badges	 when	 they	 allow	 people	 to	 enter	 inside	 a	 venue.	 	 They	 look	 for unusual	postures.		For	instance,	security	people	can	determine	whether	a	fan	is sneaking	back	to	have	a	glimpse	of	the	star.		They	also	know	the	people	who	are working	for	the	event. A	social	engineer	may	also	strike	up	a	conversation	in	order	to	gain	the	upper hand.		Consequently,	when	they	are	able	to	ask	questions	to	the	target,	they	are able	to	control	the	conversation.		More	often	than	not,	social	engineers	start	a conversation	 with	 a	 question,	 which	 can	 put	 the	 target	 immediately	 on	 the defense.	 	 Thus,	 the	 target	 feels	 a	 social	 pressure	 to	 provide	 an	 appropriate	 or correct	response.				 In	 the	 event	 that	 someone	 conveys	 control	 and	 confidence	 both	 offline	 and online,	 the	 key	 is	 not	 to	 become	 too	 comfortable.	 	 For	 instance,	 companies should	advise	employees	to	be	keen	when	it	comes	to	allowing	outsides	enter	the building.		Guests	and	even	service	providers	should	be	checked	thoroughly	for credentials	regardless	if	their	faces	may	be	familiar. 	   A	 social	 engineer	 offer	 favors	 or	 free	 gifts.	 One	 of	 the	 human	 impulses	 that social	 engineers	 use	 is	 reciprocation.	 	 More	 often	 than	 not,	 when	 people	 are given	gifts	or	favors,	they	feel	the	need	to	give	in	return	whether	or	not	they	like the	person	giving	something	to	them.		A	social	engineer	may	offer	to	hold	the door	 for	 an	 individual	 who	 belongs	 in	 a	 company	 or	 offer	 cookies	 to	 a receptionist	to	gain	access	to	the	building. Most	 social	 engineers	 know	 that	 the	 time	 delay	 between	 offering	 a	 gift	 and asking	for	a	favor	is	crucial.		This	is	because	the	target	might	take	the	gift	as	a bribe	when	the	social	engineer	immediately	asks	for	a	favor.		The	target	is	likely to	act	uncomfortably	when	they	perceive	the	gift	as	a	bribe.		As	such,	a	social engineer	is	inclined	to	giving	a	gift,	say,	to	a	guard	or	receptionist	of	a	building in	the	morning	and	come	back	in	the	afternoon.		The	social	engineer	may	claim	a mix-up,	such	as	pretending	that	there	was	a	confusion	with	an	item	or	than	an item	was	left	in	one	of	the	rooms	of	the	building	after	a	meeting.		The	guard	or receptionist	 is	 likely	 to	 let	 the	 social	 engineer	 enter	 the	 building	 as	 an	 act	 of reciprocation	for	the	latter's	gift.		 To	prevent	something	like	this	from	happening,	employees	should	be	skeptical, specifically	when	someone	is	trying	to	offer	them	a	gift.		In	most	cases,	social engineers	 spend	 weeks	 in	 order	 to	 lay	 the	 foundation	 to	 establish	 a	 reciprocal relationship	with	their	targets,	leading	them	to	access	to	secure	or	sensitive	areas. 	 A	social	engineer	makes	use	of	humor.		In	general,	people	enjoy	the	company	of other	 individuals	 with	 a	 good	 sense	 of	 humor.	 	 This	 fact	 does	 not	 escape	 the knowledge	of	most	social	engineers.		They	know	that	they	can	use	humor	to	gain information,	get	out	of	trouble,	or	win	over	a	gatekeeper.		For	instance,	a	social engineer	 may	 simply	 convey	 an	 upbeat	 impression	 to	 a	 security	 guard questioning	them.		Social	engineers	usually	give	their	targets	the	impression	that they	are	not	worried	with	the	questioning. In	 addition,	 social	 engineers	 may	 try	 to	 strike	 up	 a	 conversation	 in	 order	 to obtain	information	from	their	target.		For	instance,	a	social	engineer	may	pose	as an	 IT	 person	 and	 fake	 a	 call,	 asking	 for	 the	 target's	 password.	 	 The	 social engineer	 may	 use	 humor	 during	 the	 call	 as	 the	 target	 is	 likely	 to	 volunteer sensitive	information	when	the	conversation	is	comfortable	and	fun. 	 A	 social	 engineer	 always	 states	 a	 reason.	 A	 recent	 study	 was	 conducted   involving	2	groups	of	participants.		The	first	group	was	waiting	in	line	to	use	a library's	copy	machine.		The	second	group	was	tasked	to	cut	the	line	so	they	can use	the	machine	first.		The	study	found	out	that	people	are	inclined	to	concede	to individuals	when	they	hear	the	work	“because.”		In	the	said	study,	the	second group	cut	in	line	to	use	a	copy	machine	saying	the	following:	“Excuse	me,	may	I use	 the	 copy	 machine	 because	 I	 have	 five	 pages	 and	 I	 am	 in	 a	 hurry?”	 	 This statement	made	94%	of	the	first	group	concede,	allowing	the	individual	to	skip the	line. In	another	scenario,	an	individual	in	the	second	group	used	the	line,	“Excuse	me, may	I	use	the	copy	machine?		I	have	five	pages.”		This	statement	made	60%	of the	first	group	concede.		In	the	final	scenario,	the	second	group	used	the	line, “Excuse	me,	may	I	use	the	copy	machine	because	I	have	five	pages	and	I	need	to have	copies?”		While	the	reason	may	be	absurd,	93%	of	the	first	group	allowed the	line-cutter. Consequently,	 the	 magic	 word	 in	 the	 study	 was	 “because.”	 	 Social	 engineers know	this.		As	they	try	to	blend	with	the	people	in	a	specific	building	and	march around	as	if	they	own	the	place,	other	people	would	think	that	they	truly	belong there.									In	the	same	way,	a	social	engineer	who	uses	the	word	“because”	is likely	to	convey	to	the	target	that	they	have	a	legitimate	reason.		Most	people	are likely	to	cooperate	when	they	are	given	a	perception	of	a	reason,	regardless	if such	reason	is	sensible	or	not. Given	that	social	engineers	can	work	in	any	type	of	environment,	people	should take	time	to	know	what	is	going	on	around	them	and	what	is	being	said	to	them.	 More	 often	 than	 not,	 people	 who	 have	 a	 hectic	 day	 are	 likely	 to	 give	 up information	right	away	just	to	end	the	day	and	rest.		Social	engineers	scout	for targets	who	may	seem	stressed	out	as	they	know	these	people	are	likely	to	lose their	awareness	as	well	as	presence	of	mind.	 	   Elicitation Elicitation	refers	to	drawing	or	bringing	out,	or	arriving	at	a	truth	or	conclusion through	logic.		It	is	also	referred	to	as	a	stimulation,	which	draws	forth	or	calls up	a	specific	class	of	behaviors. In	 the	 context	 of	 social	 engineering,	 elicitation	 is	 used	 to	 draw	 targets	 out through	a	set	of	questions	that	stimulate	them,	leading	them	to	the	behavior	that the	 social	 engineers	 want.	 	 In	 social	 engineering,	 the	 attackers	 fashion	 their words	 and	 questions	 as	 well	 as	 enhance	 their	 skill	 to	 a	 higher	 level.	 	 Social engineers	who	are	adept	in	eliciting	information	can	make	their	target	want	to answer	every	question	or	request	that	they	ask	for. Most	governments	warn	and	educate	their	employees	about	elicitation	given	that this	psychological	variable	is	used	by	spies	across	the	globe.		For	instance,	the National	 Security	 Agency	 of	 the	 United	 States	 government	 has	 defined elicitation	in	its	training	materials	as	“the	subtle	extraction	of	information	during an	apparently	normal	and	innocent	conversation.”		The	conversations	referred	in this	 definition	 can	 transpire	 anywhere,	 such	 as	 in	 a	 daycare,	 a	 restaurant,	 the gym,	or	just	about	any	place	where	the	target	is. Given	that	elicitation	is	low	risk	and	extremely	difficult	to	detect,	it	works	well with	 other	 aspects	 of	 social	 engineering.	 	 More	 often	 than	 not,	 targets	 never know	where	the	information	leak	about	them	comes	from.		Regardless	if	there	is suspicion,	targets	usually	pass	it	off	as	just	a	question	that	they	should	or	should not	answer.   There	are	several	reasons	why	elicitation	works	well	with	social	engineering.  1.																													Most	people	want	to	be	polite	even	to	strangers. 2.																												When	people	are	praised,	they	are	likely	to	talk	and	divulge	more  information	about	themselves.  3.																												Professionals	desire	to	exude	intelligence	and	superiority	in	their  fields.  4.		 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Most	people	respond	as	pleasantly	as	possible	to	people	who  appear	to	have	concern	about	them.  5.																												Most	people	do	not	lie	just	because	they	want	to	lie.  These	are	significant	factors	that	social	engineers	consider	in	the	targets	they	are dealing	 with.	 	 Social	 engineers	 know	 that	 these	 factors	 are	 usually	 inherent	 in every	individual,	making	elicitation	work	well	with	their	ploys.		Thus,	they	are able	to	get	people	to	talk	about	any	information	about	them. More	often	than	not,	social	engineers	employ	light	and	simple	conversation	to get	the	most	relevant	information	out	of	their	targets.		However,	prior	to	doing so,	they	ensure	that	they	are	clear	with	their	goals	in	order	to	obtain	the	optimal results	 from	 elicitation.	 	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 social	 engineers	 do	 not	 utilize elicitation	just	for	obtaining	information.		They	use	it	to	make	their	pretext	more credible	and	gain	access	to	the	information	they	want.			   The	Goals	of	Elicitation Based	 on	 the	 definition	 of	 elicitation	 presented	 above,	 social	 engineers	 are provided	with	a	clear	path	of	what	their	goals	are.		Social	engineers	want	their target	to	act	regardless	if	the	action	is	as	simple	as	replying	to	their	questions	or as	elaborate	as	accessing	a	specific	restricted	area.		In	order	to	get	their	target	to act	 in	 accordance	 to	 their	 intention,	 social	 engineers	 are	 inclined	 to	 asking several	 questions	 or	 simply	 keep	 a	 conversation,	 which	 would	 stimulate	 their target	to	the	path	that	they	are	leading. The	 key	 to	 effective	 elicitation	 is	 information.	 	 The	 more	 social	 engineers	 are able	to	gather	information,	the	more	successful	their	ploy	would	be.		Given	that elicitation	is	low	risk,	it	does	not	pose	a	threat	to	targets.		For	instance,	people have	 numerous	 conversations	 with	 others	 at	 coffee	 shops,	 stores,	 or	 elsewhere regardless	 if	 they	 are	 significant	 or	 meaningless.	 	 Thus,	 the	 entire	 concept	 of keeping	a	conversation	is	immersed	in	elicitation,	utilizing	it	in	an	inauspicious manner.		This	is	why	keeping	a	conversation	is	significant	in	elicitation. Irrespective	 of	 the	 method	 used,	 the	 goal	 of	 elicitation	 is	 to	 gain	 access	 to information	 and	 use	 it	 to	 stimulate	 targets	 to	 a	 path	 in	 which	 social	 engineers lead	 them.	 	 This	 is	 why	 people	 should	 be	 able	 to	 discern	 between	 a	 “normal” conversation	and	elicitation	as	it	can	be	difficult	to	differentiate. In	 addition,	 social	 engineers	 are	 masters	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 the	 art	 of conversation.	 	 They	 have	 become	 proficient	 in	 the	 three	 main	 steps	 of conversing	with	their	targets. The	 first	 step	 is	 being	 natural.	 	 Social	 engineers	 can	 create	 and	 keep	 a conversation	by	being	natural	in	the	way	they	speak	and	act	while	dealing	with their	targets.		For	instance,	they	are	able	to	have	a	conversation	with	their	target about	 something	 they	 are	 experts	 with.	 	 As	 such,	 they	 are	 able	 to	 stand comfortably	and	convey	their	knowledge	without	spilling	out	a	hint	of	malice	to their	target.		Social	engineers	exude	naturalness	and	confidence.		Not	only	have they	 mastered	 the	 way	 they	 speak,	 but	 also	 the	 nonverbal	 factors	 of	 a conversation.					 The	 second	 step	 is	 education.	 	 Social	 engineers	 are	 equipped	 with	 knowledge about	what	they	are	talking	about	to	their	targets.		They	avoid	pretending	more than	they	can	be	believed	that	they	are.		This	means	that	if	they	want	to	obtain information,	 say,	 from	 a	 marketing	 company	 and	 their	 target	 is	 an	 advanced   marketer,	 their	 elicitation	 approach	 should	 involve	 something	 about	 what interests	 the	 target.	 	 Social	 engineers	 research,	 practice,	 and	 prepare	 before choosing	to	converse	with	their	target.		They	come	in	with	adequate	knowledge so	that	they	can	speak	about	a	specific	topic	intelligently. The	third	and	final	step	is	not	being	greedy.		This	step	may	be	contradicting	the motives	of	social	engineers.		However,	the	objective	in	creating	and	keeping	a conversation	is	to	obtain	information,	get	answers,	and	be	provided	the	key	to the	target's	arena.		As	such,	when	conversing	with	their	targets,	social	engineers avoid	 being	 greedy	 with	 information.	 	 Instead,	 they	 apply	 the	 concept	 of reciprocation,	making	the	conversation	a	give	and	take	process	rather	than	a	one- way	street.		They	also	allow	their	targets	to	dominate	the	conversation.		Even	if the	conversation	leads	them	to	obtaining	few	information,	social	engineers	are patient	enough	not	to	be	greedy	by	going	deeper	and	raising	a	red	flag	on	the part	of	their	targets. These	steps	to	a	successful	conversation	are	also	keys	to	a	successful	elicitation.	 It	can	change	the	way	social	engineers	converse	with	their	targets. 	 Key	Elements	of	a	Successful	Elicitation	 Social	engineers	apply	the	principle	of	elicitation	firstly	by	lacking	the	fear	to communicate	with	their	targets	and	being	in	circumstances	that	are	not	regarded as	normal. As	 part	 of	 training	 its	 agents,	 the	 United	 States	 Department	 of	 Homeland Security	  DHS 	 has	 developed	 an	 internal	 pamphlet	 on	 elicitation.	 	 It	 is	 a brochure	containing	some	significant	pointers	on	how	to	identify	the	difference between	a	normal	conversation	and	elicitation.		It	also	contains	measures	on	how their	agents	can	avoid	elicitation. In	one	of	the	scenarios	in	the	pamphlet,	the	attacker	tells	the	target,	“Your	job must	 be	 important...	 that	 is	 why	 others	 think	 very	 highly	 of	 you.”	 	 The	 target then	replies,	“Thank	you,	buy	my	job	is	not	that	important.		All	I	do	is...”		This avoidance	technique	into	a	possible	elicitation	is	simple	yet	effective	although	it generally	appeals	to	the	target's	ego. Social	engineers	tend	to	strike	at	their	target's	ego	without	overdoing	it.		They usually	 do	 it	 with	 utmost	 sincerity	 without	 stalking	 their	 targets.	 	 Social engineers	do	not	say	things	that	might	lead	to	calling	the	security	upon	them.   Social	engineers	use	ego	appeals	as	subtly	as	possible.		They	instill	flattery	in their	conversations	without	making	their	approach	overly	done	or	obvious. In	 another	 scenario	 in	 the	 DHS	 pamphlet,	 the	 attacker	 says,	 “You	 have	 a background	 in	 compliance	 databases?	 	 You	 should	 see	 the	 model	 that	 I	 have created,	which	is	designed	for	a	reporting	engine	to	assist	with	a	certification.		I can	surely	get	you	a	copy	of	it.”		Then,	the	target	answers,	“I'd	love	to	see	it.	 Our	company	has	been	indulging	with	the	idea	of	an	additional	reporting	engine to	the	system.” This	tactic	of	the	attacker	is	expressing	mutual	interest,	which	is	considered	as an	 important	 elicitation	 aspect.	 	 This	 is	 a	 tactic	 that	 is	 more	 powerful	 and effective	than	appealing	to	the	target's	ego.		This	is	because	when	there	is	mutual interest,	the	relationship	is	extended	beyond	the	initial	attempt	to	converse.		In this	 scenario,	 the	 social	 engineer	 was	 able	 to	 make	 the	 target	 agree	 to	 further contact	by	acknowledging	the	offer	of	the	attacker	and	expressing	interest	in	the plans	discussed	for	the	company's	system	in	the	future.		This	alone	can	lead	into a	huge	system	breach. In	this	scenario,	the	social	engineer	already	has	full	control	of	the	target.		This means	that	the	social	engineer	has	control	over	the	next	steps	as	well	as	what, when,	 and	 how	 much	 information	 is	 released.	 	 Naturally,	 once	 the	 social engineer	 establishes	 a	 long-term	 engagement,	 they	 would	 be	 able	 to	 build rapport	and	trust	with	the	target	and	make	the	latter	feel	a	sense	of	obligation. Another	 scenario	 in	 the	 DHS	 pamphlet	 presented	 the	 creation	 of	 a	 deliberate false	statement.		While	this	tactic	may	be	inclined	to	backfiring,	it	is	just	as	a powerful	tool	as	any	other	social	engineering	tactic. For	instance,	the	attacker	says,	“Everyone	is	aware	that	ABC	company	yielded the	highest	selling	software	for	this	particular	type	of	widget	across	the	globe.”	 The	target	then	replies,	“That	is	not	true,	actually.		Our	company	began	selling the	same	product	in	1996	and	our	sales	records	have	not	been	beaten	since	then.” The	social	engineer's	statement	is	a	form	of	elicitation	wherein	they	can	make the	 target	 respond	 with	 real	 facts.	 	 More	 often	 than	 not,	 people	 are	 likely	 to correct	a	wrong	information	or	statement	once	they	hear	them.		It	is	as	if	they	are being	 challenged	 to	 prove	 otherwise.	 	 It	 is	 inherent	 in	 people	 to	 appear knowledgeable,	inform	others,	and	be	unwilling	to	tolerate	misstatements.		Most social	engineers	know	this	and	use	it	to	bring	out	real	facts	from	their	targets.			 The	 DHS	 pamphlet	 also	 has	 a	 scenario	 wherein	 the	 attacker	 volunteers   information.	 	 Once	 a	 social	 engineer	 is	 able	 to	 offer	 information	 into	 a conversation	with	the	target,	the	latter	becomes	compelled	to	provide	an	equally valuable	 data.	 	 People	 are	 likely	 to	 share	 similar	 views,	 information,	 or	 news. Social	engineers	use	this	fact	to	set	the	mood	or	tone	of	the	conversation	while instilling	a	sense	of	obligation	to	their	target. Another	 manipulation	 tool	 that	 is	 discussed	 in	 the	 DHS	 pamphlet	 is	 assumed knowledge.		When	people	assume	that	someone	is	knowledgeable	in	a	particular topic	or	situation,	it	is	alright	to	discuss	it	with	them.		Social	engineers	are	able to	exploit	this	human	trait	deliberately	by	appearing	to	be	knowledgeable	in	a topic,	 then	 using	 elicitation	 to	 establish	 a	 conversation.	 	 Social	 engineers	 are good	 in	 producing	 information,	 which	 is	 as	 if	 they	 own	 such	 information	 and continue	to	build	around	it	to	keep	a	conversation. 	 Elicitation	and	Intelligent	Questions The	goal	of	social	engineering	with	elicitation	is	to	obtain	small	and	apparently invaluable	information	and	later	build	a	clear	picture	of	the	answers	they	want	to get	from	their	targets.		Asking	intelligent	questions	to	their	target	provides	social engineers	 to	 have	 a	 clear	 path	 of	 their	 goals.	 	 There	 are	 various	 types	 of questions	 they	 use	 in	 order	 to	 obtain	 answers	 that	 lead	 them	 to	 a	 successful attack. An	 open-ended	 question	 is	 a	 type	 of	 question,	 which	 is	 not	 answerable	 by	 a simple	yes	or	no.		For	instance,	“It's	a	little	hot	today,	huh?”	leads	to	a	“Yes.”	 However,	asking	“What	can	you	say	about	the	weather	today?”	leads	to	a	real response	of	more	than	a	yes	or	a	no. Social	engineers	know	when	to	use	open-ended	questions	through	studying	and analyzing	 prominent	 reporters.	 	 Naturally,	 good	 reporters	 use	 open-ended questions	so	that	they	can	continue	to	elicit	responses	from	their	interviewee. In	 the	 context	 of	 social	 engineering,	 open-ended	 questions	 using	 “how”	 and “why”	are	more	powerful.		This	is	because	it	compels	the	target	to	expand	on	his or	 her	 response.	 	 Furthermore,	 open-ended	 questions	 also	 compel	 targets	 to reveal	other	details	that	social	engineers	may	find	valuable. In	some	cases,	asking	open-ended	questions	lead	to	some	resistance.		As	such, social	 engineers	 use	 the	 pyramid	 approach	 where	 they	 begin	 with	 narrow questions	and	follow	them	up	with	broader	ones.		This	technique	is	evident	when   asking	teenagers.	 For	 instance,	 when	 a	 teenager	 is	 asked	 with	 open-ended	 questions	 such	 as “How's	school?”	it	will	be	replied	with	just	an	“Okay”	and	no	more	than	that.	 However,	if	asked	with	a	narrow	question	such	as	“What	type	of	Math	are	you doing	this	year?”	it	will	be	answered	with	“Algebra.”		Then,	the	narrow	question may	already	be	followed	up	with	broader	questions	to	get	the	teenager	to	talk more. Another	 type	 of	 intelligent	 questions	 that	 social	 engineers	 use	 is	 closed-ended question.		While	it	may	be	the	complete	opposite	of	open-ended	questions,	it	is likewise	efficient	in	leading	targets	where	the	social	engineer	wants	them	to	be.	 More	often	than	not,	the	goal	of	closed-ended	questions	is	to	obtained	detailed information	 instead	 of	 leading	 the	 target	 to	 the	 social	 engineer's	 goal.	 	 For instance,	 in	 an	 open-ended	 question,	 the	 social	 engineer	 might	 ask,	 “What relationship	do	you	have	with	your	manager?”		In	a	closed-ended	question,	on the	other	hand,	the	social	engineer	asks,	“Is	your	relationship	with	your	manager good?”		This	type	of	questioning	is	obtaining	direct	yet	detailed	responses	from the	target. Leading	 questions	 are	 those	 that	 combine	 the	 concepts	 of	 open-	 and	 closed- ended	 questions.	 	 This	 is	 because	 leading	 questions	 are	 similar	 to	 open-ended questions	but	leads	to	a	hint	towards	the	answer.		This	is	apparent	in	courtrooms when	lawyers	ask	questions	to	whoever	is	on	the	witness	stand.		For	instance, “On	July	5th	at	around	6:30am,	you	were	at	the	XYZ	restaurant,	weren't	you,	Mr. Phoenix?”		In	this	line	of	questioning,	the	lawyer	leads	the	witness	to	where	they want	 to	 and	 at	 the	 same	 time	 provides	 the	 witness	 the	 opportunity	 to	 express their	response.		In	addition,	this	type	of	question	preloads	the	witness	with	the idea	of	how	the	lawyer	acquired	knowledge	of	the	events. A	leading	question	is	usually	answered	with	a	simple	yes	or	no;	however,	it	is equipped	with	more	information,	which	makes	the	answer	more	informative	as well.	 	 Social	 engineers	 use	 leading	 questions	 to	 state	 facts,	 making	 the	 target either	agree	or	disagree. Assumptive	 questions	 are	 also	 intelligent	 questions	 where	 social	 engineers already	assume	that	the	target	possesses	valuable	information.		Through	asking assumptive	question,	the	target	responds	in	an	affirmative	or	disconcerting	way. For	instance,	in	a	scenario	where	a	law	enforcement	officer	questions	a	target	to know	where	Mr.	X	resides.		The	officer	asks,	“Where	does	Mr.	X	live?”		The   response	will	allow	the	officer	to	determine	whether	or	not	the	target	knows	Mr. X. In	 the	 context	 of	 social	 engineering,	 attackers	 utilize	 assumptive	 questions without	giving	the	whole	picture	to	the	targets.		This	is	because	the	target	may control	the	environment	and	remove	the	ability	of	the	social	engineer	to	govern the	situation. More	often	than	not,	social	engineers	use	assumptive	questions	when	they	have an	 idea	 of	 the	 facts,	 which	 they	 can	 utilize	 in	 the	 question.	 	 This	 means	 that social	engineers	inject	as	much	real	facts	as	possible	to	the	assumptive	question rather	than	including	bogus	information,	which	may	turn	off	their	target. 	   Pretexting Pretexting	is	referred	to	as	the	act	of	making	a	manufactured	scenario	that	causes a	target	to	either	do	an	action	or	divulge	information.		Pretexting	goes	beyond the	concept	of	lying.		There	are	situations	wherein	it	can	create	an	entire	new identity	 and	 using	 such	 identity	 to	 control	 the	 information	 received.	 	 In	 the context	 of	 social	 engineering,	 pretexting	 may	 involve	 posing	 as	 people	 in	 a certain	role	or	job,	which	the	attackers	never	have	done	themselves.			 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 pretexting	 is	 not	 as	 easy	 as	 it	 may	 seem	 even	 for	 social engineers.		For	instance,	social	engineers	need	to	develop	as	many	pretexts	as they	 can	 over	 their	 career.	 	 While	 pretext	 may	 be	 different	 in	 one	 situation	 to another,	their	common	factor	is	research.		Time	and	again	it	has	been	mentioned in	this	book	that	having	good	information	gathering	methods	can	either	make	or break	social	engineer's	ploy	and	even	an	excellent	pretext.		Take	for	example,	a social	engineer	posing	as	a	tech	support	representative.		This	act	is	futile	if	the social	engineer	does	not	utilize	outside	support. As	much	as	it	is	used	in	social	engineering,	there	are	other	fields	that	make	use of	 pretexting,	 including	 public	 speaking,	 sales,	 neurolinguistic	 programming  NLP 	experts,	so-called	fortune	tellers,	therapists,	doctors,	and	lawyers	among others.		All	of	them	make	use	of	pretexing	in	various	forms.		However,	they	also have	 to	 create	 a	 scenario	 in	 which	 clients	 or	 targets	 would	 be	 comfortable	 in divulging	information	that	they	would	not	normally	share.	 The	 only	 difference	 between	 social	 engineering	 and	 other	 fields	 that	 use pretexting	is	the	intention	or	goal.		This	is	to	say	that	social	engineers	should	live the	persona	until	they	achieve	success	in	their	ploys. The	 quality	 of	 the	 pretext	 goes	 hand	 in	 hand	 with	 the	 quality	 of	 information social	engineers	are	able	to	gather	about	their	targets.		This	means	that	when	a social	 engineer	 gathers	 more	 relevant	 and	 valuable	 information,	 the	 easier	 it would	be	to	develop	a	pretext	for	a	particular	target.	 Take	for	example	a	social	engineer	posing	as	a	tech	support	person.		The	pretext of	this	type	of	impersonation	would	fail	if	the	social	engineer	goes	to	a	company with	either	an	internal	or	outsourced	support.		Social	engineers	find	it	as	easy	to employ	their	pretexts	as	one	would	converse	naturally	with	a	friend. 	   Principles	of	Pretexting Just	 like	 any	 other	 skill,	 pretexing	 also	 involves	 principles	 that	 correspond	 to carrying	 out	 a	 task.	 	 Consequently,	 social	 engineers	 know	 these	 principles	 by heart,	which	is	why	they	are	exceptionally	good	at	the	skill. The	 principles	 of	 pretexting	 substantiate	 the	 significance	 of	 pretexting.	 	 These include	 the	 following:	 the	 more	 research	 conducted,	 the	 better	 the	 chances	 of success;	 the	 involvement	 of	 personal	 interests	 increases	 success;	 practice	 of expressions	 or	 dialects;	 using	 the	 phone	 as	 a	 significant	 part	 of	 a	 social engineering	ploy;	the	simpler	pretexts	are	developed,	the	better	the	chances	of success;	 pretexts	 should	 be	 spontaneous;	 and	 providing	 a	 follow	 through	 or logical	conclusion	for	the	target. The	more	research	conducted,	the	better	the	chances	of	success		Although	this principle	 may	 be	 self-explanatory,	 it	 is	 best	 to	 provide	 more	 details	 about	 it.	 Simply	 put,	 this	 principle	 associates	 the	 success	 level	 of	 a	 social	 engineering ploy	 to	 the	 depth	 and	 level	 of	 research	 that	 social	 engineers	 conduct.	 Information	 gathering	 is	 the	 most	 important	 factor	 to	 consider	 in	 a	 successful social	 engineering	 gig.	 	 This	 is	 to	 say	 that	 a	 social	 engineer	 holding	 more information	 about	 the	 target	 has	 better	 chances	 of	 success	 in	 developing	 an excellent	pretext. Social	 engineers	 refer	 to	 this	 principle	 in	 every	 action	 they	 take,	 specifically when	developing	pretexts.		They	are	aware	that	even	small	details	can	make	a difference	 in	 pretexting.	 	 In	 addition,	 they	 also	 know	 that	 any	 information gathered	is	relevant	and	useful.	 There	are	ways	that	social	engineers	use	when	gathering	information	and	as	they do	so,	they	also	look	for	aspects,	stories,	and	items	associated	with	their	targets.	 In	 some	 cases,	 they	 also	 look	 into	 the	 personal	 nature	 of	 their	 targets.	 	 Most social	engineers	use	the	emotional	or	personal	attachments	to	allow	them	to	get closer	to	their	targets.		For	instance,	finding	out	that	every	year,	the	CEO	of	a company	donates	a	substantial	amount	of	money	to	a	cancer	research	center	for children	would	allow	the	social	engineer	to	inject	a	fund	raising	for	such	cause	in his	 or	 her	 pretexts.	 	 It	 may	 seem	 heartless	 doing	 this,	 however,	 most	 social engineers	would	do	anything	just	to	achieve	their	goals.		Furthermore,	malicious social	engineers	make	use	of	pretexts,	which	are	sustained	by	emotions	without hesitation	or	second	thoughts.   In	 2011,	 after	 the	 terrorist	 attacks	 on	 the	 Twin	 Towers	 of	 the	 World	 Trade Center,	numerous	social	engineers	as	well	as	malicious	hackers	used	the	losses of	people	for	raising	funds	for	themselves	through	emails	and	websites.		These scammers	 targeted	 the	 computers	 of	 people	 and	 devised	 the	 accounts	 of legitimate	 fund	 raisers	 so	 that	 they	 can	 get	 the	 donations	 for	 themselves.	 Similarly,	in	2010,	after	the	earthquakes	that	occurred	in	Haiti	and	Chile,	many scammers	 developed	 websites,	 which	 posed	 as	 providing	 information	 on	 the people	 who	 were	 lost,	 victims	 of	 the	 natural	 disaster,	 or	 the	 seismic	 activity.	 These	 websites	 were	 embedded	 with	 malicious	 code	 that	 enabled	 the	 social engineers	to	hack	the	computers	of	hundreds,	if	not,	thousands	of	people. Another	 common	 scenario	 in	 which	 social	 engineers	 take	 advantage	 of developing	 excellent	 pretexts	 is	 after	 the	 death	 of	 a	 music	 or	 movie	 star.	 Naturally,	experts	on	marketing	and	search	engine	optimization	 SEO 	will	set up	the	search	engines	pulling	up	stories	about	the	star	in	just	a	few	hours.	 While	 these	 experts	 are	 doing	 their	 thing	 in	 their	 respective	 fields,	 social engineers	 take	 advantage	 of	 the	 increased	 attention	 given	 by	 people	 to	 search engines.	 	 Thus,	 they	 launch	 malicious	 websites,	 which	 feed	 upon	 a	 specific SEO.		 As	people	 are	drawn	 to	these	 websites,	the	 social	engineers	 are	able	 to gather	 information	 or	 infect	 the	 computers	 of	 people	 with	 viruses.	 	 Social engineers	 would	 then	 have	 better	 chances	 to	 research	 and	 gather	 information, making	their	chances	of	success	in	pretexting	highly	achievable.		Sadly,	there	are people	like	malicious	social	engineers	who	take	advantage	of	others'	misfortune. 	 The	 involvement	 of	 personal	 interests	 increases	 success.	 Social	 engineers	 are likely	to	increase	their	chances	of	success	in	pretexting	when	they	use	their	own personal	interests.		This	may	seem	a	simple	tactic,	but	it	can	definitely	convince targets	 that	 social	 engineers	 are	 credible.	 	 Trust	 and	 rapport	 are	 immediately ruined	if	a	social	engineer	claims	to	be	someone	who	is	knowledgeable	about	a specific	 topic	 and	 then	 comes	 short	 of	 information.	 	 For	 instance,	 if	 a	 social engineer	 posing	 as	 a	 tech	 support	 person	 has	 never	 seen	 a	 server	 room,	 yet continues	to	play	the	part	can	lead	to	ultimate	failure.		This	is	why	most	social engineers	 only	 include	 activities	 and	 topics	 in	 their	 pretexts	 that	 they	 are interested	 in.	 	 This	 provides	 them	 enough	 room	 to	 talk	 and	 display	 their intelligence	and	confidence	to	their	targets.		When	social	engineers	exude	with confidence,	it	is	easier	for	them	to	convince	their	target	that	they	are	what	they say.		   In	addition,	there	are	certain	pretexts	that	need	more	knowledge	than	others	in order	 to	 be	 convincing;	 which	 is	 why	 research	 is	 a	 recurring	 thing	 for	 social engineers.	 	 When	 a	 pretext	 is	 uncomplicated,	 social	 engineers	 simply	 read	 a book	or	search	on	a	few	websites. Regardless	 of	 how	 knowledge	 is	 obtained,	 social	 engineers	 usually	 research topics	that	they	are	personally	interested	in.		Once	they	have	chosen	an	interest, story,	service,	or	aspect	that	they	have	adequate	knowledge	in,	they	determine	if that	angle	is	feasible. When	 social	 engineers	 develop	 a	 pretext	 that	 lacks	 confidence,	 it	 creates dissonance,	especially	if	the	pretext	necessitates	that	the	social	engineers	should be	 automatically	 confident.	 	 Such	 dissonance	 results	 in	 red	 flags	 as	 well	 as impedes	 the	 establishment	 of	 trust	 and	 rapport	 between	 social	 engineers	 and their	targets.		Red	flags	and	barriers	can	affect	the	behavior	of	a	target	who	is anticipated	to	even	out	feelings	of	dissonance.		These	barriers	also	discard	any possibility	of	the	pretext	to	work.	 In	1957,	Dr.	Leon	Fe-stinger,	a	psychologist,	instituted	the	theory	of	cognitive dissonance,	 stating	 that	 people	 are	 likely	 to	 look	 for	 consistency	 within	 their opinions,	 beliefs,	 and	 all	 cognition.	 	 When	 inconsistency	 is	 present	 between people's	behaviors	and	attitudes,	a	change	should	be	employed	to	eliminate	the dissonance.	 	 According	 to	 Festinger,	 there	 are	 two	 factors	 that	 affects	 the intensity	or	level	of	dissonance.		These	are	the	number	of	dissonant	beliefs	and the	importance	of	every	belief. Festinger	 stated	 that	 dissonance	 can	 be	 eliminated	 by	 adding	 more	 consonant beliefs,	which	prevail	over	dissonant	beliefs;	changing	the	dissonant	beliefs	to make	them	consistent;	and	reducing	the	importance	of	dissonant	beliefs. Skilled	 social	 engineers	 are	 able	 to	 change	 dissonant	 beliefs	 to	 make	 them consistent.		This	is	one	of	their	powerful	yet	tricky	skills.		For	instance,	a	social engineer's	 appearance	 may	 not	 fit	 what	 the	 target	 has	 envisioned	 from	 the pretext;	however,	the	social	engineer	can	adjust	with	the	beliefs	of	the	target	by his	or	her	actions,	attitudes,	and	knowledge	of	the	pretext. 	 Practice	of	expressions	or	dialects.	Most	actors	all	over	the	world	have	dialect coaches	 who	 assist	 them	 in	 have	 the	 perfect	 target	 accent.	 	 Given	 that	 not	 all social	 engineers	 can	 afford	 dialect	 coaches,	 they	 simple	 learn	 from	 various publications	that	include	valuable	tips	on	the	basics	of	putting	an	accent	to	their   speech	 and	 expressions.	 	 These	 publications	 include	 native	 examples	 of	 the accent	 that	 social	 engineers	 want	 to	 learn.	 	 There	 are	 books	 that	 come	 with audiotapes	 in	 which	 social	 engineers	 listen	 to.	 	 They	 also	 speak	 along	 with audiotapes	and	practice	sounding	like	the	person	speaking. Once	social	engineers	become	confident	in	their	accent,	they	record	themselves to	assess	if	they	are	convincing	enough	and	correct	any	errors.		More	often	than not,	social	engineers	create	a	scenario	with	a	partner	so	they	can	practice	their new	 accent.	 	 They	 also	 try	 it	 on	 other	 people	 to	 check	 if	 their	 accent	 is believable. 	 Using	the	phone	as	a	significant	part	of	a	social	engineering	ploy.	Nowadays, the	 Internet	 dominates	 more	 social	 engineering	 aspects	 that	 are	 impersonal	 or objective.		Back	in	the	days,	social	engineers	use	the	phone	as	an	integral	part	of their	ploys.		Thus,	the	shift	resulted	in	most	social	engineers	to	exert	less	effort or	 energy	 in	 using	 the	 phone.	 	 However,	 highly-skilled	 or	 advanced	 social engineers	 know	 that	 the	 phone	 remains	 as	 one	 of	 the	 most	 effective	 tools	 for their	 ploys	 and	 that	 using	 it	 should	 not	 be	 reduced	 due	 to	 the	 Internet's impersonal	nature. In	 some	 cases,	 social	 engineers	 who	 plan	 attacks	 using	 the	 phone	 may	 think differently	 as	 using	 the	 Internet	 is	 much	 easier	 to	 plan.	 	 Social	 engineering attacks	 that	 are	 phone-based	 are	 given	 the	 same	 level	 and	 depth	 of	 effort, information	gathering,	and	research	as	with	any	other	attacks.		They	are	also	of the	same	level	of	practice. Social	engineers	usually	practice	and	hone	their	phone-based	skills	by	learning to	 deal	 with	 the	 “unknowns”	 or	 unexpected,	 specifically	 if	 they	 accidentally altered	something	in	their	script,	throwing	them	of	their	base. Social	engineers,	particularly	those	who	work	alone	or	do	not	have	anybody	to practice	their	phone-based	skills	with,	are	creative	enough	to	ensure	that	they	are able	 to	 hone	 such	 skills.	 	 For	 instance,	 they	 try	 to	 call	 their	 friends	 or	 family members	to	know	how	convincing	they	are	and	how	far	they	would	be	able	to trick	them. Social	engineers	who	use	the	phone	know	that	it	is	one	of	the	quickest	solutions to	 get	 close	 to	 their	 target.	 	 The	 phone	 gives	 them	 the	 opportunity	 to	 fake	 or “spoof”	anything	they	want	to	tell	their	target.   Moreover,	social	engineers	also	spoof	the	information	appearing	in	the	target's caller	ID.		They	use	services	or	homegrown	solutions	to	tell	the	target	that	they are	 calling	 from	 a	 local	 bank,	 a	 corporate	 headquarters,	 and	 even	 the	 White House.		These	types	of	services	allow	social	engineers	to	spoof	the	number	and make	it	appear	that	it	is	coming	from	anywhere	all	over	the	world. Hence,	the	phone	is	a	powerful	social	engineering	tool	that	solidifies	pretexting.	 Social	 engineers	 spend	 time	 in	 developing	 the	 habit	 of	 using	 the	 phone	 and treating	it	with	respect	as	an	efficient	tool	set	for	their	pretext. 	 The	 simpler	 pretexts	 are	 developed,	 the	 better	 the	 chances	 of	 success.	 This	 is based	on	the	principle,	“the	simpler,	the	better.”		If	a	social	engineer	creates	a pretext	 with	 too	 many	 details	 and	 forgets	 even	 one	 little	 detail,	 the	 social engineering	act	is	likely	to	fail.		In	order	to	establish	credibility,	social	engineers keep	their	facts,	details,	and	story	lines	as	simple	as	can	be.		In	addition,	it	is highly	impossible	for	social	engineers	to	remember	all	the	pretexts	they	created; as	such,	they	keep	pretexts	simple,	natural,	and	easy	to	remember.	 Moreover,	apart	from	remembering	the	facts,	the	details	of	a	pretext	should	also be	kept	small.		Social	engineers	know	that	keeping	their	pretexts	simple	paves the	way	for	their	story	to	grow	as	well	as	allow	their	target	to	fill	the	gaps	using his her	imagination.		Pretexts	should	not	be	elaborate.		More	often	than	not,	tiny details	make	the	difference	in	the	manner	the	target	views	the	pretext. Then	 again,	 there	 are	 some	 social	 engineers	 who	 deliberately	 make	 a	 few mistakes	in	their	pretexts.		Even	famous	con	men	and	criminals	purposely	inject a	few	mistakes	based	on	the	premise	that	“nobody	is	perfect.”		In	addition,	most targets	become	more	at	ease	when	the	person	they	are	talking	to	makes	even	just little	mistakes.		It	could	be	intimidating	if	social	engineers	are	all	too	perfect	for their	target. In	social	engineering,	the	types	of	mistakes	that	attackers	decide	to	make	are	also calculated.	 	 While	 mistakes	 can	 complicate	 a	 pretext,	 they	 can	 also	 make	 it appear	natural.		The	key	of	social	engineers,	whether	or	not	they	plan	to	inject mistakes,	is	to	keep	their	pretexts	simple. Apart	from	creating	a	simple	and	uncomplicated	storyline,	social	engineers	back it	 up	 with	 appropriate	 tools	 and	 clothing,	 which	 can	 make	 the	 pretext	 more convincing.		More	often	than	not,	the	lack	of	detail	makes	a	pretext	workable and	more	believable.   For	instance,	a	social	engineer	that	makes	use	of	the	pretext	of	a	tech	support person	is	likely	to	wear	a	pair	of	khakis	and	polo	shirt	coupled	with	a	small	tool bag	 for	 fixing	 computers.	 	 In	 most	 cases,	 this	 actually	 works	 with	 the	 target, providing	room	for	the	social	engineer	to	enter	and	move	freely	with	minimal supervision.			 	 Pretexts	should	be	spontaneous.	Creating	a	spontaneous	pretext	is	comparable	to using	 an	 outline	 over	 using	 a	 script.	 	 When	 a	 social	 engineer	 makes	 use	 of outlines,	 it	 provides	 him	 or	 her	 spontaneity	 and	 more	 freedom	 to	 edit	 as necessary.	 	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 using	 a	 script	 makes	 a	 social	 engineer	 sound unnatural,	even	robotic.	 Spontaneity	in	pretexts	is	also	associated	with	using	a	storyline	that	the	social engineer	is	personally	interested	in.		Coming	in	to	the	target	without	knowledge about	 the	 pretext	 can	 compromise	 the	 credibility	 of	 the	 social	 engineer.	 	 For instance,	if	the	target	asks	something	or	makes	a	statement,	requiring	the	social engineer	to	think,	the	latter	is	likely	to	pause	and	start	thinking	deeply	if	he	or she	 cannot	 reply	 with	 an	 intelligent	 answer.	 	 Naturally,	 people	 think	 prior	 to speaking;	 however,	 social	 engineers	 know	 that	 it	 is	 not	 about	 being	 able	 to answer	 in	 just	 a	 second.	 	 It	 is	 having	 a	 reason	 or	 answer	 for	 not	 having	 the answer	to	the	target's	inquiry	or	statement. Social	engineers	follow	a	certain	guideline	when	it	comes	to	the	spontaneity	of their	 pretexts.	 	 These	 include	 not	 thinking	 about	 how	 they	 feel;	 not	 taking themselves	 too	 seriously;	 discerning	 what	 is	 relevant;	 and	 seeking	 to	 gain experience. When	 creating	 pretexts,	 social	 engineers	 are	 inclined	 to	 overthink	 and	 add emotion	 into	 their	 storyline.	 	 However,	 this	 can	 lead	 to	 anxiety,	 fear,	 or nervousness	 and	 ultimately,	 failure	 of	 the	 pretext.	 	 Some	 may	 not	 experience fear,	 but	 over-excitement.	 	 This	 likewise	 causes	 a	 social	 engineer	 to	 make numerous	mistakes	and	again,	lead	to	the	failure	of	the	pretext.		As	such,	social engineers	make	sure	that	they	do	not	think	about	how	they	feel	while	creating their	pretexts. Social	engineers	also	avoid	taking	themselves	too	seriously.		While	their	jobs	are serious	as	it	deals	with	security,	social	engineers	are	still	able	to	laugh	at	their mistakes.	 	 This	 allows	 them	 to	 handle	 the	 bumps	 that	 may	 come	 in	 their	 way instead	of	feeling	nervous	or	cramming	up.		This	does	not	entail	taking	security   as	 a	 laughing	 matter.	 However,	 social	 engineers	 know	 that	 if	 they	 become pressured	 or	 think	 of	 a	 potential	 failure	 as	 irreversible,	 the	 create	 fear	 within themselves.		Thus,	they	know	that	minor	failures	are	normal	and	that	they	have the	capability	to	reverse	them. Social	engineers	also	know	how	to	discern	what	is	relevant.		For	instance,	social engineers	usually	plan	ahead.		If	they	miss	out	on	one	important	detail,	they	have the	ability	to	discern	the	relevant	information	or	material	around	them.		This	may include	the	target's	microexpressions,	body	language,	or	words	spoken.		Social engineers	take	in	the	information	and	employ	it	to	their	attack. In	addition,	social	engineers	know	that	generally,	people	are	able	to	identify	if someone	 is	 not	 paying	 attention	 to	 what	 they	 are	 saying.	 	 Targets	 are	 often turned	off	if	they	feel	that	they	are	not	being	listened	to.		People	like	others	who listen	to	even	the	insignificant	statements	they	utter.		As	such,	social	engineers listen	 carefully	 and	 consistently	 to	 what	 their	 target	 is	 saying.	 	 They	 pay attention	while	picking	up	relevant	details	that	may	help	in	the	success	of	their attack. Finally,	social	engineers	always	seek	to	gain	experience	through	practice.		This is	because	they	know	that	practice	can	either	make	or	break	their	pretext.		As mentioned	 in	 the	 previous	 sections,	 social	 engineers	 who	 work	 alone	 practice their	acts	with	friends	and	families.		Some	even	try	their	tactics	with	strangers without	causing	any	harm.			Social	engineers	strike	up	conversations	with	other people	to	practice	their	spontaneity	and	improve	as	necessary	until	they	become comfortable. 	 Providing	a	follow	through	or	logical	conclusion	for	the	target.	Although	some may	deny	it,	most	people	like	it	when	they	are	told	what	to	do.		For	instance,	if	a doctor	walks	in,	checks	over	the	patient,	writes	notes	on	his	chart,	and	simply tells	the	patient,	“See	you	in	two	weeks,”	it	is	unacceptable	on	the	part	of	the patient.		Naturally,	the	patient	would	want	to	know	what	is	wrong	and	what	he	or she	should	do	regardless	if	the	prognosis	is	bad. In	the	context	of	social	engineering,	the	attackers	do	not	merely	leave	their	target alone.		Social	engineers	either	lead	the	target	to	take	action	or	simply	provide	a conclusion.	 	 Regardless	 of	 the	 situation,	 social	 engineers	 give	 their	 target	 a follow-through	 so	 that	 he	 or	 she	 may	 fill	 the	 expected	 gaps	 or	 provide	 a conclusion	for	the	target.   A	great	example	would	be	the	social	engineer	posing	for	a	tech	support	person.	 If	the	social	engineer	simply	walks	out	without	saying	a	word	to	the	target	after exploiting	 the	 database,	 they	 social	 engineer	 leaves	 the	 target	 wondering	 what transpired.		The	target	would	possibly	call	another	tech	support	company	and	ask what	he	or	she	needs	to	do.		At	any	rate,	social	engineers	do	not	simply	walk away	 from	 their	 targets.	 	 Again,	 they	 either	 follow-through	 or	 provide	 a conclusion	for	their	targets. 	   Influence	and	Persuasion Apart	from	the	four	basic	psychological	tactics	mentioned	previously,	there	are other	 psychological	 techniques	 involved	 in	 social	 engineering.	 	 These	 include influence	and	persuasion. Social	engineering	psychology,	just	like	psychology	in	general,	has	a	set	of	rules that	 produces	 a	 result	 when	 followed.	 	 It	 is	 both	 calculated	 and	 scientific.	 Persuasion	and	influence	are	psychological	cognitive	factors,	which	are	backed up	 by	 science.	 	 While	 they	 are	 psychological	 results	 of	 perception,	 they	 also involve	beliefs	and	emotions. The	 art	 of	 influence	 and	 persuasion	 is	 a	 process	 of	 causing	 someone	 else	 to think,	do,	react,	or	believe	in	a	manner	that	another	individual	wants	them	to.	 People	 use	 the	 art	 of	 influence	 and	 persuasion	 in	 their	 everyday	 dealings.	 Unfortunately,	scammers,	malicious	attackers,	and	social	engineers	also	use	this art	in	their	ploys.				 More	 often	 than	 not,	 true	 influence	 is	 smooth	 and	 undetectable	 to	 individuals being	 influenced.	 	 When	 you	 are	 knowledgeable	 in	 the	 methods	 of	 influence, you	will	notice	that	billboards	and	commercials	use	the	art.		Probably	the	people who	use	the	art	of	influence	and	persuasion	most	of	the	time	come	from	groups of	salespersons	and	marketing	people.		As	you	become	aware	of	the	art,	you	start to	 notice	 the	 terrible	 billboards	 and	 commercials	 while	 you	 drive	 along	 busy streets.					 Prior	to	learning	how	social	engineers	utilize	the	art	of	influence	and	persuasion, it	is	proper	to	introduce	you	to	some	of	the	art's	key	elements	as	well	as	its	five fundamentals	 that	 lead	 to	 obtaining	 success	 in	 influencing	 a	 target.	 	 The	 next section	covers	all	pertinent	information	that	you	would	need	to	understand	how social	engineers	are	able	to	use	the	art	of	influence	and	persuasion	in	their	ploys. 	   Five	Fundamentals	of	Influence	and	Persuasion The	 five	 fundamentals	 that	 are	 significant	 in	 a	 successful	 ploy	 to	 influence	 a target	 include	 the	 following:	 set	 clear	 goals,	 build	 rapport,	 be	 observant	 of surroundings,	be	flexible,	and	get	in	touch	with	yourself. The	ultimate	objective	of	social	engineering	is	to	be	able	to	influence	targets	to carry	 out	 actions	 whether	 or	 not	 such	 actions	 would	 be	 in	 their	 best	 interest.	 Furthermore,	social	engineering	not	only	influences	targets	to	take	action.		The type	of	influence	that	social	engineering	uses	is	powerful	that	it	makes	targets “want”	to	take	actions. To	understand	how	social	engineering	can	have	such	powerful	influence	on	their targets,	go	on	to	the	next	section. 	 Set	Clear	Goals.	One	of	the	most	important	aspects	of	the	art	of	influence	and persuasion	is	knowing	what	result	you	want	to	achieve	out	of	your	actions.		In social	engineering,	attackers	approach	a	target	with	a	vivid	knowledge	of	their goals	as	well	as	the	indicators	that	they	would	achieve	what	they	want.		Once social	engineers	have	set	clear	goals,	they	would	be	able	to	determine	that	path that	 they	 need	 to	 take	 to	 carry	 out	 their	 ploy.	 	 Having	 goals	 that	 are	 clearly defined	 could	 result	 in	 either	 the	 success	 or	 failure	 of	 the	 influence	 tactic.	 	 In addition,	it	can	also	make	the	next	step	easier	to	determine,	master,	and	execute. 	 Build	 Rapport.	 In	 order	 to	 develop	 and	 establish	 rapport,	 you	 need	 to	 get	 the attention	of	the	other	individual	you	are	targeting.		In	addition,	you	should	be able	to	affect	his	unconscious	mind.		Social	engineers	have	advanced	skills	in building	 rapport	 as	 it	 changes	 their	 entire	 methodology.	 	 They	 are	 aware	 that once	they	establish	rapport	with	their	targets,	everything	will	flow	smoothly	with their	dealings.					 	 Be	Observant.	When	it	comes	to	being	observant,	it	entails	awareness	of	yourself as	well	as	your	sensory	acuity	or	surroundings.		When	you	are	observant,	you have	the	ability	to	take	note	of	the	signs	in	the	individual	that	you	are	targeting, which	will	indicate	whether	or	not	you	are	moving	towards	the	right	path.		If	you want	to	master	the	art	of	influence	and	persuasion,	you	need	to	be	a	master	in   observing	and	listening.	 Social	 engineers	 avoid	 thinking	 about	 their	 next	 stage	 of	 their	 ploy	 when approaching	the	target.		This	is	because	they	can	miss	out	on	what	is	truly	going on	 between	 them	 and	 their	 target.	 	 Internal	 dialogues	 can	 stop	 potential conversations,	which	is	why	social	engineers	avoid	them. 	 Be	Flexible.	One	of	the	keys	to	a	successful	persuasion	tactic	is	being	flexible.	 In	order	to	understand	the	concept	of	flexibility,	think	of	it	as	being	tasked	to bend	something	like	a	steel	rod	or	a	branch	of	a	sturdy	tree.		Many	people	would choose	to	bend	the	branch	because	it	is	easier	to	bend	than	the	steel	rod,	making the	task	realizable.		When	it	comes	to	persuading	people,	it	is	important	to	learn how	to	yield	and	be	flexible. Social	 engineers	 are	 flexible	 enough	 to	 adjust	 their	 objectives	 and	 tactics	 as necessary.	 	 While	 it	 may	 contradict	 the	 concept	 of	 planning,	 being	 flexible entails	 the	 ability	 to	 adapt	 when	 things	 are	 not	 going	 as	 planned.	 	 Inflexible social	 engineers	 may	 be	 viewed	 as	 insane	 and	 unreasonable	 individuals	 in	 the eyes	of	their	targets;	thus,	they	would	not	be	able	to	achieve	their	goals. 	 Be	in	Touch	with	Yourself.	In	everything	you	do,	your	emotions	take	control.	 This	 is	 also	 true	 for	 all	 individuals	 you	 are	 dealing	 with.	 	 It	 is	 necessary	 to discern	your	emotions	and	be	in	touch	with	yourself	so	that	you	can	determine the	foundation	for	a	successful	influence	and	persuasion	tactic. For	 instance,	 if	 you	 have	 a	 smoking	 friend	 and	 you	 truly	 hate	 the	 smell	 of smoke,	such	hatred	can	affect	your	approach	when	trying	to	persuade	her	to	quit the	habit.		Your	hatred	towards	smoking	can	cause	you	to	express,	act,	say,	or	do something	that	will	stop	your	chance	to	persuade	your	friend.		This	is	why	it	is important	 to	 be	 in	 touch	 with	 yourself	 and	 your	 emotions	 so	 as	 not	 to compromise	your	approach.	 Social	engineers	are	always	in	control	of	themselves	and	their	emotions.		This	is because	being	in	touch	with	themselves	help	them	in	establishing	a	clear	path toward	persuading	their	targets.							 The	 five	 fundamentals	 of	 in understanding	the	art.		The	goal	of	persuasion	is	to	establish	an	environment	in  influence	 and	 persuasion	 are	 significant	   which	a	target	would	want	to	perform	what	social	engineers	are	requesting	them to	 do.	 	 These	 five	 fundamentals	 are	 of	 enormous	 help	 in	 establishing	 such environment. 	   How	Social	Engineers	Use	the	Fundamentals	of  Influence	and	Persuasion  In	order	to	carry	out	their	ploys	successfully,	social	engineers	should	practice	the art	 of	 influence	 and	 persuasion	 until	 it	 becomes	 habitual.	 	 They	 need	 not influence	each	and	every	individual	they	come	in	contact	with;	however,	once they	 are	 able	 to	 turn	 the	 skill	 of	 persuasion	 on	 and	 off,	 it	 becomes	 a	 social engineer's	powerful	attribute. There	are	various	aspects	of	influence	and	persuasion	that	individuals	could	use, but	 eight	 techniques	 stand	 out	 as	 they	 are	 utilized	 frequently	 by	 politicians, media,	government,	scammers,	con	men,	and	social	engineers. 	   Techniques	of	Influence	and	Persuasion Reciprocation	 The	 inherent	 expectation	 of	 people	 to	 be	 treated	 the	 way	 they	 treat	 others	 is referred	 to	 as	 reciprocity.	 	 For	 instance,	 if	 you	 open	 a	 door	 for	 someone,	 you expect	him	or	her	to	say	thank	you	while	making	sure	you	keep	the	door	open	as he	or	she	comes	in.		It	is	important	to	know	the	rule	of	reciprocity	given	that returned	favor	is	usually	done	unconsciously.	 Social	engineers	are	always	looking	for	even	small	opportunities	in	which	they will	obtain	valuable	information.		More	often	than	not,	they	obtain	information by	making	their	target	feel	indebted	to	them.		In	addition,	social	engineers	are extremely	 aware	 of	 what	 goes	 on	 around	 them	 as	 well	 as	 the	 little	 things	 that they	can	to	make	their	targets	act	out	of	reciprocation.		They	act	as	natural	as they	 can	 so	 that	 their	 targets	 would	 not	 sense	 anything	 unusual	 about	 them.	 Thus,	 reciprocity	 is	 a	 an	 effective	 tactic	 of	 influence	 and	 persuasion	 when carried	out	naturally. 	   Obligation	 Obligation	 refers	 to	 a	 state	 of	 being	 wherein	 an	 individual	 is	 adhered	 to	 do something	due	to	a	sort	of	legal,	social,	or	moral	responsibility,	contract,	duty,	or promise.		In	social	engineering,	obligation	is	much	like	reciprocation,	only	in	a broader	sense.		For	instance,	simply	holding	an	outer	door	for	a	target	is	a	form of	 obligation	 in	 the	 context	 of	 social	 engineering.	 	 In	 turn,	 the	 target	 will	 be obligated	to	hold	the	inner	door	for	the	social	engineer. More	 often	 than	 not,	 social	 engineers	 use	 obligation	 as	 an	 attack	 factor, specifically	 when	 they	 are	 targeting	 individuals	 from	 customer	 service departments.		They	also	use	obligation	for	smart	complimenting.		For	instance,	a social	 engineer	 compliments	 the	 target	 and	 follows	 it	 up	 with	 a	 request	 for something.	 	 This	 is	 a	 technique,	 which	 can	 go	 wrong	 easily	 when	 the	 social engineer	 is	 inexperienced	 and	 misjudges	 the	 signals	 of	 the	 inner	 sense	 of	 the target.		However,	for	advanced	social	engineers,	obligation	allows	them	to	obtain event	the	tiniest	bit	of	pertinent	information	as	they	carry	out	their	ploys. 	 Concession Concession	refers	to	the	act	of	yielding	or	conceding.		It	is	similar	to	the	act	of admitting	 or	 acknowledging	 something.	 	 In	 the	 context	 of	 social	 engineering, concession	 is	 used	 to	 assist	 in	 touching	 a	 target's	 reciprocation	 instinct.	 	 In general,	people	may	seem	to	have	an	inherent	capacity	that	compels	them	to	do something	for	others	as	others	have	done	for	them. Social	 engineers	 use	 concession	 in	 their	 ploys	 based	 on	 the	 principle	 of “scratching	 the	 back	 of	 their	 targets	 as	 long	 as	 the	 latter	 scratches	 theirs.”	 Furthermore,	 social	 engineers	 follow	 some	 basic	 principles	 when	 applying concession	to	their	attacks.		These	include	labeling	their	concessions,	demanding and	 defining	 reciprocity,	 making	 contingent	 concessions,	 and	 creating concessions	in	installment	basis. When	it	comes	to	labeling,	social	engineers	make	their	targets	aware	of	what	and when	 they	 are	 conceding.	 	 This	 technique	 makes	 it	 harder	 for	 the	 targets	 to dismiss	the	need	to	reciprocate.		Social	engineers	usually	use	the	statements	“I will	 meet	 you	 halfway”	 or	 “I	 will	 give	 you	 this	 one”	 to	 show	 that	 they	 are conceding.	   When	it	comes	to	demanding	and	defining	reciprocity,	social	engineers	start	with a	 foundation	 of	 reciprocity	 in	 order	 to	 increase	 their	 chances	 of	 obtaining something	in	return	from	their	targets.		For	instance,	attackers	may	start	through nonverbal	 communication	 with	 their	 targets	 to	 show	 their	 flexibility.	 	 While these	may	be	little	things,	they	can	eventually	lead	to	great	results	in	terms	of building	a	sense	of	reciprocation	on	the	part	of	the	targets. When	it	comes	to	making	contingent	concessions,	social	engineers	usually	give in	to	something	that	their	targets	need	or	want	without	demanding	something	in return.		Concessions	such	 as	this	are	“risk-free”	 and	especially	effective	 when social	engineers	need	to	let	their	targets	know	that	they	are	ready	to	concede.		It is	 a	 way	 to	 avoid	 making	 the	 targets	 feel	 that	 there	 is	 something	 the	 social engineers	need	from	them. Finally,	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 creating	 concessions	 in	 installment	 basis,	 social engineers	give	in	a	little	during	their	first	attempt	and	another	over	time	so	that their	targets	would	continue	to	reciprocate.		Given	that	reciprocity	is	inherent	in people,	they	are	usually	obligated	to	give	in	when	someone	makes	a	concession, say,	in	a	bargaining	agreement	or	negotiation	process. It	 is	 important	 to	 know	 that	 social	 engineers	 as	 well	 as	 negotiators	 and salespeople	use	concessions	almost	instinctively.		These	people	are	able	to	use concessions	 by	 taking	 over	 the	 situation	 and	 resisting	 the	 manipulations	 that their	targets	place	upon	them.		 	 Scarcity In	most	cases,	people	find	items	and	even	opportunities	more	appealing	if	they are	hard	to	obtain,	rare,	or	scarce.		People	are	likely	to	be	attracted	to	messages in	radio,	television,	and	newspapers	ads	such	as	“3-Day	Sale,”	“Limited	Time Only,”	 “Going	 Out	 of	 Business	 Forever,”	 and	 “Last	 Day.”	 	 Generally,	 these messages	 lure	 	 	 	 	 	 	 people	 to	 get	 a	 share	 of	 items,	 products,	 or	 opportunities, which	 may	 no	 longer	 be	 available.	 	 In	 the	 context	 of	 sales,	 using	 scarcity	 is widely	known	with	catch	phrases	such	as	“first	100	callers	are	entitled	to	a	free widget”	or	“act	now	while	supplies	last.” In	 the	 context	 of	 social	 engineering,	 scarcity	 is	 used	 to	 establish	 a	 sense	 of urgency	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 decision-making	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 target.	 	 Such urgency	often	allows	social	engineers	to	manipulate	the	decision-making	as	well as	control	the	information	they	give	to	the	target.		Social	engineers	usually	use	a   combination	of	the	principles	of	scarcity	and	authority.	 Take	 for	 example	 a	 social	 engineer	 posing	 as	 an	 IT	 technician	 targeting	 an assistant	of	a	chief	executive	officer	 CEO .		The	social	engineer	would	claim that	the	CEO	called	him	prior	to	leaving	for	the	long	weekend	to	fix	an	email problem.		In	addition,	the	social	engineer	tells	the	assistant	that	the	CEO	claimed of	being	sick	and	tired	of	the	crashes	and	wanted	the	problem	fixed	by	Monday.	 In	 this	 case,	 the	 social	 engineer	 creates	 a	 sense	 of	 urgency	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the target	given	that	the	CEO	is	unavailable.		Furthermore,	the	scarce	item	is	time given	that	the	problem	should	be	dealt	before	the	CEO	returns	for	work.		Thus, scarcity	establishes	a	desire,	which	leads	a	target	to	make	a	decision	at	once. 	 Authority When	 people	 view	 someone	 as	 an	 authority,	 they	 tend	 to	 be	 more	 willing	 to abide	by	recommendations	or	directions	given	by	that	individual.		For	instance, children	 are	 instructed	 to	 obey	 their	 parents,	 teachers,	 nannies,	 and	 counselors among	 others	 because	 these	 people	 have	 authority	 over	 them.	 	 Furthermore, children	are	also	taught	that	questioning	or	disobeying	authority	is	disrespectful and	that	they	will	be	rewarded	for	their	obedience.		These	principles	are	carried over	into	adulthood.		This	is	why	people	respect	and	avoid	questioning	orders and	rules	by	authority	figures. Regrettably,	this	is	the	same	principle	that	often	leads	many	women	and	children into	 the	 hands	 of	 molesters	 and	 abusers.	 	 While	 the	 cause	 of	 molestation	 and abuse	 is	 not	 solely	 based	 on	 this	 principle,	 individuals	 who	 victimize	 children know	that	the	latter	are	taught	about	authority.		In	the	same	way,	social	engineers make	use	of	the	principle	of	authority	to	carry	out	their	ploys	by	manipulating their	targets	to	take	action,	leading	to	a	breach. 	 Commitment	and	Consistency As	much	as	people	want	to	be	consistent	in	their	behavior,	they	also	value	the consistency	of	others.		In	general,	people	want	congruency	and	consistency	in words,	 deeds,	 and	 attitudes	 both	 of	 themselves	 and	 others.	 	 The	 need	 for reprocessing	 information	 and	 making	 complex	 decisions	 are	 reduced	 through having	consistency.   Social	engineers	make	use	of	consistency	and	commitment	as	powerful	tools	for carrying	out	their	ploys.		Once	they	establish	a	form	of	communication	with	their targets,	 they	 commit	 themselves	 entirely	 until	 they	 accomplish	 their	 goals.	 When	social	engineers	sense	that	their	targets	are	using	gut	feelings	in	making	a decision,	they	work	doubly	hard	using	commitment	and	consistency.		This	is	to discard	any	uncertainty	that	their	targets	might	sense	in	them. 	 Liking In	 general,	 when	 people	 like	 an	 individual,	 it	 is	 because	 that	 individual	 likes them,	 too.	 	 In	 the	 context	 of	 social	 engineering,	 liking	 is	 an	 extremely	 useful tool.		One	of	the	important	attributes	that	social	engineers	should	have	is	being likeable.		In	addition,	as	social	engineers	need	to	gain	the	trust	of	their	targets, they	 appear	 to	 be	 interested	 in	 people	 in	 a	 genuine	 manner.	 	 For	 instance,	 in pretexting,	social	engineers	become	the	individual	that	they	are	pretexting	more than	 just	 playing	 out	 a	 belief	 or	 an	 idea.	 	 This	 makes	 it	 easier	 for	 them	 to	 be likable	 as	 their	 targets	 would	 conceive	 that	 they	 are	 genuinely	 interested	 in liking,	assisting,	or	helping	the	targets. 	 Social	Proof	or	Consensus Social	proof	or	consensus	is	referred	to	as	a	psychological	state	wherein	people are	 ineffective	 in	 discerning	 the	 proper	 mode	 of	 behavior	 in	 social	 situations.	 When	people	are	talking	or	acting	in	a	certain	way,	it	is	safe	to	assume	that	their behavior	is	appropriate.		Generally,	social	influence	can	result	in	conformity	of large	groups	of	people	regardless	if	the	choices	are	correct	or	misguided.		For instance,	people	who	are	in	an	unfamiliar	situation,	especially	if	they	do	not	have a	reference	on	how	to	act	in	the	situation,	tend	to	look	for	the	behavior	of	others whom	 they	 know	 are	 already	 familiar	 and	 better	 informed	 of	 the	 situation.	 Furthermore,	they	mirror	the	behavior	of	those	people	with	the	assumption	that	it is	the	appropriate	way	to	act. In	the	context	of	social	engineering,	social	proof	is	yet	another	powerful	tool.	 Social	engineers	use	social	proof	to	provoke	the	compliance	of	their	targets	with a	 request	 through	 informing	 them	 that	 other	 individuals	 also	 took	 the	 same behavior	or	action.		More	often	than	not,	social	engineers	refer	to	role	models	or prominent	individuals	in	order	to	get	their	targets	to	do	what	they	want.	   Social	 engineers	 use	 social	 proof,	 especially	 when	 there	 is	 uncertainty	 and similarity	in	a	specific	situation.		For	instance,	social	engineers	know	when	the targets	are	unsure	due	to	an	evasive	situation	because	the	targets	tend	to	observe how	others	behave	and	assume	such	behavior	as	appropriate.		Social	engineers also	know	when	the	targets	tend	to	mirror	or	follow	the	behavior	of	others	in	a specific	 situation.	 	 These	 conditions	 make	 it	 easier	 for	 social	 engineers	 to	 use social	proof.		They	will	appear	to	be	more	convincing	when	they	tell	their	targets that	many	people	before	them	have	done	the	same	action. The	 influence	 tactics	 discussed	 above	 are	 just	 some	 of	 the	 powerful	 tools	 that social	 engineers	 use	 to	 carry	 out	 their	 ploys.	 	 These	 tactics	 provide	 social engineers	the	ability	to	stimulate	and	motivate	people	to	act	according	to	their objective.		Thus,	social	engineers	become	in	control	of	any	situation.				 In	social	engineering,	the	art	of	influence	and	persuasion	is	a	process	wherein social	engineers	get	their	targets	into	wanting	to	think,	do,	believe,	and	react	in the	manner	they	want	them	to.	 	 	 	 	 	   Chapter	3:	Social	Engineering	Tools  	 Apart	from	psychological	principles,	social	engineering	also	uses	a	decent	tool set	that	can	make	or	break	a	social	engineer's	ability	to	achieve	success	in	his	or her	ploy.		Most	productive	social	engineers	have	the	adequate	knowledge	in	use the	tools,	which	closes	in	the	break	between	failure	and	success. It	is	important	to	take	note	that	social	engineers	who	merely	possess	the	tools, even	the	best	or	most	expensive	ones,	will	not	guarantee	success	in	their	ploys.	 The	 tools	 only	 allow	 social	 engineers	 to	 enhance	 their	 security	 practice, especially	when	they	are	executing	their	attacks.	 Social	engineering	has	three	categories	of	tools,	including	physical	tools,	phone tools,	and	software-based	tools. 	   Physical	Tools Physical	security	refers	to	measures,	which	people	or	companies	utilize	to	keep them	secure	without	the	involvement	of	computers.		It	usually	involves	motion cameras,	locks,	and	window	sensors	among	others.		In	social	engineering,	it	is important	 to	 understand	 how	 physical	 security	 works	 just	 as	 it	 is	 valuable	 for ordinary	people	to	understand	simply	security	mechanisms. For	instance,	lock	picking,	as	portrayed	on	television	and	in	the	movies	is	simply putting	 a	 lock	 pick	 in	 and	 the	 door	 opens	 instantly.	 	 Some	 people	 have knowledge	in	lock	picking;	however,	most	people	learn	how	to	do	it	slowly	with countless	attempts,	frustration,	and	tension.		A	skill	that	is	associated	with	lock picking	is	raking.		It	is	using	a	raking	tools	and	sliding	it	in	and	out	of	the	lock gently	with	minimal	pressure	to	the	tension	wrench.		More	often	than	not,	lock picking	coupled	with	raking	works	on	most	types	of	locks,	making	the	breach	as simple	 and	 effortless	 as	 possible.	 	 Social	 engineers	 learn	 the	 skills	 of	 lock picking	and	raking	efficiently	to	conduct	their	ploys. Today,	 a	 number	 of	 companies	 and	 organizations	 are	 using	 RFID,	 magnetic cards,	and	other	types	of	electronic	badges,	making	lock	picks	almost	obsolete.	 For	instance,	in	2004,	Wal-Mart	has	launched	a	pilot	program	by	making	use	of radio	frequency	identification	 RFID 	technology	in	relation	to	its	strategic	plan of	using	inventory-tracking	tags	for	its	top	suppliers.		RFID	is	known	as	a	type of	automatic	identification	system,	which	enables	data	to	be	transmitted	through a	portable	device	referred	to	as	a	tag.		The	tag	is	read	by	an	RFID	reader	and processed	based	on	the	needs	of	a	particular	application.		The	data	transmitted	by the	 tag	 may	 furnish	 identification	 or	 location	 information	 about	 the	 tagged product	including	date	of	purchase,	color,	and	price	among	others.		According	to Wal-Mart,	RFID	will	provide	employees	greater	ability	to	locate	products	within a	location	and	get	them	on	shelves	as	customers	need	them.		On	the	other	hand, the	use	of	RFID	can	also	cause	implications	to	its	people,	say,	on	their	auditors.	 Certified	 public	 accountants	 and	 auditors	 will	 have	 to	 obtain	 the	 skills	 and knowledge	to	reassess	accounting	procedures,	systems,	and	methods	related	to the	use	of	RFID	systems.		In	fact,	they	will	have	to	be	skilled	in	assessing	RFID system	 controls	 and	 note	 signs	 of	 inaccuracy	 or	 insufficiency	 of	 information such	as	partial	inventory	counts.		Security	of	information	may	also	be	affected by	 the	 use	 of	 RFID	 systems.	 	 The	 illicit	 tracking	 of	 RFID	 tags	 has	 been	 a principal	security	concern	of	RFID	technology.		Tags	pose	risks	to	both	personal location	 privacy	 and	 business	 security	 since	 they	 are	 world-readable.	 	 Thus,   locks	and	lock	picking	are	still	used	in	many	companies	that	do	not	have	enough financial	capability	to	install	types	of	electronic	access. The	 problem	 in	 using	 locks	 is	 not	 due	 to	 the	 choice	 of	 locks,	 but	 the	 security plan	that	supports	them.		For	instance,	a	company	may	have	installed	a	heavy- duty	lock	that	demands	for	biometrics	as	well	as	key	access	in	order	to	enter	the server	room;	however,	the	next	door	may	have	a	single-paned	glass	window	in which	scammers,	thieves,	or	social	engineers	can	easily	break	and	gain	access with	minimal	effort. Thus,	 locks	 alone	 are	 not	 enough	 security	 for	 companies	 and	 even	 homes regardless	if	the	locks	belong	to	the	top	of	the	line	types.		Social	engineers	know for	a	fact	that	security	does	not	merely	rely	on	a	piece	of	hardware.	 During	 a	 social	 engineering	 audit	 wherein	 a	 company	 patches	 its	 human infrastructure	for	more	security,	people	are	tested	on	their	knowledge	and	skills about	 company	 security.	 	 However,	 the	 same	 principles	 are	 employed	 when social	engineers	carry	out	their	ploys. In	general,	people	are	unwilling	to	admit	that	they	are	inclined	to	being	fooled	or tricked	by	social	engineers.		In	fact,	most	people	would	deny	being	fooled	by	a simple	 social	 engineering	 tactic	 due	 to	 fear	 of	 job	 repercussions	 as	 well	 as embarrassment.	 	 Recording	 devices	 can	 show	 proof	 that	 the	 trickery	 actually happened	although	they	can	also	be	used	to	train	both	employers	and	employees, specifically	on	what	signals	to	watch	out	for. Cameras	 and	 recording	 devices	 should	 never	 be	 used	 in	 getting	 employees	 to embarrassment	 or	 trouble.	 	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 information	 obtained	 from these	 devices	 provides	 valuable	 learning	 to	 show	 employees	 who	 fell	 for	 the pretexts	and	other	scams	of	social	engineers. Most	companies	that	use	cameras	and	recording	devices	can	obtain	proof	of	a social	 engineer's	 successful	 hack.	 	 This	 can	 educate	 both	 employers	 and employees	on	how	they	should	deal	with	malicious	attempts	involved	in	social engineering.	 Recording	 devices	 also	 provide	 companies	 the	 necessary	 protection	 against social	 engineering	 ploys,	 especially	 from	 advanced	 or	 highly-skilled	 social engineers.	 	 In	 camera	 recordings,	 for	 instance,	 the	 staff	 can	 see	 the	 facial gestures	 and	 other	 little	 details	 of	 social	 engineers.	 	 Thus,	 once	 the	 camera captures	those	details,	the	staff	has	something	to	analyze	so	as	to	be	ready	for	a social	engineering	attack.   	   Phone	Tools The	telephone	is	one	of	the	oldest	tools	that	social	engineers	use	in	carrying	their ploys.	 	 With	 the	 advent	 of	 cell	 phones,	 homemade	 phone	 servers,	 and	 VoIP, social	 engineers	 are	 given	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 options	 to	 conduct	 their	 malicious schemes	via	the	telephone. Given	that	people	are	flooded	with	sales	pitches,	telemarketing	calls,	and	sales advertisements,	social	engineers	are	compelled	to	be	skillful	when	it	comes	to using	the	phone,	leading	to	a	successful	ploy.		As	simple	as	it	may	seem,	social engineers	who	use	the	phone	as	a	tool	can	compromise	a	company's	security	in	a matter	of	minutes. Today,	 most	 people,	 if	 not	 all,	 are	 using	 cell	 phones	 and	 carry	 them	 both	 for personal	 and	 business	 conversations	 on	 subways,	 buses,	 and	 any	 other	 public places.	 	 In	 these	 places,	 social	 engineers	 are	 likely	 to	 eavesdrop	 or	 call	 their targets	 on	 their	 cell	 phones	 to	 obtain	 additional	 vectors,	 which	 may	 not	 be available	during	their	previous	malicious	attempts. As	smart	phones	and	hand-held	phones	that	resemble	computers	are	increasing in	 numbers,	 most	 people	 are	 inclined	 to	 storing	 personal	 data,	 passwords,	 and other	 private	 information	 in	 these	 devices.	 	 As	 such,	 social	 engineers	 are provided	with	yet	another	opportunity	to	carry	out	their	ploys	because	they	can have	access	to	their	targets	as	well	as	their	data	in	various	situations. In	addition,	people	have	24 7	access	to	their	smart	phones,	which	makes	them more	inclined	to	giving	out	information	quickly	when	social	engineers	pose	as “believable”	 callers.	 	 Take	 for	 example	 the	 caller	 Ids	 on	 cell	 phones,	 which indicates	the	identity	of	the	person	calling.		When	social	engineers	successfully access	their	targets	through	calling	them	from	a	corporate	building,	the	targets are	 likely	 to	 give	 out	 information	 willingly	 without	 verifying	 the	 caller's identity.		Certain	applications	in	Android	and	iPhone	smart	phones	are	available for	spoofing	caller	ID	numbers	to	any	number	desired. In	the	context	of	social	engineering,	the	use	of	phones	is	categorized	into	two; the	technology	equipped	on	phones	and	the	planning	of	the	social	engineers	on what	they	would	tell	their	targets. 	   Software-based	Tools One	 of	 the	 key	 aspects	 of	 social	 engineering	 is	 information	 gathering.	 	 Social engineers	 make	 it	 a	 point	 to	 spend	 time	 in	 gathering	 information	 about	 their objectives	and	targets	to	ensure	success	in	their	ploys.		Today,	there	are	various tools	 that	 can	 help	 social	 engineers	 in	 gathering,	 collecting,	 utilizing,	 and cataloging	the	data	they	have	collected.		This	means	that	social	engineers	are	no longer	 limited	 to	 what	 they	 can	 obtain	 from	 routine	 searches	 as	 online	 and software-based	tools	are	already	available. 	 Social	Engineer	Toolkit	 SET  While	social	engineers	take	most	of	their	time	in	honing	their	skills,	much	of	the variables	for	carrying	out	their	ploys	require	the	ability	to	generate	PDFs	and or emails,	 which	 are	 embedded	 with	 malicious	 codes.	 	 Social	 engineers	 have developed	the	social	engineer	toolkit	 SET ,	which	provides	them	the	ability	to penetrate	their	targets	easier	and	quicker	through	malicious	codes. Nowadays,	SET	is	continuously	expanding.		In	fact,	recently,	SET	has	proven	its capability	to	handle	attacks	such	as	an	infectious	media	generator	in	addition	to spear	phishing	and	website	cloning.		An	infectious	media	generator	allows	a	user to	 create	 a	 CD,	 DVD,	 or	 USB	 key,	 which	 is	 encoded	 with	 a	 malicious	 file.	 Then,	the	CD,	DVD,	or	USB	key	is	left	or	dropped	at	the	office	building	of	the target.		Once	it	is	inserted	and	ran	in	a	computer,	the	generator	will	carry	out	its malicious	payload,	causing	the	computer	of	the	target	to	be	compromised. SET	 also	 has	 the	 capability	 to	 produce	 a	 simple	 payload	 as	 well	 as	 a	 proper listener.	 	 For	 instance,	 if	 a	 social	 engineer	 wants	 to	 embed	 an	 EXE	 with	 a reversed	shell	connecting	back	to	their	servers,	a	USB	key	may	be	used	to	carry the	payload	and	carry	out	their	ploy.		Once	the	social	engineer	finds	a	computer or	 any	 machine	 for	 remote	 access,	 they	 can	 insert	 the	 USB	 key	 and	 ran	 the payload	file.		This	allows	the	social	engineer	a	quick	connection	back	to	their servers. SET	creates	the	programming	necessary	for	telling	tiny	boards	what	to	do	the moment	 they	 are	 plugged	 in.	 	 It	 also	 commands	 tiny	 boards	 to	 give	 reversed shells	or	set	up	listening	ports. As	mentioned,	SET	also	has	a	web	interface	feature	in	which	a	web	server	starts   to	host	the	SET	automatically	on	a	web	page	so	the	social	engineer	can	use	it easily.		Thus,	SET	is	an	extremely	powerful	social	engineering	tool	that	allows attackers	to	test	the	weaknesses	of	targets,	specifically	in	companies.	 	   Password	Profilers Another	tool	set	that	social	engineers	use	is	password	profilers.		After	obtaining information	about	their	targets,	social	engineers	create	a	profile	of	each	of	their target.	 	 This	 profile	 is	 used	 to	 plan	 out	 some	 attack	 strategies	 that	 social engineers	deem	fit	for	a	specific	target.		A	profile	is	also	used	to	establish	a	list of	potential	passwords	that	social	engineers	can	use	in	their	ploys.		Passwords can	help	social	engineers	in	carrying	out	a	hack,	specifically	when	the	situation presents	such	option.	 There	are	several	password	profilers	that	are	used	in	social	engineering,	which provide	 assistance	 in	 profiling	 potential	 passwords	 of	 a	 target	 or	 company.	 Some	of	these	password	profiling	tools	include	Who's	Your	Daddy	 WYD 	and Common	User	Passwords	Profiler	 CUPP . The	 number	 of	 people	 who	 fall	 prey	 to	 simple	 social	 engineering	 ploys	 is increasing	 every	 year	 in	 spite	 of	 various	 warnings	 issued	 by	 both	 private	 and government	sectors.		In	addition,	the	number	of	individuals	listing	all	types	of information	 about	 themselves,	 their	 lives,	 and	 their	 families	 on	 the	 Internet	 is also	rising.	 Social	engineers	can	profile	and	outline	the	entire	life	of	their	targets	by	simply using	their	tools	and	combining	a	profile	established	from	social	media	usage.	 This	works	well	on	the	part	of	social	engineers	given	that	most	people	choose their	passwords.		Fact	is,	most	people	use	the	same	password	for	various	Internet accounts	 such	 as	 emails	 and	 social	 networks.	 	 Worse,	 these	 people	 choose passwords	that	others	can	guess	easily. While	social	engineering	tools	are	important	to	carry	out	malicious	tactics,	they do	not	guarantee	the	success	of	a	social	engineer.		Tools	are	useless	unless	they are	coupled	with	knowledge	on	their	usage.		Social	engineers	should	also	be	able to	maximize	these	tools	in	order	to	result	in	a	successful	ploy.		As	such,	potential targets	should	also	have	knowledge	about	these	tools	as	they	are	commonly	used even	by	ordinary	people.					 Regardless	of	what	tool	social	engineers	use,	whether	it	is	a	physical	tool,	phone tool,	software	tool,	or	a	combination	of	tools,	successful	ploys	are	only	possible if	 they	 have	 adequate	 knowledge	 of	 each	 tool.	 	 On	 the	 part	 of	 targets,	 they should	be	doubly	aware	of	the	features	of	these	tools	so	as	not	to	become	victims of	social	engineering.	   	 	 	   Chapter	4:	Pickup	Lines	of	Social	Engineers 	 As	mentioned	in	the	previous	chapters	of	this	book,	some	of	the	most	common places	for	social	engineering	ploys	include	corporate	offices,	social	networking sites,	and	just	about	anywhere	on	the	Web.		Social	engineers	are	able	to	infiltrate corporate	 systems,	 hijack	 accounts,	 steal	 identities,	 and	 make	 money	 through employing	different	tactics,	including	the	formulation	of	good	pickup	lines. Pickup	lines	are	used	in	social	engineering	to	encourage	communication	between social	engineers	and	their	targets.		Some	of	the	most	effective	pickup	lines	used in	social	engineering	will	be	discussed	in	the	following	section	as	well	as	how they	work. 	   Pickup	Lines	on	Social	Networks I'm	here	in	New	York	traveling	alone	and	I	lost	my	wallet.		Can	you	wire	some money? This	 pickup	 line	 works	 when	 a	 social	 engineer	 pretends	 to	 be	 a	 Facebook “friend”	or	a	contact	in	other	social	networks.		He	or	she	sends	a	message	to	the target	 pretending	 to	 be	 in	 a	 foreign	 city	 and	 has	 no	 money	 due	 to	 lost	 wallet, robbery,	or	other	unfortunate	event.		The	social	engineer	then	asks	the	target	to wire	money. In	this	type	of	pickup	line,	people	should	be	extra	careful	because	most	social engineers	 are	 able	 to	 hack	 accounts	 and	 pose	 as	 one	 of	 a	 target's	 contacts	 or friends.		Thus,	people	cannot	be	guaranteed	that	the	identities	of	those	they	are	in contact	with,	specifically	in	social	networks	are	genuine. 	 Check	out	this	link! This	pickup	line	works	when	a	social	engineer	sends	a	message	or	an	email	and encourages	 the	 target	 to	 click	 a	 link,	 which	 leads	 to	 a	 bogus	 site.	 	 The	 social engineer	 usually	 poses	 as	 a	 friend	 so	 that	 the	 target	 would	 likely	 read	 the message.	 	 Once	 the	 target	 clicks	 on	 the	 link,	 the	 bogus	 website,	 which	 may appear	 legitimate,	 asks	 the	 target	 for	 personal	 information	 such	 as	 account number	or	password. For	instance,	there	is	a	Twitter	spam	campaign	that	circulated.		It	has	gone	with a	 pickup	 line,	 “Have	 you	 seen	 this	 video	 of	 you?”	 	 A	 number	 of	 people	 with Twitter	 accounts	 fell	 for	 this	 line	 and	 led	 them	 to	 a	 fake	 Twitter	 website	 that required	their	passwords. 	 Someone	 has	 a	 secret	 infatuation	 on	 you!	 	 Find	 out	 who!	 Download	 this application. This	pickup	line	works,	specifically	in	the	numerous	applications	that	users	can download	in	Facebook	and	other	social	networking	sites.		This	is	because	not	all applications	 available	 in	 Facebook	 are	 safe.	 	 Social	 engineers	 administer	 and control	 applications	 that	 install	 adware	 for	 launching	 pop-up	 ads.	 	 They	 also have	applications	in	which	personal	information	of	targets	are	exposed	to	third   parties.				 	   Pickup	Lines	in	the	Office This	 is	 Jack	 from	 technical	 services.	 	 I	 have	 been	 asked	 to	 check	 on	 your computer	due	to	an	infection. This	 pickup	 line	 works	 when	 a	 social	 engineer	 poses	 as	 a	 technical	 support person,	calling	a	target	from	a	certain	business	or	company.		The	social	engineer tells	the	target	that	the	computer	is	infected	and	offers	to	fix	it.		Then,	the	social engineer	ratchets	the	technical	difficulty	intentionally	as	he	or	she	plays	on	the fear	 and	 vulnerability	 of	 the	 target.	 	 As	 the	 target	 becomes	 more	 nervous,	 the social	 engineer	 takes	 advantage	 by	 letting	 the	 target	 reveal	 the	 password	 as “required”	to	finish	the	fix.						 	 Hello,	 I	 am	 the	 rep	 from	  name	 of	 company ,	 and	 I	 am	 here	 to	 see	  name	 of target . This	 pickup	 line	 works	 when	 a	 social	 engineer	 poses	 as	 a	 client,	 service technician,	 or	 sales	 representative	 among	 others,	 making	 him her	 a	 legitimate visitor.		The	social	engineer	will	then	use	his her	knowledge	about	the	company he she	is	representing.		Some	social	engineers	even	wear	a	shirt	bearing	the	logo of	the	company.		This	tactic	is	effective	in	gaining	the	confidence	or	trust	of	the receptionist.	 	 Social	 engineers	 spend	 days,	 weeks,	 and	 even	 months	 to	 obtain adequate	information	about	their	targets.		They	take	time	in	knowing	who	to	ask for	as	well	as	how	to	dress	and	act	when	already	inside	the	company.	 	 Excuse	me,	can	you	hold	the	door	for	me?		I	left	my	access key	card	in	the	car and	I	am	late	for	a	meeting. This	pickup	line	works	when	a	social	engineer	waits	outside	the	entryway	of	a company,	usually	the	entry	point	of	a	smoking	area	or	the	front	door.		The	social engineer	 then	 poses	 as	 one	 of	 the	 employees.	 	 More	 often	 than	 not,	 targets willingly	hold	the	door	open	for	social	engineers	in	disguise.		Thus,	the	attackers are	 able	 to	 access	 the	 building	 without	 being	 asked	 for	 their	 identities.	 Furthermore,	 social	 engineers	 get	 better	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 using	 high-end photography,	 specifically	 for	 printing	 genuine-looking	 badges.	 	 As	 such,	 even when	asked	for	credentials,	social	engineers	simply	present	their	self-made,	fake badges.   	   Pickup	Lines	for	Phishing You	recently	won	on	eBay	and	you	have	not	paid	for	the	item	yet.		Please	click here	to	pay. This	pickup	line	works	when	a	social	engineer	sends	a	target	an	email	that	may seem	to	originate	from	prominent	companies	and	organizations	like	eBay.		The message	tells	the	target	that	he	or	she	won	a	bid	and	have	not	yet	paid	for	the item.	 	 Social	 engineers	 know	 that	 targets	 who	 are	 into	 websites	 such	 as	 eBay give	importance	to	their	ratings	and	not	being	able	to	pay	for	a	won	item	would result	in	a	negative	impact.		As	such,	they	are	likely	to	click	the	link	while	the social	engineer	obtains	the	personal	information	of	the	target. 	 You	have	been	let	go.		Click	here	for	your	severance	pay. This	 pickup	 line	 works	 when	 a	 social	 engineer	 takes	 advantage	 of	 increased digitization	and	economic	uncertainty.		The	social	engineer	sends	an	email	to	the target	 containing	 a	 malicious	 link,	 which	 may	 appear	 as	 legitimate.	 	 The	 link may	be	supported	by	another	pickup	line	such	as	“This	year,	we	are	sending	out W-2	forms	electronically.		Click	here.” 	   Targeted	Social	Engineering	Attacks	Using	Pickup  Lines  The	tactics	of	social	engineering	is	increasingly	specific	as	attackers	are	inclined to	 targeting	 individual	 people	 for	 a	 larger	 payoff.	 	 There	 are	 more	 lucrative pickup	 lines	 that	 social	 engineers	 use	 to	 gain	 personal	 information	 of	 their targets	and	make	more	money. 	 Donate	for	the	hurricane	victims	and	recovery	efforts! This	 pickup	 line	 usually	 starts	 circulating	 shortly	 after	 a	 tsunami,	 major earthquake,	or	other	disaster.		Fake	websites	that	social	engineers	manage	target people	 who	 are	 deeply	 concerned	 about	 their	 loved	 ones	 in	 the	 disaster	 area.	 The	website	usually	claims	to	have	rescue	efforts	and	other	specialized	resources to	 help	 in	 finding	 victims	 and	 their	 recovery.	 	 In	 order	 to	 solicit	 charitable donations,	the	website	collects	the	names	as	well	as	contact	information	of	those who	 are	 willing	 to	 donate.	 	 The	 social	 engineer	 then	 calls	 the	 victim	 who naturally	has	heightened	emotions	to	obtain	their	account	or	credit	card	number.	 Thus,	the	social	engineer	would	be	equipped	to	commit	identity	theft	with	all	the information	obtained	such	as	the	target's	name,	address,	account	or	credit	card number,	 and	 a	 relative's	 name	 among	 others.	 	 Some	 social	 engineers	 even conduct	a	secondary	attack	by	posing	as	a	bank	representative	who	requests	for the	 Social	 Security	 number	 of	 the	 victim	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 verifying	 the legitimacy	of	the	donation. 	 This	is	Microsoft	support;	we	want	to	help	you. This	 pickup	 line	 works	 when	 a	 social	 engineers	 poses	 as	 a	 Microsoft	 tech support	 individual.	 	 The	 social	 engineer	 claims	 to	 be	 notifying	 all	 licensed Windows	 users	 who	 are	 experiencing	 abnormal	 number	 of	 errors	 caused	 by	 a software	bug.		The	target	is	instructed	to	access	the	event	log,	which	is	usually alarming	for	inexperienced	users.		More	often	than	not,	Windows	event	logs	are able	to	record	numerous	yet	small	errors.		The	target	is	likely	to	do	whatever	is instructed	 of	 him	 by	 the	 social	 engineer,	 prompting	 to	 go	 to	 a	 remote	 access service,	 such	 as	 Teamviewer.com.	 	 This	 service	 provides	 the	 social	 engineer control	over	the	target's	PC.		Then,	the	social	engineer	installs	malware,	which   will	provide	him her	continuous	access	to	the	target's	PC. 	 @Twitterguy,	what	is	your	opinion	about	Obama's	statement	on	cybersecurity? Http:  shar.es HNGAt This	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 common	 phishing	 lures	 used	 in	 social	 engineering.	 Attackers	continuously	observe	the	trends	in	Twitter	in	order	to	carry	out	their ploys.	 	 For	 instance,	 social	 engineers	 hijack	 legitimate	 hashtags	 to	 embed malicious	 links.	 	 Once	 the	 targets	 tweeted	 using	 the	 hashtags,	 the	 malware redirects	them	to	a	phishing	site	with	the	intent	of	launching	more	malware	or stealing	the	targets'	account	information	in	Twitter.		More	often	than	not,	social engineers	look	for	targets	in	Twitter	by	learning	about	their	interests.		Then,	the attackers	 send	 tweets	 that	 appear	 legitimate	 to	 entice	 targets	 to	 click	 the	 links that	lead	to	phishing	sites. 	 No	new	followers?		Get	more	Twitter	followers	here! This	pickup	 line	 works	 when	 a	 social	 engineer	 sends	 a	 tweet,	 which	 promises targets	an	increase	in	their	followers	once	they	click	a	link.		The	link	then	leads the	 targets	 to	 a	 web	 service,	 which	 asks	 for	 their	 credentials	 in	 Twitter.	 	 For those	 who	 are	 knowledgeable,	 there	 is	 not	 legitimate	 third	 party	 that	 would request	for	Twitter	credentials. 	 Subject:	About	your	job	application. This	 pickup	 line	 works	 when	 a	 social	 engineer	 targets	 businesses	 and headhunters	 by	 embedding	 malware	 in	 their	 email	 responses	 to	 numerous	 job postings.	 	 Based	 on	 a	 warning	 released	 by	 the	 FBI,	 over	 $150,000	 was	 stolen from	 a	 prominent	 business	 due	 to	 unauthorized	 wire	 transfer.	 	 The	 social engineer	responds	to	a	job	posting	on	a	specific	employment	website.		Once	the malware	 is	 installed,	 the	 social	 engineer	 obtains	 the	 target's	 credentials, specifically	for	online	banking	in	order	to	carry	out	financial	transactions	within the	 company.	 	 The	 social	 engineer	 redirects	 the	 wire	 transfers	 to	 his her	 own accounts	through	making	changes	in	the	account	settings.		As	this	tactic	became rampant,	 most	 companies	 and	 organizations	 use	 online	 forms	 for	 job	 seekers instead	of	accepting	their	cover	letters	and	resumes	in	email	attachments.   	 	   Chapter	5:	Social	Engineering	Scams	on	Social Networks	–	Then	and	Now  	  Google	and	Its	Chinese	Hackers  In	the	beginning	of	2010,	Google	made	the	headlines	and	revealed	that	Chinese hackers	were	able	to	breach	a	part	of	its	system.		Google	claimed	that	some	of	its services	 were	 breached	 and	 that	 the	 perpetrators	 wanted	 to	 obtain	 access	 to Chinese	 human	 rights	 activists	 through	 their	 Gmail	 accounts.	 	 Apart	 from Google,	 these	 social	 engineers	 also	 targeted	 other	 prominent	 companies, including	Symantec,	Adobe	Systems,	and	Yahoo. The	success	of	the	social	engineers	was	due	to	spending	weeks	and	even	months of	 scouting	 and	 targeting	 Google	 employees	 in	 order	 to	 obtain	 information.	 They	began	by	using	the	information	of	employees	found	in	social	networks	and other	places.		Once	they	got	the	necessary	information,	the	social	engineers	sent messages	to	the	employees	that	appeared	legitimate	and	coming	from	a	friend	or contact.		Thinking	that	the	message	truly	came	from	their	friends,	the	employees clicked	 on	 the	 links	 embedded	 with	 malware,	 resulting	 to	 the	 installation	 of spyware	on	their	computers. This	attack	on	Google	was	planned	and	carried	out	for	a	considerable	period.	 The	 social	 engineers	 took	 their	 time	 in	 gathering	 information	 and	 winning	 the confidence	of	the	employees	so	that	they	could	interact	and	elicit	information. Given	 that	 most	 companies	 make	 use	 of	 social	 networks	 as	 a	 part	 of	 the marketing	 strategy,	 social	 engineers	 find	 it	 easier	 to	 gather	 information	 about their	targets.		Apart	from	conveying	their	marketing	tactics	through	social	media, companies	also	expose	their	company	structure,	making	the	information	needed by	social	engineers	readily	available.	 	   Information	Exposure	on	Wikileaks  Again,	 in	 2010,	 highly	 classified	 government	 information	 was	 exposed	 on Wikileaks	with	the	successful	ploy	of	social	engineers.	 Bradley	 Manning,	 a	 U.S.	 Army	 soldier	 who	 was	 then	 assigned	 to	 a	 support battalion	in	Iraq,	was	accused	of	providing	classified	information	to	the	founder of	Wikileaks,	Julian	Assange. Having	access	to	the	Secret	Internet	Protocol	Router	Network,	which	was	used by	 the	 U.S.	 Department	 of	 State	 and	 Department	 of	 Defense	 for	 transmitting classified	information,	Manning	was	able	to	obtain	the	material. Meanwhile,	Adrian	Lamo,	a	former	hacker,	reported	Manning	to	the	authorities, telling	 the	 officials	 that	 Manning	 downloaded	 the	 material	 from	 SIPRNet	 and saving	 it	 on	 CD-RWs.	 	 Manning	 was	 allegedly	 successful	 in	 fooling	 his colleagues	 that	 he	 was	 merely	 listening	 to	 music	 instead	 of	 accessing	 and downloading	classified	information. Manning	carried	out	his	ploy	by	coming	in	with	music	on	a	CD-RW	with	a	label, such	as	“Lady	Gaga.”		He	erased	the	music,	overwriting	it	with	a	compressed split	file.		Manning	told	Lamo	in	an	online	chat	that	nobody	from	his	colleagues suspected	 anything	 as	 he	 listened	 and	 even	 lip-synched	 Lady	 Gaga's	 song, Telephone.		While	doing	this,	he	“exfiltrated”	probably	the	most	magnanimous information	spillage	in	the	history	of	the	United	States. Manning	was	able	to	play	on	the	trust	of	his	colleagues	while	keeping	his	cool.	 A	social	engineer	like	Manning	is	ruthless	as	he	knew	his	action	may	result	in	a court	martial,	yet	still	pushed	through	with	it. Following	 the	 exposure	 of	 highly	 classified	 information	 on	 Wikileaks,	 other social	engineers	took	advantage	and	sent	out	messages	with	a	pickup	line,	“Do you	want	to	read	the	file	on	Wikileaks?		Click	here.”		Once	users	clicked	on	the link,	 it	 led	 them	 to	 a	 pdf	 file	 that	 allowed	 the	 social	 engineers	 to	 search	 the computer	 through	 a	 Javascript,	 determine	 the	 Adobe	 reader	 version	 on	 the computer,	and	launched	their	exploitation	for	such	version.		The	victims	did	not mind	 if	 the	 pdf	 took	 time	 to	 load	 as	 they	 were	 expecting	 a	 huge	 document.	 However,	they	also	did	not	know	that	it	was	not	the	document	that	took	time	to load,	but	the	malware,	which	the	social	engineers	embedded. 	   Facebook	Friend	Request  The	ploys	used	in	social	engineering	are	continuously	evolving	as	various	tools for	 obtaining	 information	 are	 made	 available.	 	 These	 tools	 are	 specifically designed	for	information	gathering	in	social	networking	sites.	 In	 2011,	 a	 tool	 referred	 to	 as	 a	 Facebook	 profile	 dumper	 was	 developed	 by	 a group	of	security	researchers	who	were	based	in	Egypt.		The	tool	was	created	to educate	users	on	how	people	can	get	scammed	easily	on	Facebook.		This	Java- based	 tool	 was	 released	 for	 general	 use.	 	 It	 automates	 the	 hidden	 Facebook profile	 data,	 which	 is	 collected	 from	 users	 and	 only	 accessible	 to	 friends	 in	 a network	of	a	user.			According	to	the	developers,	the	tool	enables	a	user	to	send friend	 requests	 to	 a	 number	 of	 Facebook	 profiles.	 	 The	 moment	 the	 recipient accepts	the	friend	request,	the	tool	dumps	all	his her	information,	friend	list,	and photos	to	a	local	folder. The	developers	claimed	that	a	scammer	or	social	engineer	collects	information from	 the	 Facebook	 profile	 of	 a	 user	 simply	 by	 creating	 a	 new	 account.	 	 The social	engineer	then	adds	all	the	user's	friends	through	a	“friending	plugin”	to ensure	they	share	some	common	friends	with	the	user. Then,	the	social	engineer	uses	a	cloning	plugin	that	allows	them	to	choose	one	of the	user's	friends.		The	plugin	clones	the	display	name	and	picture	of	the	chosen friend	and	lays	it	to	the	authenticated	account. The	social	engineer	then	sends	a	friend	request	to	the	user's	account	and	once	the latter	 accepts	 it,	 the	 tool	 begins	 to	 save	 all	 information,	 tags,	 images,	 and accessible	HTML	pages,	allowing	the	attacker	to	examine	them	offline.		While	it may	be	too	late,	the	user	may	unfriend	the	forged	account	in	the	event	that	he	or she	discovers	that	it	is	actually	fake. Given	that	the	social	engineer	was	able	to	penetrate	into	the	user's	information, they	will	be	able	to	carry	out	a	number	of	social	engineering	ploys.		When	social engineers	are	able	to	obtain	more	personal	information,	they	are	likely	to	carry out	 more	 convincing	 ploys.	 	 For	 instance,	 a	 target	 is	 likely	 inclined	 to	 open	 a malicious	 email	 attachment,	 which	 social	 engineers	 normally	 use	 in	 a	 spear- phishing	attempt,	if	it	seems	to	appear	authentic. The	main	goal	of	the	tool's	developers	for	releasing	it	is	user	awareness	for	what is	 transpiring	 in	 the	 world,	 specifically	 in	 social	 networks.	 	 The	 developers claimed	 that	 the	 tool	 will	 provide	 people	 awareness	 and	 be	 cautious	 of	 the   actions	 they	 make	 online.	 	 For	 instance,	 accepting	 friend	 requests	 without verifying	the	authenticity	of	the	profile	is	one	of	the	wrong	actions	people	make.	 Social	 engineers	 will	 be	 able	 to	 exploit	 user	 profiles	 even	 with	 the	 shortest period	given. The	developers	also	hope	that	they	can	make	people	aware	of	the	flawed	user verification	process	of	Facebook.		They	claim	that	it	is	advisable	for	Facebook	to have	 stricter	 policies	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 verifying	 profiles	 who	 claim	 to	 be “friends”	as	well	as	filter	out	impersonating	or	fake	accounts.   Chapter	6:	Social	Engineering	–	How	to	Prevent	and  Mitigate  	   Social	Engineering	Prevention As	foolish	as	it	may	sound,	some	companies	and	organizations	think	that	they are	resistant	to	the	threat	of	social	engineering.		On	the	contrary,	no	organization is	 immune	 to	 social	 engineering,	 not	 even	 the	 White	 House	 or	 any	 other prominent	system.	 For	instance,	a	contest	was	held	at	a	security	conference	wherein	the	participants were	asked	to	obtain	information	from	target	companies,	which	could	be	utilized for	 a	 hypothetical	 attack.	 	 Out	 of	 the	 140	 phone	 calls	 that	 were	 made	 to employees	 of	 the	 target	 companies,	 almost	 all	 the	 employees	 divulged information	except	for	five,	who	refused	to	give	out	anything.		In	addition,	90% of	the	employees	clicked	on	a	URL,	which	was	sent	to	them	by	the	participants.	 These	 employees	 did	 not	 even	 bother	 knowing	 the	 person	 who	 sent	 it.	 	 This security	conference	concluded	on	how	wide	and	dangerous	the	scope	of	social engineering	is	for	all	systems	and	organizations. In	this	light,	it	is	best	to	know	some	effective	ways	to	prevent	social	engineering or	merely	minimize	the	risk	in	organizations.	 	   Learn	to	Discern	Social	Engineering	Attacks Before	 any	 organization	 can	 prevent	 and	 mitigate	 social	 engineering,	 the	 first step	is	to	learn	how	to	determine	whether	or	not	an	attack	is	a	part	of	a	social engineering	ploy.		Organizations	do	not	need	to	know	how	to	create	the	perfect con	 or	 plot	 a	 malicious	 attack.	 	 The	 key	 is	 to	 understand	 what	 transpires	 the moment	a	malicious	PDF	link	is	clicked	as	well	as	the	signs	to	look	for	when identifying	if	an	individual	is	into	something	deceptive.		Organizations	need	to understand	the	threat	of	social	engineering	and	how	such	threat	applies	to	them. Take	for	example,	Mr.	Z,	who	owns	a	house	and	lives	with	his	family.		Mr.	Z values	both	his	house	and	family;	thus,	he	would	want	to	protect	them	all	the time	from	any	harm	or	malicious	acts.		In	order	to	do	this,	Mr.	Z	should	not	wait for	a	fire	in	his	home	to	know	how	to	prevent	and	mitigate	the	danger.		What	he should	do	is	plan	an	escape	path	and	install	smoke	detectors	in	case	of	a	fire.	 Furthermore,	Mr.	Z	should	make	his	family	members	aware	of	the	phrase,	“stop, drop,	 and	 roll”	 so	 they	 would	 know	 what	 to	 do	 in	 case	 of	 fire.	 	 Teaching	 his family	how	to	get	to	the	door	and	avoid	the	smoke	by	staying	low	can	mitigate the	dangers	of	a	fire.		Mr.	Z	can	apply	all	these	methods	in	order	to	prevent	and mitigate	a	fire. The	same	rule	applies	in	protecting	an	organization	from	the	malicious	attacks involved	in	social	engineering.		An	organization	should	not	wait	for	an	attack	to transpire	before	finding	out	destructive	it	can	be.	 The	key	in	preventing	and	mitigating	social	engineering	is	to	know	more	about how	attacks	are	conducted.		This	way,	it	would	be	easier	to	determine	the	most appropriate	 solutions	 for	 an	 organization.	 	 Some	 of	 the	 factors	 that	 an organization	 should	 be	 aware	 of	 include	 the	 expressions,	 body	 language,	 and phrases	used	in	a	social	engineering	attempt.	 Once	 an	 organization	 obtains	 adequate	 knowledge	 about	 social	 engineering attacks,	 the	 next	 step	 is	 to	 raise	 staff	 awareness	 along	 with	 establishing	 a security-minded	culture. 	   Raising	Staff	Awareness One	of	the	most	effective	ways	to	combat	social	engineering	attacks	is	raising staff	awareness.		In	any	type	of	organization,	having	a	security-minded	culture	is essential	 as	 long	 as	 it	 becomes	 a	 standard	 that	 each	 member	 operates.	 Furthermore,	concepts	should	be	reinforced	consistently. There	are	various	ways	for	organizations	to	build	a	security-minded	culture	as well	as	raise	staff	awareness	on	the	destruction	that	social	engineering	brings.	  1.	 Higher-ups	 of	 organizations	 should	 ensure	 that	 their	 people	 get interested	 in	 security.	 	 They	 should	 be	 armed	 with	 techniques	 for securing	 not	 only	 company	 information,	 but	 personal	 information	 as well.	 	 Organizations	 can	 provide	 their	 staff	 with	 security	 seminars	 to obtain	tips	on	what	needs	to	be	locked	up	or	shredded	at	home,	how	to secure	 home-based	 wireless	 networks,	 and	 how	 to	 manage	 personal passwords	among	others.  2.	 Higher-ups	 of	 organizations	 should	 initiate	 on	 making	 the	 message visible	to	their	staff.		For	instance,	posters	can	be	put	up	at	coffee	rooms, smoking	areas,	fax	machines,	and	even	shred	bins.		The	posters	should be	eye-catching	so	the	staff	would	not	miss	out	on	it.		In	addition,	the posters	should	be	visible	enough	so	that	any	employ	who	walks	by	can read	and	understand	them	clearly.		The	message	should	be	changed	at least	once	a	month	so	that	the	staff	has	something	new	to	learn	about security.		If	an	organization	does	not	have	an	internal	graphic	artist,	it can	use	security	awareness	vendors	to	avail	ready-made	posters.  3.	 Higher-ups	 of	 organizations	 should	 allow	 their	 security	 department	 to provide	treats	for	the	staff	simply	for	doing	their	part.		For	instance,	a security	department	can	give	employees	donuts	or	cupcakes	as	a	gesture of	thanking	them	for	doing	their	part	in	securing	the	organization.  4.	 Higher-ups	 of	 organizations	 should	 conduct	 random	 desk	 checks	 after office	hours.		Those	who	have	no	sensitive	material	left	on	their	desks will	receive	a	reward.		This	reward	can	be	as	simple	as	a	leaving	a	pack of	gum	or	piece	of	chocolate	with	a	note,	“Thank	you	for	leaving	your desk	clean”	or	“Thank	you	for	doing	your	part.”  5.	 Organizations	with	a	monthly	newsletter	may	include	a	security	article, providing	 vital	 information	 on	 the	 latest	 incidents	 that	 transpire	 in	 the   same	 industry	 they	 are	 in.	 	 This	 newsletter	 may	 be	 supported	 with	 a monthly	 email	 to	 all	 the	 members	 of	 the	 organization	 with	 a	 catchy message	 about	 a	 relevant	 topic,	 such	 as	 “Emergency	 preparedness,” “PDA	 safety,”	 or	 simply	 a	 reminder	 of	 what	 number	 to	 call	 for suspicious	 or	 malicious	 events.	 	 It	 is	 also	 best	 for	 organizations	 to provide	their	staff	with	a	security	page	in	the	intranet,	which	 includes the	 list	 of	 security	 policies,	 links,	 and	 important	 contact	 information among	others.  6.	 Higher-ups	 of	 organizations	 should	 conduct	 regular	 training	 programs that	include	interactive	contests,	exercises,	give-aways,	or	games	about security.	 	 The	 training	 program	 need	 not	 be	 time-consuming.	 	 The important	thing	is	that	the	comprehension	of	the	staff	about	security	is tested.  7.	 Higher-ups	 of	 organizations	 should	 be	 able	 to	 walk	 the	 walk.	 	 This means	 that	 the	 leaders	 of	 organizations	 should	 be	 able	 to	 exhibit	 their interest	in	keeping	the	company	secured.	  The	staff	can	make	or	break	the	security	program	of	an	organization.		As	such, every	 member	 of	 the	 organization	 should	 be	 engaged	 in	 the	 security	 process through	suggestions	and	feedback. 	   Stop.		Think.		Connect. In	line	with	President	Barack	Obama's	mandate,	the	Cyberspace	Policy	Review, many	 organizations	 have	 conceptualized	 a	 campaign	 with	 the	 message,	 “Stop, Think,	Connect”,	which	aims	to	encourage	people	to	think	first	before	engaging in	 a	 potentially	 dangerous	 or	 destructive	 activity	 online.	 	 This	 message	 is proposed	to	be	understood	as	well	as	carried	out	as	easily	as	other	widely-known slogans,	such	as	“Stop,	Look,	and	Listen”	or	“Click	it	or	Ticket.”		Meanwhile, President	Obama's	mandate	called	for	the	establishment	of	a	national	awareness campaign	that	focused	on	cyber	security.	 The	message	is	simple,	actionable,	and	applicable	to	anyone	who	connects	to	the Internet	through	various	devices,	including	personal	computers,	laptops,	gaming consoles,	and	the	most	common	of	all,	smartphones. 	   Securing	the	End	User Although	technology	continues	to	change	and	evolve,	its	end	user	remains	the same.	 	 According	 to	 Winn	 Schwartau,	 who	 is	 the	 founder	 of	 the	 Security Awareness	Company,	the	person	at	the	keyboard	has	always	been	the	weakest link	when	it	comes	to	security.		Schwartau	claimed	that	along	with	the	changes in	technology,	social	engineering	has	added	new	forms	and	players	although	its fundamental	techniques	are	still	the	same.	 Thus,	 the	 end	 users	 should	 never	 divulge	 personal	 information	 to	 anyone	 and take	 note	 that	 if	 someone	 asks	 for	 their	 credentials,	 that	 individual	 is	 not trustworthy. A	 substantial	 part	 in	 any	 awareness	 training	 is	 the	 inclusion	 of	 specific instructions	to	not	divulge	personal	information	to	anyone	or	any	department.	 Organizations	should	teach	their	departments	not	to	ask	for	personal	information from	other	departments.		If	an	organization	plans	to	launch	a	new	system,	the key	is	to	create	new	credentials.		Anyone	who	comes	up	asking	for	the	existing credentials	is	up	to	something	malicious. As	 mentioned,	 when	 someone	 asks	 for	 credentials,	 he	 or	 she	 could	 not	 be trusted.		In	the	same	way,	a	legitimate	financial	institution	would	never	ask	its client	for	credentials	via	email.	 	   Keep	Software	Updated	–	All	the	Time More	often	than	not,	businesses	are	obliged	to	give	out	information	to	both	their clients	 and	 staff.	 	 For	 instance,	 a	 business	 should	 be	 able	 provide	 its	 phone numbers,	web	addresses,	and	emails.		Some	businesses	are	required	to	send	as well	 as	 receive	 PDF	 files	 from	 suppliers,	 vendors,	 and	 clients.	 	 While	 it	 is discussed	in	this	book	that	releasing	information	can	be	the	loss	of	privacy	and security,	oftentimes,	it	cannot	be	helped. However,	 there	 is	 an	 effective	 way	 to	 prevent	 social	 engineering	 attacks	 from invading	 an	 organization's	 security	 –	 keep	 software	 updated	 all	 the	 time.	 	 For instance,	there	are	still	companies	and	businesses	that	still	use	Adobe	Acrobat	8 and	Internet	Explorer	6	when	there	are	already	new	versions	of	these	programs.	 Those	 using	 outdated	 software	 programs	 and	 systems	 are	 more	 vulnerable	 to social	engineering	attacks	than	those	with	updated	versions. When	social	engineers	find	out	that	a	certain	company	still	makes	use	of	these two	 outdated	 applications,	 they	 would	 certainly	 plan	 their	 attacks	 even	 if	 the company	has	firewalls,	IDs,	and	antivirus	systems. Therefore,	it	is	important	for	all	types	of	organizations	to	update	their	software regularly.		More	often	than	not,	the	newest	software	versions	have	already	fixed their	 security	 holes.	 	 In	 addition,	 organizations	 should	 never	 use	 a	 software system	that	has	negative	track	record	as	it	will	surely	be	vulnerable	to	malicious attacks. 	   Develop	Scripts Developing	 scripts	 that	 help	 employees	 be	 prepared,	 especially	 when	 the situation	requires	critical	thinking	is	one	of	the	most	beneficial	ways	to	prevent and	mitigate	social	engineering	attacks. The	scripts	referred	here	are	not	the	same	as	what	Hollywood	actors	use	during their	film	shoot.		The	scripts	for	countering	social	engineering	ploys	are	merely outlines	that	can	support	employees	in	various	scenarios. For	instance,	how	should	an	employee	reply	to	someone	claiming	to	work	for	the CEO	 and	 demands	 for	 their	 password?	 	 What	 should	 an	 employee	 do	 when someone	who	does	not	have	an	appointment	but	dresses	and	acts	the	role	of	a vendor,	demands	access	to	a	secured	part	of	the	building? These	are	scenarios	wherein	scripts	can	be	of	enormous	help.		Scripts	can	assist employees	 in	 identifying	 the	 proper	 answer,	 response,	 or	 reaction	 in	 certain situations.		Scripts	also	make	employees	feel	at	ease.	 An	 example	 of	 a	 script	 for	 a	 specific	 scenario	 is	 provided	 in	 the	 following section. Scenario:	 Someone	 calls	 and	 claims	 to	 be	 from	 the	 office	 of	 the	 CEO	 and demands	an	employee	to	hand	over	internal	data	or	information: Script:	 1 	 Ask	 the	 employee	 ID	 number	 and	 name	 of	 the	 person	 without answering	any	questions	until	you	are	given	this	information;	2 	After	obtaining the	identification	details,	ask	for	the	project	ID	number	associated	to	the	project that	the	person	is	claiming	to	manage	or	be	a	part	of;	3 	If	you	have	obtained	the information	of	steps	1	and	2	successfully,	comply.		If	not,	ask	the	person	for	his or	her	manager's	requesting	authorization	and	send	it	via	email.		Terminate	the call. In	this	scenario	and	script,	an	employee	would	know	what	to	say,	how	to	react, and	what	to	do	while	being	conscious	of	the	company's	security. 	   Understanding	Social	Engineering	Audit A	social	engineering	audit	involves	a	simulation	of	the	malicious	attacks	carried out	 by	 social	 engineers.	 	 This	 simulation	 is	 administered	 by	 a	 professional security	 auditor	 whom	 a	 company	 hires	 for	 testing	 the	 policies,	 physical perimeter,	and	people	of	the	company. There	are	two	primary	differences	between	a	professional	security	auditor	and	a malicious	social	engineer.		One,	a	professional	security	auditor	follows	legal	and moral	guidelines	and	two,	the	goals	of	a	professional	security	auditor	is	to	help as	 opposed	 to	 that	 of	 a	 malicious	 social	 engineer,	 which	 is	 to	 harm,	 steal,	 or embarrass	a	target. In	order	to	fully	understand	the	concept	of	a	social	engineering	audit,	it	is	best	to establish	the	goals	on	why	an	organization	wants	to	implement	it. A	professional	security	auditor	should	carry	out	his	behavior	based	on	morally and	ethically	accepted	principles	while	he	stretches	across	the	line,	allowing	him to	pose	as	a	malicious	social	engineer.		In	other	words,	he	should	take	note	of things,	which	he	can	use	to	obtain	information	or	gain	access	to	the	weakness	of a	company.		While	he	tries	to	expose	the	hole	in	the	defenses	of	a	company	in the	 persona	 of	 a	 malicious	 social	 engineer,	 he	 still	 needs	 to	 behave	 in	 an appropriate	manner.	 On	the	part	of	the	companies	hiring	a	professional	security	auditor,	they	should be	able	to	determine	the	security	gaps	and	balance	them	with	a	concern	for	each employee.		More	often	than	not,	companies	who	undergo	a	social	engineering audit	think	that	terminating	the	employee	or	employees	who	fell	for	the	ploy	is the	 solution	 to	 the	 problem	 and	 fixes	 the	 hole.	 	 However,	 companies	 should realize	 that	 once	 an	 audit	 is	 done,	 the	 employees	 who	 fell	 for	 the	 attack	 are probably	 the	 most	 secure	 employees	 in	 the	 building	 during	 that	 time.	 Consequently,	 a	 professional	 security	 auditor	 should	 also	 take	 actions	 in ensuring	that	the	jobs	of	employees	would	not	be	jeopardized. 	 	 	 	   Conclusion  	 The	primary	purpose	of	this	book	is	to	open	your	eyes	to	the	real	world	of	social engineering.		I	hope	it	has	helped	you	in	maintaining	or	establishing	a	healthy dose	of	fear	for	the	potential	destruction	that	social	engineering	can	bring,	not only	 to	 companies	 or	 organizations,	 but	 also	 in	 your	 home	 and	 personal	 life.	 Thus,	I	hope	you	will	continue	to	pay	attention	to	possible	malicious	attacks	as discussed	in	this	book. Rest	 assured	 that	 following	 and	 implementing	 the	 principles	 you	 have	 read	 in this	 book	 would	 enhance	 your	 capability	 to	 discern	 and	 converse	 more efficiently	with	the	people	around	you.
