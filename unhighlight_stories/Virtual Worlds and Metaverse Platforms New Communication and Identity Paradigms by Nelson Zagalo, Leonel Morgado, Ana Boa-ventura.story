Three Case Studies of Business and Public Service ............................................................................... 1  Sisse Siggaard Jensen, Roskilde University, Denmark  Second Life is conceived as an open space and symbolic world of affordances as to the user-driven  co-creation of the content and agencies of the world. The questions asked are concerned with the ways  in which the actors of three case studies design and mediate their Second Life agencies and how these  choices contribute to user-driven content creation and possibly to innovative practises in a symbolic world.  Chapter 2 Procedural Virtual Worlds ..................................................................................................................... 16  Nuno Rodrigues, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, Portugal Luís Magalhães, University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Portugal João Paulo Moura, University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Portugal Alan Chalmers, University of Warwick, UK Filipe Santos, Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, Portugal Leonel Morgado, University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Portugal  With the increasing demand for more complex and larger models in different fields, such as the design  of virtual worlds, video games, and computer animated movies, the need to generate them automatically  has become more necessary than ever.   Chapter 3 Collective Building Projects in Second Life: User Motives and Strategies Explained From an  Architectural and Ethnographic Perspective ......................................................................................... 33  Bjarke Liboriussen, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark  Users of “Second Life” invest considerable amounts of time, money, and creativity in collective building  projects. Informed by a 14 month ethnography, this chapter explains why and how from an architectural  perspective.  Chapter 4 The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life ................................................................................ 47  Jacquelene Drinkall, University of New South Wales, Australia  This chapter looks at Virtual Worlds in contemporary art practice, as well as the role of art and science  in the creation of new technologically mediated telepathies.  Section 2  Our Immersion: Entering the Metaverse  Chapter 5 The 3-D Innovation Sphere: Exploring the Use of Second Life for Innovation Communication ........ 70  Katrin Tobies, University of Leipzig, Germany Bettina Maisch, University of St.Gallen, Switzerland  This chapter explores the 3-D environment Second Life as a communication platform used by industry  and science to create, design, develop, and distribute innovation. In order to achieve sustainable eco- nomic success in the context of global competition, companies need to optimize their communication  activities within their innovation processes.  Chapter 6 What’s Real? Presence, Personality and Identity in the Real and Online Virtual World ...................... 88  Benjamin Gregor Aas, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands  This chapter argues that presence, the experience of “being- in-the-virtual-world,” plays an underlying  key role in most psychological processes connected with virtual worlds. Virtual worlds influence real  life in a reciprocal loop, by shaping cognitive, psychological, and social processes of the real world.  Chapter 7 Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life .................................................................... 100  Sara Pita, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal Luís Pedro, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal  In the last few years much research regarding the advantages and potentialities of using Second Life in  education came in to the spotlight. To identify which type of communication is most common among  avatars and to understand if there is any similarity with communication in real life, we developed a case    study that analyzed both verbal and nonverbal communication among Master degree students during  six months.  Chapter 8 Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies: Comparing Engagings .......................................................... 117  CarrieLynn D. Reinhard, Roskilde University, Denmark  This chapter argues for research studies focusing on how people make sense of virtual worlds when  they engage with them, and to compare these situated sense-making processes amongst “virtual worlds  technologies” as well as other types of media products.  By mapping out and comparing such engagings,  we may have a better understanding about what constitutes a virtual world.  Section 3  Society Development: People, not Person  Chapter 9 Students’ Perceptions About Delivery of Game-Based Learning for Virtual Patients in  Second Life ......................................................................................................................................... 138  M. Toro-Troconis, Imperial College London, UK N. J. Roberts, Imperial College London, UK S. F. Smith, Imperial College London, UK M. R. Partridge, Imperial College London, UK  This chapter describes the use of the nominal group technique to assess students’ attitudes to game- based learning in the delivery of virtual patients in Second Life®. Two groups of undergraduate medical  students  Yr 3, n=14  were invited to participate. The research question posed was: “In your opinion  what are the advantages and disadvantages of learning in Second Life® compared with other methods?”  Chapter 10 Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse ................................................................... 149  Gaia Moretti, Libera Università Maria Ss. Assunta, Italy Eliane Schlemmer, Universidade do Vale dos Rios dos Sinos, Brazil  Digital virtual spaces can contribute to change the traditional structure and definition of virtual com- munities, and can also contribute to their digital development, in the field of participation.  Chapter 11 Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life: Time for Content Minimalism ..................................... 166  Joao Mattar, Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, Brasil  This chapter addresses a resistance against the use of Second Life in education, which is based on the  theory of technological minimalism. The main arguments of the resistance and the main concepts of the  theory are discussed.   Section 4  Built for Fun: Playing in the Metaverse  Chapter 12 The Players’ Dimension: From Virtual to Physical ............................................................................ 181  Michael Nitsche, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA  This chapter outlines three positions in the development of game spaces from the ideal of the perfect  mindspace to the commercial reality of virtual worlds to the expansion of the game world into the physi- cal environment into a hybrid space.  Chapter 13 Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds: Fictional Worlds and the Shaping of an In-Game  Social Conduct .................................................................................................................................... 192  Thiago Falcão, Federal University of Bahia, Brazil  In this chapter we inquire about the role the narrative acquires in the production of meaning resultant  from the contact between players and environment, in the Massive Multiplayer Online Role-playing  Game  MMORPG  World of Warcraft.  Chapter 14 Is There a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities? Case Study: The Sims® ..................... 206  Pascaline Lorentz, University of Strasbourg, France  The focus of this chapter is on the social impacts of virtual relationships on gamers in the gameplay.  With the game The Sims®, we would like to analyze the process at stake in the relationship between  the gamer and his Sim. The end justifies the means, so the gamer, here a teenager, has to figure out how  to behave when he is an adult with responsibilities.  Chapter 15 The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse .............................................................. 219  Luís Carlos Petry, Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São, Brazil Cristiano Natal Tonéis, Faculdades Metropolitanas Unidas de São Paulo, Brazil  Can we develop creative thinking? What is the role of games? Which characteristics of games can open  up paths to creative thinking? The classical culture and the classical puzzles can give us an opportunity  to answer these questions.  Section 5  Sustenance: Virtual Health Care  Chapter 16 Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse: Paradigm Shift in   Neuropsychological Assessment ......................................................................................................... 234  Thomas D. Parsons, University of Southern California, USA   Actualization of the potential of virtual worlds for assessment will require the following: comparisons  with well-validated neuropsychological measures, data storage, improved documentation of specific  computer hardware and software used in experimental methods, and enhanced methods and result re- porting by the researchers publishing studies on virtual worlds.  Chapter 17 Virtual Worlds and Health: Healthcare Delivery and Simulation Opportunities ................................ 251  David Holloway, Metaverse Journal, Australia  With decades of experience in simulation, the health professions are comparatively well versed in virtual  environments for training. More broadly, there is a growing body of experience and supporting evidence  on the benefits of virtual worlds in professional information sharing, clinical simulation, healthcare  delivery, and as a research tool.  Chapter 18 Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change: Overcoming Time  Space Constraints and Exploring  Anonymity to Overcome Social Stigma in the Case of Substance Abuse .......................................... 271  Ana Boa-Ventura, University of Texas at Austin, USA  In this chapter we cover a range of areas where the metaverse, and notably Second Life, have been used  to complement real life interventions in the field of public health. We particularly address those dealing  with behavioral change and within these, we devote most of our work to addictive behaviors.  Section 6  Life Happens: Religion, Morality, & Ethics  Chapter 19 Finding Liquid Salvation: Using the Cardean Ethnographic Method to Document Second Life  Residents and Religious Cloud Communities..................................................................................... 288  Gregory Price Grieve, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, USA Kevin Heston, Wake Forest University, USA  The Cardean ethnographic method was developed to study religious communities in the virtual world  of Second Life.  In our research, we faced a two-sided methodological problem. We had to theorize the  virtual and its relation to the actual, while simultaneously creating practices for an effective ethnographic  method. Our solution, named after the Roman Goddess of the hinge, Cardea, theorizes the “virtual” as  desubstantialized and nondualistc; “residents,” as fluid, multiple, and distributed cyborg-bodies; and  “cloud communities,” as temporary, outsourced groups of emotionally bonded residents.  Chapter 20 Second Life, Second Morality? ........................................................................................................... 306  Katleen Gabriels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium Joke Bauwens, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium Karl Verstrynge, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium   In this study, we examine in-world morality of frequent residents of Second Life  SL . Given the lack of  systematic research on morality in non-gaming virtual worlds, we conducted an explorative small-scale,  in-depth qualitative study with avid SL-residents.  Chapter 21 Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds ...................................... 321  Victoria McArthur, York University, Canada  This chapter focuses on the virtual world professionals being deployed within Second Life by companies  and the appearance of their avatars. Virtual world professionals are considered to be persons who are  deployed within a virtual world, such as Second Life, for the purpose of representing their company or  organization within the virtual world.  Chapter 22 One Self to Rule Them All: A Critical Discourse Analysis of French-Speaking Players’ Identity  Construction in World of Warcraft ...................................................................................................... 337  Omar V. Rosas, University of Twente, The Netherlands & University of Namur, Belgium Grégory Dhen, Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium   This chapter provides a critical discourse analysis of French-Speaking players’ personal and collective  identity construction in World of Warcraft. Based on sixteen semi-structured interviews conducted online,  we have analyzed how players introduce their avatars, the extent to which avatars correspond to or differ  from players’ real selves, and how players perceive and construct collective identity within their guilds.

And he was dancing. On my other  side, a dolphin floated a few feet above the ground on a surfboard. I think his date was the cute brunette  who pirouetted non-stop, or maybe it was the pig that waddled around him in small circles. I can’t be  sure because I was really there for the music — Lambchop, a Nashville band playing live in Austin to  this crowd of music lovers from around the world, and throughout the animal kingdom apparently.  As music lovers may know, Lambchop is very real, but Jesus and the rest of us weren’t, at least that  night. We were avatars drawn to the music or the inter-species socializing or the hope of seeing Michael  Nesmith of Monkees’ fame, the wizard behind the curtain of this virtual world concert called VideoRanch  3D. Every month or so Nesmith tapes a live band before a green screen and inserts it into VideoRanch. As  a music nut, I love the opportunity to see bands with a colorful crowd. And as a developer, I’m thrilled  to see the line between virtual and real worlds continue to blur.  While I make videogames for a living, I don’t spend a lot of time in virtual worlds. My purview  is handheld games — smartphones, DSs, mobile stuff like that. I’m often asked to help un-game-like  organizations — workforce development non-profits, public radio stations, car dealerships  !  — bring  games into their organizations. While they talk about game elements, such as avatars, rewards systems,  and user-generated content, a game isn’t really what they want. They want community. They want social  stickiness. They want a digital forum that compels folks, regardless of geography, to convene and invest  in a group, an idea, a movement.  That’s what Nesmith is after with VideoRanch. Same for the petroleum engineering class I visited in  which students were encouraged to make mistakes — big mistakes — on virtual oil wells where explo- sions and spills are corrected with a keystroke. And same for the simulator I tried that trains budding  diplomats how to navigate the complex social norms of Afghanistan. They all are fostering community  by creating safe worlds where we as users can create, communicate, and make a few mistakes.  I don’t know if virtual worlds are encroaching on the real world, games are seeping into work, or  everything we touch is becoming social and interconnected, and I don’t think it really matters. What  matters is we’re inventing new ways to come together to share, create, and debate. It’s thrilling. It’s  terrifying. And it continues to touch us in new ways.

Not only researchers and scholars are experiencing the importance of this new field, but  also industry is strongly investing in these domains, and – more important than that – society is respond- ing with huge impacts and transformations.  This book presents texts whose focus is the scientific research on uses, effects, developments, and  applications of various metaverse platforms, such as Second Life, Open Croquet, World of Warcraft,  and others, providing a forum for the research community to present and discuss innovative approaches. Whereas metaverse platforms are no longer a novel topic, they still pose challenges for the adaption  of conventional research methodologies and communication practices with topics as: digital identity,  collaboration,  entertainment  and  playing,  affective  responses,  educational  objects,  communication  design, virtual space and digital representation, simulation and substitution, technology, and arts. The  book’s chapters present foundational research, models, case studies, and research results that research- ers and scholars can port to their own environments to evolve their own research processes and studies.  The chapters cover scenarios of intellectual disciplines and technological endeavors in which metaverse  platforms are currently being used and will be used: computation, human-computer interaction, design,  media and communication, anthropology, sociology, psychology, education, philosophy, theology, arts,  and aesthetics.  The drive for creating this book originated from our practice of teaching and researching in this  domain; reading material and in-depth research knowledge are still lacking, albeit growing in numbers  and quality, but often locked into specific fields. We believe that novel platforms require researchers  and practitioners to acquire broad perspectives of their use and potential across diverse fields of human  knowledge, in order to support their own activities and inspiration.  For this purpose we initiated the SLACTIONS conference series, organizing SLACTIONS 2009  and supporting the organization of SLACTIONS 2010. We are also establishing a steering committee  to support the worldwide organization of SLACTIONS 2011 and future events. These conferences have  been extremely rewarding moments of cross-pollination of ideas between diverse fields of knowledge,  with researchers from diverse fields presenting and discussing multiple perspectives, viewpoints, and  approaches to the use, analysis, and development of metaverse platforms and their use.  The present book comes as a common base resulting from this multidisciplinary research effort.  It aims to provide a reference guide for researchers and scholars, but also for practitioners, such as  educators, artists, business professionals, communication professionals, and organizations looking for    xvi    background on how to apply virtual worlds in their research, teaching, and business strategy: a set of  pieces of knowledge with which one can open up new horizons to be creative.  The chapters, albeit diverse, form a structured encompassing view of the field. When reviewing and  editing submissions, we took care to consider the overall structure of the book and how each chapter  would contribute to the overall book. Hence, we follow a pathway style through the field, divided in to  six sections:  1.   The World Arises: Creating Content 2.   Our Immersion: Entering the Metaverse 3.   Society Development: People, not Person 4.   Built for fun: Playing in the Metaverse 5.   Sustenance: Virtual Health Care 6.   Life happens: Religion, Morality, and Ethics  In section 1, about content creation, we present different views on how to create actual virtual content.  Opening it, we present the most hard to manage perspective: user-created content and the richness of  approaches and possibilities it brings – but also its challenges. Since this viewpoint is known to social  and educational scientists, we complement it with a viewpoint well-known to computer scientists, but  little known in other fields, and critical for massive spaces: automated, procedural generation of content.  Then we expand both views by bringing in the matter of co-creation, a foremost issue in virtual worlds,  where content can go beyond an individual’s artifact into collecting creation. Finally, content creation  in virtual platforms can support novel forms of artistic expression and reflection. We close this section  with a provocative and inspiring view on how these platforms can be the heartland of different artistic  approaches.  Content alone doesn’t make a virtual world of course – at least not one warranting its consideration  as a vibrant part of the metaverse. So chapter 2 deals with how people engage with these media, plat- form, or realms, and discover their new bearings. The section opens with a view on the communication  affordances of virtual worlds and how they are being approached. Then we focus on the critical topic of  avatars, and how they place a novel issue in terms of human-computer interaction: the identification of  the avatar as an extension of one’s persona and the role of this in the experience of using virtual worlds.  We then conclude with two chapters that tackle a central detail whose impact is central to the experi- ence: how verbal and non-verbal communication are used in worlds where three-dimensional space  and embodiment are basic features, and how this affects the nature of person-to-person communication. With the third section, about the development or emergence of societal relations in the metaverse,  we take the reader a step further into these worlds. Now we delve into a concept more vast than a mere  communication tool within a space, encompassing the notion that these worlds develop societies with  their own rules, organization, and characteristics. We start from outside the metaverse, analyzing students’  attitudes to the use of these platforms, to provide insights on how their deployment must indeed consider  social dynamics; then we present a view from the inside, looking into the development of communities  that leverage the new platform and its possibilities. Finally, we take a step back and consider how these  two realities are aligned or confront current perspectives – in this case, for the field of education, an area  where many practitioners and researchers have embraced the metaverse wholeheartedly.  The second half of the book stands on the perspectives and examples of the first half, and presents   specific cases as food for thought.     xvii  The fourth section presents the entertainment perspective, with chapters that provide complementary  perspectives: starting with the possibility of expanding both reality and virtuality into novel entertainment  varieties, and concluding with a chapter on how virtual games may open up paths to creative thinking, a  concept based on classical culture. Between them, two bridging chapters provide key perspectives on the  role and development of narratives and their relation to user behavior in multi-user virtual world games,  and on how aspects of social relationship may develop between the human and the virtual personas.  In the fifth section, the relationship between the virtual and the physical worlds are explored via a  subject with a strong impact in everyday lives: health. We initiate this with a chapter on the potential of  virtual worlds for neuropsychological assessment, which may drive the reader to consider how impor- tant a role metaverse platforms may play in the near future. Then we take a broader perspective on the  potential for development of health professionals, and conclude with another example from the field,  describing a virtual world’s use to complement physical-world interventions in public health.  To conclude this pathway through which we  and the authors of all chapters  have been conducting  the reader, we provide reflections on broader ideas: how does a virtual platform support a non-physical  concept such as religion, whether morality and ethics are impacted or challenged by new means of social  interaction, how professional users ponder their identity towards others via the embodiment of an avatar  and its appearance, and – lastly, which is also the first dilemma – how our identities are constructed and  perceived, through factual analysis of discourse and data.  So, we start from the basic building blocks of the metaverse, and conclude with issues which are  present wherever humanity dwells. And this connection between the new virtuality and the ever-existing  one is in itself also a concluding tenet from this book.

We’re indebted to all people who took part in it, to all local  organizers of physical chapters  Portugal, USA, Brazil, UK, China, Israel  and also to all paper present- ers, who originated from all around the world. This conference was the debut work cooperation between  the three editors of this book, and from it sprung connections with many keen researchers across the  world. Together, the editors want to say thanks again to the institutions who supported and believed in  this vision: NMC – New Media Consortium, SPCVideojogos – Sociedade Portuguesa de Ciências dos  Videojogos, UTAD – Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, UM – Universidade do Minho,  and TACC – Texas Advanced Computing Center.  A big, hearty thanks goes especially to all our book contributors, who joined this endeavor and  maintained their will till the end, to all reviewers whose insightful comments helped improve the overall  content, and finally to all our editorial advisors who were responsible since the beginning for the great  selection of texts we are now making available for the benefit of the public.  The editors want also to thank IGI Global for asking for this edited book and its staff for supporting  it along the way: Mike Killian, Christine Bufton, Lindsay Johnston, Erika Carter, Kristin M.

Three Case Studies of Business   and Public Service  Sisse Siggaard Jensen  Roskilde University, Denmark  ABSTRACT In this chapter, Second Life is conceived as an open space and symbolic world of user-driven co-creation  of content. The questions asked concern the ways in which the actors of three case studies design, medi- ate, and remediate their Second Life projects and how the choices they make contribute to user-driven  content creation and possibly to innovative practices. To answer these questions, concepts of innovation,  in particular closed and open innovation are introduced and motivations for engaging in co-creation are  identified. It is suggested that we understand user-driven innovation in a world like Second Life in terms  of symbolic reorganization of conceptual frameworks and meaning-making. Subsequently, the concept of  remediation is suggested as a way to conceive of mediation in the cases studied. It is shown how difficult  it is for actors to co-create, mediate, and remediate thus to generate user-driven innovative practices  in two Danish business projects  Wonder DK and Times  and in one public service project  Literary .  To conclude the analysis of the case studies, it is suggested that methods of creative co-creation and  innovative practices can build on the concept of remediation borrowed from research on new media  and redefined in virtual worlds.

User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  INTRODUCTION  Virtual worlds may be seen as built of symbolic  bricks  of  signs  and  shapes;  they  are  symbolic  worlds of meaning-making and semioses  Ma- tusitz, 2005 . Questions and ideas are likely to  emerge when we experience new meaning-making  flows  Csikszentmihaily, 1996  in non-tangible  virtual worlds that even question the very idea  of what a world is. Questioning what is taken for  granted often mobilizes creative energy, rethink- ing, and reinterpretation of agencies and engage- ments. In the case of Second Life, the Linden Lab  firm’s marketing of their product emphasizes that  it is a tool for building a new world unbound by  the tangible and physical  Au, 2008 ; a symbolic  world which allows us to create shapes and signs  “not possible in real life” in a compelling, surreal,  and dream-like world to be experienced together  with other residents accompanied by their avatars. A virtual world like Second Life may thus be  seen as a window of opportunity for mobilizing its  residents’ creativity of mediation and innovation  as the content has to be provided and created by  the users; creative qualities, which are often pre- sented as a distinguishing feature of Second Life as  compared to multi-user online role-playing games  such as e.g., EverQuest and World of Warcraft. In  Second Life there are no built-in storylines and no  system of quests, experience points, classes, and  roles as is the case in many role-playing games.  In  principle,  everything  in  Second  Life  has  to  be provided by the residents who have chosen  to settle, socialize, run business, attend cultural  events, or just to have great in-world fun  Au,  2008;  Boelstorff,  2008;  Malaby,  2009 .  Let  us  therefore note that Second Life not only inspires  but the general idea of the design actually requires  the co-creation by the residents in order to make it  a compelling and attractive experience. Therefore,  to introduce Second Life to the market, a critical  mass of residents is required to actually design and  make the world. Yet obviously, for residents to run  a project, a business, or a shop, it is also required   2  that they can attract the attention of other fellow  residents to visit and partake in the activities of  their projects, places and islands.  Thus, the user-driven content creation can be  seen as a comprehensive experiment with user- driven  innovation.  Moving  into  Second  Life,  residents have to generate design ideas and realize  these ideas whether they are running a business,  conducting  a  series  of  talk-shows,  arranging  cultural  events,  producing  machinimas  or  just  travelling around the world to chat, socialize, go  to ball-rooms to dance, or visit sex clubs. All of  this may be seen as engagements, which entail  communication  and  co-creation  of  new  social  agencies, norms, digital places, and environments.  Only if the residents themselves can manage to  design places, arrange events, and run a business  can the world offer interesting and exciting in- world experiences.  QUESTIONS OF ANALYSIS  In this chapter, the practices of the user-driven  content creation and user-driven innovation of the  Second Life symbolic world is critically examined  by analyzing three case studies of projects and  actors who engage with or have been engaged  with Second Life. The agencies of the Wonder  DK, Times, and Literary projects are analyzed  as seen from the perspective of mediation and in- novation. Thus, in the analysis of the case studies,  the ensuing questions that are dealt with are: In  what ways do actors of the chosen case studies  design and mediate their Second Life projects?  And, how do their choices contribute to user-driven  content creation and possibly to innovation in this  symbolic world? To answer these questions, first,  the concepts of innovation and remediation are  introduced. Secondly, the three case studies are  presented and then analysed, and finally some an- swers to the above stated questions are suggested.   User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  CLOSED AND OPEN INNOVATION  Conceptions of innovation are many. Innovation  may be seen as a research field  Krohn & van Daele  1998 ; a social constructivist inspired sociology   Latour & Woolgar 1979 86; Latour 2005 ; in the  light of historical and  or economic understandings   Sundbo 2001, 2002 ; as collaborative network  achievements  Gloor 2006 ; from a management  and  or strategic perspective  Davis et al. 2005 .  The dynamics and processes may be conceived  as individual and subjective qualities of creativ- ity or as processes of cognitive problem solving   Simon 1977 ; as collective achievements when  seen from a systemic view  Csikzentmihaily 1996   and  or social and knowledge intensive processes  of learning when seen from a constructivist view   Darsøe 2009; Jensen 2008 . In this analysis I will,  however, focus on the distinction between closed  and open innovation.  Generally speaking, this distinction is a di- viding line and a recurring motif in each of the  above mentioned approaches to innovation. The  distinction is marked by the different relationships  between the many parties involved in innovative  practices.  They  may  be  subcontractors,  other  producers, universities or customers. In closed  innovation, the R & D department of companies is  seen as the main source of innovation. Knowledge,  experiments, tests, etc., of innovative products and  practices circulate in closed circuits kept secret  until  the  products’  introduction  to  the  market.  To illustrate this, I will refer to a definition of  innovation,  which  is  widely  adopted  in  policy  programs and statements  World Bank & OECD,  2009 . From this point of view, innovation is seen  as closely related to new products or processes of  commercial production:  Innovation occurs when a new or changed product  is introduced to the market, or when a new or  changed process is used in commercial produc- tion  Baldwin & Hanel in Jensen, 2008, p. 31 .   The closed innovation approach clearly de- marcates the boundaries between the product and  the consumer, the company and the market, the  company and the suppliers, and the company and  its competitors. If the end-users and consumers are  consulted, it is primarily for quality and usability  testing at the end of the innovation process and  before the marketing.  However, examples of advantages gained from  introducing ideas and knowledge from outside the  company and of doing so early in the practices  of innovation have also influenced the ideas of  innovation and led to the open innovation concept.  Open innovation denotes an assemblage of differ- ent ways to understand and produce innovation  concerted by the fact that end-users are involved in  early stages of the processes and practices. Among  others, the inspiration for the conception of open  innovation derives from software development and  the open source movement. The digital technolo- gies for communication, production, and design  are among the mediators of this changing of ideas  and practices of innovation. The personalization  of the web, the building of online communities  around a brand, the open source movements itself  are some of the examples of this development. In  his study about avatar-based Innovation, Thomas  Kohler  2008  traces the development of ideas and  practices which increasingly place the end-user s ,  the consumer s , as the initiator s  of the innova- tion practices or even as part of the production and  design itself. In this, he points to the notion of the  “prosumer” to conceptualize this development.  In the case of Second Life, we find closed as  well as open innovation depending on the optic of  analysis. Seen from the Linden Lab perspective  partly, the source code is public as the viewer is  open source, which means that it is open to further  development outside the control of the company.  Also, the Linden Lab company keeps up a dia- logue with in-world groups, bloggers, and online  communities to gain the advantages of feedback  and to appropriate the possible creativity of the  users. Yet, the core business decisions of R&D are   3   User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  only made public or open to co-creation when it  is a strategic advantage. Thus, the company seeks  to balance the more traditional practices of the  closed innovation approach and the open source  tradition which urges them to make available their  knowledge and sources for users to partake in the  co-creation and design.  MOTIVATIONS FOR CO-CREATION  The  question  is  however,  what  motivates  the  consumers and users to become active co-creators  of the design and content? In his work, Kohler  points out two main drivers. One is the recognition  that results from being close to the brand, i.e. the  Lindens; another is the experience itself. In order  to engage the residents in a co-creation process,  the experience itself should be compelling and  fun, entertaining and appealing. It is important  that the users see engagement as influential, with  an  impact  that  is  visible  and  recognizable  by  other members of the community, even outside  of it. Kohler  2008  refers to Bonsu & Darmody   2008  when he writes:  The authors convincingly outline the new mode of  production, where the host Linden Lab facilitates  unrestrained  consumer  freedom  and  empower- ment. The creative capacities of each consumer  of Second Life produce resources that are acces- sible to the community members and amenable  to  appropriation  for  corporate  ends   Kohler,  2008, p. 67 .  In concluding his study on avatar-based in- novation, Kohler distinguishes the four different  dimensions  affecting  the  design  of  compelling  and  engaging  experiences  of  co-creation.  The  dimensions  are:  desirability,  usability,  collabo- ration,  and  usefulness   Kohler,  2008,  p.  194 .  To create a compelling and desirable setting for  co-creation, the environment should be welcom- ing, comfortable, inspiring and stimulating and   4  provide a background for communication  DiPaola  &  Collins,  2002 .  In  the  case  of  Second  Life,  the place s  has  have to be distinguishable and  memorable and generate a sense of place and a  high degree of sensory immersion  Mullet, 2003 .  And importantly, the setting should emphasize  collaboration,  interaction,  and  modifiability  of  the content to inspire and serve as a starting point  for further creation tasks  Randall et al., 2005 .  Referring to some of the classic studies of usability   Nielsen, 1999  this dimension first of all states  that  a  compelling  environment  for  co-creation  should  facilitate  creativity  and  creation  rather  than generate obstacles to be overcome. The fre- quently stated needs are open architecture, ease  of use, clear navigation, and structure, the latter in  such a way as to balance structure and rules with  “free-flowing, evolving processes”  Hornecker,  2008 . To inspire collective consumer creativity,  Kozinets et al.  2008  suggest an environment and  content supported by help-seeking, help-giving,  reflective reframing and reinforcing behavior. As  for the third dimension, i.e. collaboration, ease of  contact with the brand, e.g. Linden Lab, company  interaction, and loosely knit communities of in- formal sociability, interpersonal interaction, and  communication in “third places” are important  drivers of engaging the co-creation  Steinkuhler  &  Williams  2006 .  Lessons  learned  from  the  many open source projects point to the important  findings that modularity and granularity as well  as integration mechanisms are needed. Finally,  the fourth dimension of usefulness identifies the  importance of a high degree of subjectivity and  clear goals; and research also points out that learn- ing and recognition have important parts to play  in building and designing compelling co-creation  experiences.  Let  me  summarize  what  has  been  said  so  far. Strategic decisions of the company and the  introduction of the Second Life platform to the  market follow a closed path of innovation  Au,  2008; Malaby, 2009  whereas the content creation  of this symbolic world is conceived an open space    User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  of innovation, co-creation, and design made by the  residents of the world. The business strategy of  leaving open the space for residents’ co-creation,  the initiatives to motivate residents’ creativity and  innovation, and the traditional closedness of the  platform’s system development, all of this forms a  complex network of innovative practices. Rather  than understanding the open and closed innova- tion as mutually exclusive, in the Second Life  case, they are networks of intertwined practices.  Subsequently,  Linden  Lab  faces  a  complexity  of innovation due to, on the one hand, the rapid  market developments of their field and, on the  other hand, the unpredictability of co-creation of  content. Their success depends on the residents’  ability and creativity to design and create compel- ling and desirable content thus to attract traffic  urging the residents to take yet another step of  engaging  their  fellow  residents  in  co-creating  practices. In other words, there are several steps  of  innovative  practices  involved  with  an  open  space virtual world like Second Life. It depends  on the users, the residents, and their motivation  and ability to create compelling and desirable ex- periences targeting their fellow residents possibly  even involving these in the co-creation. Hence,  we may see Second Life as a major experiment  with user-driven content creation in a complexity  of networks of innovative practices.  FORMS OF REMEDIATION  The  question  of  co-creation  of  content  in  the  symbolic world of Second Life also implies an  understanding  of  the  mediations  made  out  of  symbolic bricks, codes, signs, and shapes. From  the point of view of mediation, innovation can be  understood in terms of symbolic reorganization  of conceptual frameworks and meaning-making;  a  reorganization  that  allows  actors  to  see  and  interpret things in new ways. One such example  is the innovation that occurred when the under- standing  of  human  interaction  with  computers   changed from being seen as a military tool – with  “commands” – to become the personal tool – with  “clicks” - in a desktop metaphor  Nielsen et al.,  2008 . In both cases, metaphors have important  parts to play. Thus, to conceive of innovation in  terms of symbolic reorganization, the ambigui- ties of metaphors make possible a reframing of  meaning-making. In this, symbolic innovations  are different from the traditional understanding of  innovation as a well-orchestrated, clearly defined  set of actions that lead from the initial ideas to  the introduction and marketing of new products  and  or commercial processes.  Bolter & Grusin  1999  suggest the notion of  remediation to conceptualize their understanding  of digital media and the reorganization of media- tion and meaning-making that they bring. This  concept of remediation is now briefly dealt with as  it will assist us in the analysis of the case studies. Remediation denotes a strategy of mediation.  Basically,  the  concept  of  remediation  refers  to  a process by which one medium is represented  in  another.  If  the  photo  of  an  ancient  statuette  from a historical museum is digitized and put on  the web, then the digital version borrows from  the original and aims at mirroring it without ap- propriation. If the same statuette is remediated  to  a  digital  encyclopedia  with  annotations  and  search functionalities added, it makes possible a  reshaping of the ways in which to engage with  the medium; the photo of the original statuette  is reshaped and new options are added. Redefin- ing and refashioning are remediation processes  which almost aspire to alter and  or absorb the old  medium in the new. If the photo is remediated in  a virtual world like Second Life and used as the  texture of a virtual artifact that actors can use e.g.,  in  processes  of  deconstruction  and  reconstruc- tion, then the process of remediation profoundly  redefines the old medium. The online games are  obvious  examples  of  games  and  movies  being  redefined in processes of remediation. The Star  Wars Galaxies online game is an example of this.  In conclusion, it may be said that the borrowing,   5   User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  reshaping and redefining of one medium in an- other are strategies progressively moving from  continuity towards increased discontinuity of the  remediation process. These processes of remedia- tion and in particular the redefining of mediation  hold potential for innovation as it is shown by the  subsequent case studies.  CASE STUDIES: WONDER  DK, TIMES, AND THE  LITERARY PROJECT  The complexity and networks of open innovation  practices of Second Life, the motivations identified  that make users wish to partake in co-creation,  and the conceptions of remediation, together these  understandings form the conceptual framework for  the analysis of the case studies. They include three  Danish cases: the Wonder DK, Times, and Literary  projects. These cases have been studied over time  from the turn of the year 2006  2007 until 2010.  Ethnographic in-world studies and participatory  observations were conducted aimed to identify  cases of relevance to the study of sense-making and  user-driven innovation in virtual worlds  January  2007 to March 2008 . Two of the cases have been  followed until concluded: the Times and Literary  projects, whereas the third case, the Wonder DK  project, is still followed.  To follow up the ethnographic in-world studies,  in situ iterative video interviews have been carried  out covering five different foci of analyses: the  choice of virtual world, the design of the projects’  places and projects, the creation of personal me- diators in the shape of avatars, the relationships  with other residents and avatars of the world, the  influence of this on the perception of self, and  the weaving of the in-world agencies with those  outside Second Life. Each case study is briefly  introduced starting with the fully virtual business  case Wonder DK leading on to the completely  different business case of the Times project to  end with the public service project Literary. In   6  this chapter, the foci of analysis are motivations  to co-create and steps taken by the actors to make  their projects desirable, easy to use, collabora- tive, and useful. Thus, designing the places and  projects, creating their mediators by the design  of figures and avatars, and the framing of social  relationships with other in-world residents and  customers, these are three steps followed in the  case analysis.  Wonder DK: A Virtual  World Business Case  In the Wonder DK case, a start-up is run by a  team of investors. Together they have invested  in a Second Life island to run a fully virtual real  estate business renting out land to outside busi- nesses that wish to be present in Second Life.  To develop this business concept and strategy,  the  manager  is  fulltime  employed  as  he  is  to  make a living of the Wonder DK start-up proj- ect. Renting out shops is the core content of the  business. To frame this, the digital remediation  of an image of a typical Danish provincial town  is designed. It is a structured and well-planned  design of an entire island as the manager finds  that many design and places on the Linden Lab  mainland are frightening examples of pointless  and ill-designed projects and places. Therefore,  the general framing of the Wonder DK is created  by the manager with small shops all over the town  surrounded by cozy streets, houses and squares  together with agricultural and meadow-like areas,  harbors and ships. The small shops are for rent  preferable by outside businesses paying with the  real money of outside economies and they are open  to co-creation by the tenants. To ensure system  performance only a limited amount of symbolic  bricks and prims are available for the designing  practices. Every Dane avatar who visits this place  will immediately recognize the environment. They  know how to navigate and find it amusing to see  how the design is made. The first step taken by  the manager of the business is to make sure that    User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  the design of the Wonder DK world is attractive,  orderly and recognizable to convincingly convey  the sense of a professional site.  Wonder DK is started in the wake of the Sec- ond  Life  hype  in  Denmark  in  early  2007  with  extensive media coverage. To attract attention to  the place, the team decided to remediate a famous  fictional TV-series Matador about Danish society  and history from the beginning of the 20th century  until the Second World War. Buildings, cars, the  famous wheelchair of the Mrs. Møge character,  shops, etc., are remediated and the Second Life  town Korsbæk is named after the provincial town  that  frames  the  story  of  Matador.  These  steps  trigger attention. Many Danish residents entering  Second Life visit the place to see and experience  what Korsbæk looks like when remediated in a  virtual world.  The mediator of the manager’s in-world busi- ness – the avatar DC Aspen – is much in line  with the design of the place and island. He is a  remediation of the cultural image of a business  man aimed to create a sense of professionalism  and trust. The need to generate a sense of trust  with  his  companion  avatar  DC Aspen  is  vital,  according to the manager.  One of the frequently visited places of Kors- bæk is the town square. It is an open space with  a lot of information about activities in Wonder  DK and other in-world events. Avatars hang out  chatting and showing their animations at the town  square. Town guides volunteer to show visiting  avatars around the town thus getting a legitimate  occasion to chat with the visitors. Importantly, the  manager is almost always online often working  80 hours a week; he is easy to contact and soon  also well-known for his knowledge about Second  Life and his competence as to design.  The Wonder DK case is still running although  the core business has changed. Increasingly, the  content  of  the  business  includes  Second  Life  design consultancies.  Times: A Virtual World Branch of  a Company Outside Second Life  The Times business project paints a quite different  picture. It is a virtual branch of an international  company outside Second Life: a company with  many affiliations all around Denmark. The core  business of this company is to recruit temporary  workers in order to match them with potential  employers.  One  of  the  employees  of  a  Danish  branch of the company is supported by her im- mediate manager to start up a virtual branch in  Second Life with the aim to explore if the vir- tual world holds potential for the endeavors of  matching  and  recruiting.  The  top-managers  of  the company, however, do not see any sense in  exploring this potential.  The approach taken by the project manager is  to rent several places thus distributing the activi- ties of the project. There is no centrally located  place referring to the project and related activities.  The distributed locations are designed with an ap- proach quite different from Wonder DK. Instead  of carefully remediated and well-known images  as of Wonder DK, several distributed open spaces  are designed. This is to adapt to the Second Life  environment that requires freedom of movement,  which is why it should be easy to fly in and out  of the design. Any obstacle to this freedom of  movement is seen as undesirable. The open spaces  have  no  immediate  reference  or  resemblance  with the traditional images of a company or other  environments. They are transparent and inspired  by science fiction.  However, the urge and request to attract atten- tion to the project is as strong as in the Wonder  DK business whereas the strategy by which to  meet  these  requests  is  different.  Attention  is  drawn to the Times project by the design of the  project manager’s avatar, Helle, rather than by  the design of the rented places. They only hold  posters with information about the core business  activities. The avatar is a funny-looking egg-or- balloon-like  avatar  wearing  advertisements  as   7   User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  clothing. To attract attention and make avatars  aware  of  the  project,  Helle  travels  around  the  many islands of Second Life. Whenever there is  an event, an arrangement, a network meeting, she  attends it to start chatting with the avatars pres- ent about whatever comes up. The funny look of  her advertising avatar easily shifts the chat to be  about the Times business project. As part of this  business strategy, an extensive in-world network  is built. Networking with her companion avatar  Helle is the most important part of doing business  in a virtual world like Second Life, according to  the project manager.  As mentioned, from the outset, the top-manag- ers of the company did not support the project so  by the end of 2007 the project was closed.  The Literary Project: A Public  Service Institution  In the Literary project of a Danish public service  institution, the very idea is to involve visitors of  the place in activities of co-creation. Entering the  virtual world in the wake of the intense media  coverage in early 2007, this project is initiated  and a project team is built with the aim of com- municating to a wider audience how to enter this  world. Public service, enlightenment, access to  information,  knowledge,  and  experience  with  media are some of the purposes and obligations  of the institution. In line with this, the main idea  is  to  spread  and  share  with  public  audiences  knowledge about virtual worlds, be they social  worlds or gaming.  To realize the project aims a place is rented  on  the  Linden  Lab  mainland  just  beside  other  early Danish Second Life projects. The design  of the place is not planned in advance; rather, it  is designed in spontaneous sessions of creation  involving the project team as well as other visitors  of the place. Thus, it is difficult to see what kind  of place is designed, what the purpose of it is, and  what to do at the place. It conveys a somewhat  messy  impression.  On  a  wall  it  says:  Literary,   8  which is the only mark that signifies what this place  is about and who runs it. Thus, the design does  not help visitors understand the aim and activity  of the place. Also, it proves problematic that visi- tors are not able to create anything but messy and  pointless design, according to the project team. As for the mediating avatars, the project sets  out with a shared workplace avatar expecting the  colleagues of their institution to join their activi- ties in Second Life. Within only a short while, the  shared avatar is given up as it generates a lot of  confusion. Avatars appear to be a personal matter  and mediator. The many items in the avatar’s inven- tory signify experiences and memory. Landmarks  of the inventory tell the story of places visited by  the avatar, items and clothes are bought and stored,  looks and outfits, gestures and animations, all of  these help generate an avatar’s history and they  are important for the personal mediation made  possible by the avatar. Furthermore, it turns out  that the colleagues do not use the avatar. Therefore,  it is made a personal avatar and some new avatars  are created. It proves too confusing to share an  avatar not only for the project team but also for  their in-world visitors never knowing who is ac- companied by the avatar.  As mentioned, the general idea of the place is  to help public audiences enter the place to learn  how to design and create places, objects, etc., and  to disseminate and create new kinds of Literary  experiences. Over time, however, the strategy of  co-design with public audiences is given up as  it proves far too difficult to realize. Instead, the  predominant activity of the place turns out to be  meetings with a group of colleagues of the same  profession. This group of colleagues meets on a  weekly basis to discuss and debate the relevance of  Second Life to wider audiences. To support these  weekly meetings, the project buys an animated  chair with an animation that creates a new chair  each time an avatar joins the meeting; the chairs  are scripted to form a circle to ask avatars in with  this welcoming design and animation.   User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  Due to a general reduction of staff, the project  team member who is the driving force of the ad- vancements of the project is not reappointed when  his temporary employment expires. Therefore the  project is closed over summer 2007.  CASE ANALYSIS  The analysis of the cases will now follow steps  taken by each case with reference to the three  foci: designing the places and projects, creating  the mediators, and the framing of relationships  with other residents and avatars. The concept of  remediation and the motivations identified will  guide the steps of the analysis.  Design of Place  In Wonder DK, the place is seen as immediately  useful. It serves the business manager’s purposes  well and inspires co-creation. With a professional  background in programming and a hobby of build- ing environments for model railways, the manager  is used to understanding scripting languages, plan- ning places easy to navigate, and to build models  of aesthetic quality. The steps taken help create a  place useful for the owner and project manager,  easy to navigate and use for other residents with  their avatars, and the owner is in full control of  the island’s design. Most importantly, the idea of  the remediation of the fictional TV-series Mata- dor brings about a good start as it is conceived  a compelling experience to visit the place. Thus  the place and the business avatar DC Aspen is  quickly  widely  known  as  Wonder  DK  attracts  attention and traffic.  Compared to this, the Times project sets out  with a disputed question of its usefulness. A di- vergence between the local and the international  management means that the project is not fully  supported and it starts with a very low budget. The  project relies on the unpaid work of the project  initiator. Her ideas of how best to design Second   Life places entail distributed places with open and  transparent spaces. This adaptation to the virtual  world however, complicates other residents and  avatars’ recognition of the places; they are difficult  to remember, locate and understand. Most impor- tantly, the places do not contribute a compelling  experience only remediated information posters  of  job  announcements.  Renting  the  distributed  places does not allow the project manager and  designer to be in full control of the surrounding  places and environments.  The Literary project is fully supported by the  management of the institution. It is considered  useful to explore and get to know about virtual  worlds like Second Life. Yet, there are doubts as to  the usefulness of this project among professionals  from other similar institutions as they do not see  engaging with virtual worlds as part of the public  institutions’ obligations. Still, the public service  obligation is the aim of the Literary project tar- geted at public audiences. Renting islands on the  Linden Lab mainland, the project team aims to  educate and awaken the public awareness of the  emergence of these new media. To realize this, the  idea of the design is an open place for visitors to  try out how to design and collaborate in Second  Life. Thus, the explicit purpose of the project is  co-creation  of  content.  The  place  is,  however,  difficult to understand, the goal is not made clear,  the design of places is difficult for the audiences  targeted by the project, and the team has no control  of the surrounding environments of the design.  Therefore, the co-creation of content is given up.  The experimental approach is followed up by the  design of meditation bubbles to mediate surreal  and funny experiences. These bubbles are also,  it appears, difficult to understand and navigate  for visitors who are not familiar with the Second  Life environment.  Mediators  Avatars  can  be  seen  as  personal  mediators  in  virtual worlds. In the three Second Life cases, the   9   User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  avatars’ design is vital for the projects to reach out  and attract attention. The design of these avatars  is approached differently.  Remediating  the  image  of  a  business  man,  DC Aspen, is useful with regard to the purposes  of the Wonder DK project. It is an avatar easy  to  understand  and  recognizable. Together  with  the design of the Wonder DK island this avatar  inspires the trust of other residents and conveys  an  impression  of  responsibility  important  for  doing business.  Compared  to  this,  the  design  of  the  Times  project’s primary avatar, Helle, is meant to at- tract attention due to a very unusual outfit and  appearance.  This  avatar  design  is  vital  to  the  nomadic  business  strategy  of  the  project.  The  travelling avatar aims to spread the message about  the project and to increase the awareness of its  services. From an immediate point of view, it is  difficult to understand and decode the avatar but  that is part of the purpose, which is to convey a  funny experience and with that, an invitation to  chat. These adaptations to the Second Life world,  however, are not obvious and useful when seen  from the perspective of an international top man- agement’s point of view. The funny and unusual  look, the nomadic approach, the distributed places  inspired by sci-fi, does not appear convincing to a  management full of doubts as to the relevance of  this project. Even if meaningful when seen from  the in-world perspective this approach collides  with norms and expectations.  From the outset, a shared avatar is designed  in the Literary project. Sharing the avatar proves  very confusing. Never knowing what has happened  to the avatar since the last logon, what objects  and  things  have  been  bought,  or  how  clothing  and appearance have changed – all of this means  that it is a very confusing experience to share the  avatar. It generates large gaps in the memory of  the owners. Further, the remediated intellectually- looking female avatar is a problem for one of the  male members of the team. It is experienced as  unpleasant to be a female avatar.  10  Social Relationships  The welcoming town square of Korsbæk creates  an open square for avatars to meet, chat, pose, and  dance showing their animations, creative media,  and  other  in-world  gadgets.  In  other  words,  it  frames a compelling experience of social rela- tionships with other residents and avatars of the  group  of Wonder  DK  as  well  as  residents  and  avatars from outside the place. The framing of the  social relationships is easy to use and as of social  norms, it is acceptable to hang out at the town  square together with other residents and avatars  to also seek info about events and arrangements  in Second Life.  The Times project’s business strategy entails  social relationships and chatting. It is a compel- ling experience to meet the unusual avatar of the  project. The  avatar’s  appearance  is  difficult  to  understand thus inviting to chat by awaking other  residents’ curiosity. Also it is easy to recognize  and  remember  it.  This  design  of  the  avatar  is  useful in the sense that it serves to realize the  building of a network of business relations and  knowledge sharing.  In  the  Literary  project,  the  approach  is  ex- perimental. The project team seeks to realize the  “not possible in real life” approach while at the  same time targeting wider public audiences. The  experiments aimed to teach visitors how to design  and co-create the project’s place prove too difficult  to understand, use, and learn. Subsequently, the  actual content of the project is changed to frame  weekly meetings of avatars and to host critical  discussions and debates about the very idea of  providing  public  services  about  virtual  worlds  like Second Life. Changing the aim, the project  does not reach out to public audiences but to a  circle of residents and professional colleagues.  Comparison  Comparing the different design of places it ap- pears that the Wonder DK business meets many    User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  of the motivations identified that drive co-creation  practices. It is conceived immediately useful for  the business purposes, easy to use for other fel- low residents, and the owner is well-reputed and  in control of the place. It provides a compelling  experience.  In the co-creation and design of projects and  places different forms of remediation stand out.  In the design of a typical Danish provincial town  of  Wonder  DK  the  remediation  borrows  from  an  ideal  typical  and  romanticized  image.  This  cultural image is reshaped in the virtual world’s  environment. Using this well-known image, the  new environment is made easily accessible. Also,  the  remediation  of  the  fictional  town  of  Kors- bæk with many recognizable buildings, streets,  vehicles,  etc.,  it  redefines  the  widely  known  TV-series. Thus, the Second Life residents can  rent and design a shop to run a business in the  remediated  fictional  town  of  Korsbæk.  In  the  case of Wonder DK, remediation takes on forms  of  borrowing,  reshaping  as  well  as  redefining.  In particular, the redefining of the fictional town  affords a compelling experience. The remediation  of the Times project takes two main forms. The  design of the project’s distributed places inspires  a science-fiction-like atmosphere borrowed from  movies, fiction, and high-tech modes of expres- sion. In contrast, the job advertisements remediate  the content and lay-out by borrowing from well- known forms of announcement. In the Literary  project, the design is experimental in the sense  that it aims to spontaneously co-create the rented  place together with casual visitors. No apparent  remediation is part of the original design.  The remediation of the business man of the  Wonder DK business as well as the intellectual-like  female avatar from the Times project borrow from  ideal typical cultural images to reshape these in  the Second Life environment. In the Times proj- ect the choice and design of the avatar redefines  the appearance of a project manager. The avatar  does not make any reference to known images  or conceptions except for the job advertisements   worn by the funny-looking egg-and-balloon-like  figure. Only the remediated advertisements give  a hint of the purpose of the avatar.  In remediating the town square of Korsbæk, the  design borrows from the ideal typical and roman- ticized picture of a cozy, friendly and welcoming  Danish  square  to  initiate  social  relationships;  a  pond  with  ducks,  the  typical  green  benches,  paving  stones,  shops  encircling  the  place,  and  Danish flags, they are cultural images that reshape  and set the scene for chatting and socializing. As  compared to this, in the Times project no places  for social relationships are remediated whereas  the nomadic avatar is vital for building the busi- ness and social networks. When the aim of the  Literary project is changed, a meeting place is  remediated in a minimalistic reshaping, whereas  the animated chair that automatically includes a  new avatar into the meeting circle redefines the  meeting place. These weekly meetings serve to  frame professional collaboration even if they also  lead to arguments and disagreements.  In Table 1, the case analysis is condensed and  held together with the motivations for co-creation  as introduced earlier: compelling and desirable  setting, usability, collaboration, and usefulness.  By comparison, three examples are pointed out  regarding openness and closedness of co-creation:  the design of places in Wonder DK as compared  with the Literary project, the avatar mediators of  the Times as compared with the Literary projects,  and  the  welcoming  invitation  of  the  Literary  project’s chair and the city guides of Wonder DK. In  Table  1,  the  case  analysis  of  design  of  places,  mediators,  and  social  relationships  is  condensed and coded with reference to motiva- tions for co-creation.  In Wonder DK, the design is a recognisable  remediation which provides a compelling expe- rience. However, to achieve an orderly and neat  place, the owner is in tight control leaving only  little  room  for  co-creation.  In  this  respect,  the  place is characterised by closedness. Compared  to  this,  from  the  outset,  the  Literary  project  is   11   User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  1. Design of place  2. Mediators  3.

[Difficult to understand] Not  easy to recognize except for the  name of the project on a wall.    [Disputed] Known in a circle of  professionals  completely open to co-creation even for casual  by-passers. This approach leaves the project with  a place difficult to understand. There is no appar- ent remediation; rather, the design appears to be  messy. The places concerned, exemplify how dif- ficult it is to balance the recognisable remediation  of places with an open approach to co-creation.  In both cases, the endeavour is to open the place  for co-creation, yet, it proves difficult to realise. In the Literary project, it is confusing to co- create a shared avatar. The changing appearance   is difficult to understand for the project’s visitors  as well as for the members of the team. The open  approach to the co-creation of the avatar is given  up. In the Times project, it is also difficult to un- derstand the avatar which is not a remediation of  a known cultural image, but this confusion is part  of the purpose. Awaking other avatars curiosity,  the project manager incites them to co-create the  network-building activities of the project.  The welcoming gesture of the animated chair  invites other avatars to co-create the content of   Table 1.  Wonder DK  Times  Literary  12   User-Driven Content Creation in Second Life: A Source of Innovation?  events at the Literary project’s place. In Wonder  DK, some of the regulars of the town-square-chat  volunteer to show around visitors at the place; it  provides in-world status to be part of the project.  In both cases, the openness and the welcoming  remediation  encourage  co-creation  in  terms  of  socialising and event-making.  CONCLUSION  Concluding  the  case  analysis,  I  will  point  to  two factors of importance: 1  the co-creation of  compelling  experiences  and  activities,  and  2   the mastering of different forms of remediation.  As mentioned earlier, in the case of Second Life  there is a complexity of requirements regarding  user-driven content creation and innovation. To  make a symbolic world a compelling experience  several steps have to be taken. First, the platform  itself  i.e. Second Life  must be useful and easy  to use but also inspire a compelling experience.  Secondly, actors who contribute the content by  co-creating  and  remediating  shapes  and  signs  must also be capable to design compelling ex- periences that are easy to understand, use, and  remember if they aim to start projects targeting  other residents, participants, or visitors. Thirdly,  in itself, it is a difficult task to remediate cultural  images  of  artifacts,  clothes,  places,  buildings,  environments, metaphors, and genres by means  of symbolic shapes and signs. Thus, the open and  user-generated content creation of Second Life  invites the residents of the world to contribute  new interpretations and experiences while at the  same time it is a risky strategy for the providers  of platforms  i.e. Linden Lab  as well as the in- world  projects  and  businesses  considering  the  complexity of the networks of innovative practices  involved.  Remediation encompasses borrowing, reshap- ing, and redefining of mediated content. In Wonder  DK, the cultural images of a cosy Danish provin- cial town and square is borrowed and reshaped   along with the redefined TV-series Matador. The  cultural image of the project manager of the Times  project is a redefined conspicuous advertisement  pillar travelling between places inspired by the  remediated genre and images of science fiction.  The meeting place of the Literary project with the  animated chair is a redefined welcoming invita- tion to visitors of the place. The main problem is  however  that  the  competencies,  creativity,  and  knowledge needed to create compelling experi- ences are scarce resources. To generate creative  ideas  and  to  remediate  these  ideas  make  high  demands on knowledge, skills, imagination, and  methods of seeing the familiar in new ways. To  generate  new  understandings  of  known  forms  of mediation it takes rethinking, redefining, and  remediation. Not only is creativity needed to bor- row and reshape well-known mediations but so is  the ability to add-on to these by creating new and  hereto unknown experiences using the symbolic  shapes and signs. The case studies show that to  redefine  shapes  and  signs  in  a  virtual  world  it  requires know-how about how to make useful,  easy to use and navigate digital design as well as  methods to reorganise conceptual frameworks and  meaning-making.  Remediation  is  an  analytical  concept that may help us develop such methods  to  advance  innovative  practices  and  design  in  virtual worlds.

Manual tools are no longer sufficient to match this rising  need, and the impact that automatic tools may have within these fields is essential and may lead to an  adoption of virtual worlds in a growing number of applications. Indeed, it is possible to eliminate most  of the effort associated with the creation of such environments, by providing tools that may generate  “massive” 3D content automatically. In consequence these tools may lead to an exponential growth of  virtual environments and represent an important turn into the design of realistic virtual cities, which  may have a huge impact on virtual world users. This chapter discusses the very complex issue of where  and when procedural modelling may be used and presents some solutions and methods that have been  successfully used in the aforementioned fields of application.  INTRODUCTION  The continuous trend to use virtual worlds coming  from several different domains, such as education  and private sectors, leads to the need to efficiently  create  virtual  environments.  Indeed,  in  virtual   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch002  worlds as well as in the competitive markets of  film, video games and several other applications,  there is a trend to rapidly produce digital content  at low costs. Manually designing virtual environ- ments, during long periods of time, is not a cost  effective solution with limited valuable human  resources in many situations.  Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

Procedural Virtual Worlds  Within the present context, procedural model- ling represents an effective solution to produce  digital  content  which  is,  in  numerous  virtual  worlds,  often  characterized  by  urban  environ- ments. In order to assure the realism of the final  models  there  is  the  need  to  account  for  many  architectural concerns. These are essential aspects  when dealing with different applications, such as  heritage worlds amongst others. The increasing  number of virtual world users from diverse areas  creates the need to provide tools, able to efficiently  produce realistic urban environments featuring  traversable structures  e.g. houses , which achieve  architectural coherence.  Traditionally procedural modelling have been  used mostly in film and games and is not, yet, a  mainstream solution for the design of 3D content  for virtual worlds, such as Second Life, Active- worlds or Croquet. It is a fact that some virtual  worlds  e.g. Second Life  have well known native  modelling tools, but these are not yet procedural.  Some small procedural plug-ins do exist, often  designed  only  to  fulfil  small  specific  require- ments, such as the creation of textures. For these  reasons, the next sections describe in which worlds  may these procedural techniques and tools may  be adopted and when and how it may be done.  This  chapter  is  mostly  centred  on  the  creation  of  urban  environments,  one  of  the  targets  of  procedural modelling. Most virtual worlds, such  as virtual worlds for socialization purposes, are  often characterized by these type of models. The  automatic content creation that can be achieved  with such tools may deal with different features,  such  as  the  generation  of  clouds  and  textures,  streets and roads, vegetation, houses and many  other objects. These content generation have been  used mainly in film and game industry but most  of this features are often present in virtual worlds  and may used in these in a similar way.  This chapter starts by presenting an overview  of procedural modelling. Then the dilemma behind  where, when and how should procedural model- ling be used in virtual worlds is addressed. This   is followed by a discussion of two possible tar- gets of procedural modelling: reconstruction and  generation. After that, some tools and techniques  are described and finally some conclusions and  future trends presented.  “GOING PROCEDURAL”  In  the  last  few  years,  the  use  of  algorithms  to  automatically  generate  virtual  reality  environ- ments has become an effective solution for the  production of digital content. In fact, the idea of  automatically recreating environments with very  little modelling effort is a fascinating idea that can  lead to several benefits in different areas includ- ing virtual worlds  a few other examples include  architecture, video games and movies . The goal  is to place all, or most of the effort, of creating an  environment in computer software. This means  that the time spent by human resources, such as  computer modellers or even a plain virtual world  user who wants to create their own models, would  be significantly reduced and their time may be  used on more useful tasks.  The creation of virtual environments via an  algorithm  instead of manually  is often identified  as “generation” of virtual environments. Similarly,  the set of techniques which rely on algorithms to  generate these environments are often referred to  as “procedural modelling” techniques. Although  there are diverse techniques used in procedural  modelling,  such  as  grammar  based  techniques   e.g. L-systems1 , fractals2 and generative mod- elling3, the general purpose of these is similar:  apply parameterised algorithms to produce 3D  virtual scenes. The result is to create 3D models  or textures from user choices rather than manu- ally modelling each of the environment features. Procedural  modelling  techniques  embody  essential tools, in situations where it would be  cumbersome to create 3D models manually, or  where current software does not provide efficient  means to produce those models. One particular   17   Procedural Virtual Worlds  2007 . It is a fact that grammar approaches re- quire many rules to generate the models but if, at  first, this seems a clear disadvantage, compared  to other approaches, the flexibility provided by  grammars  makes  them  a  powerful  tool  for  the  generation of urban models. Furthermore, it is  also possible to avoid the text-based complexity  of  grammars  by  designing  efficient  interactive  visual editing systems for shape grammars, such  as the one presented by Lipp et al.  Lipp, Wonka,  & Wimmer, 2008 .  Figure 1 presents a procedural generated vir- tual environment including algorithm generated  objects  houses and roads  and manually designed  objects  fences, trees and lightning poles . All of  the houses in the picture are completely travers- able and although some objects were manually  designed they were algorithmically placed  via  an L-system .  WHICH WORLDS?  The first question concerning the use of proce- dural modelling techniques in virtual worlds is  where, i.e. in which virtual worlds may they be  used? This raises another question, which types  of virtual worlds exist?  The most popular virtual worlds are used for  entertainment purposes. Most of them belong to  the category of the so called Massively Multiplayer  Online Role Playing Games  MMORPG   Wood- cock, 2008  and are games in their real sense as  they have an inbuilt narrative or meta-narrative  for the users which have in that game a specific  purpose  or  goal  to  achieve.  Some  of  the  most  played MMORPGs today are World of Warcraft   Warcraft, 2010 , Lineage  Lineage, 2010  and  RunEscape  RunEscape, 2008 .  One other popular use of virtual worlds is for  socialization purposes. The so called Massively  Multiplayer  Online  Social  Games   MMOSG   which, without necessarily imposing a narrative  to the user, focuses on the social aspect of it as   situation, which reveals the huge advantages of  such techniques, is their use in computer anima- tions where one can easily imagine the amount of  effort necessary to perform some manual tasks,  such as perform characters movement including  their hair and clothing. For these reasons recent  animation  movies  use  algorithmic  simulations  to perform characters animation. It is also easy  to imagine several situations where procedural  modelling may be useful such as the generation  of “massive” 3D models to quickly populate a  virtual  world   e.g.  traversable  buildings  for  a  whole city . As such there is an increase demand  for tools that can produce 3D content, which in  some situations requires automatic solutions as  manual creation methods are no longer sufficient. The generation of urban structures seems to be  a very appealing target for the use of procedural  techniques, since urban models embody most of  the computer graphics environments in several  areas. For this reason there has already been a  number  of  papers  produced  concerning  urban  procedural modelling such as the work presented  in  “Procedural  Modeling  of  Cities”   Parish  &  Müller, 2001 , in “Real-time Procedural Genera- tion of ‘Pseudo Infinite’ Cities”  Greuter, Parker,  Stewart, & Leach, 2003 , in “Instant Architecture”   Wonka, Wimmer, Sillion, & Ribarsky, 2003  and  in “Procedural Modeling of Buildings”  Müller,  Wonka, Haegler, Ulmer, & Gool, 2006 .  One common characteristic amongst most of  the existing methods within the field of urban pro- cedural modelling, e.g.  Coelho, Bessa, Sousa, &  Ferreira, 2007; Pascal Müller, et al., 2006; Parish  & Müller, 2001; Wonka, et al., 2003 , is the use  of some kind of grammar  e.g. shape grammars:  L-systems, split grammars4, etc. , although the  purpose may be very diverse  e.g. generate roads,  determine building locations, generate building  facades, etc. . Indeed, even within recent tech- niques ranging photogrammetry and or LIDAR,  grammars are also applied, e.g.  Aliaga, Rosen,  & Bekins, 2007; Hohmann, Krispel, Havemann,  & Fellner, 2009; Müller, Zeng, Wonka, & Gool,   18   Procedural Virtual Worlds  Figure 1. Procedural generated environment  the  main  purpose,  are  expanding.  Second  Life   SecondLife,  2009   is  currently  the  most  well  known virtual world of this kind, and the most  open to content development by users, but many  others  have  similar  or  greater  popularity,  e.g.  IMVU   IMVU,  2010 ,  particularly  within  the  age groups of children and teenagers, e.g. Habbo  Hotel   Hotel,  2010 ,  Club  Penguin   Penguin,  2010 . The “Universe chart” in Kzero  KZero,  2010  shows the variety and popularity of virtual  worlds universe.  One interesting aspect of some virtual worlds,  MMOSGs  in  particular,  is  that  as  they  don’t  have a goal to achieve or narrative to follow but  rather they give the users the tools to make them.  Second Life is well known by its 3D modelling  tools   not  procedural ,  which  allow  users  the  ability to program and control the behaviour of  the world’s objects. Other MMOSGs have lesser  degrees of freedom in the level of control they  give their users for creating content, but several  provide tools that are adequate within the scope  of this chapter  e.g. Activeworlds and Croquet .  Virtual Worlds that have these two features give  its users tremendous possibilities as worlds can  be created and programmed for certain activities   as education, scientific research and collaborative  work, amongst others.  These two perspectives see virtual worlds as  pre-existing entities upon which one wishes to  create content. A third perspective is that one may  decide to create a virtual world from scratch, and  provide the content from the start. This can be done  using either a set of traditional programming tools  or a special-purpose development library, such as  Unity3D  Unity3D, 2010 .  The  potential  of  virtual  worlds  is  very  rich  but has yet to be fully realised  Prentice, 2007 .  Still, there are already a great number of projects  that take virtual worlds for education purposes   Ching-Song, Yan, & Jiann-Gwo, 2009; Dickey,  2005; Dreher, Reiners, Dreher, & Dreher, 2009;  Natho & Pfeiffer, 2010  and training  Heinrichs,  Youngblood, Harter, & Dev, 2008 . These two uses  of virtual worlds take advantage of, very often,  virtual worlds as a simulating platform. Simula- tion may be seen as a technique “to replace or  amplify real experiences with guided experiences,  often immersive in nature, that evoke or replicate  substantial  aspects  of  the  real  world  in  a  fully  interactive fashion”  Gaba, 2004 . Virtual worlds,  as simulators, have some advantages over other  types of simulators as high-fidelity simulators are   19   Procedural Virtual Worlds  WHEN?  Once it is established the different types of vir- tual worlds which may benefit from procedural  modelling it is also essential to determine when  these techniques might be applied. This question  does not have a straightforward answer since it  is dependent of several aspects. For example, it  depends of the availability of efficient methods  tools to produce the models. Most likely a com- mon virtual world user who does not have any  programming skills will not be willing to develop  an algorithm to create virtual models.  Another example is the purpose for which the  models are intended. It is not the same generat- ing models for a pure imaginary world than for  a world where the purpose is to represent real  world structures. In fact, in procedural modelling  techniques, the quality of the 3D models is closely  related with the quality of the algorithm used to  generate them, whereas in manual techniques the  quality  of  the  models  is  directly  related  to  the  skills of the human modeller.  Furthermore  the  choice  of  when  to  use  a  procedural technique is always dependent on the  person who will design the world, either this is a  computer graphics modeller or a common virtual  world user. Most likely it is possible that, even  when  considering  a  procedural  approach,  the  user would like to manually create some features  or make some customizations thus producing a  hybrid model. After all, as previously stated, the  goal of procedural techniques is not to replace hu- man resources or creativity but instead to provide  efficient tools aiding the sometimes arduous and  tedious task of producing complex 3D content.  These are just a few examples since there may  be  many  other  aspects  constraining  the  use  of  procedural techniques. So, as may be understood  there is not a unique answer of when to “go pro- cedural”. Though, one may say at the very least  that  procedural  techniques  are  very  likely  the  prime resort for the generation of virtual worlds,  in present days, where it would be cumbersome   expensive and students may be geographical far  apart in virtual worlds  Heinrichs, et al., 2008 ,  and in that virtual worlds can be more flexible in  the range of educational activities, by leverag- ing the ability for students trainees to create or  modify content.  Other purposes for virtual worlds that are worth  mentioning are the ones used for collaborative  work  Back, et al., 2010; Bouras, Tegos, Triglianos,  & Tsiatsos, 2007; Snowdon, Churchill, & Munro,  2001 ,  scientific  research   Bainbridge,  2007 ,  virtual tourism  Bellotti, Berta, Gloria, Panizza,  &  Primavera,  2009   and  military  applications   3DSolve, 2010; Benford, Greenhalgh, Rodden,  & Pycock, 2001 . The commercial potential of  virtual worlds is also subject of much research   Fang & Cai, 2009; Seidel & Berger, 2007 .  Now, that a brief overview of has been pre- sented the initial question persists. The fact is that  independent of the type of virtual world there is  a common feature amongst them, which is they  all use 3D models, that represent nature, urban  structures  or  even  other  human-made  objects.  Indeed it is easy to foresee a set of contexts where  automatic 3D modelling mechanisms based on  user parameters are useful. For example, a virtual  city with hundreds or thousands of buildings can be  implemented for real life simulations  e.g. earth- quake damages scenarios  as virtual worlds may  also have powerful physics engines integrated.  These can also be useful for games and movies  as new scenarios could easily be seen and tested  since it would only be needed to change the pre- programmed rules for building creation.  These features makes procedural modelling  a  suitable  tool  for  mostly  all  of  the  presented  virtual worlds presented, since it ranges several  different features ranging the simple generation  of a texture, performing real objects animations   e.g. smoke, fire  to the complete generation of  urban environments.  20   Procedural Virtual Worlds  to create 3D models manually or where current  software  does  not  provide  efficient  means  to  produce those models.  HOW?  The previous sections described where and when  procedural modelling techniques may be used but  did not described exactly the features of the dif- ferent virtual worlds. This section presents how  they may be used.  Most  procedural  modelling  techniques  ad- dress the generation of different features which  may refer either to generation of static models  or animated ones, allowing for the generation of  models representing many of the physical objects  present in our world. In  Watson, et al., 2008   the authors present a briefing of some of the vast  quantity of procedural modelling “targets” and  the  corresponding  techniques  commonly  used  by several authors to generate or simulate each  of them. L-systems are identified for the genera- tion of plants  Prusinkiewicz, Lindenmayer, &  Hanan, 1988 , agent-based methods to model and  animate different types of objects – e.g. particle  systems to model fuzzy objects such as fire and  smoke   Reeves,  1983   and  Reynolds’  boids  to  animate  flocks,  schools  and  herds   Reynolds,  1987 , Perlin’s noise to simulate clouds and natural  textures  Perlin, 1985 , and fractal techniques to  synthesise natural landscapes  Fournier, Fussell,  & Carpenter, 1982  or even simulate erosion ef- fects on them  Musgrave, Kolb, & Mace, 1989 . All of these features make it possible to use  procedural modelling in a large diversity of ap- plications where different techniques may be used  to  couple  with  different  aspects.  For  example,  they may centre the attention on the generation  of individual houses  Martin, 2005; Rodrigues,  Dionísio, et al., 2008a, 2008b; Rodrigues, et al.,  2009 , on tall buildings and skyscrapers  Greuter,  et al., 2003; Parish & Müller, 2001; Park, 2005 ,  or on large urban environments  Bostrom, et al.,   2004; Willmott, Wright, Arnold, & Day, 2001 ,  applying urban planning principles to the design  of virtual environments  Ingram, Benford, Rd, &  Bowers, 1996 , modelling from architectural rules   Fuchs, 2006; Luca, Véron, & Florenzano, 2007;  Rodrigues, Dionísio, et al., 2008a, 2008b; Ro- drigues, Magalhães, Moura, & Chalmers, 2008 ,  dealing with specific features as the generation  of streets and roads  Chen, Esch, Wonka, Müller,  & Zhang, 2008; Parish & Müller, 2001 , or on  house specific house features such as windows   Charbonneau, Boulerice, Booth, & Tidafi, 2006 .  Likewise, they may focus on modern architecture   Bessa, et al., 2005; Coelho, et al., 2007; Martin,  2005; Rodrigues, Dionísio, et al., 2008a, 2008b  or  on heritage architecture, such as Roman  Müller,  Vereenooghe, Ulmer, & Gool, 2005; Rodrigues,  Magalhães, Moura, & Chalmers, 2007; Rodrigues,  Magalhães, et al., 2008  or Mayan architecture   Müller,  Vereenooghe,  Wonka,  Paap,  &  Gool,  2006 . In another perspective, they may empha- sise optimisation techniques, deal with real-time  issues  M. Carrozzino, Tecchia, & Bergamasco,  2009; Döllner & Buchholz, 2005; Willmott, et al.,  2001; Wonka, et al., 2006 , or even address photo- realism  Müller, Vereenooghe, Vergauwen, Gool,  & Waelkens, 2004  or high-fidelity  Sundstedt,  Chalmers, & Martinez, 2004  concerns.  From all of the above it is clear that the req- uisites are not the same for each of the different  applications  where  procedural  techniques  may  be employed. The next section addresses the use  of procedural techniques for two of their main  purposes: reconstruction and generation.  RECONSTRUCTION GENERATION?  At the beginning of this chapter some features of  procedural modelling techniques were uncovered  showing their undeniable advantages for the gen- eration of new worlds. Indeed, often procedural  modelling is the tool of choice when generation  is  in  order.  Additionally  it  may  also  prove  to   21   Procedural Virtual Worlds  Müller, et al., 2006 , generated Puuc-style build- ings similar to the ones that may be found in the  ancient Mayan site of Xkipché, in Mexico. Without  disregarding the efficiency of such techniques and  tools the fact is that generation produces fictional  structures, although in the present cases these are  based  upon  known  heritage  construction  rules  or tries to reproduce features found in existing  structures.  However, in structures showing more complex  geometric harmony, the process used, i.e. the set  of rules necessary to describe the physical geom- etry of the buildings may prove to be, in several  cases, harder to achieve  or take more time  than  when using traditional methods  manual model- ling  or even impossible. Indeed, an experienced  modeller may produce 3D models very efficiently  when given adequate data  e.g. measurements,  photographs,  etc.   about  a  physical  structure.  Unfortunately,  manual  modelling  does  not  al- low  the  efficient  reproduction  of  large  virtual  environments  showing  diversity   e.g.  creation  of  different  houses  corresponding  to  a  similar  architectural  style .  For  the  above  reasons  and  although the generation of models representing  ancient structures may prove to have some interest  or applications within archaeology and several  other areas, when trying to faithfully reproduce  an existing structure it does not always is a better  solution. Therefore sometimes it is not desirable  to use only algorithmically generated structures.  The next section describes a way of using proce- dural modelling and yet maintaining realism in  the models, by using a hybrid approach.  Realism  When addressing reconstruction or even consider- ing a procedural technique for reconstruction it is  important to think in which areas it may be applied.  So, one may think at most obvious areas such as  archaeology, architecture, etc. This raises some  questions concerning the ability to represent or  reconstruct structures using procedural methods   be useful to create virtual models representing  structures lost in time, or even to create virtual  models of existing structures. For these reasons  it is important to first establish the significance  of the terms reconstruction and generation within  the present context, presented below:          Reconstruction – creation of models using  automatic techniques representing existing  structures or creation of models represent- ing  structures  no  longer  existing  but  for  each there is enough evidences  i.e. ruins,  floor plans, photographs, etc.  to faithfully  reconstruct them. Generation – generation of new worlds, i.e.  automatic  creation  of  fictional  structures  not intended to represent any ever-existing  structure.  Throughout the rest of this section the use of  procedural techniques to perform the reconstruc- tion  and  generation  of  structures  is  discussed,  exemplified with heritage structures one of the  main targets for “procedural reconstruction”.  If  the  use  of  procedural  techniques  which  produce fictional structures it is somewhat simple  to realize in some areas  e.g. games , their use  on areas such as archaeology where the general  idea is to record historical fact it is not. Indeed,  although these techniques should be carefully be  thought out before they are employed in such area,  since depending of the case study and purpose of  the virtual models there may are more efficient  methods  manual modelling , when realism is the  main concern.  Some literature concerning procedural tech- niques has been used to create heritage models  representing ancient structures. For example, in   Müller, et al., 2005  the authors wrote a set of  rules to generate a virtual model of Pompei using  CityEngine, a system introduced by Parish and  Müller  Parish & Müller, 2001 . Later, using the  same system, the authors of “Procedural 3D Re- construction of Puuc Buildings in Xkipche”  P.   22   Procedural Virtual Worlds  since, for example, areas such as archaeology are  highly driven by proof and realism.  Most known methods and tools for the automat- ic generation of models representing man-made  structures usually rely on procedural techniques,  which often produce models through the means  of simple shape composition  or decomposition  –  depending  on  the  technique . As  previously  mentioned  these  techniques  sometimes  do  not  allow the use of more complex objects. In areas  such as archaeology, one main key point to recre- ate the past is the realism, which means that it is  crucial do create features with a higher level of  detail. Therefore, it is advisable to use manually  modelled objects rather than to try to use some  algorithm which would resemble the real structures  that are pretended to be represented.  Producing  these  realistic  models  may  be  achieved either by designing them from known  similar objects  e.g. artefacts, columns, windows,  etc.  or even by replicating existing ones. This  last  option,  however,  does  allow  using  faster  reproductions, since there is the possibility of us- ing automatic techniques such as laser scanning,  to create the objects. Independently of how the  models are created, the fact is that often there is  evidence which indicate that most probably, within  a certain architectural style, similar structures use  identical features.  This is what led Rodrigues et al. in  Rodrigues,  Magalhães, et al., 2008  to define a hybrid ap- proach, i.e. an approach which joins both manual   and procedural modelling, to meet the demanding  concerns  behind  the  reconstruction  of  heritage  structures, but also providing most of the features  brought by procedural techniques. Thus, the au- thors used an object database which may be used  to represent some more specific house features.  An example of this is the House of the Skeletons,  a Roman heritage house of Conimbriga, Portugal.  For the creation of the house several manual ob- jects  e.g. triclinium window, impluvium, tuscan  columns , modelled in an external application  3D  Studio Max  were used, represented in Figure 2,  and placed accordingly to grammar rules.  Integrating these objects into the final geom- etry is simply a matter of placing it in the desired  place  e.g. impluvium, columns  or by subtracting  the corresponding object geometry from the wall  where they are to be placed  e.g. windows .  The grammar rules used in the approach were  based on the knowledge left by Marcus Vitruvius  Pollio – Roman architect and engineer who lived  in the first century BC, author of “De architectura”. Moreover the same authors also provided a  means to describe the whole geometry of a house  through textual specifications  using a grammar   allowing both the generation of new houses but also  the reconstruction of existing ones. This feature is  particularly useful, because it allows a user with  no knowledge or experience with modelling tools,  to construct his her own models through a set of  textual specifications. These specifications were  used to perform the reconstruction of the House   Figure 2. External objects; From left to right: triclinium window, impluvium, tuscan columns  Silva,  Rodrigues, & Gonçalves, 2004   23   Procedural Virtual Worlds  of the Skeletons which was then compared to a  manual  model  showing  very  similar  features.  Figure 3 shows both of these models.  This  approach  may  be  considered  a  hybrid  one,  since  it  combines  procedural  techniques  together with manually modelled objects. This  allows a more realistic appearance of the final  models and uses the best of both approaches: the  efficiency of procedural techniques and the real- ism of manually modelling.  Automatic Reconstruction?  The previous section described how realism may  be achieved using procedural modelling but one  question still persists: how may procedural model- ling techniques tools be useful for areas such as  archaeology?  The first answer to this question is to efficiently  produce models of non-existing worlds for which  there is some kind of knowledge  e.g. floor plans,  photographs   to  support  the  reconstruction  of  realistic environments.  Projects such as “Rome Reborn”, “an interna- tional initiative whose goal is the creation of 3D  digital models illustrating the urban development  of ancient Rome from the first settlement in the late  Bronze Age  ca. 1000 B.C.  to the depopulation of  the city in the early Middle Ages  ca. A.D. 550 ”   Rome,  2010 ,  use  both  reconstruction,  which   currently is done manually, and generation. The  buildings present in the digital model are divided  into two kinds: “Class I” and “Class II” buildings.  “Class I” buildings are manually modelled based  on archaeological evidence  such as excavations,  studies and ancient literary sources . “Class II”  buildings are procedurally modelled from a digi- tization of the Plastico di Roma Antica, “a large  plaster-of-Paris model of imperial Rome  16x17  meters  created in the last century”  Guidi, et al.,  2005 . The process consists of replacing the scan  data from the digitization with geometrically sim- plified forms and the modelling of these simplified  form  faces  with  detailed  architectural  features   e.g. doors, windows, balconies . The process also  included the correction of known errors present in  the Plastico di Roma Antica. Another interesting  feature about “Rome Reborn” is that CityEngine,  an urban modelling software from Procedural Inc.  described in section “Tools and Techniques”, was  used in “Class II” buildings. Rome Reborn is also  published in the Internet as “Ancient Rome 3D”  in Google Earth  A. Rome, 2010 .  The second answer to the question presented  is to support the generation of distinct possibili- ties to allow experts to draw some conclusions or  conceive different hypotheses about lost worlds.  For example in several Roman heritage sites  e.g.  Conimbriga, Portugal  some parts of the city are  yet uncovered or may even be lost. By taking as   Figure 3. House of the Skeletons; Left: manual model, Right: grammar model  24   Procedural Virtual Worlds  an example similar Roman cities it is possible to  determine what may exist in most of the site. For  this reason, Rodrigues et al. in  Rodrigues, Mag- alhães, et al., 2008  have designed an grammar  approach which allows the specification of several  features of a house, including incomplete speci- fications which allows the generation of several  resembling models within an architectural style.  The presented approach is demonstrated with the  generation of several Conimbriga’s Roman houses  showing some dissimilarity amongst them.  The idea of generating structures similar to  existing ones is not something new and not even  confined to heritage. In fact, it is something that  is pursued by several authors and may be referred  as inverse procedural modelling. For example,   Aliaga,  et  al.,  2007   describes  an  interactive  system for the creation of new buildings in the  style of others or for the modification of existing  buildings. The idea is to create geometric models  from photographs, divide the building into their  basic external features  e.g. floors, windows, etc.   and create a grammar that captures the repetition  patterns of these features. Then it allows the user  to design building configurations from building  blocks and finally to divide these building con- figurations  into  the  several  features,  using  the  repetition patterns from the grammar. One of the  most interesting aspects of this approach is the  idea itself and its potential use in architecture.  Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of interac- tion needed from the user, starting from the initial  photograph mapping until the design of the final  building blocks  nevertheless the interaction in  this last step does make a lot of sense if the idea is  for the user to provide new geometries . Another  aspect to notice about this approach is that only  facades are created.  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES  Although  recently  procedural  modelling  is  be- coming mainstream in other applications, it has  already  been  applied  for  a  number  of  years  in  several applications such as games. The initial  motivation for this relied in the fact that earliest  computer games were limited by memory con- straints of existing hardware and software. For  example, “The Sentinel”, a video game featuring  3D graphics allowed the generation of 10,000 dif- ferent levels, which would be stored in about 64  KB of memory  another is “Elite”, a space video  game, which was initially planned to contain ap- proximately 282 trillion galaxies with 256 solar  systems each .  Nowadays the motivation is not exclusively  related to hardware software resources but also on  the human resources necessary to produce large  3D  environments.  For  this  reason  the  trend  to  use procedural techniques to produce 3D models  remains in modern games. Such is the example of  “.kkrieger” and “Will Wright’s Spore” which use  procedural synthesis to generate the graphics  the  first, “.kkrieger” has the particularity of packing  video effects in less than 97 KB . Many more  examples exist, such as the first-person shooter  video games “Left 4 Dead” and “Left 4 Dead 2”,  released in 2008 and 2009 respectively.  Another  example  in  a  different  area  is  the  competitive movie industry where every year new  movies rich in digital content, produced through  procedural techniques, appear.  In the field of applications there is also some  tools specific for the generation of different fea- tures, for example, to generate terrains there are  tools available such as Terragen or Acropora; for  trees, Speedtree; for urban structures, CityEngine   further  described  shortly   and  Cityscape;  for  textures, Art of Illusion; to perform animations,  Houdini, etc. Beside these applications there are  also procedural plug-ins for existing applications,  for example, Filter Forge is a plug-in for Adobe   25   Procedural Virtual Worlds  city networks may be imported into this software,  from several other programs such as OpenStreet- Map  OpenStreetMap, 2010 . The software also  includes a scripting language to develop architec- tural 3D content and an interface to parameterize  specific building features  e.g. height, age . City- Engine also allows batch exports of 3D models  for several file formats such as: Wavefront OBJ,  Autodesk FBX, Autodesk 3DS, COLLADA DAE,  MentalRay MI and Renderman RIB.  Some virtual worlds provide tools to develop  3D content  with scripts for behaviours if desired   but others rely on 3rd party tools for this task, as  Blender or 3D Studio Max, giving the user “import  content” tools. As this may be desirable, giving the  users the liberty to use their favourite modelling  tool, the lack of a common 3D modelling format,  for the several virtual worlds, could also be a chal- lenge as some problems of conversion between  formats still exist. Presently, virtual world users  may implement their own procedural techniques  and tools for content generation, within the con- straints of each platform  e.g., scripting languages,  automated client software, etc. . Some 3rd party  tools are available, with varying degrees of power  and applicability, such as the ones described in  this section, albeit its use is not widespread.  The dilemma behind using 3rd party tools is  that  these  are  not  integrated  in  virtual  worlds  meaning the models have to be exported from  3rd party tools and imported to the virtual world.  Beside conversion problems that may arise there is  another aspect to take into consideration, which is  the fact that 3rd party tools often produce dummy  models, i.e. generic models which may not suit  the virtual world. Indeed, although some virtual  worlds allow the import of several formats, most  of the time not all of the features of the format  are supported due to constraints related with the  virtual world. Furthermore, the models may be  suitable for some applications but sometimes they  are not appropriate for virtual worlds, which have  to  maintain  some  minimum  performance. Ad- ditionally, the lack of a common format amongst   Photoshop  for  designing  procedural  textures.  These represent only a fraction of the available  tools and most of these tools are not exclusively  to one type of content. For example, some tools  for  the  generation  of  urban  environments  may  also allow the generation of terrains and trees.  Furthermore,  although  some  of  these  tools  are  available for free others are very expensive. So,  it is really up to the user to choose the software  which best fits their purpose.   M. Carrozzino, et al., 2009 , presented the City  Modelling Procedural Engine  CMPE , a system  for  the  automatic semi-automatic  reconstruc- tion of virtual models of cities integrated in the  XVR framework  Marcello Carrozzino, Tecchia,  Bacinelli, Cappelletti, & Bergamasco, 2005 , a  framework for the development of Virtual Real- ity  VR  applications developed by some of the  same authors. Indeed, mostly built with XVR, it  uses 3D urban models and may include vehicle  simulators, crowd behaviour simulators, according  to the Pecchioli, Carrozzino et al.  Pecchioli, Car- rozzino, & Mohamed, 2008 , which also present a  methodology to deal with the access to information  related to Cultural Heritage.  In  CGV, 2010  several ongoing projects are  also  presented  featuring  High-Quality  Urban  Reconstructions by Fitting Shape Grammars to  Images and derived Textured Point Clouds and  also the generation of 3D city models, using ex- isting data such as aerial photos and laser scans.  Indeed such examples, e.g.  Hohmann, et al., 2009   proof that even procedural modelling approaches  may also incorporate data and techniques used in  photogrammetry and laser scanning.  One of the most remarkable tools, in the field  of  the  procedural  urban  environments,  is  City  Engine,  a  commercial  software  produced  by  Procedural Inc.  Procedural, 2009 . City Engine  is a 3D modelling software especially conceived  for the generation of urban environments, using  procedural techniques, which allows the genera- tion of street networks which take into account  the topography of the terrain. Furthermore, real   26   Procedural Virtual Worlds  virtual worlds sometimes constrains the use of  certain application to produce the models.  The  above  reasons  led  Rodrigues  et  al.,  in   Rodrigues, et al., 2009  to present a framework  prototype – ArchHouseGenerator – for the de- velopment  of  virtual  models  which  integrates  an “dedicated exporter”, i.e. an exporter which  takes into consideration the type of format being  produced and the type of virtual world. Although  this tool is not yet available to virtual world users  some initial tests allow to produce models which  were imported into a virtual world. The models  were  tested  in  a  virtual  world  developed  with  virtual  World  SDK,  OpenCroquet,  a  tool  that  “can be used by experienced software developers  to create and deploy deeply collaborative multi- user  online  virtual  world  applications  on  and  across multiple operating systems and devices”   OpenCroquet, 2009 .  Figure 4 shows an OpenCroquet virtual world  where  a  house  produced  with ArchHouseGen- erator  was  imported  and  where  its  multi-user  capabilities were also tested.  As it can be seen the world was rendered in  two different machines synchronously – allowing  the  simultaneous  presence  of  two  users   here  represented by rabbits – each one is seeing the  other .  CONCLUSION AND  FUTURE TRENDS  This chapter has presented the advantages, as well  as disadvantages of using procedural modelling  tools in the several types of virtual worlds. In ad- dition, where, when and which tools are available  to generate virtual models have been described.  It is clear that, the purpose of procedural model- ling in virtual worlds, is not to prevent virtual  world  users  from  designing  their  own  worlds,  but instead to provide an efficient tools to do so.  Indeed, procedural modelling has been extensively  used in several other areas and there is no reason  to believe it will not be used the same way in  virtual worlds.  The different types of existing virtual worlds  determine  where  and  when  should  procedural  techniques be employed. When dealing with urban  structures, the starting point for defining the way  to create the physical models is to determine if  the purpose of the models are the representation  of existing structures or the generation of new  ones. Procedural modelling is a very powerful  tool but that does not mean that it is always the  better solution. As described in this chapter many  aspects determine the possible use of such tech- niques  e.g. type of virtual world, reconstruction   Figure 4.

In this busy and competitive world the rush  to generate digital 3D content may determine the  overall adoption of procedural tools. This may  also  be  a  great  opportunity  to  propel  a  virtual  world to a new status as providing features not  yet supported by all the others.  It is likely 3rd party generation tools would be  integrated with virtual worlds’ engines or, at the  very least, would perform exports that are mode  “virtual world friendly”.  In addition, it is even more likely that future  virtual  worlds  would  have  integrated  their  3D  modelling tools, as they currently have  e.g. Sec- ond Life , but also featuring procedural features,  either natively supported or provided via plug-ins.

Informed by a 14-month ethnography, this chapter explains why and how from an architec- tural perspective. User motivation is explained with recourse to the concept of dwelling, and special  attention is given to use of the architectural devices boundary and image. The user strategy employing  such devices is summed up as a pop vernacular building strategy characterised by eclecticism but not  by irony. Special attention is given to the way in which the avatar allows a sense of place to be bodily  grounded in agency. Through its architectural focus on concepts such as place and dwelling, the chapter  demonstrates the relevance of “old”, i.e., pre-digital, experiences in virtual worlds.  INTRODUCTION  This chapter explores the phenomenon of virtual  dwelling  in  “Second  Life”   and,  by  extension,  other virtual worlds . Both methodologically and  theoretically it is informed by the idea that it is   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch003  meaningful and productive to approach virtual  dwellings as places. Methodologically, the notion  of place points towards an ethnographic approach.  Theoretically,  it  points  towards  architectural  theory and related fields, especially the philoso- phy of space and place. These methodological   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

Perhaps on the following day, the user  thinks of it more as a place to be visited.  The tool approach is, e.g., employed by psy- chologist Nick Yee  2007  who have documented  how the main tool for engagement with a virtual  world, the avatar, influences not only how one is  perceived by other users but also self-perception. The notion of place is constantly present in  Howard Rheingold’s early book  1993  on “The  WELL”  a text-based world preceding the World  Wide Web with almost a decade . Place also makes  itself present in Lisbeth Klastrup’s work  2003   on “EverQuest”  SOE, 1999  in which she brings  examples of how changes to virtual places radi- cally alter social practices. A more recent article  by  Eric  Hayot  and  Edward  Wesp   2009   goes  into detail with the social construction of place  in “EverQuest”.  The notion of the virtual world as a way of being  underlies work focusing on the blurred boundary  between online and offline. Examples are Mário  J. L. Guimarães, Jr.’s ethnographic study of “The  Palace”  2005 , a 2D precursor to contemporary  virtual worlds  Time Warner Interactive, 1995 ,  and T. L. Taylor’s ethnography  2006  of “Ever- Quest”, tellingly titled “Play Between Worlds”. In  a sense, work focusing on blurred boundaries are  a variant of the place approach, since there would  not be a boundary, blurred or not, if the virtual  world was not a place in its own right.  Based  in  the  notion  of  place,  ethnographic  approaches  have  been  used  for  text-based  and  two-dimensional virtual worlds. But the virtual  world  is,  arguably,  a  place  in  a  stronger  sense  when it is three-dimensional and engaged with  through an avatar.  Avatars in Virtual Architecture  When users engage with virtual world places, they  do so through and with an avatar. To understand  the premise of virtual world ethnography, then, it   and theoretical issues are addressed immediately  below. I then turn towards my ethnography of a  collective building project in “Second Life”. The  motivation for that collective building project will  be explored through the concept of dwelling. User  practices aimed at dwelling will be explained from  an architectural perspective through the devices of  boundary and image, and summed up as a build- ing strategy of the pop vernacular. Throughout  the chapter, special attention is paid to the ways  in which the avatar functions as a device for giv- ing the user a bodily grounded sense of agency  and place.  PLACE, ETHNOGRAPHY,  ARCHITECTURE  People in Virtual Places  In Tom Boellstorff’s words  2008 , virtual world  ethnography  presupposes  that  “virtual  worlds  are places”, and thus “fieldsites [...] making an  ethnographic approach conceivable”  p. 91 . At  heart, and bracketing its many variations and the  discussions surrounding it, ethnography is about  entering a place and staying in that place long  enough to get a sense of its culture from the inside.  The ethnographic approach is, however, not the  only approach to studying virtual worlds, and this  section gives a brief overview of how ethnography  is situated in recent virtual worlds research.  Annette N. Markham  1998  offers three cat- egories for the ways in which users can conceptu- alise an online community: as tool, as place, and as  way of being. Based on Markham’s work on  and  in  text-based, online communities, the categories  are meant to be a rough starting point for think- ing about the myriad ways users approach such  communities. The categories are also useful when  surveying recent work on avatar-based, 3D virtual  worlds such as “Second Life”. Markham stresses  that the three concepts are not used exclusively  and that they form a continuum. On a day when   34   Collective Building Projects in Second Life  is necessary to clarify the function of the avatar.  Having an avatar opens up issues of identity and  self-representation but what is important here is  the  avatar’s  fundamental  function  of  affording  users a sense of being in virtual place. That theme  will be introduced here and then fleshed out later. 3D graphics and avatar allow correspondence  between the movements of the user’s actual body  and movements in the space of the virtual world.  This effect is known as motor-isomorphism  motor  has to do with movement, iso- with things being  the same . Even though a press of the W-key to  move the avatar forward in “Second Life” is a  very modest example of bodily movement, the  user  immediately  perceives  similarity  between  actual  body  movement  and  avatar  movement.  This similarity is suggestive of a space which is  not the actual body’s space. How could the body’s  movements  be  similar  to  other  movements,  if  there was no space for these other movements to  occur in? In 3D virtual worlds such as “Second  Life”, that most basic sense of space triggered  by  motor-isomorphism  is  enhanced  by  various  depth cues such as perspective  in perspective,  two  parallel  railway  tracks  famously  converge  in a single point , and motion parallax  e.g., a  close  tree  seemingly  moving  faster  than  a  far- away tree, when observed from a moving train ,  as described in perceptual psychology  see, e.g.,  Bruce & Green, 1990 .  Crucial  for  the  experience  of  avatar-based  virtual worlds, movement through space is crucial  for architectural experience as well. Architecture  might be designed with a specific movement in  mind,  e.g.,  an  imposing  system  of  arches  and  staircases  designed  to  impress  the  visitor  on  arrival,  but  architecture  thrives  on  the  relative  freedom to take it in, literally on one’s own pace.  There are obvious differences between online and  offline architectural experiences, but bracketing  these differences allows us to tap into theoretical  resources within architectural theory and related  fields. When architectural theory is applied in order  to improve game design, there is a tendency to   arrive at formalist understandings of architecture   e.g., the use of Christopher Alexander et al.’s  tellingly titled “A Pattern Language” [1977] by  Ljungström [2005] and Nitsche [2008] . As for  this chapter, the issue is not game design but col- lective building projects aimed at dwelling. That  issue calls for other parts of architectural theory  to form the theoretical starting point, as I will  discuss in the following.  Space and Place  When “Second Life” users, such as the ones of my  ethnography, build virtual houses to feel at home,  they are surely not engaged in an activity aimed at  providing real-life housing. But they are, at least  in  some  sense  of  that  ambiguous  word,  doing  architecture. Engaging in any discussion about  “architecture” is to claim that the built environ- ment is too important to be merely engineered in  the most cost-effective way. Architects themselves  often understand their craft in opposition to that  of the engineers they work with on projects. The  engineer might be able to construct buildings that  fulfil required functions, but as the arguably most  influential architect and architectural theorist of  the  20th  century,  Le  Corbusier,  puts  it   2008 ,  the architect “[goes] beyond [...] the more or less  utilitarian program”  p. 93 . It is something of a  mystery  what  exactly  this  “going  beyond”  the  utilitarian means, and architectural theory often  reflects  on  that  mystery.  One  answer  found  in  Le Corbusier  2000  is that although modernity  is an “age of every conceivable ferocity: tumult,  disorder, revolutionary inventions”  p. 304 , the  goal of modern architecture is to build “[homes]”  that can “take [us] in” and “welcome [us]”, despite  the challenge posed by modernity  2008, p. 296 . This strand of Le Corbusier’s thinking, that  architecture should fulfil a basic, human need for  a sense of home, has been emphasised by self- appointed heirs to the modernist legacy, such as  Christian Norberg-Schulz  2000a . To highlight  the theme of home, however, Norberg-Schulz and   35   Collective Building Projects in Second Life  The peak of this complex transition is often said  to be Newtonian absolute space or Cartesian res  extensa. With Heidegger, the pendulum swings  back towards place. After Heidegger came a num- ber of “rediscoverers of place”  such as Foucault,  Deleuze and Guatteri, and Tuan  who in Casey’s  account all had to react to Heidegger’s work in  some way, positively or negatively  p. 286 .  Amongst all these eminent thinkers it is argu- ably Maurice Merleau-Ponty who is most relevant  for understanding avatar-based engagement with  virtual  worlds   cf.  the  use  of  Merleau-Ponty  in  game  studies,  e.g.,  Klevjer,  2006;  Nielsen,  2010 . With Merleau-Ponty, the concept of place  becomes  contingent  on  a  body,  or  rather,  on  a  sense of bodily grounded agency. As Casey points  out,  Merleau-Ponty  also  gives  place  “a  virtual  dimension  overlooked  in  previous  accounts. A  place I inhabit by my body [...] I come to a place  as providing an indefinite horizon of my possible  actions”  p. 230, emphases in the original .  For a user of “Second Life”, this “virtual dimen- sion” of “possible actions” means that even when  a building is explored in camera view  i.e., with  an avatar-disembodied, flying camera , the avatar  still plays a role. Its presence is felt as a virtual  avatar, meaning that the user’s sense of propor- tion is informed by the out of sight avatar. The  building is tall or low, big or small, as measured  against the avatar. A slope is walk-constraining  or walk-affording, depending on how the avatar  is imagined to move up it.  An important nuance is, however, introduced  with the concept of inhabitation  in the Casey  quote above: “A place I inhabit” . Inhabitation  highlights that relating to place through a sense  of bodily founded agency goes beyond being able  to perform a set of well-defined actions. Casey’s  summary of Merleau-Ponty’s position can thus  be read as a description of the avatar’s role in  virtual  world  experience   note  the  mention  of  “my virtual body” :  others had to clean up the theoretical toolbox of  architecture, as it were. Modernist art forms had  been defined by pointing out experiences and attri- butes unique to them, and modern architecture had  defined itself as an art of “space”  Forty, 2000, p.  265 , but there is something not quite homely about  the concept of space. In fact, space has been used  as one side of a conceptual dichotomy throughout  all of the history of philosophy, “where ‘space’  connotes something undelimited and open-ended”   Casey, 1997, p. 77 , and place its opposite. So to  make the legitimate claim that Le Corbusier and  his work focused on providing inhabitants with  a sense of home, and by extension that “modern  architecture [,] came into existence to help man  feel at home in a new world”  Norberg-Schulz,  2000b, p. 6 , Norberg-Schulz and others  includ- ing Juhani Pallasmaa and Aldo van Eyck [Forty,  2000, p. 271]  needed to switch from “space” to  “place”  as  the  core  concept  for  understanding  architecture.  They  did  so  from  the  late  1960s,  calling on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger.  I  return  to  Heidegger’s  influential  thoughts  on  architecture later.  Avatars in Places  Before turning to my own ethnography, this sec- tion offers further background information on the  theoretical connections between sense of place and  the phenomenology of having an avatar. Readers  with no or little interest in the philosophy of place  might want to skip ahead.  The  space place  dichotomy  just  alluded  to  underlie a rich tradition in philosophy with high  relevance for understanding virtual world expe- riences  see the list of further reading . Edward  S. Casey  1997  has laid out the philosophical  history of space and place as a multi-millennial  conceptual oscillation between the two. Broadly  speaking,  Aristotle  and  Plato  understood  the  connection between human and world in terms  of place. Gradually, thinking about the world in  terms of places gave way to a focus on space.   36   Collective Building Projects in Second Life  In  noninstrumental  settings  as  well,  the  body  remains a constitutive force. A snowbound glade  could not constitute a full-fledge place unless I  could at least tacitly, by imputation, feel myself  to be there bodily [...] Similarly, the lonely light- house is a place insofar as I can, by proxy, as it  were, imagine someone’s body  not necessarily my  own  inhabiting it. In order to effect such imputa- tions, I need to call on my virtual body, which is  capable of inhabiting even the most remote and  seemingly vacuous place. So long as something  is a “possible habitat” for a possible body, it can  count as a place.  Casey, 1997, p. 235, emphases  in the original   In a kind of projection, Merleau-Ponty calls  upon his “virtual body” to “inhabit” the snowbound  glade and the lonely lighthouse. In an essay on  “The Place of Man”, architect and architectural  theorist  Juhani  Pallasmaa   2005b   expresses  a  sentiment close to Merleau-Ponty’s: “In an en- vironmental experience, there is an unconscious  bodily identification with the object, a projection  of the body pattern onto what is experienced, or  a  physical  mimesis,  an  unconscious  mimicry”   p. 75 . Such projections are important not only  in the experience of place in general but more  specifically in the architectural profession, when  architects work with models, drawings, and other  representations of unrealised projects. With the  avatar, projections gain a graphical focus and a  more immediate bodily foundation. The avatar  stands  in  for  the  otherwise  purely  imagined  virtual body. The avatar is a device that aids in  the inhabitation of virtual place by proxy. As it  happens,  proxy  is  a  contraction  of  late  Middle  English procuracy which in turn stems from Latin  procurare “take care of, manage”, from pro- “on  behalf of” and curare, “see to”  the OED . Proxy  thus neatly sums up how the avatar acts on the  user’s behalf  pro- , yet is taken care of by the  user  curare .  VIRTUAL DWELLING IN  “SECOND LIFE”  Starting Point  Most would-be ethnographers of virtual worlds  probably have experience with their virtual field- site before even considering doing ethnography.  There have probably been unstructured excursions  into the fieldsite giving rise to loosely formed re- search questions. Holding on to and reflecting on  one’s personal starting point for an ethnography  might seem slightly narcissist but is also a way  of grounding the ethnography.  My own, initial reaction to “Second Life”  in  2004  was one of recognition. This felt like my  days  and nights  in “The Palace” almost ten years  earlier  in 1996 , back in the day when the line  “we just got on the Internet!” commanded respect  and envy. The sense of potential, if not promise,  the odd encounters, the overwhelming generos- ity of strangers, the amazement at how human  feelings were, so it felt, able to travel through a  digital communications medium: It was all there,  complete with the technological glitches which  only served to underline the fact that we were  all on a great, futuristic adventure. Informed by  the philosophy of space and place I was reading  at the time, initial reactions soon gave way to a  sneaking suspicion that “Second Life” was not  about limitless  cyber-  space but about places.  Boundaries made themselves felt. I would glimpse  an interesting, faraway building and fly towards  it, only to hit a semi-invisible “glass wall” with  a loud smack, left to peek into the forbidden land  from a distance. If they did not secure their houses  in this way, some users gained a degree of access  control by building or renting houses floating high  above ground level. What was going on?  To get a closer, micro-level look, I decided to  do an ethnography centred on a group of “Second  Life” builders. A builder is a commonly used term  for a user with a certain expertise in wielding the  design tools of “Second Life”. Because of that   37   Collective Building Projects in Second Life  I met the leader of the group of builders, whom  I will call Vlad, in early June, 2007. At that time I  was quite literally trying to get through the glass  walls of private places to get a better sense of what  was going on inside them. Incidentally, my curious  attitude has never offended anybody or raised any  questions as to my identity. As it happens, there  is a socially acceptable subject position standing  ready for people indulging in flânerie. Sometimes  users explicitly label such persons “explorers”. I  have had the explorer label attached to me on a  number of occasions, for example when taking  screenshots of private homes. To me, this makes  it possible and acceptable for the researcher to  stay in explorer character, so to speak, until initial  contact and trust have been established with in- formants. None of the builders I approached took  any offence when I came clean as a researcher,  possibly  several  months  after  first  contact.  On  the contrary, it might have seemed out of place  to break the special “Second Life” atmosphere  of playful fictiveness by prematurely providing  “first life” information.  I chatted with Vlad in a “Second Life” gal- lery, and he told me he was “searchin [sic] for  a  home”  for  his  “family”   June,  2007 .  The  term “family” was recently agreed upon by him  and  a  handful  of  other  builders  tied  together  by sexual orientation and an urge to establish a  virtual  “home”.  During  the  following  months,  several members of the group made frequent use  of the terms “home” and “family” as their build- ing project took shape as an intricate castle. The  enterprise took continuous investments of time,  money, and creativity. All of these investments  were undertaken collectively. Costs were shared  and the time-consuming creative work done by  all family members  according to talent . In the  early  phase  of  the  project,  one  of  the  builders  earned the humorous honorific lagooneer as he  was the one in charge of shaping a coastal area;  an indication of how important building was to  his “Second Life”. In October, 2007, a neighbour  was allowed to add a small structure in the same   expertise, the builder gains recognition amongst  peers and is probably able to make money on his  or her skills. The self-assigned “builder” label was  used explicitly, and not without pride, by most of  the users I followed.  Modelled on Christine Hine’s examples in her  book “Virtual Ethnography”  2000 , and combin- ing my initial curiosity about the use of boundaries  with the conceptual dichotomy of place and space,  I arrived on the following, very open questions to  guide my attention:  Do “Second Life” users conceptualise their virtual  world primarily in terms of space or place? Do  they embrace a condition of placelessness? Or  do they, on the contrary, develop attachments to  virtual places? When it comes to “Second Life”,  is boundary no longer an organising principle?  And how does one go about gathering material  illuminating such questions?  Boundary  This section contains the main account of a col- lective building project I followed for 14 months   June 2007 to August 2008 . During that time I  regularly visited the group of builders, took scores  of screenshots and logged all text chat. As soon  as possible after the visits, I mixed screenshots  and bits of text chat with my own reflections in  field notes. Below follows a brief, chronological  account of my time spent in the various places  the group built. As that account draws to an end,  Heidegger’s  philosophy  of  dwelling  is  reintro- duced.  This  shift  towards  reflection  illustrates  anthropologist  Tim  Ingold’s  point   1994   that  in  ethnography,  “a  clear  distinction  between  observation and interpretation, between the col- lection of data in the field and their placement  within a theoretical framework, can not readily  be sustained”  p. xvi . Ingold goes as far as to  call ethnography “philosophy with people in it”   p. vii , a sentiment I share.  38   Collective Building Projects in Second Life  style as the main building, or as Vlad put it: “He  linked it there because we both find it fitting”, as  if the places themselves had an inherent fit which  both of the users happened to sense.  In late October, 2007, a rather well attended  house warming party was held. According to the  invitation’s wording, oddly enough, the party’s  occasion was the “long time and hard but suc- cessfull [sic] work to build [the] Castle”, rather  than the castle itself. Conscious or not at the time,  the wording proved appropriate in the following  months as the family kept building and changing  the castle. In April, 2008, the entire structure had  to be taken down due to financial reasons out of  the family’s control, but the building continued  at an even grander scale on newly bought and  much larger grounds. A new ambition had crept  in: to build something “fitting with the landscape”   Vlad’s words , a landscape which was much more  elaborate than the landscape surrounding the old  place.  The  new  landscape  included  mountains  and forests. Having mastered the art of individual  buildings, the builders now focused on the con- nection between house and landscape, something  only tried out on a modest scale before.  In  July  2008,  Vlad  told  me  something  that  I believe to be an apt summary of his building  experience during the preceding 13 months: “a  castle is never finished but it looks complete”.  The building might be “done” as thing, something  standing in the landscape providing material for  a  nice  screenshot.  The  building  understood  as  activity is never over. Vlad thereby unknowingly  hinted at the core of Martin Heidegger’s philoso- phy of building.  Now, shifting towards reflection, Heidegger’s  thinking on architectural matters were done at a  time when Germany was in the middle of rebuild- ing herself after being reduced to rubbles in the  Second World War. Millions were rehoused in a  fast and efficient way, using then modern build- ing  technologies.  This  provoked  Heidegger  to  consider the difference between being housed and  to truly dwell. It ultimately made him question   the basic assumption that building is an activity  aimed at providing dwelling, i.e., an activity cre- ating something entirely new. Building should,  according  to  Heidegger   1971 ,  be  understood  as a “construction” that is also a “cultivation”;  cultivation of something that grows on its own,  but needs someone to “to cherish and protect [it],  to preserve and care for [it]”  p. 145 . Cultivation- building is, however, only half of dwelling and  must be complemented by construction-building:  Building in the sense of preserving and nurturing  is not making anything. Shipbuilding and temple- building, on the other hand, do in a certain way  make their own works. Here building, in contrast  with cultivating, is a constructing. Both modes of  building - building as cultivating, Latin colere,  cultura, and building as the raising up of edifices,  aedificare - are comprised within genuine build- ing, that is, dwelling.  Heidegger, 1971, p. 145,  emphases in the original   Not only did the builders I followed explicitly  build to dwell, to be “at home”, but in Hedeggerian  eyes they seemed to on the right, although end- less, track to get there; “A castle is never finished  but  it  looks  complete”.  Protecting  boundaries  were crucial in securing building’s “cultivation”  aspect. On the few occasions on which I have  entered private homes without permission  and  been found out , I have been scolded with “doors  are closed for a reason” or similar statements. I  really did feel bad on these occasions, exactly like  I would, had I been caught trespassing in the real  world. Fortunately, it feels correspondingly good  and immediately generates a sense of together- ness to be invited into someone’s private place.  Ceremonies of reception and rejection, inclusion  and exclusion, constantly happen on the boundar- ies of “Second Life” places, and are important in  generating dwelling.  39   Collective Building Projects in Second Life  in the analysis. Pallasmaa acknowledges how the  television has taken over the fireplace’s role as  focus for domestic sociality - and it can be added  that  the  screens  of  gaming  consoles  and  PCs  function as such foci as well - but a screen and  a fireplace allow for different kinds of domestic  sociality. Pallasmaa generalises this to a distinc- tion between “images [such as the fire-place, BL]  that are deeply rooted in our common memory,  that  is,  in  the  phenomenologically  authentic  ground of architecture” and “images [such as the  “flat” screen images, BL] [that are] striking and  fashionable perhaps [but do not] incorporate the  personal identity, memories, and dreams of the  inhabitants”  p. 124 .  My starting point was that “Second Life” actu- ally abounds with Pallasmaa’s images of home. It  is exceedingly and perhaps surprisingly easy to  find groves, huts, fireplaces, and canopied beds in  “Second Life”. All of these small insides are flat,  of course, as far as the screen goes, but less flat  when the embodied and avatarial nature of user  interaction is taken into account. A canopied bed,  for example, is not just experienced on a screen  but  through  and  with  an  avatar,  thus  retaining  some of its quality as “a miniature house within  the house with physical and symbolic privacy”.  In a virtual world, a bed is inhabited by proxy  when the avatar is there on the user’s behalf, as  the user’s substitute and not merely as his or her  representative. It is not entirely accurate, then, to  make general statements such as “[i]n the virtual  world the existence of a ‘building’ is purely sym- bolic”  Harry, Offenhuber, & Donath, 2008, p.  65 . The purity of the symbolic is contaminated,  as it were, by the user’s sense of agency. This  situation does allow for some sense of dwelling  centred on architectural images, even though it  is an interactive simulation of dwelling, not the  authentic, offline thing.  Image  Taking the discussion of virtual world dwelling a  step further, the home of Vlad’s family featured  several archaic symbols of domesticity, such as  huts,  fireplaces,  and  canopied  beds.  The  same  symbols  showed  up  in  other  private  places  I  visited. The “Second Life” practice of employ- ing such symbols resonates with discussions of  contemporary  possibilities  of  dwelling  within  1990s  architectural  discourse,  and  emphasises  the crucial function of the avatar.  Juhani Pallasmaa  2005a  was among those  concerned with dwelling in the 1990s. The archi- tectural images necessary for establishing a sense  of home, argues Pallasmaa, have been diluted.  Inspired by phenomenological philosopher Gas- ton Bachelard’s “The Poetics of Space”  1994 ,  Pallasmaa understands an architectural image to  resonate on a deeply personal and bodily level.  Such an “image” is not perceived on exclusively  visual terms. One of Pallasmaa’s examples is the  image of the bed. Surely beds are functional, i.e.,  they solve the problem of finding a comfortable  place to sleep, but a bed used to be  and ought  to  be,  it  seems   “a  miniature  house  within  the  house with physical and symbolic privacy”. The  contemporary bed, on the other hand, is often “a  mere neutral horizontal plane, a stage of privacy”   p. 122 .1  Pallasmaa  takes  the  “flattened”  bed  to  be  part of the poor dwelling conditions of modern  homes. The hearth, or stove, is also used as an  example  of  a  flattened  home-image.  Flattened  from fireplace into a mere “[mantle] without the  possibility of actual fire [...] The fireplace has  turned from a device addressing the skin into a  medium of visual pleasure”  p. 122 . In order to  provide true dwelling, homes have to combine  images  authentic images, not the flat ones  with  a basic, spatial sense of insideness.2  This  is  where  the  mass  media  come  into  Pallasmaa’s criticism of the modern home. The  television screen is assigned symptomatic status   40   Collective Building Projects in Second Life  The Pop Vernacular  The  collective  efforts  of  Vlad  and  his  family  were  playful  but  there  was  also  a  sincerity  to  their projects that deserves a few words before  the conclusion, as it sums up some of the themes  covered so far. The family members showed a high  level of commitment to common tasks and goals,  and the mention of “home” never seemed ironic. Paul Oliver  2003  has studied dwellings in all  corners of the real world and notes a “widespread  desire to create and build one’s own dwelling”  p.  260 . When this desire is realised, the self-made,  architect-free, and often community-built dwell- ing is labelled a vernacular dwelling. Oliver is in  accord with Heidegger’s cultivation construction  dichotomy when he describes dwelling as “both  process and artifact: it is the experience of living  at a specific location and it is the physical expres- sion of doing so”  p. 15 .3 Vernacular dwelling  is in a sense what happens if Heidegger is read  literately and dwelling and building understood  synonymously. The most obvious and efficient  way to obtain a feeling of being at home, then,  would be for the dweller to dethrone the architect  and build his or her own home, or at least have a  substantial say in its building.  “Second  Life”  dwelling  is  often  vernacular  dwelling  existing alongside a big market for pre- fabs . When virtual dwelling is vernacular it could  be labelled a “pop vernacular”, a term I believe  coined by Sam Jacob  2004 . The term is intended  to credit Pop Art for pioneering the utilisation of  bits and pieces of popular culture and established  art alike as a resource for creative work.4 Vlad and  family employed a similar strategy in their castle  projects, mixing and matching elements belonging  to diverse and sometimes contrasting styles and  historical epochs. Pallasmaa’s cosmic images of  home  e.g., the fire-place  were thrown into the  mix. This was not done at random by the users  but with the explicit goal of attaining a sense of  dwelling. Users do seem to have a sense of the  power of architectural images of home. They in-  clude deeply resonating images of home in their  kitsch  building,  and  they  do  so  sincerely,  i.e.,  without the irony characteristic of other modes  of eclecticism, e.g., postmodernism.  FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  As  for  the  possibilities  of  obtaining  as  sense  of dwelling by influencing the design of one’s  private  home,  preferably  in  co-operation  with  co-dwellers, virtual worlds are currently explored  as  a  means  of  furthering  that  very  possibility.  Parts of the research project I have contributed  to until recently, “Sense-making Strategies and  Innovation  in  Virtual  worlds”   funded  by  the  Danish Strategic Research Council , is empiri- cally based in architects’ experiments with using  virtual  worlds  to  allow  inhabitants   current  or  coming   into  the  architectural  design  process.  At the time of writing, however, the innovative  architects I have interviewed for the project are  not  so  much  fascinated  by  the  virtual  world’s  potential for letting clients wield design tools, as  they are fascinated by two other aspects of virtual  worlds. Firstly, the avatar, which can give the cli- ent a better sense of a proposed project through a  bodily grounded sense of free movement through  a  3D  model.  Secondly,  the  virtual  world  as  a  framework for social interaction letting those in- terested in investing in a building project, as well  as those interested in architecture and design in a  less committed way, exchange ideas and experi- ences. But the potential for letting the user into  the design process is there, and that potential can  be understood and nurtured by research based in  a mix of ethnography of existing user practices,  philosophy of space and place, architectural theory,  and scholarship focusing on the crucial device of  the avatar  scholarship which is mainly undertaken  within computer game studies .  41   Collective Building Projects in Second Life  amount of stringency, the subject of place adds to  our understanding of virtual worlds and the ways  we engage with them.

CONCLUSION  Some  “Second  Life”  users  invest  considerable  amounts of money, time, and creativity in build- ings; “buildings” in the double sense of things  and activities. They do so with the explicit goal  of feeling at home. Because of their never-ending  character, such projects resonate with Heidegger’s  thoughts on true dwelling being the result of both  construction and cultivation. In virtual worlds,  cultivation, or caring, is done through, with, and  towards avatars. There is, in other words, a non- instrumental  aspect  to  having  an  avatar  which  provides a sense of place. The avatar’s original  function is to be a graphical focus for navigation  through space, but it also provides a sense of being  in place, e.g., when small insides are encountered   canopied  beds,  small  huts,  the  intimate  circle  around a fire-place, etc. .  The  concepts  of  boundary,  image,  and  the  vernacular   as  used  in  architectural  discourse   illuminate virtual world user practices aimed at  dwelling. Users rely very much on boundaries  for  generating  a  sense  of  dwelling;  i.e.,  what  Heidegger  would  call  dwelling’s  cultivation  aspect. They also rely on architectural devices  constituted simultaneously by space and image,  such as the fire-place and the sleeping-place. Their  use of such devices is part of a pop vernacular  building  strategy,  characterised  by  eclecticism  but not by irony.  When young expert users of “Second Life”  seek out new ways to obtain a sense of dwelling,  it  reminds  us  that  virtual  worlds  call  not  only  for fascination with what is new about them, but  also for fascination with the old in the sense of  the pre-digital. Virtual worlds offer renderings of  very basic, human experiences in ways that are  intriguingly new but based in something intrigu- ingly old, namely, our relationship with places.  Sense of place is a subject inviting lyricism and  speculation.

The ambition of striking a balance between  image  and  space  is  articulated  in  various  ways  within  architectural  theory,  both  as  a  statement  about  architecture  in  general   e.g., Frampton, 1975; Krauss, 1972  and  as a statement about dwelling in particular   Rice, 2007 .

Avatar Performance Art by Jeremy Owen Turner and Second Front have  explored a variety of Second Life telepathies, and have quickly earnt the title of Virtual Fluxus. Second  Front’s links to Western Front, Fluxus, Robert Filliou and the Eternal Network assist the continued  internationalised new media and performance collaboration work with telepathy. As the body becomes  obsolete, it develops new techlepathy1.  INTRODUCTION  “Artistic  activity  is  founded  on  high  telepathy  – a high contact – and everything which comes  into its field becomes a sign, and is part of art.  It is therefore evident that the primary problem  of  today’s  art  has  become  the  renovation  and  intensification of perception.”  Lebel, 1968: 721    Within Second Life  SL  there are a variety of  emerging and established artists, art scenes, art  galleries, residencies, sculpture parks, curators,  artist-run spaces and an art market. Mario-Paul   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch004  Martinez Fabre y Tatiana Sentamans detail key  manifestations of art in SL  2007 . There is the  hyperformalism of Dancoyote Antonelli a.k.a. DC  Spenseley that borrows from the graphic arts, mod- ernist abstraction and pixel algorithms  Martinez  Fabre y Sentarmans, 2007: 55 . There is avatar  performance art, hybrid projects that are halfway  between the real and the virtual such as the work of  Eva and Franco Mattes a.k.a. 0100101110101101. ORG and video and animation is called Machinima   ibid: 55-62 . Code Performance involves writing  a script that can then be performed and changed  by avatar performance artists when making the  work. Code-scripts can also alter the behaviour   Copyright   2012, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  sphere, and to have them intersect with aesthetic  experience.”  ibid  Duchamp and Ettinger show  how the “artist and the viewer transform the art- work and are transformed by it in different-yet- connected ways” where there is “a kind of aesthetic  osmosis between the artist and the viewer via the  artwork.”   ibid   Telepathy  is  a  hidden  psychic  force behind identity transformation. Telepathy  cannot be separated from the Freudian concept  of transference and the uncanny reality of shared  language, feelings and empathy between the I and  the non-I. Further, telepathy assists the generation  of doppelgangers, puppet-selves, modified egos  and alternate selves as Green discusses through  looking at the artwork of Gilbert & George and  Abramoviç Ulay.   Green,  2000;  Green  2001;  Green,  2004   Duchampian  telepathy  aesthetics  and  Green’s  model  of  telepathetic  and  collab- orative performance can occur in collaboration  between avatars, between the ‘real’ self and the  alternate avatar self, and between the creator and  the viewer participant end-user. Whilst nanotech- nology and cyberspatial developments create new  techlepathies in science  Finkelstein, 1999: 13 , a  number of collaborative SL avatar performance  artists  are  remediating  works  by  collaborative  performance artists such as Abramoviç Ulay and  Fluxus and this is developing virtual and synthetic  telepathies in art.  Dominico Quaranta, a prominent SL art critic,  reports that the kitsch capitalist dystopia of SL is  teeming with artists keen to develop their alter  egos, meet other artists and collaborate, more so  in SL than any other virtual world.  Quaranta,  2007  It is utopic for artists in terms of creating  ‘enormous’ sculptures and installations works in  SL, and the “lack of corporeality is compensated  by the increase in specularity and cheap financial  costs.”  Martinez Fabre y Sentarmans, 2007: 64   “While real world venues frown upon dowsing  an audience with napalm or crashing planes into  it, not so is SL, where anything goes, and SF was  quick to take advantage.”  Wodell, 2008  SL art- ists are showing their work in experimental and   of avatars as collaborators and audience as well  as the environment  ibid: 66 .  Second Front  SF  are the pioneering avatar  performance artists in SL, co-founded by Jeremy  Owen Turner, Tanya Skuce, Doug Jarvis, Patrick  Lichty and others on November 23, 2006.2 Gazira  and Lichty also work as code-performance artists  and they have brought code-performance to some  SF artworks. Italian art-star avatar performer and  ‘code-wiz’ Gazira was recruited quite early on by  Turner. The SF website artist statement lists their  influences as Dada, Fluxus, Futurist Synthesis,  Situationism as well as performance artists such  Laurie  Anderson  and  Guillermo  Gomez-Pena.  “Second Front creates score-based performances  and interventions that challenge notions of tradi- tional performance, virtual embodiment and the  culture of immateriality.”  Second Front, 2010   SF members often refer to the grandmother of  performance art, Marina Abramoviç and Fluxus  in  artist  statements,  writings  and  remediations  of  her  artwork.   Kildall,  2010;  Lichty:  2009;  Lichty,  2009a;  Turner,  2010 .  References  to  Abramoviç in Lichty’s writing are too many to be  listed individually here, but many of his writings  are  easily  accessible  from  his  website   Lichty,  2010 . Fluxus performance artist Robert Filliou  was acknowldeged in an SF hybrid real-world  gallery and virtual happening for Art’s Birthday,  a  Fluxus  tradition  that  Filliou  invented,  which  involves local and global telepathic exchanges  and performances  Fritz, 2007 .  Artists Abramoviç  Abramoviç, 1993; 1996;  1998  and Filliou  Ruhrbeg, 2000, p. 589; Fritz, A.,  2007  are also known for working with telepathy,  as is Marcel Duchamp  Dalrymple Henderson,  1998:  101-111,  103;  Drinkall,  2010;  Lipsey,  1988: 98-101, 99 . Duchamp and contemporary  artist,  psychoanalyst  and  art  historian  Bracha  Lichtenberg-Ettinger  recognise  the  importance  of “psychic transgression … [and] its irruption in  the form of telepathy mysterious and mystical,”   Lichtenberg-Ettinger, 2005: 211  to deliver “inter- subjective transference relationships to the artistic   48   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  established gallery spaces as well as major art  biennales such as Venice and Shanghai.3 Impor- tantly for visual artists and performance artists, the  avatar body modification options and Machinima  platform in SL are widely considered the best of all  the virtual worlds.  Martinez Fabre y Sentarmans,  2007; and Neustaedter and Fedorovokya, 2008 . The SL destination guide lists many new age,  spiritual and religious destinations indexed under  Spirituality and Belief, Strange and Mysterious,  Spirituality and Belief  Second Life, 2010 . How- ever this paper focuses on SL technologically me- diated telepathies  Porush, 1998  and techlepathies  through the channel of contemporary conceptual  performance art and its emerging presence in SL.  Life as an avatar in SL is can be described as an  Alice in Wonderland experience, where the Queen  remembers the future as well as the past.  JEREMY OWEN TURNER’S  AVATAR TELEPATHY  Turner has many avatars, some of which are per- formance artists, and Wirxli Flimflam is arguably  his most infamous. In an interview Turner casu- ally refers to instant messaging  IM  as telepathy.  “I cannot speak for all of my peers but I can say  that  any  form  of  collaboration  and  rehearsal  almost instantly takes some form of  virtually   tangible  manifestation.  We  can  literally  beta- test any idea before taking it to an audience. In  terms of performance, it helps to have the Instant  Messaging  IM  system while performing and or  rehearsing because this form of telepathy allows  the group to conduct themselves without leaking  their improvised methods to the audience. Group  performance in this regard becomes much easier  to do.”  Turner in Paech, 2007   Turner says he was drawn to SL because of its  godlike dimension. “I am into metaphysics and  transcendental ideas…so cyberspace is really the  most compatible medium for me.”  ibid  SL “and   similar avatar worlds allow literally for a kind of  magick to happen. Artists can truly become the  shamans and sorcerers they have always wanted  to be.”  ibid   The word telepathy is used to brand Professor  Kevin Warwick’s ‘cyborg’ emotion communica- tion chips inserted in the human body  Drinkall,  2006 and 2009; Fleming, 2007  The invention  of the term telepathy accompanied the invention  of the telephone in the late 1800s and continues  to have currency and shadow new technologies.  Like other SL users, performance art avatars use  dialogue ‘channels’ very similar to facebook chat  windows  to  plan  and  undertake  performances,  collaborations, and gaming theatre. Gaming and  avatar theatre offers further ‘mind share’ improve- ments on top of the social networking augmenta- tion of the Internet. ‘Channeling’ reveals further  techlepathy, resonating with both telecomunica- tions and occult practice. Artist tricksters in SL  learn to operate with sleight of hand, Linden cur- rency and ‘speculative intuition’  Martinez Fabre  y Sentarmans, 2007: 52 .  Facebook  already  facilitates  games  such  as  Farmville  and  credit  cards  have  point  reward  systems, so it is a small leap from web 2.0 social  networks to the next 2.0 expansion of the gaming  layer. The suggestion of telepathy and promises  of magic can seem like eccentric esotericism or  alternatively  like  exaggerated  public  relations   PR  spin on the other. Artist intellectuals such  as  Turner  enable  ‘high  telepathy’  to  become  increasingly contagious and effervescent within  SL culture. Turner acknowledges he is simulta- neously obsessed with both PR and the spiritual  quest. This may have something to do with his  SL medium. SL’s two main assets are the promise  that anything is possible including telepathy and  teleportation, and of course its credit card oper- ated Linden economy of companies, advertising  strategies, landowners, artisans, service providers,  artists and the homeless.  Turner has played and experimented with a  wide range of virtual world game sites. In addition  to being an avatar performance artist, he is also   49   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  On stage for Wirxli’s final performance was a cube  shaped ‘prim’  an SL term to describe a primary  shape or virtual object  with the text “If you are  dead and you know it kill yourself.” “The rights  of an avatar are not the same as the rights of the  associated person.  When people erase avatars of  themselves is that suicide, homicide, or infocide? ”   Bainbridge, 2008  Was it just another event in  avatar auto-bio-thanatography? How can you die  when you are already dead? Where lies agency  and culpability with avatacide?  Wirxli was also a member of the Avatar Or- chestra Metaverse. In Figure 1 he is at centre front  contributing to a telepathic sound-art performance  within SL with peers from Avatar Orchestra Meta- verse.6 In the real world jazz musicians and band  members in general often describe the experience  of improvising on top of a score, collaborative  fusion and charismatic shared intimacy as telepa- thy. Those developing artificial intelligence are  studying  improvisation  cognition  and  theories  of  mind   Baumer, A.  and  Magerko  B.  2009   -  something all children develop when they learn  to read the emotions and minds of others. Another  avatar  member  of Avatar  Orchestra  Metaverse  called  Humming  Pera  explicitly  identifies  her  contribution  to  SL  as  exploring  sound,  music,  performance, telepathy and collaboration.7 In the  Wirxli FlimFlam memorial blog dated Monday  May 14, 2007, Wirxli conjures improvised sound  performance as a Duchampian readymade that is  transmitted telepathically between avatars:  “...for this found-sound intro warm-up piece, we  are literally just standing around, hanging out  and telepathically transmitting our found sounds  from  our  inventory  directly  into  the  public  platz…”8  Wirxli committed suicide to earn the love and  respect of SaveMe Oh on Valentines Day, 2010 at  The Diablous Artspace. Appropriate to character,  the wicked avatar performance and video artist  SaveMe Oh takes all credit for Wirxli’s suicide   a social addict, art historian, musician and con- ceptual artist. Turner’s work with virtual worlds  and telepathy precedes SL. Turner practices astral  travel and has his own private avatar in the real  world.4 The names for his SL avatars are derived  from the secret name of his most personal and  secret avatar that exists outside of SL  so far  and  only in his mind and imagination. Onto Distro  was his avatar in the Digitalspace Traveler Ava- tar  Community.  This  avatar  resembles  a  black  TV screen with a face, and it suggests telepathic  communication with the viewer from within the  Yahoo time capsule:  I understand that there are entities that are trans  terrestial  and  trans  dimensional  in  scope,  and  in  scale.  Cyberspace  and  other  occult  worlds  illustrate proof of that, as far as I’m concerned.  Some of you have already spoken with me via  telepathy using my limited mode of conscious- ness as a transmission medium.”…“I think it is  time  this  shallow  3D  earthly  society  begins  to  embrace Alfred Lambremont Webre’s exo-political  approach to ET and ED, that is extra dimension  entities such as yourselves.”  Distro, 2006   Turner’s  arguably  most  infamous  avatar  Wirxli  Flimflam   2006-2010   recently  left  SL  via  suicide  with  great  theatrical  spectacularity   Turner, 2010a . A memorial plaque has replaced  Wirxli’s Warhol-like PR office. The suicide was a  live gallery and SL avatar performance event. It  involved artistic collaboration with SaveMe Oh5  and machinima documentation. For Turner, it has  presented an opportunity to explore life after death  in Second Life, abstractions on the astral plane and  delve deeper into SL as an afterlife. Although SL is  gaining recognition as both a creative and capitalist  economy in its own right  Schnapp and Shanks,  148  the death of an avatar artist has not had the  same art market effects as the death of an actual  artist. How do avatars die in SL - isn’t it just life  after life after life? SL can already resemble the  afterworld with skull-headed and winged avatars.   50   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  Figure 1. Avatar Orchestra Metaverse  Jeremy O. Turner, 2007. Used with permission   and final performance. SaveMe is the archetypal  “soul-sucking” psychotic femme-fatal and “psy- chic  vampire.”9  Wirxli  wanted  so  much  to  be  like her, to be with her and even to be her that  he ‘fell into her machinima’, stalked her and in  the end died for her. Such a strong identification  borders  on  the  telepathic.  Stalkers  often  claim  to  communicate  telepathically  with  their  prey.  In some cases the victim of stalking can begin  to  stalk  the  stalker  and  be  caught  within  the  psychic game playing of deranged love transfer- ence, psychic terror and dangerous telepathy. In  the  wider  metaverse  of  Facebook  and  Twitter  world the concept of ‘friending’ and ‘following’  someone is now synonymous with stalking, due  to ease and addiction of life sharing with friends,  acquaintances and strangers. In SL one ‘befriends’  someone in order to open IM telepathy channel- ing and facilitate teleportation. In SaveMe Oh’s  blog  2010 , Wirxli says: “SaveMe mesmerizes  me.” He follows her about, hangs out, squats in  her studio and her UFO-Oh. He looses himself for  this other. “I wish I was her or at least with her.”   Turner, 2010a  SaveMe and Wirxli collaborate  to create an SL fiction that performs telepathetic  cyber love, death wish stalking, infatuation, as   well as mind control and thought insertion of the  cruel femme-fatal cyborg.10  Qyxxql Merlin is a spiritual seeker who exists  in order to meet all the major religious and spiritual  leaders in SL  Turner, 2010d . Qyxxql Merlin’s  LiveJournal reports contact with various spiritual  leaders in numerous blog entries such as Gandhi’s  Salt Satyagraph Walk in Second Life, the Angel- Channeler Nina and the Mystic Twins, Nichiren  Buddhism, Krishna Consciousness in Second Life  and  Islam  in  Second  Life.  Qyxxql  also  reports  on “his” experiences with a pagan ritual ground,  Jewish candle lighting ceremony and Buddhist  counseling. S he blogs with interrogative detail  about  numerous  Mormon  Transhumanists  SL  seminars. Qyxxql has been documented in Turner’s  blog as having visited Wirxli’s funerary plaque. Qyxxql  participates  in  MahatmaGandhi  Chakrabarti’s pilgrimage for the last three miles  and  reports  “I  am  pleased  that  I  was  able  to  capture the energy between us as walkers. We  did not speak that much during our walkabout. I  really think we had an intuitive rapport that was  bordering on the telepathic.”  ibid   See Figure 2   Qyxxql’s blog documents a “transcendental yet  intimate session that was held in Nina Lancaster’s  Healing Pool Centre for angelic transmissions and   51   spirit-guided meditation.”  ibid  Nina’s friends,  The Mystic Twins, counsel him further about his  higher self and Qyzzql vows “I will expand my  realm to include the “real” analog world alongside  the “virtual” realms in order to achieve a quantum  spiritual unity.”  ibid   Qyxxql is not an artist, but Turner certainly  identifies as an artist and has shown in many gal- leries  and  Qyxxql  is  interested  in  telepathic  telepathetic  SL  artists  and  identities.  Ghandi’s  great walk was projected into Eyebeam gallery  in New York, 2008. Ghandi’s real physical self  Joseph  DeLappe  spent  time  on  a  treadmill  in  order to walk his avatar across islands in SL, and  by the end of the pilgrimage he had walked 240  miles. Outside of SL, the collaborative perfor- mance artists Abramoviç Ulay experienced pain,  endurance, alchemical transformation, profound  connection with earth minerals and energy lines  of the planet, and even telepathy during their walk  of China’s Great Wall in 1988.  The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  Qiezli Hixantapo is one of Turner’s most recent  avatars -  a shimmering and jewel-like abstract  non-humanoid. The audience, comprised mostly of  other avatar performance artists and SF members,  are both viewers and participants who ascend “the  heavenly exit portal into the white void”. “Qiezli  Hixantapo greets them and giggles as their spirit  guide” and “the reborn visitors play with Qiezli in  the secondafterlife  or aftersecondlife ”  Turner,  2010  Qiezli shimmers because its skin carries the  memory of SF performances as they are abstracted  into  four  largely  monochromatic  modernist  shapes. Qiezli wears a video texture that carries  “a kind of abstracted ‘life review’ for the visi- tors”.  Turner 2010  The remediated machinima  of SF performances from the Ars Virtua archive  are mapped onto the form to create a flickering  distortion of the representational footage while  the accompanying sound track continues to play   Turner, 2010 . Qiezli is the reincarnation of Wirxli  and Qyxxql, and its name is a derivation of both.  Qiezli consists of four intersecting or clustered   Figure 2.

In a 2010  collaboration  called  Homology12  with  another  avatar performance artist Selavy Oh, Qiezli and  Selavy exchange clothes and become the other.  When Qiezli and Selavy practiced their exchange  in the white void, Turner noted: “It was quite the  gnostic and mystical experience - even for the  artists!”13 Wirixli escaped the deadly transference  spell of SaveMe Oh into another ‘second life’ as  a new and different being that can continues to  exchange and collaborate with other SL artists.  Qiezli is half ‘human’ avatar and half ‘bot’, which  is a scripted automaton agent that Jeremy plans  to use as a process of ongoing transformation and  self-othering: “I was also thinking of giving it  public access to certain trustworthy individuals as  an open source identity.”14 Qiezli resembles some   early modernist abstractions in paint and sculpture.  Kitsch  pop-aesthetic  attains  a  high-modernist  conceptual affinity with Theosophical ‘thought  forms’ and the ‘movement of the triangle’ central to  Wassily Kandinsky’s philosophy Concerning the  Spiritual in Art. Turner recently left SF in order to  undertake research into the anthropomorphism of  non-humanoid avatars in SL in his Masters thesis  titled Neo-Modernist Visual Design of Avatars in  Second Life  See Figure 3, Figure 4 .

Doug Jarvis also co-curates an annual  World Telekinesis Competition with Ted Heibert.  This annual event involves real world game, play  and competition as well as parapsychology, the oc- cult and telekinetic aesthetics. This event receives  submissions via internet from all over the world.  Many members of SF exhibit their own art practice  in galleries, for example Kildall exhibits SL digi- tal prints as well as sculptural objects, video and  installation. Kildall has explored technologically  mediated telepathy in his work After Though 2010,  which like Mariko Mori’s UFO Wave translates  EEG brainwave analysis of participants into an  “emotional reflector”  Kildall, 2010 .  Perhaps SF’s most literal example of telepathy,  collaboration  and  performance  art  is  Tower  of  Babelfish, 2007:  Real world gallery visitors enjoyed a projected live  online performance where Second Front enacted  textual  performances  that  communicated  with  spirits of four dead performers: Tristan Tzara,  Ana Mendieta, Charlotte Moorman and Rudolf  Schwarzkogler. The ghosts used AtlaVista’s Ba- belfish engine as a means of trans-dimensional  communication.  Second Front, 2010   In The Absolutely Last  and final  Supper16  performed by SF  See Figure 5  we see the artists   54  taking the position of Christ and his disciples, and  with sly reference to Dan Brown they state it is  Da Vinci code for the 21st century  Second Front,  2010 . Communion engages a tele-presence with  God by tasting his symbolically transubstantiated  wine-blood. SF deliberately confronts the over- abundance of reproductions of masterpieces in SL,  while at the same time create the work purely for  live gallery exhibition. The seated avatars appear  dressed for a rave and then briefly eat, drink and  quietly commune collectively. However they soon  start projecting red wine vomit-blood and jump up  on the table to make full display of their pixilated  tele-pathology for the distanced televisual audi- ence. Telepathology is the diagnosis of blood and  disease at a distance, mediated by computers and  virtual reality technologies. SF offers the carni- valesque display of their ‘semi-god’  Quaranta,  2008   symptom  and  the  pathos  of  a  bloodless  kitsch performance. As a group engaged in both  conceptual instruction and improvisation strate- gies, and performance for video machinima, they  engage what Krauss has identified as the telepathy  of narcissistic performance for video aesthetics   Krauss, 1976 . The appearance of partying and  dying to be all at once more human, more cyborg  and more god-like is both hilarious and haunt- ing. The tableau vivant performance drifts away  from the formality of its Christian references to  resemble something like electro punk voodoo. A  parallel can be drawn with their animal-cyborg    The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  behaviour and highly stylized animalistic and hu- man figurative statuettes of traditional African Boh  sculptures where sacrificial items such as blood  and alcohol are combined with earth to coat the  sculptures. This Boh ritual draws in positive spirits  and wards off evil spirits. SF’s remediation of Da  Vinci shows that new or different technologies  are accompanied by new or different mediations  of spiritual communion.  Zombie Attack!  28 Avatars  Later17  uses  the  cult of zombie movies to critique SL, where all  the  bodies  are  far  too  perfect  yet  cyborg  and  zombie-like.  Zombie  culture  is  a  horror  genre  parody of the contagion of crowd mentality that  occurs in a street protest or large gathering where  everyone starts behaving in the same way at the  same time resulting in conformity at times, and  a revolutionary eruption at others. Social theorists  Gustave le Bon and more recently Mikkel Borch  Jacobsen  recognise  that  real  world  crowds  are  vulnerable to a telepathic contagion. Borch-Ja- cobsen  describes  the  mysterious  force  within  crowds as “indissolubly nonsubjectal and ‘social,’  [with nothing designated except] immediate com- munication with others…prior to any conscious-  ness of self, and thus also prior to any conscious- ness of other. Taken to the extreme, it is thought  transmission, telepathy.”  Redfield, 1992  A shar- ing of identification, identity and telepathic con- tagion  can  also  occur  within  the  collaborative  process. As telepathy theorist David Porush has  shown, the viral nature of bodies, language and  computers extends the telepathy metaphor  Po- rush, 1998 .  With  the  help  of Wirixli  FlimFlam,  Kildall  produced a series of remediations of several iconic  performance art pieces in SL in a series called  Paradise Ahead, 2006-2007  Kildall, 2010 . The  title of the work came from Kildall’s concern with  the demise of spiritual space in the modern age and  his experience that he found “many in Second Life  looking for transcendental experience.”  Kildall in  Quaranta, 2007  The concept for these works was  entirely Kildall’s and not a work of SF. Wirixli  was only recruited as a helper, and only for part  of the series. Wirixli’s repeated presence could  almost be suggestive of something more than just  assisting, especially when work by collaborative  artists  Abramoviç Ulay  is  repeated.  However,  other original artworks Kildall has remediated in   Figure 5. The Absolutely Last  and Final  Supper  Second Front, 2007. Used with permission   55   this series such as those by Yoko Ono and Chris  Burden required the relational assistance of other  artists, helpers or viewing participants, without  necessitating  a  more  sustained  partnership  or  formal artistic collaboration. Kildall’s work deals  more with the problematic issue of reproduction  and remediation in performance art  Sant, 158   and his collaboration with Wirixli Turner is con- fined within the group work of SF. Remediating  performance into the virtual opens up “collective  notions of emotional content in surreal space.”   Kildall in Quaranta, 2007  It is in the work of  the Mattes that collaboration of Gilbert & George  and Abramoviç Ulay is more closely mirrored by  the artists’ own intimate collaboration as artists  who are partners. There is a difference between  the telepathy of collaboration and the telepathy of  a minor agent who helps, assists or participates.  The telepathy of helpers requires less direct affec- tive contagion to penetrate into and be recognised  within the authorial identity, potentially creating  more of a haunting shadow doppleganger. History  reveals great telepathic assistants within Sandor  Ferenczi,  who  assisted  Sigmund  Freud  on  his  theory of telepathic transference, and Thomas Wat- son who attended séances and assisted Alexander  Bell’s invention of the telephone. Wirixli happily,  generously and clownishly haunts Kildall’s work.   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  The Wirixli FlimFlam memorial built by some of  his other SF colleagues again clownishly haunts  SL as he rides a SaveMe Oh horse backwards  see  Figure 6, Figure 7 .  WESTERN FRONT AND ETERNAL  NETWORK  SF  started  as  a  SL  extension  of  The  Western  Front  artist  run  space.18  Turner  was  born  just  after Western Front was established in 1973 with  a focus on performance and new media. Turner  credits  friends  of  his  parents,  Michael  Morris  and Vincent Trasov, who co-founded19 Western  Front for getting him into art. Filliou’s early and  ongoing  visits,  performances,  residencies  and  teachings are celebrated as the founding philoso- phy of Western Front. Filliou’s work is very well  represented in Western Front archives, including  some  of  his  Telepathic  Music  series.  Filliou’s  Telepathic Music Series started with Telepathic  Music No. 2  made  in  1973,  and  extended  into  the 70s. Filliou and George Brecht crystallised  the  Eternal  Network,  facilitating  artists’  work  with  telepathy  via  mail-art  and  performance.  Together  with  George  Brecht,  Filliou  founded  the Eternal Network, which facilitated many of   Figure 6. Remediation of Abramoviç Ulay’s Rest Energy  Scott Kildall, 2006-2007.

Numerous other members of  the Eternal Network spread throughout the world  have also worked with telepathy  Drinkall, 2006 .  Filliou’s invention of Arts Birthday continues as  a global Eternal Network ritual and legacy that  is most actively kept alive by Western Front and  a sister new media arts community in Vienna. In  terms of being an artist, Turner is a Western Front  baby.20 Eternal Network’s mail-art network and  artworks, happenings, performances and installa- tion have evolved to include telematics, telepathy,  email, and now SL and virtual worlds.  VIRTUAL FLUXUS  Quarenta declared SF to be ‘virtual fluxus’ very  soon after it formed, and some may have thought  this  a  bit  premature  and  perhaps  a  burden  for  such an emerging artistic identity.21 However, it  is true that Turner and his SF friends and avatar  performance friends share a deep connection to  Fluxus, and that they remediate its spirit through  original artworks as well as SL remediations of  Fluxus  artworks.  Lichty  sees  Alan  Kaprow’s  Happenings, Joseph Beuys social sculpture and   shamanism, and Nicholas Bourriard’s Relational  Aesthetics as the ideal influences for engagement  with SL and virtual worlds. He points to Beuys as  the artist with the best affinity to connect with the  philosophy of Linden Lab.  Lichty, 2008   A more recent addition to SF is the avatar Bibbe  Oh a.k.a. Bibbe Hansen, daughter of important  Fluxus artist Al Hansen  Second Front, 2010 .  Bibbe  Hansen  often  performed  in  her  father’s  theatrical  avant  guarde  ‘Happenings’  as  well  as Andy Warhol films from the age of 13 when  she  starred  opposite  Edie  Sedgwick  in  Prison.   Second Front, 2010  She continues to archive  and exhibit her father’s work. SF performed Car  Bibbe  in  2008  after  a  never  performed  Fluxus  score that was created for her by her father  ibid .  They also performed a new version of Yoko Ono  Piano Drop created by Bibbe’s father for Yoko  Ono, and called it Hansen-Ono Piano Drop  ibid .  The artwork Virtual Fluxus was performed Oc- tober 27 2010 and involved collaboration with  the important Fluxus artist Larry Miller. Miller  is known for working with telepathy in his early  Fluxus work, for example when he went under  hypnosis to become and create artwork as his dead  mother  in  the  work  Mom-me   Drinkall,  2007;  Stiles, 2003: 75-88 . In Virtual Fluxus Miller is   57   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  fantasmagoria as shallow othering of the young  and beautiful avatars that dominate SL. Instead  Lichty prefers the old and ugly ones as an af- firmative attempt to represent alterity. Although  there are plenty of homeless avatars, there is a  virtual lack of representations of squallor, filth  and  dilapidation.  Lichty  does  identify  Virtual  Darfur as a consciousness and social justice site.   Lichty, P. 2010 22  In terms of SL, it is artists who work between  reality and virtuality with the greatest tension that  are best placed to deal with issues of “gender,  migration,  micropolitics  etc.”   Martinez  Fabre  y Sentarmans, 2007: 69 . Lichty creates anima- tions for art activists The Yes Men, and there is a  similar prankster and activist aspect within SF’s  work. SF have created activist interventions, for  example Breaking News, 2008, was made in the  abandoned  SL  buildings  of  Reuters. The  2007  work Martyr Sauce  See Figure 8  mobilized a  peace  demonstration  within  SL  conflict  zones.  Some performance art avatars apparently lost their  lives  carrying  peace  placards  whilst  triggering  animated psychedelic gerberas blooms and raining  marijuana leaves.  ibid: 66 . Hazardous, 2007, is  a work made in response to the ill treatment of a  fellow artist by the police.  Second Front, 2010  It is claimed that a virtual happening occurred  in SF’s Spawn of the Surreal because of the in- voluntary audience ‘participation’ as the audience  became part of the work.  ibid: 68  The avatar  audience was given seats for the performance that  were loaded with avatar-transforming code. At a  specific time this code transformed their bodies  into bizarre mutations. This work had a surreal  and hallucinatory effect, causing some audience  members to flee and log off, and others requesting  a higher dose of the code. 28 Avatars Later had  a similar propagated disfiguring effect upon both  performers and audience.  Fluxus artist and theorist Jean Jacque’s Lebel’s  text ‘On the Necessity of Violation,’ was written  in 1968 as an art treatise on telepathy, happenings  and revolutionary aesthetics written just prior and   dressed in tuxedo with a photo mask of his real  and  quite  elder  face  of  today.  He  introduces  a  series of short Fluxus artworks by himself, Bibbe  and Man Machinaga a.k.a. Lichty. One of his own  performances involves Bibbe and is called See  you  in  your  dreams. This  artwork  was  written  in 1977 with the instruction: appear in another’s  dreams  Virtual Fluxus, 2010 . Lichty articulates  some anxiety held by SF with this notion of being  becoming Virtual Fluxus, which is nevertheless  outweighed  with  confident  and  critical  ease.   Lichty in amyfreelunch, 2008 . Lichty already  had  existing  deep  friendships  with  both  Bibbe  and Miller that preceded the founding of SF, and  he is also familiar with some other Fluxus artists.  Lichty describes the process of integrating Bibbe  into the SF ‘street gang’ as very “organic” after  Turner found out she was online  ibid .  ART, TELEPATHY AND REVOLUTION  In the otherworld of SL how do avatars identify  with the Other and engage in issues of gender,  conflict and representation? What is Other in this  otherworld? How do avatars create changes in their  own world, and perhaps the real world? One of the  curators of Vancouver’s Second Live Biennale of  Performance Art 2007, called xox voyager, says,  “Nothing can represent The Future better than a  real-time, interactive 3-D space where fantastic  people populate improbable architecture as they  fly, teleport, and telepathically communicate their  thoughts and dreams. Where do Native people  fit into such a space?”  Fragnito, 2007  In James  Cameron’s blockbuster movie Avatar, the organic,  cosmic ‘gaia’ telepathy of Na’vi comes up against  the virtual world telepathy of humans - a form of  military infiltration and surveillance. The human  operated avatars use their military techlepathy in  two ways – to love, learn from, collaborate and  save the Na’vi or to stalk, manipulate and destroy  the Na’vi. Lichty complains about alien fairies  in  SL  as  far  too  predictable  vision  of  utopian   58   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  Figure 8. Martyr Sauce  Second Front, 2007. Used with permission   after the May June riots. Fluxus fused art, politics  and telepathy, and the Eternal Network was also  started  in  France  in  1968.  Filliou’s  Permanent  Creation Tool Shed, 1969, promoted playful use  of everyday tools - hammer, sickle, imagination  and telepathy. A sign above Filliou’s tool shed  read something like: I am away on a trip at the  moment, but leave your name with address and  one day I will touch  contact  you via telepathy.23  Lebel describes ‘high-telepathy’ of newly interdis- ciplinary art, radically connected to everyday life,  politics and ‘everything’. He questioned reliance  on conventional theatres and galleries, and their  status as sacred places. Happenings interpolate  ‘actual experience directly into mythic context’,  creating deep links between ‘the actual and the  hallucinatory’, so we ‘become one with our hal- lucinations.’  Lebel, 1996: 720  Lebel celebrated  the prophetic role of art and ‘mind-dancing hip- pies’  ibid: 722  to encourage people ‘to be free of  mental Stalinism’ through ‘guerilla theatre, street  happenings  and  similar  activities’.   ibid:  721   ‘The Happening ... carries out transmissions’ and  ‘imposes no restriction on affective ambivalence.’    ibid: 720  Happenings involve extreme physical- ity and psychic activity. Lebel says:  Everything depends on the collective watchfulness,  and  on  the  occurrence  of  certain  parapsycho- logical phenomena. ... The Happening is not an  invariable ceremony – rather, a state of mind, an  act of clairvoyance.  Lebel, 1968: 720-71   Some believe the revolution will not occur in  social networking of Facebook and Twitter because  it promotes weak ties, instead of strong cult-like  ties between revolutionaries who keep each other’s  secrets and reinforce strong hierarchy  Gladwell,  2010 . Daniel J Mounsey a.k.a. Pyewacket Ka- zyanenko reflects on the difference between SL  compared to Facebook and Twitter and finds that  there is a lot more scope for artist collaborations in  SL  Bramwell, 2009 . The Mattes’ artwork I know  that it is all a state of mind their avatars’ action  of repeatedly falling down triggered spontane- ous and telepathetic avatar affect contagion. Eva  and Franco kept falling over and over for hours.  It was not meant to be a participatory artwork,  but audience members also started falling down   59   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  and in one recent article on the subtleties of new  media performance, he says that performance can  be both the performer creator and the viewer or  end-user clicking computer mice  Lichty, 2010 .  Lichty acknowledges the tele-empathetic nature of  comparative affect between live real performance  and SL avatar performance: “empathy with Marina  Abramoviç’s bleeding belly in Lips of Thomas is  questionably analogous to Man Michinaga’s re- mediation of the piece.”  Lichty, 2008  As yet,  very few can profess to be working at the same  level of physicality, danger and endurance as art- ists such as Abramoviç, but many involved with  SF as well as the Mattes and Abramoviç herself  are currently working through these problematics.  For Marina, a crucial element of performance  art is endurance so we accepted [the directive]  to perform for four days, for four hours a day.  At the end, we were almost throwing up on the  keyboards and for the first time, we felt pain that  our avatars usually don’t feel in our performances.   Mattes in Shindler, 2010   SL  artists  such  as  Joseph  DeLappe  use  a  human-computer interface that uses the body in a  more holistic way. The avatar performance artist  Pyewacket Kazyanenko assists Stelarc’s work in  SL. It seems logical to suppose that Stelarc may  also  bridge  his  older-style,  more  ‘real’  endur- ance exercises with SL avatar performance. For  DeLappe, physically demanding actions such as  walking on a treadmill are used instead of being  limited to a keyboard and computer mouse. Earlier  artists such as Abramoviç are important muses and  mentors for those seated at computers assisting  the agency of avatar performance artists. Works  by Great Escape and Wirxli have been made that  show the pathos of eliminated risk and physical  extremes,  supplemented  by  superhuman  fluo- rescent skin and cartoon levitation. Abramoviç  herself is very interested in SL, and having seen  the series Synthetic Performances of the Mattes  she exclaimed that she wished she had thought of   until the end of the performance.  Shindler, 2010   Lisa Blackman argues that theories of embodi- ment, affect and media need to acknowledge the  workings of telepathy as a hidden force within  contemporary forms of affective contagion  Black- man, 2010 . What might be affective in real life  is tele-affective in SL, with some ability to be  touched  at  a  distance.  The  Mattes  report  that  performances in SL are much more interesting  now than in 2007. “Now avatars are super fast  at improvising with you; the result is, of course,  unpredictable.”  Mattes in Shindler, 2010  There  is synthetic telepathy being developed within the  Mattes’ Synthetic Performances, reminds us that  human telepathy has always been technologically  mediated - as theorist of telepathy and technology  David Porush has detailed.  Porush, 1998   PERFORMANCE AND PAIN  Doctors constantly warn of damage to eyes, back,  metabolism  and  mind  through  long  periods  of  sitting at a computer. In Abramoviç Ulay’s most  epic endurance work Nightsea Crossing, 1981- 1987, the artists sat for days and weeks at a time  in numerous galleries around the world at either  end of a table without eating or speaking whilst  maintaining each other’s gaze. Instead of using a  computer for mental travel they placed alchemical  objects such as a boomerang covered in gold and  a live python on the table at which they seated.  Through extreme endurance of pain and exhaus- tion of sitting day after day an energy dialogue  comprised of empathy, sympathy and telepathy  was established with the audience and between the  pair. The within and known to SF and the Mattes  sometimes  engage  in  endurance  performance,  where  they  continually  move  their  mouse  and  click on keys to animate their avatar. Most are art  university trained artists, art historians and or crit- ics and thus very knowledgeable of the history of  conceptual, performance and time-based practices  in art. Lichty writes and publishes prolifically,   60   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  it.  Lichty, 2009d  In May 2010 Mattes reported  Synthetic Performances continues as an ongoing  project, and that they were creating two new works  in collaboration with Plymouth Arts Centre and  Abramoviç.  Schindler, 2010; and Plymouth Arts  Centre, 2010 . Abramoviç has expressed interest  in working with scientists to make teleportation  and time travel possible:  The are hundreds of parallel worlds. The fasci- nating thing about the idea of being in this space  is that just by changing my wave-lengh, I could  disappear in front of your eyes and reappear in the  same room but in a different order, with another  set-up. It could be incredible to work with both  scientists and artists to make such things possible.  You could really make time trips.  Abramoviç in  Pijnappel and Abramoviç, 1990: 60   In scientific experiments at Georgia Tech, real  actors are combined with virtual ones within the  same visual field, where a resident performance  group called Lets Try That help test new tech- nologies. “Avatars active on the virtual stage in  Second Life are combined with the real-world  actors in the physical performance space.”  Far- ley K. et al, 2009  They observe that SL offers a  dynamic performance platform that nevertheless  has problems.  The animation control and render system is fixed,  as well as the number of polygons used in a certain  location. The use of dynamic lights and detailed  avatar appearances is usually very limited, as both  put heavy pressure on the render engine.  Farley  K., Nitsche M., Bolter J. and MacIntyre B., 2009   experience in terms relating to the paranormal,  such  telepathy  and  voodoo.  They  believe  that  “magic and paranormal phenomena could be a  fruitful place to look for new metaphors for TUIs.”   Svanaes, D. and Verplank, W. 2000   During our experimentation, we repeatedly found  ourselves and others comparing our prototypes  with  paranormal  phenomena:  “This  is  like  te- lepathy”, “This is like Voodoo”. This observa- tion led us to explore our tacit expectations of  the paranormal. Are there any common themes  in our expectations of the magical? What is the  structure of this world?  ibid   Svanaes and Verplank refuse to reconcile their  desire to know more about telepathy by limiting  its usability artistry as mere stage magic.  Tognazzini  argues  for  the  application  of  tech- niques from stage magic to interface design. We  use “magic” to refer to belief systems different  from that of Western rationality, that allow for  phenomena that are “impossible” in the latter  system.  ibid   They seek a scientific belief system that will  support  this  real  experience  of  telepathy  that  people have through an appreciation of Quantum  Mechanics and Bells Theorem, Relics and Magic  and  “The  holistic  universe  and  magic  through  resemblance”  ibid .  GHOSTS, SHELLS AND  TELE-ACTORS  The experience of telepathy is not a confined to  artists. Computer science researchers Dag Svanaes  and William Verplank developed usebility tests  of  Tangible  User  Interfaces   TUIs .

Such real world performances are  semi-autonomous, and can be puppet, automaton  and mime-like where an elimination of personal- ity is used to create an uncanny fusion between  two selves while further distancing the viewers   Green, 2001: 139, 147, 152 . In this example of  early performance work “Each jerk is therefore a  point at which an instance of virtuality occurs.”   Green, 2001: 152  Alternatively, a line of con- centrated smooth flight in SL is an instant of the  otherworldly feeling more real.  CONCLUSION  Artists such as Turner and his avatar performance  art friends and peers allow telepathy to be part  of SL avatar performance art, unconsciously and  through  intellectual  decisions  to  engage  with  transferential, technological and occult phenom- ena.  Telepathic  and  transferential  phenomena  are active when creating an alternate or virtual  self and or selves, inside and outside of SL, and  through sparks generated between the borders of  real and virtual worlds. SL augments the creative  schizoid nature of artistic personalities through the  splitting and doubling of selves and ego modifica- tion. Avatar telepathy fictions can involve love,  spiritual quests and high modernist aesthetics. The  generation of secondafterlives in SL affirms that  the avatar identity is extremely fluid, dynamic,  exchangeable and telepathetic. Activist tendencies  and Fluxus happenings are also accompanied by  transferential and hypnotic phenomena, and this  ‘code’ is present within SL. The performing body  generates experiences of telepathy, as does the  shared group and collaborative telepathy. Speaking  through another, ventriloquising through soulless  avatar shells and general computer and SL weird- ness also allow telepathy to effervesce. SF and  SL artists are remediating earlier technologically  mediated telepathies and extending the cyborg flux  of telepathetic art practice and historical lineage.  “…changes  the  current  between  perceiver  and  perceived: she is haunted by us because without  us she has no existence. Annlee never did have a  soul – and her body possesses only appearance.  She is “No Ghost Just a Shell.”  ibid  In SL an  avatar that remains after a person has logged off  due to a glitch is called a “ghost.” Pyewacket,  whose  first  name  was  taken  from  a  sixteenth  century witches cat, has considered becoming a  paranormal researcher into the glitches experi- enced in SL.24 Pyewacket has been documented  merging into the body of Wirixli, a common SL  glitch that the Mattes anticipate will be fixed soon   Schindler, 2010 .  Turner’s metaphor of IM as telepathy doubles  in computer associated weirdness with the twice- absent presence of communicating one’s being as  ‘away from keyboard’, typed in shorthand logo  as ‘afk’. The afk person haunts the virtual world  as somewhere between online and offline as a  ghostly absent presence  Boellstorff, 2008: 117 .  In a Derridean hauntological sense, Tom Boell- storff identifies the haunted afk as the essence of  SL culture, where presence and emersion meet.  For him as an anthropologist, afk is also where  ethnography and the virtual meet - the participant  observer is an “awkward presence” surveying the  culture of the other.  ibid  Although Jacques Der- rida himself did not have a computer he considered  writing to be very performative, and the act of  ‘loosing’ his Telepathy text for several years is an  example of that. Derrida ventriloquises Sigmund  Freud in Telepathy, speaking not as himself but as  Freud. Telepathy is a lesser-known text than The  Spectres of Marx, and both extend his interest in  hypnotic and speculative phenomena.  The  actions  of  avatars  in  machinima  have  an “orthopaedic touch”  Martinez y Sentamans,  2007: 60  involving what Lev Manovich refers  to as ‘tele-acting’ and remote control in real time.  The  movement  resembles  zombie,  robot  and  marionette-like  qualities  of  some  instructional  conceptual  performance,  for  example  Gilbert  & George’s Underneath the Arches and Bend It   62   The Art and Flux of Telepathy 2.0 in Second Life  REFERENCES  Abramoviç, M.  1993 .

In order to achieve sustainable  economic success in the context of global competition, companies need to optimize their communication  activities within their innovation processes. In addition to identifying relevant trends at an early stage  and generating marketable ideas, it is becoming increasingly important for companies to sufficiently  communicate the usage and the meaning of innovations and to position themselves as consistent inno- vators. Virtual worlds like the high profile, realistically designed online environment Second Life offer  far-reaching possibilities within the innovation management process – from ideating to market introduc- tion. The objective of this chapter is to provide a systematic analysis of the communication paradigms  in virtual environments. In particular, the main issues, challenges, opportunities, limits and trends of  digital innovation communication will be discussed in the context of the 3-D world Second Life.  INTRODUCTION  In order to be economically successful, compa- nies have to effectively communicate products  and to position themselves as innovators. Three- dimensional virtual worlds provide a multitude  of  options  for  innovation  management.  While  the  number  of  reports  about  corporate  activi- ties  in  3-D  worlds  has  decreased  significantly,   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch005  three-dimensional virtual worlds are continually  growing, both in terms of user numbers and the  technological possibilities and the use scenarios  these bring. In addition, studies on virtual worlds  have gained new popularity in science and re- search. Research institutions and companies are  continuing to explore the potential of these online  environments  for  interaction  with  internal  and  external stakeholders in the course of innovation   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

However,  three-dimensional  virtual worlds also appear to open up extensive  possibilities for innovation communication, which  have barely been examined to date.  This  chapter  contributes  to  the  systematic  analysis of the potential, limits and challenges  of digital innovation communication. Basic in- formation for the evaluation of current or future  involvement in virtual worlds for the purposes  of innovation communication will be presented  using a systematic description of selected case  studies from one of the first and most well-known  virtual worlds – Second Life. This contribution  describes the communication options provided by  a 3-D online environment like Second Life, how  companies  can  use  such  environments  in  their  innovation processes and to what extent Second  Life helps companies to position themselves as  innovators.  VIRTUAL 3-D WORLDS  Virtual  3-D  worlds  are  “immersive,  three-di- mensional, multi-media, multi-person simulation  environments, where each participant adopts an  alter ego and interacts with other participants in  real time. World activity persists even if a player  is  off-line“   Wagner,  2008 .  In  terms  of  their  appearance, they can mimic the real world, but  may also represent fantasy worlds. The common  feature of all virtual worlds is that, because they  are realized in digital form, they are not necessarily  subject to any of the physical laws of reality. In  the case of Internet-based virtual worlds, this is  supplemented by the fact that they can be accessed  online at any time, from anywhere in the world. According to Frédéric Cavazza  2007  virtual  worlds can be allocated to one of four forms of use:                  Social: worlds in which the main focus is  on community building; Game: worlds that first and foremost serve  online gaming; Entertainment:  worlds  consisting  of  mu- sic, videos and films; Business:  worlds  that  specifically  fulfill  business  purposes,  including  worlds  used  for  the  exchange  and  sale  of  goods  or  to  simulate training.  These  four  categories   see  Figure  1   can  overlap in places, since a single world can serve  more than one use aspect. The virtual 3-D world  Second Life lies at the interface between all four  areas, as it combines social interaction, gaming,  entertainment, and business applications.  Second Life is an interactive 3-D online envi- ronment, which is not restricted to any specific  subject matter and was created entirely by its us- ers. It was set up in America in 1999 by Philip  Rosedale, but did not go online until June 2003.  Since then, it has undergone a continuous process  of further development. In this world, users can  create virtual landscapes and objects  buildings,  apartments, items of clothing, etc.  and interact  with one another in a broad variety of ways  chats,  games, trading, organizing events, etc. . Anyone  wishing to use Second Life has to register online,  install a free software package and configure their  own  avatar. The  avatar  can  be  personalized  in  such detail using more than one hundred param- eters that users can replicate their own individu- al  personality  and  appearance  in  a  way  that  is  extremely true-to-life. Users can move through  the virtual world and communicate with others  via their avatar. Those who wish, in addition, to  own  land  and  create  their  own  items  have  to  purchase premium membership for 9.95 US Dol- lar per month  Linden Lab, 2010b .  Despite dwindling membership numbers since  2007, Second Life is considered to be the most   71   Figure 1. Categorization of virtual worlds.  Cavazza, 2007. Used with permission   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  important 3-D world of its kind, both in terms of  its profile and the number of users. More than  1.4 million residents logged-in worldwide within  a 60-day period  as per May 2010, Linden Lab,  2010a . The majority of users are male, below the  age of thirty and characterized by a high degree of  affinity with computers  Fittkau & Maaß, 2007 .  In addition to individuals – and due largely to in- tense media interest in 2007 – companies, research  institutes,  private  and  government  institutions  can also be found in Second Life. In addition to  companies like Adidas, BMW, IBM, Sony and  Vodafone,  Research  Institutes  of  the  German  Fraunhofer-Society,  the  University  of  the Arts  Berlin, Greenpeace, the German federal state of  Baden-Württemberg, the Swedish consulate and  many more all have or had a Second Life presence. Second Life offers its users a wide range of  development and activity options, enabling them  to create their own content and interact with other  users. The operators behind Second Life, Linden  Lab, have not specified any differentiated gaming  scenario, fixed rules, conditions or overarching  purpose – indeed, quite the opposite: the inhabit- ants are free to design the platform according to   their own ideas, interests and objectives, and can  create their own games with no restrictions as to  the size and genre within this world. Thus, not  only a large number of role-playing communi- ties, each with their own sets of rules, but also  numerous fantasy, puzzle, problem-solving and  strategy games have developed in which users  can set out on adventures and search for treasure.  There are also spheres in which weapons may be  used to stage “Ego Shooter” games or murderous  chases. On account of the fact that Second Life  is deliberately used for relaxation and for actions  with no specific purpose, the world has some of  the characteristics of a game  Huizinga, 1939  in  a Computer-generated three-dimensional setting.  Overall, however, it embodies more an Internet- based infrastructure platform with user-generated  content rather than a traditional game.  Furthermore, Second Life is open to targeted  use for commercial ideas. It has a complete eco- nomic  cycle,  in  which  goods  and  services  can  be produced and traded with the Linden Dollar   L$  as its own currency. This virtual money can  be purchased on stock markets and, in turn, ex- changed for real currency. The exchange rate is   72   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  approximately 260 Linden Dollars to 1 US Dollar   as per February 2010, Linden Research, 2010 .  In October 2008, turnover totaled more than 22  million US Dollars  Linden Research, 2008 . The  option of exchanging the virtual gaming money  into real money has led to the creation of various  forms of income in and around Second Life. The  platform itself constitutes a distribution channel,  as avatars can sell virtual and real products direct  to other avatars. To this end, sales branches and  flagship stores have been set up in-world, and on- line market places for Second Life products have  even been created outside the platform, including  ww.xstreetsl.com  English  and www.slmarket.de   German . Furthermore, the advertising commu- nication opportunities mean that it is also possible  to achieve indirect income in Second Life.  SECOND LIFE AS A  COMMUNICATION PLATFORM  Not only private individuals, but also companies,  associations, educational and research institutes  utilize Second Life as a communication medium  that can be used in a multitude of ways: for re- cruitment events, staff meetings, product presen- tations, counseling interview, to run courses and  workshops, as an e-learning tool, for image and  marketing purposes, as a sales area, or as a test area  for experiments and scientific studies. In so doing,  companies not only create virtual products, events  and advertising to support internal and external  communication, but also employee avatars and  virtual company representative offices.  Employee Avatars  Employees can use avatars to complete tasks virtu- ally. Avatars can interact in real time by simulating  body language, in writing via a chat window and  orally via Voice Chat. Thus, companies can use  Second Life to carry out consultation and sales  meetings, to exchange ideas with customers, run   internal training events or to bring together work- ing groups that are scattered across the globe. The  IT company IBM, for example, began its virtual  involvement in October 2006 with a staff meet- ing,  which  was  also  attended  by  CEO  Samuel  Palmisano via his avatar. Since then, IBM has  provided  a  significant  proportion  of  customer  services in Second Life, since some solutions are  easier to explain using 3-D than per telephone or  e-mail  Wilkens, 2006 . German energy provider  EnBW also uses Second Life for customer sup- port purposes. Customers can log their electricity  meter reading with a virtual member of service  staff and obtain advice on tariffs and products.  The advantages of this are manifold: it involves  less time than real meetings and there are no travel  expenses whatsoever. The feeling of actually be- ing in the same place is greater than in telephone  conferences, on account of the visual presence of  the participants. The visual aspect furthermore  makes it possible to use static, moving and, in  particular, three-dimensional diagrams. Moreover,  Second Life is independent of time or place, that  is, it can be used anywhere in the world, 365 days  a year at any time of the day or night. In addition,  the potential anonymity – users are not required  to state a real user name or authentic data when  setting up their profile – means that participants  may act more freely and thus provide the com- pany with more open, critical feedback than they  otherwise would.  Company Representations  A number of companies have set up not only virtual  company headquarters, but also entire islands to  bring their company, products and services closer  to the interest public. Often, they serve image- building and marketing purposes to equal parts.  Thus, these islands comprise a mixture of brand  world,  event  platform,  interactive  showroom,  sales point, service point and meeting place. The  record company Sony BMG, for instance, invited  fans from all over the world to virtual concerts   73   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  the communication can furthermore be country- specific and run at certain times. Personalization  like this facilitates greater attention and improved  advertising impact. This is due not least to the fact  that advertising messages may be experienced in  a more emotional and positive light in a playful  environment.  REQUIREMENTS FOR  INNOVATION COMMUNICATION  The opportunities for communication and interac- tion in virtual 3-D worlds, such as Second Life,  can also be used for the purposes of innovation  communication. The concept of innovation com- munication addresses a relatively new field within  the area of corporate communication. The term was  coined and the concept developed and promoted  by  German researchers from the University of  Hohenheim and University of Leipzig. In their  understanding – which we adopt here – innovation  communication is defined “as symbolic interac- tions between organizations and their internal and  external stakeholders, dealing with new products,  services, and technologies”  Mast, Huck, & Zer- faß, 2005; Mast & Zerfaß, 2005; Zerfaß, Sandhu,  & Huck, 2004 . It covers all systematic commu- nication activities with the objective of fostering  technological,  economic  and  social  novelties;  this  includes  activities  such  as  communicating  the novelty itself, creating an understanding and  trust in it, influencing its socially shared meaning  pattern, and positioning the organization behind  it as an innovator  Zerfaß, 2009 .  Even  though  innovation  communication  is  a field of activity in corporate communication,  it requires its own methods and concepts to be  tailored to the special features of novelties. As  studies show  Mast, et al., 2005; Zerfaß, Swaran,  & Huck, 2004 , the challenge lies in the fact that  new ideas and inventions are difficult to explain:  for the most part they are complex and abstract,  while their benefits and final target groups are   on its “Media Island”, advertising stars like Justin  Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, as well as sell- ing their music. Fashion label American Apparel,  meanwhile, sells its clothing both in virtual stores  on Lerappa Island and in the real world. Other  well-known companies such as BMW, Amazon  and TUI hoped to gain a greater media presence  through their involvement in Second Life, resulting  in an increase in popularity and a positive image  transfer, since this proves that they are actively  involved in a modern and innovative environment.  Another reason for many was to gain experience  in the professional use of a 3-D online world at  an early stage, to equip them for the opportunities  and challenges of three-dimensional Internet. As  a result of the wane in media interest, however,  many companies soon left Second Life.  In-World Advertising  A widespread form of communication in Second  Life  is  the  running  of  advertising  campaigns:  in-world advertising. Usually, standard forms of  advertising are employed. Forms used in-world  include  posters,  adverts,  promotional  films,  sponsoring and mobile advertising media  head- up  displays,  signboards,  rucksacks .  German  insurance company Gothaer used an advertising  poster in its search for qualified employees for  office and fieldwork, which linked users directly  to the careers pages of its website.  Media agencies specialized in virtual worlds  have already been set up, including The Other- land Group, the Inworld Advertising Network,  YOUin3D.com and Second Promotion. They also  offer behavior-based advertising campaigns. This  is one of the huge advantages of Second Life, since  here advertising can be integrated in a targeted  fashion pursuant to specific criteria, and replaced  as and when necessary. With the help of fixed  user accounts, session cookies and IP-addresses,  advertising can be personalized and systematically  tailored to the interests of any given member. As  logged-in users can also be geographically located,   74   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  initially unclear. Mainly because of their novelty,  there is a lack of examples and experiences that  could be used to explain their meaning and use.  Thus, one task of innovation communication is to  anchor a clear, positive image of the new product,  service, process, or technology and its added value  in the minds of relevant stakeholders. People must  be given the opportunity to acquaint themselves  with it and to trust the innovative power of the  company  behind  it.  Moreover,  communicative  interactions  between  the  organization  and  its  audiences  need  to  establish  social  practices  of  the innovation. This is important as “innovation  is more about creating meanings than it is about  creating artifacts”  Toumi, 2002 .  This  means  innovation  communication  is  not  simply  transmitting  information  about  a  new  product  or  service  to  relevant  stakehold- ers, as the focus of prior studies in innovation  management and marketing would suggest  e.g.  Mohr, Sengupta, & Slater, 2009; Trommsdorff &  Steinhoff, 2007 . Rather, from a social science  perspective,  innovation  communication  is  also  about creating common patterns of meaning and  establishing joint social practices  Zerfaß, 2005b,  2009 . Accordingly, an innovation communica- tion approach which emotionalizes and entertains  and  which  visualizes  and  presents  the  specific  uses, benefits, and meanings of the new product  or service in a multi-sensual, experiential way is  considered the most promising  Mast, Huck, &  Zerfaß, 2006 . Novelties demand simple, logical  examples and an appealing, clear language  Mast,  et al., 2006 . Embedding in stories  storytelling ,  linking with current trends, gripping dramaturgy  and sensationalism are also considered helpful   Mast & Zerfaß, 2005; Mast, Huck, & Zerfaß,  2006; Hoewner, Jansen, Jantke 2008; Fink 2009;  Huck-Sandhu 2009 .  Experience-based forms of communication in  the real sphere and product samples for testing are  particularly well-suited to fulfilling these require- ments. For reasons of time and cost, however,  these are often dispensed with. The virtual world   Second Life provides several opportunities to fill  this gap. While it may not be possible to actually  touch,  taste,  or  smell  new  products,  these  can  nevertheless be depicted true-to-life and simulated  in virtual processes. As in the real world, inter- ested parties can, through their avatars, actively  try out new products and procedures and enter  into dialogue with the companies or innovators  behind them. This is considerably easier, faster,  more cost-effective and entails less risk in a virtual  environment. This is significant for the manage- ment of innovations, since time and budget are  seen as the most crucial factors for success.  However, communication is key to making an  innovation system work  Nordfors, 2004, 2006 .  An innovation system is built up by a complex set  of interactions between those people, enterprises,  institutions, research bodies, investors etc. that  are essential to an innovation process  Lundvall,  1985 . Therefore, it is vital that all internal and  external stakeholder groups be incorporated. Close  collaboration between employee communication,  marketing and public relations  PR  is also very  important  see Figure 2 .  The objectives of innovation communication  differ according to the stakeholder group  Zerfaß,  2005b, 2009 . The purposes of internal innovation  communication are primarily to support employ- ees, but also to assist research and development   R&D  partners in the search for ideas and con- cepts, in initiating dialogue and enhancing prod- uct and process development. The task of innova- tion marketing is to optimize the introduction to  the market and, thus, the diffusion and adoption  of new products among customers, partners and  competitors.  The  purpose  of  innovation  PR,  meanwhile, is to ensure an innovation-friendly  environment  throughout  the  entire  innovation  process in order to avoid potential opposition from  decision-makers in politics, interest groups and  the mass media.  75   Figure 2. Communication and stakeholders in the innovation process.  Adapted from Zerfaß, 2005a   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  INNOVATION COMMUNICATION  IN SECOND LIFE  To date, the metaverse has not been explored as a  platform for innovation communication. Current  investigations  into  innovation  communication  analyze conceptual frameworks  Nordfors, 2006;  Zerfaß, 2005b; Zerfaß & Huck, 2007 , the inter- linking  between  corporate  communication  and  journalism  Mast et al., 2005; Mast et al., 2006  as  well as different communication instruments and  formats  Zerfaß & Möslein, 2009 . Furthermore,  there  are  some  studies  which  explore  the  use  and potential of 3-D virtual worlds in innovation  management. Several papers investigate the virtual  product  experience  and  customer  participation  in  designing  and  manufacturing  new  products   Chase, 2008; Franz & Wolkinger, 2003; Füller  & Matzler, 2007 . Studies using the terms “Ava- tar based Innovation” or “Virtual Co-Creation”,  meanwhile, analyze the challenges and opportuni- ties of Open Innovation approaches with respect  to the online integration of customers  Kohler et  al., 2009 , amongst are also case studies which  describe the use of internet platforms and Web  2.0 in corporate innovation practice  Erler et al.  2009;  Helfrich  2009;  Roschek  2009;  Schläffer   2009 . Other investigations focus on marketing  aspects of 3-D worlds  Gierke & Müller, 2008;  Hemp, 2006  including public relations, adver- tising  Barnes, 2007; Thomas & Stammermann,  2007  and branding  O’Guinn, Allen, & Semenik,  2008 . However, to date, there has not yet been  any investigation into which role virtual worlds  can play for companies and their communication  practices in innovation ecosystems.  Our  research  shows  that  several  companies  already use Second Life in their innovation com- munication. They use the virtual world during all  phases of the innovation process, both for product  communication and for corporate communication.  The following examples illustrate how, with the  help of Second Life, new ideas can be generated,  new products developed, tested and marketed and  the organizations behind these products portrayed  as innovative. At the same time, we will evaluate  the extent to which the virtual 3-D world is suit- able for innovation communication.  Generation of Ideas and  Development of Prototypes  Second Life serves as a development and testing  laboratory for new ideas, products and services   76   The 3-D Innovation Sphere   Kohler et al., 2009; Ondrejka, 2007 . The reason  behind this is obvious: with manageable expendi- ture in terms of staff and costs, companies can use  Second Life to collect ideas, simulate products and  present them to the target group. In this way, com- panies can find out whether the product innovation  meets with approval among potential partners, co- producers and customers without any of the costs  and risks entailed in a real physical introduction  to the market  Bonsu & Darmody, 2008 . Second  Life also enables products to be developed further  in a collaborative process, in line with the “Open  Innovation” approach  Chesbrough, 2006 . The  lifelike, three-dimensional presentation of prod- uct developments and the option of being able to  test these virtually, generally facilitates mutual  understanding. Possible alterations can be taken  into account at an early stage of development at  a correspondingly low cost. The product designs  can subsequently be implemented in real life and  sent to selected target groups  lead users  to test  their potential in the real world.  Reebok provides a good example of this. The  sporting goods manufacturer allows its custom- ers  to  individually  design  their  shoes  –  purely  virtually – for their avatar and, if they like them,  as real one-off designs for themselves  Tedeschi,  2007 .  The  Reebok  shoe  configurator  allows  individual components such as the sole, tongue,  laces and upper to be designed in a variety of  ways  mainly with respect to the color combina- tions . By making the customer a “Co-Producer”  or “Prosumer”  Toffler, 1980 , the manufacturer  was able to identify trends and requirements at an  early stage. The logistics and transport services  provider Deutsche Post investigated new design  and distribution ideas in Second Life by allowing  visitors to create their own works of art on “Post  Island”, to take photographs and send them as a  postcard to anywhere in the world  Jacob, 2008 .  The QUELLE Innovation Initiative also appeals  to its customers’ “inner inventor” and in March  2007 launched the first virtual laboratory in the  world for inventors and creative individuals, sup-  porting them in the development of their ideas  into market-ready products. This “ErfinderLand”  provides information on patent procedures and  marketing, a partner search facility for ideas and a  sculpture garden in which users can evaluate cur- rent projects  Quelle InnovationsPartner, 2007b .  In addition, inventor congresses and competitions  are organized, e.g. expert chats on the subjects of  inventing, designing and setting up a company   Quelle InnovationsPartner, 2007a .  The ideas and feedback in the Second Life  community are also utilized by American hotel  chain Starwood Hotels to develop and beta-test  new products. The prototype of its new brand, the  boutique hotel “Aloft”, was first created by the  company in the second world in the fall of 2006.  Avatars were able to evaluate sample rooms, as- sess structural plans and have a say in the fittings,  interior design and color palette used  Jana, 2006 .  Since then, the feedback collected has flowed into  the real construction of these new design hotels,  which are characterized by loft-style rooms, high  ceilings, huge windows and public areas reminis- cent of lounges. The first Aloft Hotel was opened  in Montreal in June 2008, and the plan is to build  a further 500 hotels by 2015  Seipp, 2008 .  Nevertheless, those wishing to generate and test  ideas and new developments in Second Life must  always be aware of the risk that competitors will  quickly be able to copy them, since confidentiality  of information is not sufficiently guaranteed in  this environment. The highly sensitive nature of  novelties and innovations at the pre-market stage  means a protected development environment may  well be the better choice in some cases.  Product Communication:  Marketing New Products  Second  Life  can  also  serve  to  promote  fully- developed  product  innovations  on  two  levels:  potential customers can view the products in a  three-dimensional form  presentation level  and  interact with the products or test them virtually   77   The 3-D Innovation Sphere   action  level .  Adidas,  for  instance,  created  a  virtual store where the newest models from the  current collection could be tested on a training  course and purchased for avatars. The sporting  goods  supplier  sold  more  than  20,000  virtual  pairs of shoes, thereby boosting real sales  Hofer,  2007 . In 2007, Sony Ericsson set up an interac- tive replica of its CeBIT trade fair stand on its  own  island  in  Second  Life,  where  all  product  novelties could be examined in detail and avatars  were able to request advice from specially-trained  Sony Ericsson promoters  Sony Ericsson, 2007,  see Figure 3 .  Three-dimensional, multimedia realization of  this kind allows for a realistic presentation and  improved understanding of the form and dimen- sions of new products. This approach is particu- larly compatible with complex innovations that  require  some  explanation.  This  is  why  energy  company EnBW uses Second Life to outline its  innovative energy generation systems, including  a geothermal power plant. Second Life allows the  boundaries of physical reality to be deliberately  crossed. Thus, computer manufacturer Dell cre- ated a huge computer in Second Life, which was  the size of a high-rise building in the virtual world  and could be entered and interactively discovered  by avatars. The altered dimensions made it pos-  sible to display elements that cannot ordinarily  be seen with the naked eye, making them com- prehensible  and  opening  up  an  entirely  new  perspective  Second Opinion, 2006 .  In addition to the true-to-life presentation, the  advantage of Second Life is that innovations can  be embedded in use scenarios and easily simulated.  This not only highlights the product benefits and  added value for the target group, but also means  that immersion here is far greater than on many  other  Internet  platforms.  For  example,  the  lat- est model launched by a car manufacturer can  be experienced in Second Life in a much more  direct fashion than in a vehicle configurator on  a website. A Second Life visitor would be more  likely  to  say  that  he she  had  “test  driven”  the  new car following a virtual test drive. Through  this ostensibly direct handling of the object, the  users are given a sense of having directly expe- rienced  it.  Reservations  regarding  the  product  can  be  reduced  or  even  eliminated  entirely,  as  there is no risk involved in testing the products  and they are not exposed to damage or wear and  tear. However, despite the technical possibilities  available, it is simply not possible to adequately  replicate haptic and olfactory experience and real  optical and acoustic experience on a 3-D platform.  Matthias Schultze, Head of Customer Relationship   Figure 3. Customer advisor and CeBIT 2007 trade fair stand of Sony Ericsson in Second Life.  Sony  Ericsson Mobile Communications International AB., 2007. Used with permission   78   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  Management and New Media at EnBW, sums it  up as follows: “Second Life is only suitable for  presenting new products to a limited degree, since,  despite ongoing improvements, the platform is  still far too complicated, too unstable and far too  time-consuming  to  use  for  the  majority  of  the  population”  Schultze, 2008 . This means there  is even greater need to anchor product innova- tions in the real world. Close links between the  virtual and the real world are thus a commonly  used approach.  To market product novelties, Deutsche Post  delivered  packages  of  samples  containing  a  changing selection of branded items, including  products from Nestlé, Wilkinson, Zewa, skincare  brand Dove, Burda publishing house, online video  rental store Netleih and the mail service company  DHL. Anyone who requested a TESTBOX on Post  Island in Second Life received a free package of  innovations relating to alternating topics such as  wellbeing, entertainment or cosmetics with real  products  to  try  out  at  home.  “The  TESTBOX  informs our customers about the latest trends in  the various subject areas” says Claudia Schäfer,  Head  of  the  Innovative  Products  Division  at  Deutsche Post  Deutsche Post World Net, 2007 .  Well-known manufacturers used this method to  publicize  product  novelties,  to  test  their  sales  potential and obtain feedback. Users could leave  comments on the products on an evaluation page.  Corporate Communication: Image  Profiling as an Innovative Player  In addition to the communication of new ideas  and products, companies use Second Life first  and foremost in the course of their PR work. If a  company is active in the area of new, innovative  media, it is likely to be perceived by the public as  an innovative player. Even the creation of a virtual  representation  in  itself,  or  the  implementation  of special 3-D web measures, often garners free  media coverage. For many companies, this was  the original motivation behind their involvement   in Second Life. ”Back then, at the beginning of  2007, the fact that we were here first enabled us  to achieve really excellent and broad press com- munication”, remembers Matthias Schultze, “and  we were able to link the concepts of energy and  innovative energy supply in Second Life with the  EnBW brand”  Schultze, 2008 .  Thus, with the help of a virtual world, the im- age of an innovative player can be strengthened  twofold: first, by innovative communication via  that medium  how ; and second, by communicating  innovations through that medium  what . In order  to consistently present itself as an innovation leader  using this modern form of Internet presence, the  energy company regularly runs special promo- tions. It started with a football strip sponsoring  campaign, then a discussion group involving Sec- ond Life participants; not long after, the permanent  virtual branch office was established: Its purpose  and main activities include interactive exhibits,  film screenings, recruitment events, lecture series  and  quiz  shows. The  EnBW  EnergyPark  com- bines innovative communication measures with  communication about company energy innova- tions, which can be explored interactively in the  integrated Innovation Center  see Figure 4 . The  EnergyPark encompasses a  the “EnergyTower”, a  replica of Europe’s largest lightning machine from  the phæno Science Center in Wolfsburg, which  explains the phenomenon of electrical surges in  spectacular style, using a Tesla-Transformator with  sparks flying off it; b  the “GeothermieCube”, in  which visitors can explore the varying heat lev- els within the earth and find out about the use of  geothermal energy as a renewable energy source  in the course of a virtual journey to the centre of  the earth; and c  the “EnergyGlobe”, a globe that  simulates the changes occurring around the planet  as a result of CO2 emissions, population growth  and climate change. Visitors can also gain an in- sight into how modern power plants work  CO2  reduced coal power plant, wave power plant etc. ,  in “EnyCity” for an energy-efficient city of the  future, as well as a large number of tips and trick   79   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  to help save energy.

In addition, every  month EnBW runs a quiz with new questions on  everything to do with energy, where players can  win Linden Dollars and increasingly large volumes  of traffic are being generated: more than 75,000  visitors have taken part in the quiz since autumn  2007  EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG,  2009b . The quantitative number of contacts in  Second  Life,  however,  remains  relatively  low.  The  EnergyPark  has  around  250  avatars  visit- ing daily, while the EnBW company homepage  had approximately 15,000 visitors daily in 2007   Hildebrand,  2008 .  Seen  in  qualitative  terms,  however, it is assumed that customer contact in  virtual worlds is considerably more intensive and,  thus, has more long-lasting effects.  Deutsche  Post  also  values  Web  3-D  as  an  ideal environment within which to build an in- novative market presence. “What was to the fore  in our involvement in Second Life was that we  are able to communicate regarding our proven  products, brands and services in a completely new  way,  providing  new,  creative  perspectives  for  communication. We wanted to use this to empha- size our position as an innovative communications  service  provider”,  says  Björn  Jacob,  project  leader for Second Life in the Market Communica-  tion Division at the group  Jacob, 2008 . In May  2007, the company opened its virtual presence  – a true-to-life replica of its headquarters in Bonn  – and tested new ideas by means of interactive  promotions and competitions. At all times efforts  were made to connect both worlds, in order to  provide added value both online and offline, e.g.  with the delivery of test boxes and postcards in  the  real  world.  Other  promotions  included  the  “Speed Academy Racing Cup”, the virtual winter  games, the adventure game “on the trail of the  mysterious stamp” where players had to prove  their skill, endurance and ability to multitask, and  the sculpture competition “Summer, Sun, and the  Travel Bug“, where avatars could create works  of art and postcard designs in the Post Tower’s  atelier. The best designers were rewarded with  the  prize  of  virtual  land  and  Linden  Dollars.  Deutsche Post itself said that these promotions  were in great demand among inhabitants of Sec- ond Life, yet actual use remained far lower than  expected, despite the huge marketing efforts. Only  a couple of hundred avatars visited Post Island  weekly, with a total of slightly more than 10,000  guests over 9 months. The number of postcards  sent was also only in the three-figure range per  week. Despite the lack of response, Deutsche Post  clearly demonstrated how companies can display   Figure 4. EnBW EnergyTower and EnBW EnergyGlobe in Second Life  EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg  AG, 2009a. Used with permission   80   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  their innovative power and imbue their brand with  emotion by becoming involved in Second Life.  With the sending of postcards the company pro- vided the first communication service of its kind  between the virtual and the real world, delivering  “as securely swiftly and dependably as always to  anywhere in the world”  Jacob, 2008 . By linking  traditional, physical deliveries with an interface  in  a  modern  virtual  3-D  world,  Deutsche  Post  successfully  positioned  itself  as  an  innovative  logistics company company  see Figure 5 .  Many  other  companies  use  the  continually  growing offers of Second Life, which are also  improving in terms of quality, to present them- selves to the interested public as innovative and  modern. A number of educational institutes and  seminar organizers relocated their teaching events,  workshops  and  courses  in  the  artificial  world   Billig, 2009 . EnBW is also investigating how  Second Life can be used for additional fields of  action, e.g. for e-learning, conferences, internal  seminars,  and  team  meetings  in  internal  com- munication as well as for e-recruiting in person- nel procurement. The positive public perception  and the successful positioning of the energy com- pany as a Second Life expert made a significant  contribution to generating the necessary interest  in the company, even cross-sector. “If one expe- riences certain success with a topic, people are   more likely to go along with it. Internally, we see  this in the fact that areas that do not have any  direct links with virtual worlds now are prepared  to look into additional forms of use together with  us”, says Matthias Schultze  Schultze, 2008 .  However, new web technologies are not given  a fixed place in the communications mix of all  players. Following Adidas  summer 2007 , Mer- cedes  spring 2008  and Reuters  winter 2008 ,  Deutsche Post also withdrew from the parallel  world in spring 2008: “It became clear to us that  we had largely exhausted the possibilities within  Second  Life”,  says  Björn  Jacob  justifying  this  decision  Jacob, 2008 . A group representative  furthermore  explained  their  withdrawal  on  the  basis of the fact that the company’s own offers  were not being used frequently enough, the design  possibilities of the platform too limited, operation  too complicated and the technical requirements in  terms of computer systems too high  Hildebrand,  2008 . Many organizations entered Second Life  with high expectations which were raised by a lot  of enthusiastic praises in the media around 2007,  but they also withdrew fast when they realized that  Second Life needs to be used properly and that  this platform is only one interesting channel for  digital communication amongst others.

Used with permission   81   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  Virtual  advisors  provide  important  persuasive  work through their direct customer contact. The  virtual service offerings must correspond to that  available in the real world. This, however, demands  constant support in real life. To facilitate close  communication  between  the  company  and  the  visitors, EnBW installed feedback boxes on its  island, set up an EnBW-Group, whose members  can be informed via Internet mailing lists, and  operates an avatar that actively approaches guests,  answering questions and providing suggestions.  The effort involved in this is much greater than for  normal Internet, also to ensure that the presence  in Web 3-D is always up to date.  It is also important that visitors are provided  with an entertaining, action-based program. Inter- active, varied and new promotions all the time are  very important to the success of a representation.  Being up to date is a vital element. According to  EnBW’s experiences, comparably short update  cycles of approximately 2-3 months are required.  However, these promotions do not always have to  be groundbreaking. “Recently I came to the con- clusion that it is the really simple things that work  here”, advises Matthias Schultze, “many simple  mechanisms  will  also  work  on  a  platform  like  this”  Schultze, 2008 . Providing new highlights  regularly appears to be more important. The energy  company held a series of talks in 2007 for example:  every three weeks there was a presentation on a  specific main topic followed by an opportunity  for discussion. Figures recorded by Deutsche Post  furthermore demonstrate that numbers of visitors  can be boosted significantly through interactive  promotions  Jacob, 2008 . What must be kept in  mind in this context is that the offers are tailored  to the technical features of the platform. Projects  requiring elaborate graphics and staging larger in- world events are possible only to a limited extent  with the technology currently available.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR  SUCCESSFUL INNOVATION  COMMUNICATION IN  VIRTUAL WORLDS  Companies  use  Second  Life  primarily  as  an  innovative research laboratory: to test out new  ideas, to experiment with modern communica- tion  methods,  to  try  a  new  form  of  marketing  presence and thereby position themselves as an  innovative company. Some companies, bolstered  by the media hype and the fear of missing out  on a development, were able only to gain a brief  and temporary insight into the opportunities and  limits in virtual worlds. Others are still involved  today in new projects, testing the innovative and  sustainable  options  within  the  online  world  to  actively promote their own development. Below,  we summarize a number of recommendations as  to how a company’s own actions and representa- tions in the course of innovation communication  can  be  successfully  used  to  gain  new  visitors.  Strategic planning, implementation and control  of such activities is even more important since  Second Life, while it is one of the most popular  3-D online platforms, still has not been able to  reach a mass audience.  A virtual representation should be every bit  as “alive” as real life. A successful presence thus  demands a dialog-oriented, personal support, con- tinual maintenance, ongoing further developments  and above all an apparent added value – both for  the individual visitor and for the virtual world per  se. This requires that a company not only knows  its target group, but also the field in which that  target group is active  Mediaedge:cia, 2005 .  Added  value  can  be  created  e.g.  through  a  personal contact person in the virtual company  presence, through permanently available attrac- tions and up-to-date additional services. What is  important is that companies not only represent  themselves with virtual buildings, but also that  they are present with avatars. They should reveal  themselves personally to their visitors, enter into  active dialog with them and be constantly present.   82   The 3-D Innovation Sphere  CONCLUSION AND  FUTURE RESEARCH  The  suggestions  put  forward  here  present,  by  means of an example, the potential and the limits  to innovation communication in virtual worlds  like Second Life. The study does not, however,  claim to be comprehensive.  It can be assumed that 3-D online worlds and  the opportunities that can be realized therein will  develop further. They are still at the beginning  of a huge process of development, but they have  the potential to develop into the Internet of the  future in the course of the next few years. Those  who already test and learn to understand these  worlds today are at any advantage. Björn Jacob  also confirms that, despite its withdrawal from  Second Life, Deutsche Post intends “to continue  to intensively explore the development of 3-D  worlds and, when the time is right, to become  involved again”  Jacob, 2008 . With increasing  bandwidth, growth in Internet usage, improved  technology,  more  straightforward  operation,  inter-operability between worlds, growing media  interest and an entertainment and games industry  that is beginning to become established, companies  are set to invest more in virtual worlds. There is  already huge potential for greater use: by 2011,  around  90  percent  of  German  households  will  have an Internet connection, around 80 percent  will  have  broadband  by  2015   Medienboard  Berlin-Brandenburg, 2008 .  Despite the fact that the number of traditional  media users and gamers is likely to remain con- siderably larger, it can be assumed that virtual 3-D  worlds will establish themselves in future as an  important communication and information plat- form, thereby providing additional opportunities  for  innovation  communication.  New  visualiza- tion technologies will initially result in improved  graphics with almost photo-real images. Further  developments will show which communications  platforms are able to establish themselves on the  market and whether interfaces between the various  platforms will develop, allowing users to switch   with ease from one world to the next. However,  virtual worlds are able to meet specific communi- cation demands and to reach specific stakeholders,  but their potential should be estimated realistically  to avoid possible new disappointments.  It follows that companies will have to continue  to familiarize themselves with the forms of com- munication, presentation and interaction in Web  3-D in good time, in order to be in a position  to fully exploit the opportunities that arise in a  profitable manner. In doing so, the use of new  Web technologies in innovation communication  must always be carefully weighed up. Thus, there  is a need for ongoing systematic exploration of  virtual  worlds  in  media,  communications  and  economic sciences.  REFERENCES  Barnes, S.  2007 .

KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS  Communication  Platform:  Describes  a  sphere of communication that is relatively freely  accessible to all individuals and organizations and  in which the participating players can communi- cate, interact and exchange ideas with one another  about various topics and opinions. These spheres  may be constituted by different communication  mediums and interaction forms including physi- cal and virtual means, e.g. by face-to-face talks,  events,  online-mediated  forms   blogs,  virtual  worlds, online-communities , mass-medial forms   radio, television, newspapers  and others.  Innovation: Describes all technical, economic  and  social  novelties  that  successfully  establish  themselves  on  the  market  or  within  an  orga- nization,  are  acknowledged  as  being  new  and  encompass a change in social practices. This can  apply  to  new  products,  services,  technologies,   processes, structures, business models etc. The  word “innovation” literally means “novelty” or  “renewal” and is derived from the Latin “novus”  meaning “new” and “innovatio” meaning “a new  creation”.  Innovation Communication: Describes all  systematic  communication  activities  –  carried  out by organizations with their internal and ex- ternal stakeholders – which have the objective of  fostering  new  products,  services,  technologies,  processes,  ideas,  and  concepts.  This  includes  strategic activities in all stages of an innovation  process, such as communicating the novelty itself,  supporting its further development, influencing  its socially shared meaning pattern, creating an  understanding and trust in it, and positioning the  organization behind it as an innovator. Innovation  communication is a field of activity in corporate  communication.  Innovation  Management:  Describes  the  systematic planning, steering and controlling of  innovations in organizations. The process includes  several steps, amongst them  1  the search for  and generation of new ideas and concepts and the  evaluation thereof,  2  the development of new  ideas and concepts into new products and services,  and  3  the implementation and diffusion of these  new products and services into the market.  New  Product  Communication     Market  Entry Communication of Innovation: Describes  the communicative introduction of the innovation  to the market. The objective is to have a positive  effect on the diffusion and adaption of the novelty  among  the  target  groups,  thereby  helping  it  to  become successful.  Virtual Innovation Communication: Related  to all innovation communication activities, which  take place in computer-generated environments  respectively the Internet. This can take place in  all interactive mediums, such as e.g. in virtual  3-D worlds  Second Life, World of Warcraft etc. ,  blogs, forums and social networks.  87   88  Chapter  6  What’s Real?  Presence, Personality and Identity in   the Real and Online Virtual World  Benjamin Gregor Aas  University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands  ABSTRACT To understand virtual realities and the effect on its users, empirical research into a variety of social and  psychological domains has to be conducted in online virtual environments. It is argued that presence, the  experience of being-in-the-virtual-world, plays a key role in most psychological processes connected with  virtual worlds. A short overview of studies addressing personality, identity, emotions, and stereotypes  in virtual reality is given, to subsequently offer improved approaches, by using a setup that compares  participants on an individual level. Furthermore, potential cohort-differences are discussed; there is  reason to believe that people who have grown up with computers, Internet, and virtual worlds experience  and use virtual worlds differently than those who haven’t. Finally, it is hypothesized that virtual worlds  influence real life in a reciprocal loop, by shaping cognitive, psychological, and social processes of the  real world and – seemingly paradoxical – might even trigger experiencing the real as real.  INTRODUCTION  A lot has been written about  online  virtual reali- ties: their economic potential, their communicative  potential, their social potential, their therapeutic  potential and their psychological and cognitive  potential  and risk . On one hand, so called ‘im- mersionists’ believe that virtual realities function   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch006  as an entirely new world with their own features  of  social,  economic  and  psychological  aspects  that are to some extend different from the real  material world, potentially following their own  specific processes - I will denote the real material  world as ‘real world’ and online virtual worlds as  ‘virtual worlds’ throughout this chapter  Wadley,  2008; Turkle, 1995; Boellstorff, 2008 .

What’s Real?  other hand, there are the ‘augmentationists’. They  understand virtual worlds as an extension of the  real life, to which the aspect of virtuality is merely  added and argue that processes of social, economic  and psychological nature in virtual worlds function  the same way as in real life. They “expect people  to behave in the same way in the virtual environ- ment as they would in an equivalent real-world  situation”  Friedman, Steed & Slater, 2007b, p.  252 . To put it short, both sides agree that there  are  some  commonalities  and  some  differences  between the real and the virtual world, starting  off from the two extremes of a continuum.  This differentiation appears somewhat blurry,  for it does not add clarification, nor does it make  specific predictions about what is going on when  people enter the virtual world. A basic demand  one must have towards a concept or theory is not  fulfilled, namely that no strong conclusions can  be drawn from such a distinction. When it comes  to very basic aspects of personality, identity or  mood,  substantial  knowledge  about  potentially  existing differences between real life and virtual  life, is missing.  Central to a proper understanding of virtual  realities is the proper understanding of the real  world. One method that is widely used to achieve  this  understanding  is  the  empirical  scientific  method, which can be applied to virtual worlds as  well as to real life questions. This book chapter will  therefore try to give a short compilation of theories  that are most basic to the understanding of human  behavior in the virtual world. In a first step, the  very basic concept of presence, which underlies  all other experiences within virtual lifes, will be  discussed   How  real  is  the  virtual?  Do  people  experience  presence  in  virtual  environments? .  The focus will then be shifted on the psychology  of virtual worlds, especially personality, identity  and  emotion  aspects  of  virtual  worlds   second  step . Thirdly, an attempt will be made to predict  how virtuality influences real life in a reciprocal  loop, performing the step back from the virtual  life into the real life. This, it is analyzed, might   be  essential  to  understand  how  the  virtual  and  the real merge into one. Where possible, short  sketches for improvements of research in virtual  worlds will be given.  BACKGROUND  At the University of Amsterdam and many other  places, there is ongoing research concerning the  possibility to use virtual platforms for psycho- logical  therapeutic  interventions   Meyerbröker  &  Emmelkamp,  2010 .  To  give  such  research  and practical implementation a sound basis, it is  inevitable to understand underlying processes and  yield a sound conceptualization of what is going  on, when humans go virtual.  PRESENCE, PERSONALITY AND  IDENTITY IN THE REAL AND  ONLINE VIRTUAL WORLD  Presence in Virtual Reality  The  concept  of  presence  can  mainly  be  traced  back to 20th century philosophy. ‘Being-in-the- world’   in-der-Welt-sein   and  ‘being’   Dasein   add a basic structure of emotional authenticity  to the more interpretation- and thought-focused  philosophical approaches and trends of that time   Heidegger, 1927; 2006 . “The ‘production of pres- ence’ points to all kinds of events and processes  in which the impact that ‘present’ objects have  on human bodies is being initiated or intensified”   Gumbrecht, 2004, p. xiii . This is a more modern  version  of  how  everything  surrounding  us  not  only conveys meaning, but also always contains  an emotional  read ‘presence-like’  component.  In virtual worlds, ‘being-in-the-world’ receives  a new notion, raising the question to what extent  a mere digital and data-driven environment can  create such a feeling of presence.  89   What’s Real?  identifies with his avatar  proto-level , how well  the virtual world yields coherent and convincing  stimuli  core-level  and how smooth, immediate,  continuous and detailed interaction between avatar  and 3D-world is  extended-level .  An attempt to translate such conceptual consid- erations into the practical realm of a questionnaire  is undertaken by the Igroup Presence Question- naire  IPQ; Schubert, Friedmann & Regenbrecht,  1999;  2001 .  Using  linear  equation  modeling,  these authors find that a certain sense of being  in  the  virtual  environment  or  presence  is  best  reflected by three distinct factors, namely ‘spatial  presence’  feeling present in the virtual world ,  ‘realness’  consistency between virtual and real  world   and  ‘involvement’   being  concentrated  on the virtual world . As described by Riva et  al.  2004 , ‘spatial presence’ and ‘realness’ are  found back in the above mentioned integration  of presence layers, and ‘involvement’ is related  to focused conscious attention.  Empirical research on presence focuses mostly  on how presence mediates virtual world experi- ences  Do participants feel present in the virtual?   and very rarely on presence in the real world. As  described before, even in everyday life, people  supposedly experience different grades of pres- ence. Some studies use presence questionnaires  as  a  control  mechanism  when  running  experi- ments in virtual worlds or hypothesize about the  mediating  influence  of  presence  on  behavioral  outcome measures  e.g. Jin, 2009 . Surprisingly,  no  empirical  research  has  been  conducted  yet,  whereby similar situations in real and virtual life  are  tested  and  compared  in  terms  of  presence.  Such a simple comparison could clarify whether,  and if so, in what respect, presence differs in the  real and the virtual.  To have knowledge about the role of presence  is not only important per se, but also to draw the  right conclusions when comparing the real and  virtual worlds in terms of personality, identity and  emotion - the psychology of the virtual.  Riva,  Waterworth  and  Waterworth   2004   follow  Damasio’s  approach  of  subdividing  the  self into a proto-, core- and extended-self. They  apply this distinction to the concept of presence,  resulting, firstly, in a proto presence, which can  be described as the experience of ‘being’ an em- bodied person  self vs. non self . Secondly, a core  presence can be discriminated, which is the coher- ent, perceptual ‘being-in-the-world’, the stream  of outside reality we experience  self vs. present  external world . Thirdly, these entities interact in  an extended presence, the reflective, significance  creating ‘being-a-person’  self relative to present  external world . It is hypothesized that the overall  “experienced presence is mediated by the integra- tion of these three layers of presence […] and the  extent to which conscious attention is focused on  one layer”  Waterworth, Waterworth, Mantovani  & Riva, 2010, p. 8 . From these authors’ point  of view, the sketched approach can be applied  to  real  world  experiences  as  well  as  to  virtual  world experiences. An experienced gamer might  describe a situation in a 3-D game, where he is  totally sucked into the world and in ‘the flow’  of  the  virtual  reality. As  a  result,  even  though  the eliciting stimuli are merely virtual, he might  experience coherent real life bodily sensations.  When playing a couple of hours and accidentally  falling from a virtual skyscraper – even in a non- immersive 3-D game – it can occur that the gamer  senses his intestines cramp together. This person,  one might argue, has exported the three layers  of presence into the virtual world  the embodied  proto presence might be influencing his ‘guts’   and his attention is focused on virtual stimuli  the  experience of ‘flow’ . In other words, in the same  way the integration of the three presence layers in  real life can be distinguished and informs about the  experienced presence, the virtual presence can be  subdivided into the same three levels and follow  the same processes. From this conceptualization  one can predict how real a virtual world will appear  to a user. The sense of presence can be described  as the function of how well the online world user   90   What’s Real?  Psychology of Virtual Reality  Whereas presence is a relatively young concept,  emotion, identity and especially personality have  infiltrated scientific and everyday life very deeply.  A first conceptualization of personality and per- sonality differences draws back to ancient Greek  ideas of body fluids, introduced by Hippocrates,  that  were  supposed  to  influence  temperament.  Today, there are numerous theories and studies  circling around the very broad topic of personal- ity;  psychotherapists  even  use  a  whole  cluster  of personality disorders to understand peoples’  misbehavior and inability to adapt to their social  environment.  The  historic  idea  of  body  fluids  does not attract too much attention anymore; it  is,  nevertheless,  still  one  of  the  big  debates  in  psychology, whether the personality of a person  is mostly ‘hard-wired’ in its genetic code or a con- sequence of its social environment throughout life  and learned. Most researchers and therapists would  probably subscribe to the idea that personality is  a product of both, but would still find themselves  troubled  when  asked  about  the  flexibility  and  alterability of personality over time. In the field  of psychotherapy, a clear answer to this question  is necessary, to know how to treat patients with  a personality pathology; when it comes to virtual  worlds, the consequences are less dramatic, but it  remains astonishing that some online virtual world  users keep reporting to experience their avatars as  distinct from themselves and even ascribe them  an own, virtual personality. Most definitions see  personality as a stable and unchangeable concept  of the sum of the attributes of a person  Mischel,  1999 ;  so  it  seems  tautological  to  expect  an  incoherent personality between the real and the  virtual world.  In a recently published study, 34 participants  filled in a personality questionnaire twice, once  in a pen and paper version and once with their  personalized avatar in the online virtual reality  of Second Life on a virtual testing screen  Aas,  Meyerbröker & Emmelkamp, 2010 . Strikingly,   as can be seen in Figure 1, no significant differ- ences between the real life version and the virtual  version for any personality trait are found, even  though there was a half year delay between the  two tests. From this result, the authors conclude  that when it comes to extraversion, friendliness,  conscientiousness, neuroticism and development,  the virtual personality does not differ from the real  personality or, in other words, that there is no such  thing as a distinct virtual personality.  Even though this study yields interesting re- sults, it still has some drawbacks. There should  be, as a first point, larger samples; virtual realities  offer a great opportunity to easily gather data from  a highly diverse sample. Therefore, this study is  currently being conducted on a bigger scale via  internet and Second Life, but it is too early to  make statements about results.  Second,  one  could  argue  that  the  setup  of  the  study  is  only  of  correlational  nature.  In  a  true experiment, participants are supposed to be  manipulated in a certain way to make statements  about their expected behavior and test clear hy- potheses. Using the experimental approach, one  could  manipulate  e.g.  specific  emotions  using  computer- and text based paradigms which have  subsequent effect on negotiation behavior  Kleef,  De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004 . Eventual differences  in  outcome  behavior  between  the  real  life  and  virtual life situations might then be ascribed to a  lack of presence or differences between the virtual  and real personality. If there was something like a  virtual personality that differs from the real world,  the manipulation of specific emotions might pro- cess in different ways or remain domain specific. Third, one might possibly use the concept of  identity. Theories surrounding this concept allow  persons to carry a whole variety of identities, as  e.g.  experiencing  different  identities  in  certain  social situations. It seems plausible that one acts  differently at work, at home or on the basketball  court. Different social situations demand different  sets of behavior. There might be something like a  core identity, but identity theory inhers a greater   91   Figure 1. Means of the real life and virtual Second Life version of 5 personality traits  with standard  error bars; adapted from Aas et al. 2010   What’s Real?  flexibility  as  a  concept  within  persons   Tajfel  & Turner, 1984 . It is, however, difficult to find  good measures of identity in real life, let alone for  virtual environments. One possibility could be to  look at stereotypes of people and their influence  on identity perception. It is known that activation  of certain ethnic and social identities results in a  simultaneous activation of stereotypes, or in other  words, stereotypical thinking often is a significant  part of an identity, that can directly influence be- havior  Bargh, Chen & Barrows, 1996 . Can this  process be found in virtual life as well? Which  cues do users of virtual worlds – implicitly – take  into account when drawing conclusions about the  person behind an avatar? One hypothesis could be  that within the virtual, people rely less on variables  that can be manipulated, e.g. skin color, gender  or age. The virtual world simply yields less and  – by nature – more mediated information than  real life. This might be the reason why the step  from text-based chat to voice-based chat in virtual  worlds is experienced as a big one. In real life, it  is the body appearance that gives first and deep  cues.  In  virtual  worlds,  one  can  choose  which  ‘channels’ to open and it is mostly voice that is  the first real life channel that is used in virtual  surroundings. Since those first cues potentially   trigger  stereotypical  thinking,  there  are  simply  fewer cues available to draw conclusions from in  virtual worlds; this might in turn be experienced  by the user as being more open towards anyone  around. Own openness and expectation of oth- ers’  openness  might  set  communication  into  a  positive direction from the very beginning. Such  reasoning can be cast into an experimental setup.  It has been found that, within an immersive virtual  reality, stereotypical behavior existed in a similar  way as it is found in real life situations  Dotsch  & Wigboldus, 2008 . In this study, participants  approach  a  Dutch  or  Moroccan  avatar  waiting  at  a  virtual  bus  stop.  Results  show  that,  when  asked to read numbers on the chest and back of  an avatar, people tend to have less eye-contact,  keep a bigger distance from the northern African  type than the Caucasian avatar and show a higher  skin conductance rate in this situation, pointing  towards higher stress levels. Similarly, it has been  found that characters of the same gender maintain  a bigger distance from each other in virtual worlds   Yee,  Bailenson,  Urbanek,  Chang,  &  Merget,  2007 , sales techniques like the foot-in-the-door  and  door-in-the-face  approach  also  function  in  virtual worlds  Eastwick & Gardner, 2009  and  the conformity in individual attitudes on sex is   92   What’s Real?  mediated by the cohesion of the virtual group one  is in  Friedman et al., 2007b .  Unfortunately, in this respect exemplary for  most studies, these studies only test participants  within  the  virtual  world  and  do  not  compare  them  individually  with real life data. Rightly,  the authors conclude that stereotypes do exist in  virtual life as they do in real life, but it would be  even more insightful, if for the same participant  the same cues were found to function in differ- ent worlds in a similar procedural way. It might  be that differences exist, for the subset of virtual  online world users who perceive their avatars as  distinct from themselves.  In  a  next  step,  it  is  important  that  studies  conducted in immersive online virtual worlds are  repeated for non-immersive virtual environments,  and in frequently used online platforms. Further- more, presence, gender and questions evolving  around identity could be taken into account. With  such an approach, it would be possible to draw  firm conclusions on identity  -shifts  in virtual  and real life.  Cohort-Effect of Experiencing  Virtual Worlds  A dad tells his daughter about the good old times,  when  everything  was  fine,  the  people  friendly,  the summers hot and the world just more relaxed  without computers and all that. The girl responds:  ‘But if you had no computers, how did you access  internet?’  Another related topic that lacks profound research  is the question whether and how people that grow  up with modern technical devices, computer us- age and virtual worlds differ from people who  did not, in terms of the above raised questions of  presence, personality, identity et cetera. There is  a good chance that people of 30 years and older  – in fact those who are in good research positions  – have a different perception of virtual worlds.  Just as I was watching my parents struggle to deal   with emails, the generation of children growing  up now will look at their parents the same way  when these try to communicate and navigate in  online virtual worlds of twenty years from now.  When it comes e.g. to presence in virtual reality,  the mere fact of not being used to handle those  worlds, might be an obstacle that ‘pushes’ one  out of the immersive experience. For someone  used to it with peers doing the same, there might  be  no  hesitation  at  all.  Again,  this  possibility  could be researched in a straightforward manner  by applying the setup of almost any of the above  introduced studies and running the experiments  twice in real life and virtual worlds to compare  data afterwards. Such research might also inform  about, how to enhance the accessibility of online  worlds for anyone how is new to virtual worlds. From  evolutionary  psychology  it  is  known  that learning a second language is best and easi- est achieved between the ages of two to five, the  critical period  Snow & Hoefnagel-Höhle, 1978 .  In fact, it makes it easier to learn a third language  later in life as well. Accordingly, there might be  a process underlying the usage of virtual worlds  that is best learned early in life as well, so that  intuitive handling of virtual worlds could have a  critical period as well. On the other hand, it might  be just a matter of time spent in the virtual world  and learning. It is certainly not impossible for older  people to acquire good capabilities to lead a ‘sec- ond life’; however, having contact with computers  and virtual realities early in life might enhance  how to navigate and communicate digitally and  therefore let emerge subsequent experiences of   naturalistic   immersion.  In  contrast,  common  usage of virtual worlds might also lead to a less  naturalistic and more realistic – read ‘virtualistic’  – usage of the virtual worlds. One could raise the  question, why we still feel the urge to let our ava- tar sit down on virtual chairs to feel comfortable   Yee, Ellis & Ducheneaut, 2009 . Even though we  know that it is just an avatar, people behind the  screen still respond by moving towards somebody,  when the other avatar does so as well, but at the   93   What’s Real?  People who grow up in a modern information- and  communication society might automatically adapt  to these cognitive demands and, as a consequence,  perceive not only computer based environments  like the internet in a new way, but also the real  world around them. In fact, the two environments  of the real world and the technical might grow  closer together and indivisibly merge into one – in  terms of devices to access online worlds and the  necessary cognitive resources.  This process is likely to occur not only for  internet, but also for virtual worlds. As already  picked up briefly above, virtual worlds not only  add a new experience to everyday life, but the  way these worlds are built, the way they func- tion and the benefits they bring, will influence  human cognitions and psyche in a reciprocal turn   Sanchez-Vives & Slater, 2005 . It is found that  participants given a taller avatar in Second Life  have more aggressive negotiation behavior in real  life afterwards, as compared to smaller avatars   Yee & Bailenson, 2007 . This short-term effect  might foster itself in people that go online on an  everyday basis. In fact, this is the basic rationale  behind  research on  virtual therapy: Virtual reali- ties trigger a certain fear response of e.g. height,  spiders or social situations, to subsequently allow  the patients to apply therapeutic psychological  interventions  like  gradual  desensitization,  rec- ognition of the irrationality of the fear response,  application of relaxation techniques and social  skills  training.  Somebody  who  is  for  example  afraid of meeting people in public or speaking to  strangers, might experience communication via  virtual platforms as less intriguing and harmful,  always having the possibility to leave an undesired  situation with a single mouse click. Step by step,  the virtually experienced positive situations and  practiced skills might translate into real life.  Besides such therapeutic and desired effects,  there might also be some more subtle ones. In a  virtual reality, one has control over the appear- ance  and  communication  channels  at  use. The  virtual  mask  of  the  avatar  might  enhance  the   same time, they experience their personal space  intruded if an avatar stands too close  Friedman  et al., 2007b . These kind of real-world-virtual- world coherencies might disappear in people that  grew up with the virtual world. For them, using  the PC and virtual environments as a mere tool  might be more pronounced than in older people.  Reciprocal Influence From the  Virtual Onto the Real World  Reasoning up to this point was performed in the  direction of the real life to the virtual life. Con- cepts and processes from real life are for some  part found in the virtual worlds, but apparently  differences exist as well. The question remains,  how the real life is influenced by the virtual. By  that, I do not only mean how our lives are changed  in terms of communication possibilities and large  scale networking, but also the question whether  distinctive virtual features have influence on how  we perceive and behave in real life. This reverse  process has reached wide acceptance in art, where  content or graphics take more and more online  forms in real life as well; this is true for language  as well, where computers and internet yield fer- tile   metaphorical   concepts  for  non-technical  entities  thinking e.g. of the brain as a computer  with working memory, hard ware and software . The  internet  makes  communication  and  gathering information easy and very accessible.  Educational institutions react on this evolution by  placing the focus of their didactic curricula not  only on knowledge, but also the act of acquiring  and selecting knowledge. The reasoning is that if  the pool of almost all knowledge is just a mouse  click – or screen touch – away, it is more useful  to be able to know where to look and to decide  quickly  which  sources  to  trust  and  which  not,  than  to  merely  accumulate  factual  knowledge.  This factual ‘what’ is then outsourced into the  online  internet  cloud.  Selection  of  information  and  remembering  already  acquired  knowledge  however demand different cognitive resources.   94   What’s Real?  openness in conversations. Even though there is  less direct contact, behind an avatar, people prone  to show themselves in too positive light in real  life, might be capable of showing more of their  true  self  in  a  virtual  environment  and  lose  the  fear of committing failures. The controllability of  communicative situations might however, in an  unfavorable process, impair peoples’ capability to  make contact in real life. Somebody neurotic in  real life might even get more neurotic when only  communicating in virtual rooms. To put it short,  the ‘nerd’ might become even more nerdy; people  with good social capacities might even increase  their skills and benefit from virtual realities.  To wrap the main part of this chapter up, it is  interesting to finally look at the reciprocal effect  of virtual realities on the concept of presence, as  introduced in the first part. As stated there, the  intensity of feeling present in a virtual world is  thought to be a key factor in understanding the rela- tion between virtual and real world. Furthermore,  authors like Gumbrecht  2004  try to implement  the concept of presence in the humanities, inter- estingly without touching the topic of virtuality.  The growing use of internet and virtual worlds, the  technization and digitalization of communication  and information creates a ‘second world’ in which  the actor is no longer embodied and an absence  of certain senses is the consequence, especially  olfaction,  gustation,  touch  and  to  some  extent  audition. In other words, a primacy of vision is  the  consequence  of  the  digital  revolution. The  fact  that  people  spend  more  and  more  time  in  such un-embodied virtual worlds, makes it almost  inevitable that they experience the virtual world  –  at  least  unconsciously  –  as  real.  Simultane- ously, the virtualization of everyday life and the  experience of sensual absence will also rebound  in stating questions about presence in real life.  In short: Setting a virtual world next to the real  world makes it easier and more prominent to ask  questions about the realness of the real world.  This ‘experiencing the real as the real’ is closely  connected to Heidegger’s ‘being-in-the-world’,   which in reaction might conceptualize itself in  the idea concept of presence automatically. Do- ing so, virtual worlds not only add a dimension  to everyday life as a new place to go, but might  also give rise to a stronger need to reflect on one’s  existence and – paradoxically – experience the  real as real.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE  RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  This chapter presents ideas and research on how  people  behave  in  and  experience  virtual  reali- ties. A key feature of virtual worlds appears to  be  how  present  someone  feels  when  entering  such a world. It is argued that people experience  the virtual as part of their real life  augmenta- tion  or as an own separate world  immersion ,  but that the intensity of presence is a key factor  for understanding whether social, cognitive and  psychological processes function the same way  in both environments.  In  a  second  step,  the  psychology  of  virtual  worlds  is  then  introduced,  presenting  research  which shows that real life personality, real life  emotions and real life identity stereotypes do exist  in virtual worlds in a similar way. It is pointed out  that there is, however, a lack of empirical research  that  experimentally  compares  these  processes  between the worlds. Despite evidence that some  psychological processes cohere between the vir- tual and the real world on a global level, it remains  unclear, whether this argumentation holds true for  individuals as well. It is possible that people who  experience strong presence in virtual worlds and  perceive their avatar as distinct from themselves,  display a non-corresponding virtual personality,  identity or stereotypes.  In a next step, it is argued that there might not  only be differences in virtual experiences in terms  of presence, but also related to age. It is plausible  that there exists a cohort effect in a way that ado- lescents who grow up with computers and virtual   95   What’s Real?  move by himself and the user loses control? These  questions  can  be  addressed  in  virtual  settings  very easily and set the stage for a new entry into  research on the mind. Replicating the idea of the  rubber hand illusion, it is possible to experience  a virtual arm as part of one’s own body  Slater,  Perez-Marcos, Ehrsson & Sanchez-Vives, 2008 .  In this experiment, participants have their real arm  tapped, but have synchronous visual input of a  virtual arm, projected towards their body, being  tapped, too. After some minutes, they report ex- periencing the visual arm as real. This experience  can even be taken further to encompass whole  out-of-body experiences; when participants see  themselves depicted as avatars from behind as  they are stroked in a virtual world and have the  coherent real body sensations, they begin to locate  their true body position in the avatar rather than  in their real body  Lenggenhager, Tadi, Metzinger  & Blanke, 2007 . Such an out-of-body experience  can hardly be induced in a real life setting, so if  one wants to continue in this line of research, it is  necessary to accumulate knowledge on the effects  and processes of virtual worlds thoroughly. This  is also necessary, because new technologies will  contribute to closing the gap between the real and  the virtual world. On the one hand, as the success  of  the  Nintendo-Wii  game  console  shows,  the  virtual will be more and more embodied, closing  the gap from the virtual side. The game, and by  that the virtual world, is brought deeper into real  life. On the other hand, the gap will be closed  more and more from the real life side as well. It  has been shown that brainwaves can be recorded  by an EEG in a way that it is possible to control  mouse  cursors  and  by  that  navigate  avatars  in  virtual worlds. Such a tool allows a person to let  his avatar do what he wants by thinking alone and  this will most certainly have beneficial influence  on the experienced presence in virtual worlds.  This point appears even more crucial, when  following modern neuroscientists and anthropolo- gists that take even a step further, stating that all  self-consciousness and culture is in the end just a   worlds from an early age onwards, have a more  direct and natural usage of digital environments. Finally, it is being discussed, in what respect  virtual worlds influence the real world in a recip- rocal loop. Distinctive features of digital environ- ments as e.g. dis-embodiment of communication,  control over appearance and general settings or  absence of sensual stimuli leading to a primacy  of vision will shape the perception, experience  and communication in real life as well.  It is not only important and interesting to un- derstand virtual worlds and effects between the  real and the virtual per se, but it is also inevitable  to have this profound knowledge to use virtual  worlds  as  online  research  and  sales  platforms.  To mention just some benefits of online research,  more  information  can  be  accumulated  from  a  worldwide sample, only restricted by computer-  and internet-access. Seen that most psychological  research is conducted by first year undergraduate  students, the  virtual  internet sample is not only  bigger and easier to access, but also has a higher  degree of diversity. Some cross-cultural aspects  are for example automatically ruled out, when  an experiment is conducted 24 7 in an internet  based  online  ‘worldwide’  world.  Furthermore,  the costs can be dramatically reduced; not only  because  no  more  laboratories  are  needed,  but  also  because  a  high  degree  of  automatization  can  be  achieved.  Virtual  robot  avatars  could  undertake  assignments  to  execute  experiments   Friedman et al., 2007a . This is not only cheap,  but also makes experimenter effects completely  controllable, traceable and manipulable. In fact,  this manipulability is one of the most interesting  features of virtual worlds from an experimental  psychologist’s point of view. One can not only  change – and track – real life coherent variables  in virtual life, but also a whole variety of variables  that are fixed or not existing in real life.

To identify which type of communication is most common among avatars  and to understand if there is any similarity with communication in real life, a case study was developed  in order to analyze both verbal and non-verbal communication among Master degree students.  This chapter will explain how this study was conducted, as well as the results and the conclusions drawn  from it. After the data analysis we concluded that avatars rarely use kinesic communication - although  there is, in Second Life, an inventory full of gestures - using instead verbal communication. In fact, it  was very clear that individuals use written code to express their emotions, thus increasing the number  of participations. Non-verbal communication had a small role in interaction, proxemics was influenced  by space, and finally, appearance didn’t reveal the true personality of the user.  INTRODUCTION  Second  Life   SL   is  known  by  its  potential  to  enhance social communication, interaction and  information sharing. This virtual environment is  also interactive and dynamic, allowing users to  experience situations beyond one’s physical and  financial constraints  Appel, 2006, p.4 . In fact,  several teachers, doctors, architects, businessmen  and many others use SL to develop their daily   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch007  activities, because it is a realistic and persistent  environment, and because it expresses a sense of  presence and a sense of immersion. SL also has  several advantages for educational professionals,  especially regarding content creation, role-playing  and socialization.  However,  in  order  to  use  virtual  worlds  in  classrooms,  it  is  fundamental  to  understand  how individuals relate with each other and what  pedagogical strategies are more efficient in those   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

To fulfill these goals, the present  research was out forward, over the period of a year,  aiming to understand the verbal and non-verbal  behavior of several Portuguese master students  in Second Life.  Words have an enormous importance in our  lives because they can express feelings, enlighten,  excite. Therefore language can be a great instru- ment or a hazardous weapon.  Toomey, 2000 .  But communication doesn’t necessarily mean  speaking: pre-historical men used gestures, pos- tures and movements to get in touch with other  individuals.  Davis   1979   however  acknowl- edges the value of words, adding that words are  beautiful, exciting, and important, although also  expressing a belief that words have been over- estimated  since  they  represent  neither  the  full  nor the partial communicated message. Indeed,  verbal communication cannot be analyzed without  non-verbal  communication,  because  doing  so  might jeopardize the effectiveness of the whole  purpose of interaction. To fully understand the  meaning of verbal messages, individuals have to  take into account intonation, intention, environ- ment,  interaction,  interlocutor  and  non-verbal  communication  Streeck, 1993, inLeathers, 1997 .  As Kendon  1972  stated “the flow of movement  in the listener may be rhythmically coordinated  with the speech and movements of the speaker.”   inWeitz, 1979, p. 89   Non-verbal communication is responsible, in  real life, for 65 to 70 percent of human interac- tion  Birdwhistell, 1970, inLeathers, 1997 . The  way we look, the way we place ourselves and the  gestures we make are very expressive and say a  lot about of our emotions. These items are studied  by  several  disciplines,  namely  proxemics  and  kinesics. Obviously, non-verbal communication  is quite different in SL and in real life, but there  are some points in common.  Since we have described the two major con- cepts that underlie our study it is now important  to present its main aims which were to identify  how individuals relate with each other in SL and   to identify whether there is any similarity with  real life interaction, so as to adjust SL classroom  strategies to both the teachers’ and the students’  needs. Furthermore, we also wanted to:  1.   Understand the interaction typologies –ver- bal and non-verbal communication – among  students in Second Life and their relevance  to education;  3.    2.   Understand the impact of interaction between  individuals concerning the increase of sense  of community; Identify  the  advantages  of  interacting  in  virtual  worlds  when  compared  with  the  advantages  of  traditional  communication  means.  COMMUNICATION TYPOLOGIES  Verbal Communication  Language is a tool to accomplish one’s goals and  success   Ng  e  Bradac,  inSzuchewycz,  1995 ,  because it can develop, modify or overthrow the  power someone has. Although it is very important,  language is not the only constituent of the com- municative process, since the non-verbal acts, such  as movements, postures and facial expressions,  also express feelings and emotions.  Although it might look simple, the analysis of  verbal communication requires the consideration  of multiple variables. Since language is full of  ambiguities it is necessary to use complementary  signs to get the message through  Toomey, 2000 .  Verbal messages can be used to fulfill four main  functions:  1.   Give information on people’s attitude; 2.   Provide  personal  information  about  the   speaker and his state of mind;  3.   Report the intensity of speaker’s emotions; 4.   Present relational information.  101   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  actions and expectations and to show feelings and  believes whether they are intentional or not. Leath- ers  1997  defines non verbal communication as  “the use of interacting sets of visual, vocal and  invisible communication systems and subsystems  by communicators with the systematic encoding  and  decoding  of  nonverbal  symbols  and  signs  for the purpose of exchanging consensual mean- ing in specific communicative contexts”  p.11 .  Therefore, non-verbal communication can be an  effective way to explain ambiguous oral messages  and to indicate how accurate and cohesive they are. Non-verbal acts have many functions, namely  the reinforcement or replacement of verbal mes- sages and the clarification of some indistinct con- cepts. They also emphasize emotions and express  feelings  in  a  genuine  and  discreet  way.  More,  these acts control social situations since they can  guide one’s behaviors and impressions. Finally,  non-verbal communication is often quicker than  verbal messages:  “The reaction must be quick and reflexive, with  no time to ponder or talk. And whenever such  situation occurs, the slower and exhaustive verbal  codifications are out of the question for practical  reasons and are clearly more time-consuming and  inefficient than nonverbal reactions”  Reusch &  Kees, 1956, inLeathers, 1997, p.8 .  Given that non-verbal communication has so  many  functions,  it  encompasses  several  disci- plines, namely kinesics, proxemics and appear- ance. Although appearance has a huge impact in  everyday communication, in SL is hard to analyze  its importance since users can freely edit their  avatars. Despite this fact, we will explain, in the  following section, each one of these three areas.  Kinesics  Kinesics studies observable, isolate and meaning- ful movements, such as gestures, facial expres- sions and postures that occur during interpersonal   Hymes  1984  and Jakobson  inHébert, 2006    have considered six functions:  1.   Referential – it analyzes context and content; 2.   Metalinguistic – it analyzes the code and   3.   Expressive  –  it  focus  attention  on  the   language itself;  speaker’s emotions;  4.   Connotative – it emphasizes the speaker’s  intention to influence the attitudes and be- havior of the receiver;  5.   Poetic – it focus on the shape and structure   6.   Phatic – it establishes and maintains inter-  of the message;  personal contact.  Verbal communication is about sharing infor- mation, not only regarding the speaker’s character,  but also his her emotions, believes and attitudes.  Therefore, verbal communication is an incredible  network whereby messages, means and the com- munication process itself work together.  To sum up, verbal messages give us informa- tion on the participants, space, time and intrinsic  meaning.  However,  each  and  every  message  should be analyzed to avoid mistakes and mis- understandings. Speech acts can have different  intents and it is, therefore, extremely important  to analyze them not only taking into account the  reaction they will produce in the receiver but also  their communicational expressivity and context. During the analysis of speech acts we have  considered several parameters which helped us  to classify each message. These parameters are  related to the expression of emotions, the qualita- tive participation in a debate and the proximity  between the intervenients. Some of these param- eters will imply gathering specific words and will  be detailed in the next chapters.  Non-Verbal Communication  Hickson & Stacks  inLeathers, 1997  describe non- verbal communication as a process to manipulate   102   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  communication  Leathers, 1997 . According to  Birdwhistell, “kinesics is concerned with abstract- ing from the continuous muscular shifts which  are characteristic of living physiological systems  those groupings of movements which are of sig- nificance to the communication process and thus  to the interactional systems of particular groups”   inLeathers, 1997, p. 67 .  Kinesics analyzes movements taking into ac- count their intentionality, awareness and cohesion  within verbal discourse. Through this analysis,  the researcher can justify some attitudes, feelings  and even the self-esteem of the subject  Leath- ers, 1997 .  Postures  are  also  an  important  element  of  kinesics, whether in real life or in Second Life.  Scheflen  1964, inLeathers, 1997  classifies pos- tures in three different types:  1.   Postural movements keep other people away   2.    or bring them closer together; Individuals  stay  near  their  interlocutors,  showing interest in communicating with all  participants;  3.   Posture indicates haughtiness or modesty.  In fact, postures can influence the way other  people  perceive  us  and  how  they  react  to  our  speech,  facilitating  or  hindering  the  continuity  of communication  Weitz, 1979 .  Proxemics  Proxemics is the study of movements in a space,  of the positioning of objects and of the distance  between people  Hall, 1968 . To clearly under- stand  this  concept,  we  have  to  understand  the  meaning  of  both  space  and  distance;  the  first  one refers to the location or environment where  interaction occurs and the use that people make  of it. According to Hall, the organization of space  can prevent spontaneous interactions  inLeath-  ers,  1997 .  Unfortunately,  educational  spaces  are organized in such a way that they intimidate  students and support distance when they should  promote closeness, involvement and interaction. Distance depends on the affiliation or privacy  needs  Leathers, 1997 . Collier  1975, inDavis,  1979  and Leathers  1997  argue that people come  closer to people whom they like and care for, stand- ing face-to-face or side-by-side. The positioning  also determines status and hierarchical role; lead- ers tend to adopt a central position - though this  might be a spontaneous attitude.  Davis   1979   also  holds  that  it  is  possible  to  foresee  some  psychological  characteristics  from  the  place  people  take  in  a  conversation;  for instance, shy people tend to keep away from  other participants. This author adds that a circular  disposition is taken whenever there is no clear  leadership  Davis, 1979 .  In order to analyze proxemics it is important  to observe people’s movements in spontaneous  environments,  because  spatial  configurations  can  determine  human  behavior   Davis,  1979 .  Furthermore, it is essential to observe people’s  attitudes, since they might express feelings and  emotions that would not be told orally.  Appearance  Appearance is also an essential element of non- verbal communication. According to Birdwhistell   inDavis,  1979   individuals  are  influenced  by  society  to  look  in  a  certain  way.  Mass  media,  culture or religion exerts pressure over individu- als, making their desire to fit in more important  than their own individuality.  Physical appearance, namely the type of body,  weight and height, clothes and accessories also  influences  others  perspective  towards  us.  So,  appearance may define social identity: a gothic  man,  for  instance,  is  easily  identified  with  his  group  Leathers, 1997 .  103   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  Real Life Parameter  Virtual worlds as well as web 2.0 tools are growing  because of their social capacity, since they have the  ability to spread knowledge regardless distance. In  this parameter we consider all sentences relating  to events that occur in real life.  Interactive Parameter  To define the descriptors of the interactive pa- rameter  we  have  used  a  Philips’  study   2000   as reference, because it analyzes the quality of  interaction between students in virtual environ- ments like LMS. Although LMS and 3D virtual  worlds are very different, participations are quite  similar because both use written code, making  sharing easier and potentially empowering argu- mentation skills.  Sentences  representing  appreciation  for  the  other’s point of view or showing reference to a  specific  subject  were  classified  as  interactive.  These  speech  acts  not  only  showed  tolerance  and respect but also contributed to enhance the  communicative process.  This parameter also included questions that   present one’s point of view.  Table 1. Verbal communication parameters   PARAMETER  Affective  Social  Interactive  Cohesive  Participative  DESCRIPTOR  Expression of emotions  Demonstration of users’ state of mind  Greetings Presentation of events which take place  outside SL Resumption of previous discussion  Clear allusion to someone else’s topic  Questioning others directly  Showing one’s appreciation for others’  opinion Sense of community  Using vocative Number of sentences collected  Number of sentences on a specific topic  Diversity of topics in discussion  WORK PLAN AND  COLLECTED DATA  When SL became a famous platform, a group of  students and teachers of the University of Aveiro   Portugal  decided to explore this new environ- ment.  Because  they  were  studying  the  use  of  different  technologies  in  education,  especially  Web 2.0 tools, SL seemed to be an interesting  new platform where they could meet, talk and  share information. These meetings, which were  always held after working hours, soon drew the  attention of other people, which also wanted to  learn  and  speak  about  the  way  technology  en- hanced learning.  In order to analyze both components of com- munication in the aforementioned meetings we  created two main observation grids. The verbal  communication grid was actually based on studies  by Philips  2000  and Rourke et al.  2001 . These  authors studied the way people interact in virtual  environments like LMS  learning management  system . The non-verbal communication grid, on  the other hand, was more complex to build since  there  are  many  different  components,  some  of  which are not considered in a 3D virtual envi- ronment, namely facial expressions. Despite this  restriction, we have studied and included kinesics,  proxemics, intentionality and appearance compo- nents in this data collection instrument  Davis,  1979; Leathers, 1997; Weitz, 1979 .  Table  1  shows  the  several  parameters  and   descriptors of the verbal communication grid.  Affective Parameter  This  parameter  refers  to  all  the  sentences  in  which users express feelings, emotions, beliefs,  values or their state of mind. Greetings, verbal  reinforcement, expressive icons  ☺, ☹, …  and  onomatopoeic words are some of the most com- mon examples of affective elements.  104   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  Cohesive Parameter  These sentences are intrinsically related with the  affective  content,  since  they  express  the  sense  of  community.  Expressions  like  “our  group”  or “our point of view”, the use of the personal  pronoun “we” and others are just a tiny example  of this sense of belonging which is increased by  familiarity.  Once  again,  greetings,  resumption  of  previous  topics,  sharing  social  information  and indicating a specific topic were considered  cohesive elements. Using the first name to speak  to someone was also an expression of cohesion,  regardless its common use in SL.  The non-verbal grid was divided into four main  parameters regarding avatars’ behaviors and at- titudes  Davis, 1979, Knapp, 1992   See Table 2 .  Kinesics  Gestures are the most ancient way of commu- nication  and  therefore  their  relevance  cannot  be devalued. In real life interaction, non-verbal  acts can replace speech. However, in SL, these  gestures are especially used to reinforce certain  oral messages. This parameter includes both the  gestures available in the inventory and the gestures  created by SL users.  Participative Parameter  Physical Features  This  parameter  counts  the  sentences  that  were  written down along the meetings.  We decided to consider the sentence as the  unity  of  analysis,  like  Henri   1992   did  in  his  study. Participative and interactive parameters, for  instance, showed us how important these meetings  were and how involved users in this community of  practice and learning were. On the other hand, the  affective parameter gave us tools to understand the  emotions and the relationship between individuals,  some of which were conveyed to real life.  Since we had to analyze non verbal commu- nication in real time, verbal communication was  studied a posteriori, always taking into account  the avatar’s behavior and his her non verbal acts. In fact, one of our parameters was intentional- ity, which was used to compare verbal messages  with non-verbal attitudes  gestures, movements or  simply appearance , because they might disclose  the true meaning of verbal messages  Davis, 1979 . Although  there  were  obvious  differences  between non-verbal communication in a real en- vironment and in SL, we have discovered some  similarities,  namely  kinesics  and  proxemics.  Physical features, however, were hard to evaluate  because avatars can freely choose their appearance.  In real life, appearance has an important role in  social  relationships,  because  it  shows  people’s  expectations, believes, desires, needs… Physical  features can influence the personality of an indi- vidual and can determine the group to which he  she will belong. Although we might make some  assumptions regarding the impact of the avatar’s  appearance in his her personality, there is not a  clear proof showing this relationship.  Table 2.

Although we have analyzed the information ac- cording to a qualitative perspective all data will  be showed using graphics. The written messages  and the non-verbal acts were all treated with the  help  of  software  of  qualitative  analysis   QSR  Nvivo ,  respecting  the  parameters  put  forward  in the observational grids.  Verbal Communication Results  There was an average of 27 users from different  educational  institutes  in  the  meetings  we  have  attended. In fact, the less crowded meeting was  on the 8th January 2008, when users discussed  the topic of interaction design. The presence of  so  many  people  in  these  meetings  showed  the  importance of SL and its sense of community.  This huge participation can be shown through the  number of messages collected, in a total of 6423  sentences  See Figure 1 .  The number of messages collected on the 24th  January meeting showed that users talk intensely  about that specific topic. The two first meetings  were about topics related with education or with  SL benefits or disadvantages and gathered main- ly Master students, as this discussion began in  real life classroom. Most meetings were related  with a conference on Communication, Education  and Training in SL held in the University of Aveiro,  which probably influenced this amount of par- ticipation.  After  collecting  avatars’  messages  we  have  analyzed them according to the parameters previ- ously presented. Next, we will represent the global  analysis, which will respect the order of param- eters, because this is the best way to understand  and frame some of the conclusions drawn. Since  descriptors are a little extensive, we adopted an  alphabetic system, in order to represent each one  of them:  A.   Expression of emotions; B.   Demonstration of users’ state of mind;  Nevertheless, appearance is the easiest way to  recognize someone in a crowd or to define his  her importance in a certain group.  Proxemics  The position people assume in the presence of  other people or towards space can have different  meanings. In fact, some positions and postures  clearly  show  some  degree  of  intimacy  among  avatars.  Positioning  can  also  reveal  someone’s  status and role in the community, especially when  they take a central place.  The last descriptor of this parameter refers to   the group’s behavior as a collective entity.  Intentionality  This last parameter intends to analyze the rela- tion and cohesion between verbal and non-verbal  acts.  In  some  cases,  non-verbal  acts  can  show  emotions, even though they are not linked to a  specific oral message. Concerning intentionality  we also evaluated if non-verbal acts were used as  a reinforcement of speech.  As we mentioned before, the majority of par- ticipants in this study attended a master degree  in Multimedia in Education lectured in the Uni- versity of Aveiro. Despite this fact, the openness  of the meetings soon attracted other researchers,  students and scholars, which came from differ- ent cities and countries. Since the avatars came  from different places, these meetings happened in  different locations, for example the Island of the  University of Aveiro, Portucalis, and the Island  of PT Inovação. The topics of discussion were  mainly related with education in virtual worlds.  DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Next, we will present and discuss the information  gathered in the six meetings we have observed.  In  these  meetings  the  number  of  participants,   106   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  Figure 1. Number of sentences per meeting  C.   Greetings; D.   Presentation  of  events  which  take  place   outside SL;  E.   Resumption of previous discussion; F.   Clear allusion to someone else’s topic; G.   Questioning others directly; H.   Showing one’s appreciation for others; I.   Sense of community; J.   Using vocative.  These descriptors belong to different param- eters, respectively affective  A, B, C , social  E,  F, G, H , cohesive  I, J  and interactive. Figure  2  represents  the  amount  of  messages  in  each  parameter, being obvious the supremacy of the  interactive parameter over others. However, this  parameter has more descriptors than the others,  which might have influenced this result.  Once  more,  we  want  to  stress  that  written  messages were analyzed in context to understand  the true meaning of that specific speech act. The  same sentence can be classified in a multiplicity  of parameters, according to its meaning and inten- tion.  Messages are often labeled as interactive or  affective. In meetings like these, in which people  are supposed to express their opinion, it is normal   to argue, to expose ideas, to reveal a state of mind  or to greet.  Figure 3 allows us to confirm that descriptor E  has a significant difference when compared with  the remaining descriptors. The use of vocative  – descriptor J – is also often used, since avatars  need to identify who they are talking to.  Furthermore, it is important to notice that the  sense of community was visible regardless the   Figure  2.  Percentage  of  messages  per  verbal  communication parameter  107   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life      [15:33] Avatar5: I love it!  Descriptor B, corresponding to the “demon- stration of users’ state of mind”, gathered mes- sages that use humor, emoticons and expressive  punctuation.  In  order  to  recognize  humoristic  sentences, researchers consider the context and  punctuation, since there is no intonation available,  as it happens in a real life situation.  In order to show this descriptor, we have col-  lected the following messages:  [13:22] Avatar1: lol [14:10] Avatar2: :  [14:20] Avatar3: :D [14:15] Avatar4: heheheheheheh  The last affective descriptor  C  includes not  only greetings, but also messages showing per- sonal incentives and support.  [13:22]  Avatar1:  good  night  everybody,  sorry i’m late [15:24] Avatar2: C U:  [15:02] Avatar3: good news:D [14:16] Avatar4: go on!!                             number  of  messages.  Avatars  use  words  like  “community”, “all”, “people”, “group”, “folks”,  as well as personal pronouns  “we” and “ours” . In order to clear up this analysis and given the  fact that we have only showed the global results  we will specify each parameter by giving some  examples.  Affective Parameter  Messages expressing emotions, beliefs, states of  mind and intimacy are classified as affective. It  is important for us, as researchers, to analyze not  only the explicit meaning of sentences, but also  the subjective one, because people are not always  objective. Despite this fact, there were some speech  acts hard to classify due to its multiple meanings. To descriptor A – “expression of emotions”  –  correspond  all  sentences  expressing  feelings  such as:                [13:23] Avatar1: This space makes me feel  safe... [14:05] Avatar2: yet?? [14:29] Avatar3:  what a shame...  [15:10] Avatar4: Hallelujah!!!!  Figure 3. Number of sentences per descriptor  108   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  As we can see, these messages do not have a  direct relationship with the argument. Nevertheless  they allow us to deduce the existent relationship  between avatars.  Real Life Parameter  This parameter is characterized by messages relat- ing to events that took place in real life and do not  influence directly avatars’ behavior and experience  in the virtual world. We also classify as social all  the messages relating to the users’ opinion on the  importance of topics in their daily life.  Even though there were not many messages   of this kind, there are some examples:  [14:12]  Avatar1:  I  was  in  DSI  until  last  year… [14:35] Avatar3: I just arrive from BCN. [14:37] Avatar4: Prima is a journal pro- moted by CETAC.MEDIA  UA and UP  [14:07] Avatar6: I know one’s made and  sold in a typical fair at Setubal  Interactive Parameter  This parameter has a large amount of messages,  because it refers to argumentative sentences that  carry on an argument  E  or bring in a new dis- cussion  H .  The  next  messages  are  just  an  example  of   descriptor E:  [14:22]  Avatar1:  well,  at  the  beginning  what attracted me the most on SL, was the  possibility of communicate and meet peo- ple from other cities and countries [13:22] Avatar2: Metaphor is a challenge  to communication… [14:21] Avatar3: In this second stage we  want  to  reinforce  the  development  of  ar- eas  to  support  students  and  to  enhance  socialization                                 [14:44]  Avatar4:  I  want  to  show  you  an  experience…  When avatars use a message to make comments  about a certain topic or to mention directly the  work or the opinion of someone else, there is a  specific reference  F . The sentences below show  how interested the avatars are in the discussion  and in the resumption of argument.  [14:42]  Avatar1:  and  there  isn’t,  on  SL,  the means to fulfill our dreams as Avatar7  says? [13:29]  Avatar2:  I’ll  add,  Avatar8:  The  arousing of new era...the dawn of the an- cient ways to communicate [15:41]  Avatar3:  with  the  goal,  as  Avatar10 said, of involving more Brazilian  people [15:26]  Avatar4:  in  one  of  the  meaning,  I believe it was in the first one, Avatar10  raise a relevant question, which I’m about  to explain  Descriptor  G  includes  messages  in  which  avatars show their respect and appreciation for  somebody’s  opinion,  indicating  intimacy  and  proximity between the users. The next sentences  exemplify this fact:  [14:52] Avatar1: I agree [13:22] Avatar2: oh Avatar7...great ideia [15:08] Avatar3: exactly, Avatar8 [15:24] Avatar4: that’s great:D  The last interactive descriptor does not relate  exclusively to interrogative questions, since there  are also many declarative sentences employed to  stimulate argument and to raise new topics. Here  are some examples:  [14:36]  Avatar1:  aren’t  we  encouraging  controversy by defending the idea that SL  is a game?                                   109   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  [14:26]  Avatar3:  when  you  spoke  about  Portuguese-speaking  community,  did  you  mean academic and scientific one? [14:42] Avatar4: Avatar7, do you want to  speak a bit about Avatar8 professional and  personal path? [14:14] Avatar5: Can you explain me once  again the context, since I didn’t understand  it quite well?  Cohesive Parameter  Group cohesion is a very important issue in any  social situation. At SL the sense of community   I  is really important and avatars show how deep  the relationship that unites them is by using some  specific  words,  such  as  “group”,  “our”,  “com- munity” or “we”.  [14:13] Avatar1: hello everybody [13:24]  Avatar2:  He!!!  I  have  my  family  from SL community calling me every where [14:13] Avatar3: Hi, folks! [15:32]  Avatar4:  I  like  to  see  u  all  together…  The other descriptor in this parameter is the use  of vocative. In SL it is necessary to use the first  name so that people know who they are talking  to, unlike it happens in real life communication.  [13:26] Avatar1: Avatar8, this is good or  bad, if we’re talking about socialization on  second life? [14:18]  Avatar2:  Avatar10,  make  the  introductions [14:20]  Avatar3:  Avatar11,  please  turn  that voice down [14:33] Avatar4: Avatar8... lead the argue  results  mean  that  individuals  are  participative,  interested and active in the debate, choosing to  express their opinion rather than just listen to oth- ers’ ideas. The affective parameter also reveals the  intimacy between individuals, which led them to  express their emotions and feelings.  Non-Verbal Communication Results  The analysis of non-verbal acts was made in real  time with the support of an observational grid.  After recording each act, we crossed this refer- ence with the verbal speech in order to analyze  its cohesion and veracity. Although this section  of communication is qualitative, the results will  be presented through graphics.  Physical features are difficult to analyze just  through the observation of meetings. As we have  mentioned  earlier,  individuals  are  totally  free  to edit their avatars, independently of their real  personality. This makes it really difficult to set  people’s personality or to identify the group to  which they belong just by their appearance.  Even though we can’t make any assumptions  regarding the user’s personality or behavior, we  can notice that some of them choose an eccentric  appearance. Even if there isn’t any connection  between  appearance  and  behavior,  eccentricity  can  promote  their  recognition  while  in  a  huge  group. To corroborate this fact, we have chosen  several messages in which avatars talk about some  particular features:                   [14:31]  Avatar1:  I’ve  blue  hair,  almost  green… bad premonition [15:08] Avatar2: and blue eyes… [13:41] Avatar3: I love your cloak [13:42] Avatar4: remembers me Cruela [13:42] Avatar5: phantom of the opera...  In conclusion, verbal communication is the  most important mean to socialize and interact in  SL. Results showed that 43% of the messages  were interactive, while 37% were affective. These   In conclusion, the first parameter of non-verbal  communication only allows us to identify people  in a group; however, it is impossible to indicate  their status or any trace of personality. In order                                             110   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  to get this information we suggest the application  of questionnaires.  Kinesics  Users have a huge amount of avatars gestures in  the SL inventory at their disposal. Additionally,  they can create their own gestures. There are 35  gestures, some of which are different according  to gender to simulate several of the non-verbal  acts used in common interaction. The creation  of gestures was indicative of the knowledge of  avatars regarding the use of scripting tools. Be- sides, it also illustrated their interest in this virtual  environment. Although many gestures were used,  we’ve noticed users prefer to express themselves  in written code, using emoticons, interjections and  idiomatic expressions. From the inventory, it be- came quite clear that users use “Laugh” the most;  however, many of them choose to write it down  in the following way: [14:15] Avatar1: hehehe- heheheh” or “[14:20] Avatar2: HiHiHiHiHiHi”. Since avatars choose to replace gestures for  speech acts, the percentage of non-application is  bigger than its use  See Figure 4 .  We can point out some reasons to justify this  behavior. First, its timing, since there is a time  frame between the application of gesture and the  speech act that can lead to incoherency and in- comprehension of the true message. Second, the  lack of knowledge of gestures use; and third, the  habit of using emoticons or written sentences to  express feelings, emotions, humor…  These three reasons can probably be the cause  for the devaluation of gestures, which, in some  meetings, were not even used at all. Figure 5 shows  a comparison of the six meetings.  It is important to clarify that although percent- age reveals a high application of gestures; numbers  are quite lower, corresponding to only one dozen  of gestures per meeting.  Throughout meetings we have realized that  several  avatars,  especially  those  with  a  better  knowledge of this particular virtual world, create   Figure 4. Global results for application of gestures  some gestures, namely “All right”, “Aahhh!” or  “Miauu”. However, this fact did not emphasize  the avatars’ interest on the application gestures.  From the 35 gestures at avatars disposal, “Clap”,  “Chuckle”, “Laugh”, “Wow” and “Yes” are the  most frequently used.  After  the  comparison  between  verbal  and  non-verbal communication, we’ve noticed that all  gestures used by avatars intended to emphasize  other people speaking act. In order to corroborate  the cohesion between these two components of  interaction, we will present the written message  and the respective gesture.  At  14:58,  24th  January,  an  avatar  used  the  gesture  “Nod”  to  express  his her  agreement  to  Avatar3’s opinion: [14:58] Avatar3: credibility,  presence…  In the same day, at 14:31, an avatar used the  gesture “Aahh” to show his her support to the  information given by the slides and wrote simul- taneously [14:31] Avatar4: well done.  In February, an avatar joke about cats, writing  [15:05] Avatar1: unless you’re a cat. In response  Avatar2 used the sound “Miauu”.  111   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  Figure 5. Global percentage of gestures per meeting  expose his her ideas  See Figure 6 . Curiously,  avatars said that they rather like to be seated in  circular way, like they do in real life:             [13:47]  Avatar1:  don’t  you  think  we  can  talk better in orange seats? [13:47] Avatar2: we’re in a circle [13:48] Avatar3: I like it better  The position avatars took in the meetings reveal  their sense of community and the intimacy between  them.  So,  if  they  adopt  a  circular  positioning  they will engage in argue actively, unlike what it  happens when they sit side by side. Comparing  a meeting in which the space wasn’t restricted   Figure 6. Snapshot retrieved 08 January 2008  The final example happened on the 05th June,  at 14:20, when an avatar used the gesture “Boo”  to emphasize his divergence regarding another  avatar’s opinion. At the same time another avatar  used “All right” to simulate his her agreement.  These gestures were used in response to the fol- lowing message [14:20] Avatar5: that’s a rap…  would you want to go to coffee, sit down a bit?  The application of these gestures throughout  all the meetings shows the cohesion and coherence  between verbal and non-verbal communication.  Curiously, we have noticed that even when the  gesture could entirely replace the written code,  avatars used rather both of them.  Proxemics  Throughout the meetings we have noticed that  avatars adopt a certain position in order to see all  participants, even if it means having to change  place regularly. Indeed, although real users have  a clear perspective of other avatars, they try to  take the better place.  Avatars like circular disposition better, adopt- ing a different disposition only when the space  is  preconceived. This  fact  happened  in  two  of  the meetings, in which the leader used slides to   112   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  to another one in which it was necessary to look  at slides, we have noticed that avatars were less  participative  in  the  second  case,  because  their  focus was on the slides being presented and not  on the discussion itself. Circular positioning also  helps to understand the closeness between users  and their sense of belonging to a group, as non- verbal theories advocate.  Although the previous items are quite similar  in real life communication, we cannot identify  how close individuals are by their positioning or  their personality. In fact, even when they were  apart, avatars participated actively in discussion.  However, in some cases avatars took a leader- ship  position,  when  the  meeting  was  of  their  responsibility.  In  conclusion,  proxemics  gave  us  enough  material to understand the relationship between  avatars and to identify a sense of community and  of belonging to a group. Even though there were  some similarities with real behavior, namely the  circular position when in group contexts, it was  difficult to establish a connection between their  positioning and the avatars’ personality or impor- tance in the meeting. However, in some meetings  we  have  noticed  that  avatars  take  a  leadership  position, acting as moderators.  CONCLUSION  The main goal of this research was to identify  which type of communication avatars liked better,  so that teachers and other scholar agents could have  a deeper understanding of communication patterns  that emerge in this particular virtual world. After  analyzing the information, we have realized that  users communicate mostly through written code. Despite the success of verbal communication,  we have realized that the absence of non-verbal  acts, such as postures and gestures, devalue the  power of interaction, when compared with every- day life, because a lot of interpersonal communica- tion happens through non-verbal communication.  Throughout this research we have collected  6423 sentences, proving that individuals are re- ally interested in debates and want to share their  knowledge  and  opinions.  Even  when  avatars’  intention is to express their emotions, they prefer  to use emoticons or written expressions.  Although the affective parameter was relevant  to the overall superiority of verbal communication,  the  interactive  parameter  gathered  much  more  messages. All the descriptors in the interactive  parameter refer to debate, not only with messages  regarding its resumption, but also boosting.  Results have showed individuals are active, en- gage in debates and want to contribute to ongoing  discussions. Curiously, users didn’tmention many  events happening in real life, probably because  they see SL as an opportunity to live another life.  Results also reveal that users regularly use voca- tive, because they need to specify the person they  are talking to. This discloses a flaw in SL interac- tion which might be overcome through a more  powerful database of gestures and movements.  The cohesive parameter did not give us much  information, but we could foresee the sense of  community and the union between avatars, when  they used specific words or expressions.  In  relation  to  non-verbal  results,  we  have  concluded that it is difficult to establish a con- nection between the avatar’s appearance and the  user’s behavior or status. In order to obtain this  information it is essential to apply questionnaires  and interviews. Although the majority of the de- scriptors in the appearance parameter could not  be  analyzed,  observation  showed  that  physical  features are an excellent way to identify a person. The proxemics parameter revealed that when  avatars adopt a circular disposition in the group,  they wish to share experiences and to point out  their equal status. Even when there was a leader  or a moderator, avatars chose to use an informal  speech.  After the analysis of each type of communica- tion, we have compared results and concluded that  there is cohesion between both of them and that,   113   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  in addition, non-verbal acts were used especially  to emphasize the meaning of the messages.  This  research  has  given  us  some  clues  on  the impact of these virtual worlds in education,  namely on the use of informal spaces to create a  friendly environment and to enhance spontaneous  interactions. The absence of an authority figure  and the use of open and creative spaces also help  individuals to talk to one another, exposing their  ideas and opinions freely. Despite this fact, we  can’t firmly say that SL is a useful tool to improve  learning and a powerful instrument to use in class- room. If a teacher wants to use this kind of virtual  environment, we suggest the implementation of  discussion activities.  In conclusion, we can say that verbal com- munication is the most used type of interaction  in SL, in spite of weakening the content of the  messages. So, it might be useful to improve non- verbal communication, not only by increasing the  gestures available in the inventory, but also by  developing new postures and movements.  FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  Throughout this chapter we have indicated some  future research directions that might give educa- tors and researchers a new background on this  particular virtual world.  One of the studies we consider important is  concerned with the relationship between avatars’  life in SL and users’ real life. This could tell us  more about behavior, learning and teaching hab- its, allowing educators to adopt the most useful  strategies to achieve their learning goals.  Another important research direction is related  with  the  analysis  of  these  two  components  of  communication in multicultural groups in order   to realize the impact that this interaction has in  real and in second life.  Finally it could be helpful to develop a sys- tem  to  improve  non-verbal  communication,  so  that avatars can understand the full meaning of  messages by intonation and postural movements.

The deeper the users are engaged in this  virtual world, the higher their sense of realism is,  and so the more they believe they experiencing  real situations.  Intentionality:  Cohesion  between  written  or verbal message and kinesics and proxemics  movements.  115   Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication in Second Life  Kinesics: Study of observable and meaningful  movements happening throughout interpersonal  communication like gestures, facial expressions  or postures.  Non-Verbal Communication: Communica- tion based on visual, vocal and invisible systems,  with the main goal of emphasizing, clearing up  or replacing speech acts.  Proxemics:  Study  of  people’s  positioning  and behavior in space. It also studies the distance  between individuals during a conversation and  the relative position of objects.  Sense of Presence: User’s belief that the vir- tual world is real, because it has some similarities  with real life such as gravity or topography. This  concept can be linked to immersion, since the user  believes that he she is in a real environment and  that he is able to interact with people and objects. Verbal Communication: Oral language, it is  the most common type of communication in an  interactional setting, although not the most impor- tant one. This type of communication should be  analyzed according to the meaning and intention  of the verbal acts.  116   117  Chapter  8  Virtual Worlds and  Reception Studies: Comparing Engagings  CarrieLynn D. Reinhard  Roskilde University, Denmark  ABSTRACT Across the various fields, discourse communities, and paradigms studying virtual worlds, there are  disagreements about the object of their studies. The nature of what virtual worlds are, and how to study  them, are in flux. For some, this flux has benefits. However, the flux is potentially a problem for the study of  virtual worlds from the audience and reception studies paradigm. Without knowing what can be labelled  as a “virtual world,” it is hard to study how people engage with a virtual world and to discuss what is  found as ecologically valid. This chapter argues for research studies focusing on how people make sense  of virtual worlds when they engage with them, and to compare these situated sense-making processes  amongst “virtual worlds technologies” as well as other types of media products. By mapping out and  comparing such engagings, we may have a better understanding about what constitutes a virtual world.  INTRODUCTION  As  a  new  computer-based  technology,  a  new  communication medium, a new entertaining pas- time, a new instructional tool, and a new venue  for self-expression, virtual worlds have become   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch008  the “object of interest” for a variety of academic  fields and public discussion. The introduction of  any new media technology, content, or genre often  causes the same pattern of questions, problems  and approaches from academics and the public   Golub, 2010; Manovich, 2003; Marvin, 1988 .  The introduction tends to be met with questions  over  what  is  the  new  technology,  how  does  it   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  We should study virtual worlds as one medium  among others in people’s media landscapes by  comparing  these  engagings  with  other  media  products  Dovey & Lister, 2009; Hermes, 2009 .  By mapping out people’s engagings with a va- riety of media products, we can understand the  convergences and divergences amongst various  virtual world technologies and between virtual  worlds and other media technologies. In order to  map out this terrain of reception, we should utilize  an interpretivist perspective to understand how  people make sense of their engagings with media  products  Dervin & Foreman-Wernet, 2003 .  First, I review the flux and disagreements of  conceptualizing this new media technology. Sec- ond, I review the types of comparison studies that  have already been done and discuss where they  lack a  comparisons to other media products and  b  an interpretive perspective on engaging with  media  products.  Third,  I  propose  the  need  for  methods for studying comparisons that understand  situations of media engagings as complex, situated  sense-making processes. Fourth, I discuss differ- ent types of methods that could be useful in this  endeavor, with examples of work my colleagues  and I have done to this end at the Virtual Worlds  Research Project at Roskilde University  http:   worlds.ruc.dk .  THE PROBLEM OF FLUX  In a top-down approach to audience and reception  studies, how we study engaging with a virtual  world depends on how we define what a virtual  world is  Boellstorff, 2010; Schroeder, 2008 . In  these media reception situations, the entry point  usually depends on the media product chosen: do  we want to study violent television, emotional  films, multiplayer games, and so forth. To say we  want to study how, why, when, and where people  engage with a “virtual world”, for XYZ reasons,  we would first have to define what is a virtual  world and why the one we have chosen to study   impact people, how are people using it, and how  can it be beneficially integrated into society and  culture.  By positioning virtual worlds as a new media  technology, I am consciously highlighting how  virtual  worlds  have  been  undergoing  a  similar  period  of  answering  these  questions.  As  with  media innovations before it, this is a period of  flux for virtual worlds technologies. This period is  seen in the disagreements that exist regarding the  conceptualization of the technologies, contents,  and users of these media products.  Being in a period of flux has both advantages  and disadvantages. On the advantages side, those  who are innovating virtual worlds have latitude  in what they should do to have their final media  product be considered as aligned with the terrain  of products known as virtual worlds technologies.  On the disadvantages side, those who are studying  how and why people engage with virtual worlds,  and the impact doing so can have, find themselves  perhaps troubling over how to study such objects.  This chapter approaches the study of virtual worlds  from the audience and reception studies paradigm,  which would consider the flux a disadvantage with  the potential to be advantageous.  My proposal for handling this flux is the propa- gation of methods that centralize the comparison  of media engagings through situated sense-making  processes. My assumption is that comparisons will  provide fuller understandings of what is unique  about  engaging  with  virtual  worlds,  thereby  helping us to better conceptualize virtual worlds.  Empirical work on mapping the similarities and  differences amongst virtual worlds, and between  virtual worlds and other media products, may help  handle the flux by providing bottom-up, empiri- cally based definitions and typologies. We often  know what something is by knowing what it is  not. If we want to know what a virtual world is,  especially to those who engage with them, then  we  should  know  what  they  consider  a  virtual  world is and is not.  118   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  qualifies as such. Without knowing what is and is  not a “virtual world”, it is difficult to make claims  about what happens when a person engages with  a virtual world, or to apply what is learned from  one such engaging to other virtual worlds. This not  knowing is the flux that I discuss in this section.  Defining Virtual Worlds  To study a virtual world, and a person’s engaging  with it, we begin with the problem “what is a vir- tual world?” From an exploration of the literature  produced from research into virtual worlds tech- nologies across numerous discourse communities,  I  have  found  a  multiplicity  of  answers  to  this  question  Reinhard, 2010a . So as not to impose  my own definition into this confusion, I refer to  these material digital objects as “virtual worlds  technologies”, creating an umbrella term for the  assortment of technologies being grouped together  for or associated with this field of research. The  multiplicity  indicates  that  a  certain  amount  of  disagreement  surrounds  these  material digital  objects and the phenomena associated with them.  Throughout this research, it appears that academ- ics differ on three important considerations: the  classification of virtual worlds as a medium, the  definition of boundaries of separation and inclu- sion, and the jargon or terms used to label these  technologies.  The first consideration focuses on whether or  not virtual worlds technologies can be classified  as  communication  medium.  Academics  differ  on classifying these technologies as a “commu- nication medium” or as a “metamedium” with a  variety of communication modalities or channels.  Wadley, Gibbs and Ducheneaut  2009  argue that  virtual worlds are not themselves “communica- tion media”, but simulations of three-dimensional  space within which different channels of “virtual  communication  media”  are  implemented.  Oth- ers argue they are more than what a modern day  conceptualization  of  a  medium  allows  for:  to  Boellstorff  2008 , virtual worlds offer more to   people than any other medium before them by  providing places for human cultures to evolve.  This initial classification is important if we want  to  understand  how  virtual  worlds  technologies  relate to the array of media products people engage  with on a daily basis.  The second consideration focuses on what are  the features a virtual world technology needs to  have to be defined as a virtual world. That is to  say, academics differ on what is the definition of  a virtual world. According to Bell and Robbins- Bell’s  2008  joint analysis of the etymology of  the term, the term “virtual worlds” goes back to  1965 and Ivan E. Sutherland’s idea that through  computer screens we can see a virtual world. This  usage was repeated by Richard Bolt in 1980. This  idea of the computer as window into a new world  grew  in  1980s  as  computers  became  powerful  enough  to  construct maintain model  “complex  natural environments”, so that before the rise of  the internet, anything “beyond the screen” was a  virtual world.  With the rise of internet and networked comput- ers in the 1990s, virtual worlds became conceived  as multiple and interacting. In what was apparently  the first contemporary definition, Bruce Damer in  1997 mentioned “navigable visual digital environ- ments…inhabited by users represented as avatars”   as quoted in Bell & Robbins-Bell, 2008 . Fol- lowing Damer, other formal definitions include:              its   inhabitants    2003 :  environment  regard  as  being   Richard  Bartle  that  self-contained. Raph  Koster   2004 :  spatially  based  de- piction of a persistent virtual environment,  which  can  be  experienced  by  numerous  participants  at  once,  who  are  represented  within the space by avatars. Edward Castronova  2004 : crafted plac- es inside computers that are designed to ac- commodate large numbers of people.  119   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  they  have  studied.  The  use  of  different  terms  becomes  the  jargon  through  which  academics  communicate.  The  focus  here  is  on  the  multi- tude of terms being employed across discourse  communities.  Additionally,  they  appear  to  be  interchangeable, and are sometimes stated without  reflection or explanation for why that term was  used. By going through research publications, I  have generated the following list of terms, grouped  by their conceptual similarities:     MOOD                       virtual  community,  online  game,  digital  game, social game, casual game  Multiplayer    Multi-User  Object  Oriented  Domain Dungeon ,  MUD   Multi-User  Dungeon Domain ,  MMO   Massive ly   Multiplayer Online , MMOG  Massive ly   Multiplayer  Online  Game ,  MMOSG   Massive ly   Online  Social  Game ,  MMORPG   Massive ly   Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game   3D   MUVE   Multi-User  Virtual Visual  Environment ,  SVWE   Social  Virtual  World  Environment ,  MUSE   Multi-User  Simulated Environment  networked world, virtual world, synthetic  world,  digital  world,  mirror  world,  sim,  simulation,  social  virtual  world,  gaming  virtual world, metaverse 3D  platform,  virtual  environments,  syn- thetic  environments,  3D  environments,  CVE  Collaborative Virtual Environment ,  IVE  Virtual  Environment ,  DVE   Distributed  Virtual  Environment , 3D web, 3D internet virtual reality, networked virtual reality   Immersive Intelligent   The  array  of  terms  is  vast,  and  oftentimes  they  conceptually  overlap,  creating  confusion  about what is being said when one term could, or  could not, stand in for another. Saponaro  2007 ,  in trying to explain in a school assignment paper  what is Second Life, shows the slipperiness of  the labels as well as their interrelatedness: “Sec-             Mark Bell  2008 : A synchronous, persis- tent network of people, represented as ava- tars, facilitated by networked computers. Sarah  Robbins-Bell   2008 :  persistence;  multiuser; avatars; wide area network. Ralph  Schroeder   2008 :  persistent  vir- tual environments in which people experi- ence others as being there with them - and  where they can interact with them. Tom Boellstorff  2010 : places of human  culture  realized  by  computer  programs  through  the  Internet,  a  definition  that  in- cludes  online  games  but  excludes  things  like email and websites, and thus even so- cial networking sites like Facebook.      Across these definitions we see the following  similarities in what are defining characteristics:  people, computers, and space place. Differences  include: persistence, presence, avatars. None of  these definitions specifically address the represen- tation of the world, via computer graphics  2D or  3D  or text -- although Boellstorff  2010  stated  a virtual world does not need “visuality” -- and  the necessity of the interaction to be synchronous  versus asynchronous.  It appears academics agree that the label “vir- tual worlds” applies to a specific array of digital  technologies that require certain actions of the  user to engage with them. Specifically, the ma- terial object s  of a computer-network produces  a digital space within which people can gather.  Beyond that, agreements breakdown, especially  given  the  continual  emergence  of  objects  that  could be virtual worlds, such as Facebook games  like  Zynga’s  Farmville,  or  networked  console  videogames like Sony’s Little Big Planet. With- out agreed upon boundaries for what constitutes  a “virtual world”, what results is a vast array of  related virtual worlds technologies that may not  all be the same when it comes to how a person  engages with them.  The third consideration focuses on the labels  being used when academics discuss what it was   120   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  ond Life is defined trough different acronyms:  MUVE  Multiplayer Virtual Environment  is the  most used, but it’s even ascribed at the MMOGs’  family   Massively  Multiplayer  Online  Game ,  wherein it’s defined as a MMOSG  Massively  Multiplayer Online Social Game  to distinguish  it among other role play games  MMORPG .”  Without agreed upon terms, communication can  become complicated and unsuccessful.  Virtual Worlds as New Media  While we may disagree as to what constitutes a  virtual world, or even what to call such objects,  there is no denying that virtual worlds technolo- gies are positioned as new media. They are a new  media technology because they are, or at least  rely  on,  digital  media.  They  require  computer  code  for  programming  the  multimedia  content  of text, audio and visual that produces the digital  environments within which individuals interact  with each other and the environment  Bell, 2008;  Schroeder, 2008 .  However, being a new medium indicates that  these technologies are undergoing a period of flux  as societies and cultures determine how to “man- age” them. Gitelman and Pingree  2003  argued  that when any new media technology is introduced  into society and the marketplace, if it is able to  maintain and grow in presence, then it will enter  a period of flux in which its presence challenges  the “ritualized conventions of existing media”.  …when new media emerge in a society, their place  is at first ill defined, and their ultimate meanings  or  functions  are  shaped  over  time  by  society’s  existing habits of media use  which, of course,  derive  from  experience  with  other,  established  media , by shared desires for new uses, and by the  slow process of adaptation between the two. The  ‘crisis’ of a new medium will be resolved when the  perceptions of the medium, as well as its practical  uses, are somehow adapted to existing categories   of public understanding about what the medium  does for whom and why.  p. xii    Lievrouw and Livingstone  2002  argued there  exists a process of innovation in new media de- velopment, where existing devices, practices, and  arrangements are continually being innovated by  designers, users, and regulators. The more innova- tive and iterative turns taken amongst these actors,  the  more  normalized  the  new  media  becomes,  reducing the ideological tension and conceptual  flux that originally surrounded it.  With each new media technology introduced,  we can see the same recurring ideological ten- sions  Manovich, 2003 . In the 1800s, new com- munication technologies were met with the same  tension of “fascination and fear”  Marvin, 1988   as  today’s  virtual  worlds  technologies   Golub,  2010 . These tensions fuel public and academic  interest in studying the new media technology. The  particular interest is in how the different behaviors  implicated by the new technology support either  side of the tension. As virtual worlds technologies  become more integrated into people’s everyday  lives, then this period of flux and tension typically  dissipates. What the technology is will crystallize,  and how societies and cultures can manage them  will become normalized. We will know we have  reached that point when this period of flux has  diminished.  Of course, one method to make this period  diminish  may  be  through  judicious  study  and  mapping  of  the  various  definitions  and  terms  being used by academics, and even other actors  like practitioners, designers and the public. Such  a solution would ultimately entail having “the”  definition and “the” jargon agreed upon through  negotiation of all the actors’ epistemological and  ontological stances. I am suggesting a solution that  entails gathering further evidence as to how people  make sense of virtual worlds technologies as part  of their everyday lives and the mediascape within  which it is entangled. Understanding how people  make sense of these technologies, in relation to   121   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  technology or “magic circle” conceptualizations   Golub, 2010 . Any “membrane” must be seen  as permeable due to the user bringing into the  world his or her own lived experiences  Malaby,  2009 .  By  placing  virtual  worlds  technologies  within these “magic circles”, we further the con- ceptualization of them as unique and worthy of  special  consideration,  reinforcing  the  flux  that  surrounds them. Instead, these technologies need  to be understood for how they are as interwoven  into people’s lives as other media technologies. There have been studies that have compared  engaging with virtual worlds to engaging with  “real world”, or the physical world, or comparing  engagings with different virtual worlds technolo- gies. I discuss these two trends in the following  sections,  followed  by  how  such  studies  fail  to  address the types of comparisons needed to be  useful to handling the flux.  Comparing the Physical  and the Virtual  Studies have compared experiences in a virtual  world to experiences in the physical world. The  typical approach is to ascertain if some psycho- logical, sociological or cultural aspect of living  in  the  “real  world”  will  manifest  similarly  or  differently in a “virtual world”. Even studies that  do not explicitly compare the physical world to a  virtual world appear implicitly interested in under- standing how similar or different “being” in the  latter is compared to the former  examples: Fox  & Bailenson, 2009; Lo, 2008; Pena, Hancock &  Merola, 2009 . Currently, one line of inquiry on  this topic informs the argument on the viability  of virtual worlds as places for experimenting to  understand and or modify human behaviour  see  Gillath,  McCall,  Shaver  &  Blascovich,  2008;  Moore, Wiederhold, Wiederhold & Riva, 2002 .  Overall, underlying questions in these comparison  studies  focus  on  how  close  virtual  worlds  can  replicate, represent, and remediate the physical  world and human behaviours from it.  each other and to other media technologies, could  provide empirical evidence to help academics and  others have a basis for the negotiation of answers  to the question of “what is a virtual world”.  COMPARING ENGAGINGS  It is my contention that virtual worlds technologies  should be studied as just another medium people  engage with during their daily lives. I make this  assertion based on three reasons. First, differentia- tions between “new” and “old” are unnecessary.  According to media historian Carolyn Marvin,  other generations have remarked about the shifts  in technology and society: “If our own experience  is unique in detail, its structure is characteristically  modern.”  1988, p. 3 . Each new medium does  not emerge from a vacuum to become a unique  object: the new develops out of the potentials and  pitfalls of the old. Instead of seeing engaging with  virtual worlds technologies as being unique due to  the characteristics of the technologies, we need to  recognize that all media technologies are unique  due to their specific characteristics.  Second, virtual world technologies appear to  be three types of communication media simultane- ously. They are the result of computer networked  technologies,  where  computers  communicate  with each other. They are a visual and auditory  manifestation of a digital environment that com- municates the representation of the environment to  the user. They are a framework of communication  channels, which allows for users to communicate  with each other. What results is a communication  technology that is simultaneously a mass medium  and an interpersonal medium.  Third, differentiations between what happens  inworld  versus  offline  unnecessarily  separate  engaging with virtual worlds technologies from  engaging with other media products. This ten- sion  appears  in  the  extent  to  which  academics  will  define  the  virtual  world  as  being  separate  from the “actual” world due to “membrane” of   122   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  The  majority  of  these  studies  appear  to  fo- cus  on  the  performance  of  specific  cognitive  or  physical  tasks.  Flannery  and  Walles   2003   experimentally tested whether or not knowledge  about what constitutes an office in the physical  world would be accessed when evaluating a virtual  office. Mania and Chalmers  2001  experimentally  compared learning in virtual reality set-ups and  a more traditional physical world classroom for  memory retention. Jackson, Zhao and Witt  2009   conducted a survey to understand the relationship  of morality between the physical world and virtual  worlds. Bideau, Kulpa, Ménardais et al  2003   experimentally compared a handball goalkeeper’s  actions in the physical world and a virtual recon- struction of a stadium. In an experiment, Arnold,  Farrell, Pettifer and West  2002  had participants  complete a skilled motor task of passing a metal  hoop across a series of joined metal pipes: either  first in the real world, or first in a virtual world  accessed via a head mounted display.  Studies  that  compare  internal  and  external  behaviors  tend  to  be  focused  more  on  narrow  aspects of engaging with the virtual world: motor  tasks, memory retention, and so forth. There is  less focus on aspects of engaging that are more  complicated, such as enjoyment or communica- tion practices  Golub, 2010 , or on considering a  number of these factors concurrently. An example  of  a  study  comparing  more  complex  practices  comes from Castronova, Williams, Shen et al’s   2009  experimental and survey examination of  economic systems and behaviors in MMORPGs.  While less complex than economics, Friedman,  Karniel and Dinur  2009  employed the virtual  world Second Life in an experiment to compare  group discussions inworld and outworld.  Comparing Different  Media Technologies  More similar to the argument being made in this  chapter are those studies that have compared dif- ferent media technologies to various virtual worlds   technologies. In a longitudinal study, Smyth  2007   randomly  assigned  people  to  play  one  of  four  types of games for a month: arcade, console, sole  computer, or MMORPG. In an experiment, Persky  and Blascovich  2007  tested for the impact of  violent content on aggressive tendencies between  people playing a desktop computer game or an  immersive  version  accessed  via  head  mounted  display. Chen and Raney  2009  experimentally  compared playing a Nintendo Wii game or a Flash  game about boxing, or watching a DVD clip, for  impacts on mood. Bailenson, Patel, Nielsen et al   2008  analyzed an experiment on learning Tai  Chi moves from video versus virtual reality.  Sometimes this type of comparison study will  overlap with studies comparing physical world to  virtual world performance when one of the media  technologies studied is a physical, tangible object.  In an experiment about sense-making, Antoniettei  and Cantoia  2000  compared a static image of  art to an immersive virtual environment. For their  experiment, Mania and Chalmers  2001  compared  task performance when information was commu- nicated via a physical lecture, a desktop virtual  environment, a head mounted virtual reality, or  audio  only.  In  another  experiment, Antoniettei  and Mellone  2003  had people play either the  physical or virtual version of a game and compared  performance with each.  Where Lacking Comparisons Persist  The  studies  discussed  above  are  examples  of  trends in  research that compare engaging with  a  virtual  world  technology  to  something  else.  Looking across these studies, they tend to lack the  two aspects that I aruge are necessary for making  deep understandings out of such comparisons: the  type of deep understandings that could help us  address the question of “what is a virtual world”.  First, they lack a focus on comparing the complex,  situated sense-making processes involved with  engaging with these virtual worlds technologies.  Second, there has been more work done compar-  123   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  virtual worlds technologies than virtual worlds to  other media technologies and the physical world,  with some exceptions  examples: Castronova et  al, 2009; Friedman et al, 2009; Smyth, 2007 .  Additionally,  there  has  been  less  focus  on  comparing virtual worlds technologies to media  products  that  are  further  removed  from  them  taxonomically. That is, most of the comparisons  to other media technologies have been similar in  terms of being a game  ex. Antoniettei & Mel- lone, 2003; Persky & Blascovich, 2007; Smyth,  2007  or something else that requires visual cues   ex.  Antoniettei  &  Cantoia,  2000;  Bailenson,  Patel, Nielsen et al, 2008; Chen & Raney, 2009;  Mania  &  Chalmers,  2001 .  Such  comparisons  make  theoretical  and  conceptual  sense,  given  the similarities in engaging with such technolo- gies, and thus more should be done to understand  such overlaps. However, we may also learn new  similarities, and differences, when we compare  virtual worlds technologies to media products that  appear to be less similar to them, such as music  and books.  STUDYING COMPARISONS  In this section I explain my suggestion for how to  compare engagings with different media products.  It is my argument that to truly compare, we need  to understand all the ways engagings can overlap,  and to make comparisons in those overlaps for  similarities and differences. In order to understand  these overlaps, we need to map out engagings. I  am suggesting a focus on complex, situated sense- making processes for comparing engagings with  the variety of media products that constitutes the  everyday lifeworlds of users  Reinhard & Dervin,  2010 . What I discuss in this section are a  what  are situated sense-making processes, and b  what  are methods to measure these processes for com- paring media reception situations.  ing virtual worlds technologies to each other and  the physical world than comparing them to other  media products.  First,  the  majority  of  these  studies  are  ex- perimental, quantitative, and focused on specific  aspects of engaging without consideration of the  complexity involved in these media reception situ- ations. They appear to study the media reception  situation from the perspective of the technology,  and how the features of the technology impact the  engaging with it. Sometimes the research brings in  sociodemographic and or psychographic features  of the person to test for interactions with the tech- nological features, such as Persky and Blascovich   2007  comparing gender, violent and nonviolent  content, and desktop versus head mounted display.  However, overall, there is less consideration for the  mediating, moderating, and interacting influences  of the sense-making processes that occur within  the situations of engaging. Without accounting for  these influences, the actual operations of a person  engaging with a technology, and how a person  understands what is a virtual world, especially  in comparison to other media products, cannot  be fully understood  Reinhard & Dervin, 2010;  Potter & Tomasello, 2003 .  Second, most previous works have focused on  virtual worlds technologies, specifically digital  games and virtual reality interfaces. Less work ap- pears to have been done on what researchers would  more generally consider to be virtual worlds, given  the most agreed upon definition discussed previ- ously. Digital games found in arcades, on console  systems, and standalones on computers are not  persistent, networked digital environments that  continue progression without the involvement of  the player. Virtual reality interfaces may provide  access to a virtual world, but the presence of a head  mounted display, haptic gloves, and other related  interface devices is not sufficient to say there is a  virtual world being studied. In most studies that  utilize VR  interfaces,  what  is  called  a  “virtual  world” is just a digital environment. Thus, there  appears to have been more work done to compare   124   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  Situated Sense-Making Processes  When studying a media reception situation, the  focus  should  be  neither  on  the  person  nor  the  virtual  worlds  technology,  but  on  those  times  and spaces when the person and the technology  interact within the situation and how the person  makes sense of such interactions  Giddings, 2009;  Reinhard & Dervin, 2010 . The main analytical  interest  should  be  the  mapping  of  differences  and similarities as not just due to technological  or content features and or sociodemographic or  psychographic  features,  but  on  complex,  situ- ated sense-making processes. There needs to be  a focus on the complex, interconnected internal  and external cognitive, affective, and behavioural  processes that constitute sense-making as it oc- curs during the engaging. This call for focusing  on situated sense-making processes comes from  other researchers as well.  Some researchers have argued on the inter- twinement of online and offline sense-making.  Golub  2010  argued for the need to study not just  the users when inworld, but also how those worlds  they engage with are part of the larger fabric of  their lifeworlds. Marvin  1988  argued that since  we  always  use  our  bodies  to  engage  with  any  media, engaging with a new medium draws upon  the body’s experience with older media: we make  sense of the new based on what we know from  the old. Malpas  2009  argued that virtual worlds  are not autonomous from the non-virtual world of  people’s everyday lives: the systems that constitute  virtual worlds are dependent for their structure  and meaning on the pre-established systems that  constitute the non-virtual world. Thus, how we  make sense of a virtual world is similar to how we  make sense of other engagings with other, older  media products, which is also related to how we  make sense of the non-mediated experiences we  have in our everyday lives. There is no online life  and offline life: there is just “life”.  Some researchers have argued for the need to  study the situation within which the engaging oc-  curs as the main unit of analysis. Dervin made it  her primary conceptual focus in her Sense-Making  Methodology  Dervin & Foreman-Wernet, 2003   that can be applied to compare different media  products with one another  see Dervin & Song,  2005;  Reinhard,  2008 .  Hoelig  and  Hasebrink   2008  argued to shift analytical focus from the  media technology to the user-within-situation to  understand what is being done with any media  product. Combining these arguments with those  made above, there is the foundation for an argu- ment that supports studying situated sense-making  processes. That is, to understand this intertwine- ment between the online and offline – to understand  the cognitive and affective processes of making  sense of just “life” – we need to take a situationality  approach to our studies of media reception. With  a microscopic focus on the situation we can see  the operations that occur as people make sense of  their lives, whether online or offline.  What I and others are advocating is for audi- ence and reception studies that focus on mapping  these complex, situated sense-making processes  during media reception situations. To do so re- quires a methodological and methodical focus on  a  understanding sense-making processes and b   comparing media reception situations that involve  differing media products. By positioning virtual  worlds technologies as media products, I extend  this theoretical, methodological, and methodical  suggestion to the creation of studies to understand  people’s engagings with virtual worlds. What fol- lows are my suggestions for how methodological  approaches and research methods could be applied  to this pursuit, with examples given from work  my colleagues and I have already done.  Three Approaches to Methods  I do not consider there to be just one method- ological approach or method that can be usefully  applied  in  this  endeavor.  Instead,  a  variety  of  methods could be applied, as they currently ex- ist or with some alteration. Such methods could   125   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  person’s memory. Additionally, while there are  problems associated with recall -- in that people  may not be able to faithfully recite the engagings  moment-by-moment -- there are means by which  to adjust the method to account for this lacking.  One approach would be to utilize an interview,  questionnaire or focus group informed by Dervin’s  Sense-Making Methodology  Dervin, 2008 .  Other approaches can be seen in the studies  that, to some extent, appear to be accounting for  this dual focus on situated sense-making processes  and comparing engagings. There have been stud- ies focused on understanding in more depth the  sense-making  processes  of  engaging  with  one  virtual world. Shin  2009  conducted a quanti- tatively intensive survey analysis of Second Life  users to understand motivations to engaging with  the world. Oliver and Carr  2009  interviewed  couples who played World of Warcraft together  to understand how they make sense of playing as  it related to other aspects of their lives.  Other studies have sought to compare experi- ences with a more than one virtual world. Kieger   2010  surveyed self-identified entrepreneurs of  two  virtual  worlds,  Second  Life  and  Entropia,  for how used the worlds and made sense of them  for business purposes. Still others have looked at  virtual worlds compared to other media products.  Sivunen and Siitonen  2010  interviewed interna- tional organizational teams and their use of media  technologies for communicating and compared  them  to  MMO  gaming  clans’  communication  techniques.  With all these examples, the recollections tend  not to be situationally anchored; although, it is not  unheard of. With Sivunen and Siitonen  2010 ,  the MMO gaming clan members were asked to  answer the interview questions with the recollec- tion of specific situations. Anchoring the interview,  questionnaire or focus group to specific situations  would  yield  even  more  information  about  the  sense-makings people had when engaging with  these virtual world technologies.  be employed from a quantitative or qualitative  approach, as long as the method is anchored in  the dual requirements to measure situated sense- making processes for the purposes of comparing  media reception situations.  Instead  of  bifurcating  into  quantitative  and  qualitative, a better distinction would be to con- sider how researchers locate the media reception  situations. There are at least three ways to do this.  In this final section, I discuss what I see as these  three locations, with examples that illustrate the  type of studies being done to compare engagings  from them. These locations are: a  “recollection”,  locating the media reception situation in the past  experiences of everyday life; b  “everyday”, locat- ing the media reception situation in the everyday  experience as it occurs; c  “artificial”, locating  the media reception situation in the laboratory  experience as it occurs.  Recollection  On approach would be to compare engagings by  locating the media reception situations that have  already occurred in the course of the person’s ev- eryday life. The methods for this approach would  focus on people’s  recollection of the engaging  and  the  situated  sense-making  processes  from  it. Interviews, questionnaires and focus groups  have a long history of being used for this purpose,  replete with advantages  e.g. cost effectiveness   and disadvantages  e.g. problems of recall . With  the proper anchoring on situated sense-making  processes and comparing engagings, these meth- ods could be applied from either a quantitative or  qualitative approach.  Indeed,  so  fundamental  are  these  methods  that they would likewise be useful in measuring  situated  sense-making  processes  for  the  other  two  locations.  What  separates  them  into  their  own approach is the focus on recollection. While  recollection may play a role in the everyday and  the artificial, it is central to this approach: through  these methods, the past can be recalled from the   126   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  Everyday  A second approach would be to locate and under- stand people’s sense-making in these engagings  in  the  context  of  their  everyday  lives.  Unlike  recollection, the focus would be to understand the  sense-makings as they occurred within the context  of the person’s daily life. Traditionally, such a fo- cus has been the purview of ethnographies. While  there are other methodological approaches, given  the history of ethnographies in social sciences, I  will focus my discussion on how ethnographic  approaches can be useful for studying situated  sense-making processes to compare engagings. Ethnographies  have  helped  us  understand  how various media products are integrated into  the everyday lives of people, and the sense they  make  of  these  media  products  as  part  of  their  lifeworlds   Moores,  1993;  Bird,  2003 .  Ethno- graphic approaches use a variety of methods, such  as  participant-observation,  text  analysis,  focus  group and interview. At a meso-level analysis, a  media ecology approach focuses on the specific  situational contexts in which sense is made before,  during and after engagings with virtual worlds and  other media products. This approach could provide  an in-depth analysis of “what people really do with  media, rather than what we imagine they might do,  or what close readings of texts assume they might  do”  Bird, 2003, p.191, italics in original . At a  micro-level analysis, Giddings  2009  has called  for a moment-by-moment ethnographic analysis  of gameplay as it occurs  “microethology” : his  argument is based on the need to understand the  moment s  of intersection between technology,  content and user.  There  have  been  examples  of  ethnographic  methods used to study people’s engaging with vir- tual world technologies from the vantage of within  the physical world and or in a virtual world  i.e.  virtual ethnography . One approach is to have an  in-depth investigation of one virtual world. Boell- storff  2008  conducted a two year ethnographic  study of the cultures and inhabitants of Second   Life. Others have done less intensive ethnographic  studies by going inworld with specific questions  in mind. Ostrander  2008  studied situated sense- making processes when she examined information  seeking behaviors in Second Life.  Another approach is to compare more than one  virtual  world.  Researchers  observed  behaviors  at specific types of locations across a variety of  worlds  Star Wars Galaxy, City of Heroes, Second  Life, EverQuest II, World of Warcraft, EverQuest  Online Adventures, and There  to understand how  they were being constructed as public spaces or  “third places”  Moore, Gathman & Ducheneaut,  2009 . Voulgari and Komis  2010  combined their  participant observations with interviews of play- ers to understand collaborative problem-solving  processes in Lineage II and Tribal Wars.  Other  ethnographies  have  approached  the  subject from the position of seeing the engaging  with the virtual world in a larger framework of  engagings and lived experiences. Golub  2010   discussed his experience with a guild in World of  Warcraft for how they utilized a variety of media  technologies across their lives to conduct guild  business. Albrechtslund  2010  followed gamers’  storytelling on different websites to understand  their processes of meaning making as it related to  their identity constructions. In studying Whyville. net, the researchers focused analytically on “an  insider gaming practice” which allowed them to  follow the users’ activities across gaming spaces,  both online and offline  Feldon & Kafai, 2008;  Fields & Kafai, 2008 .  However, none of the examples given were  studies  that  compared  situations  of  engaging  with different media products. Those studies that  looked at use of media technologies outside of the  virtual world were primarily interested in how  such technologies were integrated into the person’s  engaging with the virtual world. A media ecology  ethnography, combined with a “microethology”,  would be intensive and expensive, but also ex- pansive for our knowledge, and thus worthy of  the investment.  127   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  reception situations under controlled conditions.  While, typically, experiments approach data col- lection from a quantitative approach, they could  be restructured for a more qualitative approach  to  measure  situated  sense-making  processes   Reinhard, 2010b . As experiments traditionally  have structures for making comparisons among  conditions,  the  addition  of  a  qualitative  data  collection would help to compare situated sense- making processes.  Indeed,  the  artificiality  of  the  experimental  framework  could  illuminate  the  sense-making  processes by allowing for a moment-by-moment  analysis of them. Dervin  2008  discussed how  what appears to be, to the observer, a cohesive,  solitary  situation  can  be  broken  down  into  “micro-moments”  of  time-space:  in  essence,  mini-situations embedded in the larger situation.  German reception theorists such as Iser  Holub,  1984   have  discussed  how  there  exists  “gaps”  structured into a text that influence the process,  over time, of reading the text. Thus, each moment  of engaging with a media product could require  sense-making.  To understand situated sense-making processes  in-depth,  a  moment-by-moment  accounting  of  them  would  be  useful  to  understand  how  they  relate to the media product and the context of the  situation. The ability to control the conditions of  the engaging in an experiment could facilitate such  a mapping. Josephs  2000  discussed the utility  of the artificial lab environment “to slow down  the meaning-making process in order to gain ac- cess to it.”  p. 124 . Talk aloud protocols could  be combined with recollection and observation  methods to surround the situated sense-making  processes as they occurred and afterwards.  Such an experimental design requires more  measurement of sense-making than the application  of pre- and post-test questionnaires typically allow.  One example of a more involved measurement  comes from Hindmarsh, Heath and Fraser  2006 ,  who analyzed people’s conversations while they  engaged with a desktop virtual reality interface.   Research Example The following is an example of an ethnographic  study that compared media reception situations  involving two different types of virtual worlds. The  particular research focus was on how people made  sense of their avatars in specific situations and in  general. My colleague on the Virtual Worlds Re- search Project, Sisse Siggård Jensen  2009; 2010   conducted  participant  observations  and  in-situ  video interviews at the homes or offices of users  of Second Life and players of EverQuest. During  these sessions, the interviewees led her through  their own experiences with the respective virtual  world, discussing and interpreting their actions  for her during these research journeys.  Jensen  analyzed  these  “sense-makings  in  practice” for how the people discussed the role of  their avatars. She found similarities in how people  discussed their avatars across the different types of  engagings people had with the virtual worlds, and  thus across the two very different virtual worlds.  She argued that analyzing these engagings with  virtual worlds through the interpretive perspective  of the users helped her to find similarities between  the gaming-based world and the user-driven world. What  Jensen’s  work  shows  is  the  utility  of  studying  sense-makings  to  compare  different  virtual worlds. Because her topic was focused on  understanding avatars, there was no feasible way  to compare these engagings to the variety of media  products that do not contain avatars. However,  her focus on comparing through sense-making  processes is the reason this study is included as an  example for how an ethnographic method could  be applied to this line of study being proposed.  Artificial  The third approach would locate media reception  situations within artificial conditions. Essentially,  this would entail examining engagings as they  occurred  outside  of  the  context  of  a  person’s  everyday life. Commonly, this approach utilizes  the artificiality of the laboratory to create media   128   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  However, they did not study a virtual world, and  they did not compare the sense-making of the VR  interface to other media technologies.  Research Example The following is an example of a study I conducted  where I examined how novice users made sense  of the two types of virtual worlds, gaming and  social, in comparison to two older media products,  film and video games. The two virtual worlds I  studied were City of Heroes and Second Life. I  controlled for different types of media technolo- gies to produce media reception situations with  different requirements on their actions and, pos- sibly, their sense-makings. To do so, I utilized  the framework of the experiment to structure the  comparisons,  while  I  used  various  qualitative  methods to measure the situated sense-making  processes  Reinhard, 2010b .  The study was a within-subjects experimen- tal  design  with  in-depth  qualitative  interviews  employed  alongside  talk  aloud,  surveys  and  observations  as  the  data  collection  methods.  Data collection occurred while participants were  engaging with the media products, via talk aloud  protocols, and afterwards when they were asked to  recall and compare these situations in open-ended  questionnaires  and  interviews  structured  using  Dervin’s Sense-Making Methodology  Reinhard  & Dervin, 2010 .  I  analyzed  how  the  participants  discussed  their  engagings  with  the  four  media  products.  In this analysis, I focused on areas of potential  overlap to compare sense-makings that occurred  when engaging with the virtual worlds to console  videogames and movies. By using Sense-Making  Methodology, I was able to illustrate how situated  sense-making  processes  can  provide  locations  of potential overlaps within which to compare  engagings  with  different  media  technologies   Reinhard & Dervin, 2010 . Using these overlaps,  similarities could be found across these engagings  in how people had questions about the engaging,  what they found helped or hindered them as they   engaged, and the roles their past experiences and  expectations played in how they made sense of  the engaging.  As with Jensen’s study, I collected data on the  participants’ engagings as they occurred. I also  sought their recollection of what happened using  Sense-Making Methodology to probe the experi- ence and have them discuss how it connected to  their  everyday  lives. As  with  both  studies,  the  focus on situated sense-making processes allowed  us  to  find  similarities  alongside  differences  in  how these engagings compare. The analysis of  these comparisons has just begun. Thus far, the  foundation has indicated the utility of combining  the artificial construct of the experiment with the  interviewing for situated sense-making processes.  CONCLUSION  Virtual worlds are no more special than any media  technology that existed before them. All media  technologies have affordances and constraints due  to their technological structures, which may align  or differ with other media technologies, and which  may be more or less useful for some purpose than  another. But each new media remediates upon the  older  Bolter & Grusin, 1999 , reconfiguring the  old to offer something new until the trajectory of  media technologies is a long history of innovation   Marvin, 1988 . Thus, virtual worlds are unique  and worthy of study, just as each media product  has  unique  characteristics  that  make  it  worthy  of  study. Virtual  worlds  are  both  different  and  no different than every other media product that  constitutes the fabric of a person’s lifeworld. As  such, they should be studied in conjunction with  studying  those  other  media  products  in  how  a  person makes sense of each as it relates to her life. Because we are in a period of flux, where our  understanding  of  and  the  potential  for  virtual  worlds are being forged, there are great opportuni- ties to explore how we study people’s engagings  with them. Indeed, doing so may better help us   129   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  REFERENCES  Albrechtslund, A. M.  2010 .

The approach advocated here is  not top-down theorizing but bottom-up empiriciz- ing: to understand how the people who engage  with  these  technologies  make  sense  of  them  in comparison to other media technologies for  what sets these technologies apart into something  categorizable  as  “virtual  worlds”.  Supporting  research that seeks to map the similarities and  differences  of  engaging  with  virtual  worlds  to  engaging  with  other,  more  established  media  products could foster the growth of virtual worlds  to reach their full potential.  The methodological and methodical approach- es discussed in this chapter are but one potential  means for handling the issue of what is a virtual  world. I am arguing that any of those approaches  could be useful in handling the problem if they are  structured a  to understand situated sense-making  processes during the engaging with b  different  media products. The approaches suggested are not  to say we should ignore differences that arise in  these comparative studies. However, we will not  know about similarities that exist until we look  for  them.  These  proposed  approaches  are  my  suggestions for where and how to start looking.  The examples given are from studies that have  only begun to go looking. I hope others will be  inspired to go looking after reading this chapter. In order for virtual worlds to become more  normalized, to emerge from the flux and become  more fully integrated into societies and cultures,  we have to stop focusing on them, and start focus- ing on the people who engage with them. Only  when we can show how virtual world users, and  non-users, make sense of these virtual worlds can  we show the potential they offer as a new computer  technology, a new communication medium, a new  entertaining pastime, a new instructional tool, and  a new venue for self-expression.  130   Virtual Worlds and Reception Studies  Benoit,  B.,  Kulpa,  R.,  Ménardais,  S.,  Fradet,  L., Multon, F., & Delamarche, P.  2003 .

Two groups of undergraduate medical students  Yr 3, n=14  were invited to participate. The research  question posed was: “In your opinion what are the advantages and disadvantages of learning in Second  Life compared with other methods?” Thirty items were generated in each group, then reduced to 10  items. These were classified into 3 themes 1  learning experience, 2  clinical exposure, and 3  technical  experience. Results from the first group focused on the learning experience highlighting its importance  for clinical diagnosis and a structure for learning. The second group focused on the clinical exposure  although they were ambivalent about the advantages of this type of delivery mode. Results show inter- esting findings highlighting the virtual patients developed follow a very linear approach which is not  challenging enough for medical students at that level.

Students’ Perceptions About Delivery of Game-Based Learning for Virtual Patients in Second Life  INTRODUCTION  Anecdotal evidence from teachers suggests that  the impact of gaming on millions of learners, who  grew up playing best-selling games such as SimC- ity is starting to be felt  Squire 2002 . According  to Prensky  2001 , these learners or ‘digital na- tives’ are native speakers of the digital language  of computers, video games, mobile phones and  any other digital technology that easily become  available. Some authors recognise the fact that  these learners have a cognitive style character- ised by multi-tasking while learning, with short  attention span during learning and an exploratory  and discovery approach to learning  Asakawa &  Gilbert, 2003; Bain & Newton, 2003; Prensky,  2005 .  However,  the  term  ‘digital  native’  has  been recently expanded by Prensky  2009  to fit  a wider audience that has grown up in the era of  digital technology. Prensky defines a new term  ‘digital wisdom’ emphasizing that the use of digital  technology in our everyday lives makes us wiser.  Digital  tools  already  extend  and  enhance  our  cognitive capabilities in a number of ways. Digital  technology enhances our memory, for example,  via data input output tools and electronic storage.  Digital data-gathering and decision-making tools  enhance judgment by allowing us to gather more  data than we could on our own.  Prensky, 2009   Video and computer games are in many ways  a  ‘perfect’  learning  mechanism  for  this  group   Prensky  2006 .  Learning  by  games  results  in  the acquisition of new knowledge, the transfer  of learning, the development of intellectual skills   abstraction,  anticipation,  strategy-building,  problem-solving, spatial representation, function- movement relationship , and the development of  behavior and attitudes  Whelan, 2005; Sauve et  al, 2007 .  The term game-based learning has emerged as  a generic name for the use of games for learning  or educational purposes. It has also been termed   ‘serious  games’,  and  includes  fully  immersive  virtual worlds, in which learners can take on virtual  presence within these worlds  Joint Information  Systems Committee 2007 . Gee  2003  also ob- served how successful game play and experiential  learning opportunities have been shown to share  common aspects.  The  game-based  learning  activities  for  the  delivery of virtual patients were designed based  on  the  four-dimensional  framework  developed  by De Freitas and Oliver  2006  and discussed by  the authors in other publications  Toro-Troconis  et al, 2008 , which provides a close relationship  with the systems of Activity Theory  Kuutti,1996 .  The learning types described by Helmer  2007 :  Demonstration, Experiential Learning, Diagnostic  activities, Role-Play and Constructive Learning  were also taken into account for the design. And  finally, it is worth highlighting the last three in- fluential factors taken into account in the design  which were described by Begg  2005 : Emergent  Narrative,  originally  described  by  Murray’s   1997 ,  The  Responsive  Environment  and  the  Psycho-social Moratorium originally described  by Gee  2003 .  The framework focuses on four main dimen- sions in advance of using games and simulations   De Freitas & Oliver, 2006 :                  particular  context  where  learning  takes  place,  including  macro-level  contextual  factors. attributes of the particular learner or learn- er group. internal representational world of the game  or simulation and pedagogic considerations, learning models  used, approaches, etc.  The Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College  London developed a Respiratory Ward in Second  Life with a series of virtual patients’ activities fol- lowing the framework and modes of representation  mentioned above. A range of game-based elements   139   Students’ Perceptions About Delivery of Game-Based Learning for Virtual Patients in Second Life  were introduced and delivered to the learner via  a Heads Up Display  HUD , which aims to keep  the learner informed of his her progress, show- ing the patients treated by the learner, how far  the learner is in the diagnostic process, his her  scores and the top scores for each patient  Figure  1 . A demo on YouTube can be accessed at: http:   tinyurl.com mwpm2r  The game-based learning activities aim to drive  experiential,  diagnostic  and  role-play  learning  activities within the 3-D world, aiming to support  students as they select investigations and make  diagnoses. The Respiratory Ward was developed  with five virtual patients, each with a different  respiratory condition, and each includes elements  of medical history, differential diagnosis, inves-  tigations, working diagnosis and production of a  management plan.  The delivery of virtual patients in Second Life  benefit from target user input during development.  Focus groups composed of undergraduate medical  students have been organised to gather feedback  about attitudes and barriers when accessing vir- tual patients in Second Life. As an alternative to  the focus group, the Nominal Group Technique   NGT ,  originally  developed  by  Delbecq,  Van  de Ven, and Gustafson for organizational deci- sion making and problem solving was used. The  NGT is a highly structured group process that is  used to generate prioritised list of responses to a  question or problem  Delbecq et at, 1975; IoM,  1985 . A primary purpose of the NGT is to ensure   Figure 1. Virtual Patient at the Respiratory Ward – Imperial College London region in Second Life  140   Students’ Perceptions About Delivery of Game-Based Learning for Virtual Patients in Second Life  that  opinions  of  all  participants  receive  equal  representation  Hall, 1983 .  One of the criticisms of nonstructured focus  groups is that there is often a tendency for discus- sions to become dominated by the opinions of the  most self-assured personalities in any group. The  NGT aims to limit this potential by offering and  forcing equal opportunities for each participant  to express their opinion  Carney, O. et al, 1996 .  EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY  Participants  This investigation focused on two groups of Year 3  undergraduate medical students. On average, par-  ticipants were 21 years old  + - 1.26 . The gender  distribution of the respondents was 7% female  n  = 1  and 93% male  n = 13 . Two sessions were  held with 6 in one group, and 8 in the other.  Process  An  introduction to  the  virtual hospital  and  the  Virtual Respiratory Ward was given to each group  of students. The students spent 30 minutes assess- ing five virtual patients at the Respiratory Ward  in groups of two  Figure 2 .  The moderation of the NGT was not research- er-led which avoided domination of the leader’s  concerns  rather  than  those  of  the  participants.  Three members of staff led the process and students  were asked to consider the following question:   Figure 2. Students assessing a virtual patient at the virtual Respiratory Ward  141   Students’ Perceptions About Delivery of Game-Based Learning for Virtual Patients in Second Life  “In  your  opinion  what  are  the  advantages  and  what are the disadvantages of learning in Second  Life compared with other methods?”.  The NGT process consisted of 6 stages  Fig-  ure 3 .  Results  The NGT was held at Imperial College, Sir Alex- ander Fleming building, London in April 2009.  The results of the NGT include the items generated  and the voting that gave the consensus opinion  on important items for inclusion. Initially, 30 pos- sible items that could be important in assessing  the advantages and disadvantages of learning in  Second  Life,  following  a  game-based  learning  model for virtual patients were generated by the  two groups. The 30 items generated by participants  during the silent phase and subsequently ranked  during the voting phase can be seen in Table 3 &  4. Table 1 & Table 2 only show the top 10 items  selected in each group.  Figure 3. The NGT process  Following the first round of voting, participants  had an opportunity to view the voting results and  express their opinions or discuss queries if it was  considered  some  items  had  been  emphasized  incorrectly in their opinion. The discussions that  preceded the first round of voting clearly influ- enced how individuals ultimately voted. Ten items  had received final votes in both groups resulting  in greater consensus  Table 5 .  The established items have been grouped into   three main areas in Table 5:  1.   Learning experience  L  2.   Clinical exposure  C  3.   Technical experience  T   DISCUSSION  The results of this NGT process established ten  items generated in each group to be taken into  account for the design of game-based learning for   142   Students’ Perceptions About Delivery of Game-Based Learning for Virtual Patients in Second Life  Table 1.

This process has  determined content validity by assuring students  agreement on the items to be evaluated further.  The final items generated by Group 1 were  mainly focused on the Learning Experience with   a total of 107 points. The second most popular  item among Group 1 was focused on the Clinical  experience with a total of 62 points leaving only  21 points to the Technical experience item.  Table 3.

Miss out on practical stuff – only theory.  Time taken away from learning - technical issues.  Not designed for teamwork, no expert to ask unless they happened to be there.  Too spoon fed for Seniors.  Motivating for junior levels.  Very easy to use in own time, anywhere.  Students can work at their own speed.  Break from other formats of learning.  Mimics game, conditioned to enjoy games, making learning memorable.  More applicable to learning on the wards ties in with wards.  Integrates learning that is not covered in other ways, e.g. breath sounds and other things not  always taught together as a package.  Not good learning tool.

The group also pointed out how the delivery of  virtual patients in this way would reduce doctor  patient contact and would not prepare them for  experiences on the ward. The only item discussed  around  the  technical  experience  area  was  the  advantage of accessing virtual patients in their  own time, anywhere.  The final items generated by Group 2 con- centrated mainly on the Clinical exposure with a  total of 282 points. This group highlighted the fact  that this delivery method was too simple to teach  diagnostic skills and more challenging scenarios  were required. Few items related to the Learning   experience were discussed mainly focused on the  advantage of making students remember better  bridging  the  gap  between  lectures  and  clinical  work. A  small  amount  of  students  did  not  see  the advantage of learning in the virtual hospital  over other forms of e-learning. This may be due  to the fact students are used to a wide variety of  interactive e-learning materials which are already  embedded in the curriculum and they are already  used to accessing and learning from.

REFERENCES  CONCLUSION  Consensus of these student groups has established  20  items  to  be  considered  for  the  delivery  of  virtual patients following a game-based learning  model in Second Life. With increased educational  research investigating interventions to evaluate the  educational advantages of virtual worlds, such an  instrument will be critical for the non-biased quali- tative analysis of these learning environments.  It is clear from the group items generated that  there are mixed opinions about how useful they  find learning in this way and no major technical  issues were found. On the other hand, the clini- cal experience was found to be too simple for the  delivery of virtual patients at Year 3 undergraduate  medicine  level,  suggesting  the  delivery  of  this  type of virtual patients should be aimed at earlier  years in the undergraduate medical curriculum.  More challenging scenarios following a branching  model and a ‘responsive environment’ that does not  necessarily follow one right path  Murrary, 1997;  Begg 2007 , should be constructed to target higher  level cognitive skills at more advanced clinical  years. Further thought needs to be given to the  type of clinical scenarios and skills acquisition best  suited to this form of learning. This may involve  scenarios where students can select investigations  or interventions which could cause harm in real  life such that experience can be obtained without  risk. Role-play - multi-user game-based learning  activities may also be developed in which students  could work together, with their responses affecting  the overall learning experience of the group. This  approach would challenge more advanced medical  students in their diagnosis processes emphasizing  communication and Inter professional skills. This  model would also exploit the multi-user capacity  presented in virtual worlds.  Asakawa, T., & Gilbert, N.  2003 .

Assunta, Italy  Eliane Schlemmer  Universidade do Vale dos Rios dos Sinos, Brazil  ABSTRACT Characteristic of the contemporaneous age, and taking advantage of the diffusion of digital technologies,  virtual communities are diffusing in the organization’s culture such as places where members can learn,  work, or simply meet. The evolution of the same digital technologies, and the development of Digital  Virtual Worlds in 3D  such as Second Life , permits now to think of new tools for the organizational  communities and for communities in general that could build new knowledge, share common practices,  and work together in immersive and collaborative spaces. Digital virtual spaces can contribute to change  the traditional structure and definition of virtual communities, and can also contribute to their digital  development, in the field of participation.  INTRODUCTION  This paper aims to present the possibilities offered  by some new technologies and cultural paradigms  to the organizational world, particularly investigat- ing the concept of Virtual Learning Community of  Practice in the context of 3D technologies. There- fore the concept of Metaverse and the characters  of Metaverse technology will be useful to define  the possibilities that could be realized in the field  of the Virtual Community.  DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch010  Starting from the importance and the characters  of  the  so-called  “  contemporaneous Age”,  and  from the centrality of the digitalization process,  we are going to describe Virtual Learning Com- munities of Practice as communities that produce  knowledge, make subjects express their emotions,  create spaces of collaboration and cooperation.  The success cases of UNISINOS  ECODI Ricesu  e ECODI PPGs  will show the role of Metaverse  technology  in  the  creation  of  several  Virtual  Learning Communities of Practice.

Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  state  that  the  importance  of  Digital  Technolo- gies  is  in  offering  the  possibility  of  creating  and  implementing  communities.  In  developing  communities, emotions play an important role:  members  of  communities  express  themselves  online trough different tools, not only writing;  voice,  ‘smiles’  and  graphic video  expressions  contribute  to  communicate  different  feelings.  Therefore, different digital technologies offer the  possibility of members sharing emotional ties; in  the case of Metaverse technology, this possibility  is developed by textual language, voice, graphics  and sign language. It means that the members’  personality can be expressed by his way of writing,  his opinions in a discussions, the customization of  his own avatar and so on; Virtual Learning Com- munities of Practice are surely involved in this  process, and are based on maintaining relations  and developing new interactions.  Neal Stephenson coined the term Metaverse in  his postmodern novel Snow Cash  1992 , where it  represents a fictional virtual world. For the author,  Metaverse is a lifelike private and public utility, an  extension of the physical world’s real space within  an Internet virtual space. Therefore, Metaverse  is  constituted  in  cyberspace,  and  according  to  Lemos  2002  it is the technological incarnation  of the old daydream of creating a parallel world,  a collective memory, with the imagery, myths and  symbols, pursuing man since ancestral times, and  is  materialised  with  the  creation  of  DVW3Ds,  where subjects represented by avatars experience  immersion in a digital virtual environment, by  interacting  and  creating  several  3D  spaces  for  living and living together, thus allowing paral- lel worlds to emerge. DVW3Ds are multimedia  environments  Boccia Artieri, 2004 , permitting  communication through supporting technologies,  3D representation, computer-graphics modelling.  DVW3D  are  materialised  through  3D  graphic  representations  and  require  human  actions  to  come into being. Without the acting of e-citizens  through their avatars, DVW3D would not come  about at all. Any action by the avatars has real-  BACKGROUND  According to Castells  1999 , the contemporane- ous age can be called ‘Information Age’: main  processes and functions are growing organized in  Nets. These Nets put in order a new social mor- phology, and the diffusion of Net logic modifies  productive, cultural and social processes, and also  experience processes. Therefore, Net is a system  of interconnected elements that can also connect  to other elements, creating other Nets and creat- ing “new orders in the world and in heads”  Eco,  2004, p. 162 .  The new paradigm of Information Age consist  in the capacity of information and communication  technology in diffusing the Net into the social  structure. The  power  of  information  and  com- munication flows is more important and stronger  than political power: to be or not to be present in  the Net and in relation with other nets is a cru- cial element to dominate and transform society.  In this framework, virtual communities play an  important role, because communities live in Nets  and constitute Nets: the same constitution of the  Net passes trough people that are in it, building  relations with other people, building infinite Nets. Moreover,  according  to  Veen  e  Vrakking   2006 ,  a  new  generation  is  emerging  in  the  contemporaneous age: the Digital Natives. This  generation lives absorbed by digital virtual tools  and environments, using them daily to connect  with people, especially building communities.  According  to  Levy   1999   and  Palloff  and  Pratt  1999 , virtual communities are defined as  electronic  Nets  of  interactive  communication,  constituted by sharing interests, knowledge, com- mon projects and tools to realize it, established  in a cooperation process. Communities can also  be characterized by identity processes  Turkle,  1999; Wenger, 2006 : members of communities  experiment  ‘sense  of  membership’  because  of  sharing common contents. Members are involved,  moreover,  by  social  relations  and  interactions:  because of this, Levy  1999  and Castells  1999    150   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  time results; that is, at the very instant the avatar  acts, the DVW3D is modified and updated. The  Digital  Virtual  World  offers  multiple  ways  to  interact, which may be developed using different  languages: textual, oral, gestural and graphic.  According to Klastrup  2003 , a virtual world  is  a  persistent  online  representation,  which  contains the possibility of synchronous interac- tion  between  users  and  between  the  user  and  the world that exists within the framework of a  space designed as a navigable universe. Virtual  worlds are worlds you can move in, by means of  a persistent representation of the user, in contrast  to the worlds represented by traditional fiction,  which are presented as inhabited by real people,  but not actually inhabitable  Klastrup, 2003: 2 . According to Schlemmer  2004 , a DVW3D  may be a relatively faithful facsimile of the physi- cal world, or it may be an unique creation based  on entirely imaginary representations, modelling  itself  on  non-physical  space  for  digital-virtual  living together. These worlds may have rules of  their own, and its inhabitants can make use of their  creative powers, since they are not limited to any  existent physical rule. One of the key characteris- tics of DVW3D is that they are dynamic systems  that change in real time as subjects interact with it.  VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES  Online  learning  developed  by  the  constitution  of  Virtual  Learning  Communities  of  Practice–  VLCP  represents,  nowadays,  not  only  a  world  tendency but, moreover, a reality that develops  both in formal education  Institutions, Universities  and Research Centers , and informal education   organization and firms .  The term “virtual communities”  VCs  gained  strength  in  1993,  with  Rheingold’s  book  “The  Virtual  Community”.  According  to  Rheingold   2004  virtual communities are “... social aggrega- tions that emerge on the network when a group of  people carries on public discussions long enough   and with enough human emotion, to form networks  of relationships in cyberspace.” However other  researchers, over time, have also dealt with this  definition, such as Lévy  1999  and Palloff and  Pratt  1999  that define “virtual communities” such  as interactive electronic communication networks,  formed from affinities of interests, ideas, projects  and mutual exchange values are established in a  cooperation process.  According to Castells  2003 , there are two  main aspects on which the VCs work: free and  horizontal  communication   linked  to  global  practice  of  free  expression  that  arise  with  the  creation of the Internet , and shared values  that  he  calls  “formation  of  autonomous  networks,”  which means that any subject can form a group  and disseminate its own information . Thus, the  development of a VC is based on interconnection,  through  contacts  and  interactions  of  all  kinds,  involving  and  incorporating  different  forms  of  expression as well as the diversity of interests,  values and imaginations, including the expres- sion of conflicts.  According to Turkle  1999 , a community is  linked to identity; therefore a community cannot  exist in the interim. Turkle  1999  is interested in  the effects of “identity” in the experiential online,  which involves the feeling of permanence expe- rienced when one assumes a role, becoming part  of the life of another one, which is typical of the  community. “It will come, however, to call the  places not transient Internet community, because  I believe that the issue remains open. In any case,  I turn to them in that effects of identity. To them,  to weave personal stories.”  Turkle, 1999, p. 2 . A VC is constituted by people who share the  same interests and goals, and that interact using  different  languages   textual,  oral,  gestural  and  graphic , over various digital technologies which  have the Internet as a platform. Thus, a collective  VC is semi-permanent, depending on the mainte- nance and on the interest of the participants, be- cause it feeds the flow of interactions and concerns   151   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  new knowledge is not automatic, nor for men. The  knowledge produced by an individual is the result  of experiments, theoretical knowledge, skills he  possesses.  Moretti, 2009 p. 5:06   For VLCP we intend here a Virtual Learning  Community of Practice that daily learn, work and  act in and for the organization whom concern. In  our perspective  Moretti, 2009  a Virtual Com- munity  of  Practice  is  rarely  not  also  a  Virtual  Learning Community; practices developed by the  community become knowledge available for all  the members  and, at least, for the organization ,  and a continue process of learning is developed  into the community’s activities.  Nonaka and Takeuchi  1998  build a model  describing the organizational knowledge flows;  in their model, organizational knowledge passes  through  several  processes  of  sharing  tacit  and  explicit  knowledge,  sharing  tacit  knowledge  through  sharing  experiences  and  processes  of  creation knowledge. Creation of knowledge, in  particular,  can  be  developed  in  spaces  called  BA  Nonaka, Konno, 1999 ; a BA is a common  context where knowledge is created, shared and  used through interaction processes. A BA, in our  opinion, can be considered as a community-space  where members can share and create knowledge,  also through the sharing of tacit knowledge  expe- riences and implicit knowledge . Surely, a BA is  a formalized and structured space; but one of its  most important characteristics is represented by  the interaction among the members, the frequent- ers of the common space. The BA is a “shared  space for emerging relationships”, and it could  be virtual, physical, mental, or a combination of  different “spaces”  Organizations have to think of nonconformist  ways and practices in online learning and in the  constitution implementation  of  virtual  commu- nities; this means, finding new tools to improve  people’s competencies in communities, learning  processes  and  development  of  good  practices   Wenger, 2006 . In our opinion, the Metaverse   and human relations that are deterritorialized in  the digital virtual space.  Looking for the production of knowledge re- lated to VCs, we find derivations such as virtual  learning communities - VLCs, virtual relation- ship communities - VRCs, virtual community of  practice - VCPs, among others, both expressions  of a culture of real virtuality. In this chapter we  will discuss VLCs and VCPs in particular.  In our perspective, a “virtual learning com- munity”  VLC  can be understood as a group of  people that act and interact through telepresence,  and through digital virtual presence  Schlemmer  et alii, 2008 - 2009 , sharing common interests  and  learning  together,  defining  learning  objec- tives, strategies and actions, in order to achieve  them in a timeless time and in a communication  stream of digital virtual nature. The main purpose  is learning.  In our perspective, a “virtual community of  practice”   VCP   has  as  its  main  objective  to  exchange information- generate and share knowl- edge - mainly linked to professional practice and it  can be linked to formal organizations or informal.  According to Moretti  2009   “Produce  knowledge  for  an  organization  not  only means to acquire information and data, but  rather create a dynamic system in which data,  information  and  experiences  are  connected  to  produce  a  greater  overall  knowledge  than  the  simple sum of the initial knowledge. To do this,  an organization needs to develop the production  of knowledge in each element that is part of it.  The basic elements that constitute an organiza- tion are, according to the theory of Argyris and  Schon   1998 ,  Porter   2003 ,  Nonaka   1998 ,  Wenger   2000,  2006 ,  Davenport  and  Prusak   2005 , men who work in the organization. This  means that the main producers of knowledge are  workers, and on the other hand, the technological  artifacts with which they work.  ...  The men who  work are actually the only ones able to produce  new knowledge. However, the process of creating   152   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  technology, which enables the creation of DVW3D   Digital Virtual worlds in 3D , offers this pos- sibility both to formal training Institutions and  to  productive  organizations.  We  suggest  that  constitution  of VLCPs  in  DVW3Ds  can  be  an  important  opportunity  for  those  organizations   i.e. international organizations  that desire im- proving their Learning Communities of Practice  offering  to  them  Digital  Virtual  Environments  where they can share experience, practices, emo- tions, and producing new knowledge, in order to  their own organization turn more productive and  competitive.  VIRTUAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES  In this part, we suggest a brief analysis of the  nature of Virtual Learning Communities, and an  identification of their role in productive organi- zational processes; we also suggest some tools  to improve their activity and production, using  Digital Technological Tools.  The members of a VLC – that lives in its mem- bers’ actions and interactions - can share knowl- edge, experiences, ideas and information, and they  can, therefore, produce knowledge cooperating.  Virtual Learning Communities build themselves  in practices of interaction in the Net, an interactive  process that involves the community’s objectives,  rules and tools to achieve them; depending by  the type of technology utilized to implement the  community, interaction can be realized through  different languages  oral, textual, graphic, sign .  Some underlying functions of Virtual Learning  Communities are identified by De Marchi & Costa   2006  as to produce knowledge, to collaborate  and to manage all the process. These elements  represent the basis of development for this kind  of  communities,  but  their  full  potential  is  not  possible without an environment where develop  them. The cooperation and collaboration between  community members forms the environment. This  can take place only in an environment that offers   the possibility of virtual meetings, interactions  between participants and so on. Finally, a Learning  Community cannot exist without the development  of ‘participation culture’; each member knows  the importance of relating with others, and they  all know the importance of the common projects  they are working on together.  A Virtual Learning Community is mainly a  formal community, but even informal communi- ties of learning can be developed. This depends  on  the  nature  of  learning,  a  participative  and  shared process, but also a process in which the  knowledge transfer is in act. Members of Learn- ing Communities can acquire knowledge through  lessons and formal ways of learning, but can also  develop processes of learning by doing, develop- ing learning through their experience and pratical  tacit knowledge.  VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES  OF PRACTICE  According  to  Wenger   2006 ,  communities  of  practice  CoPs  are groups of people that share a  common interest for something that they achieve  to do better together than alone; CoPs are group  of people working together and sharing practices,  experiences and working methodologies . CoPs  are groups of people, defined by three characteris- tics: the domain  of a certain common and shared  interest , the community  members participating  in activities together  and the practice  sharing  resources and methodologies to work .  CoPs can be organized in informal or formal  groups. According to the first definition of Wenger   2006 , CoPs should be mainly informal groups,  in order to enhance the sense of membership built  by the own members. In the second version of  Wenger’s CoPs theory  2007 , CoPs are groups  that can be quite formalized, as the organization  can build spaces and tools  bulletin board, mail- ing lists, video conferences, newsletters, forum,  wiki, blogs  to improve the CoPs’ activity. In our   153   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  Digital Virtual Worlds in 3D, that we call a type  of “primary virtualty”, permit  the creation of three-dimensional online graphic  environments, where the subject can be telepresent  through an avatar  avatar-driven telepresent , a  3D graphical representation through which s he  can interact making a kind of ‘digital-virtual life’  emerge. This ‘digital-virtual life’ has shaped and  being shaped by a human being represented by  a ‘digital-virtual self’ in its relations with other  digital-virtual ‘selves’ represented by ‘technolo- gised bodies’ organising in communities in the  cyberspace, creating digital-virtual social nets,  shaping and being shaped by this culture.  Sch- lemmer, Trein, Oliveira, 2009   VIRTUAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES  OF PRACTICE IN METAVERSE  According to Moretti  2010 , the concept of Com- munity of Practice cannot be separate from the one  of Learning Community. A Community of practice,  in fact, always learns from the experience of its  members, situations and projects; and members  always learn together, one from the other: learning  is possible in sharing practices.  We can define “virtual learning community of  practice”  VLCP  a community constituted by the  sharing practice, the study and discussion of top- ics of common interest within the members of the  community, and rules and performance standards  that are set through negotiation within the group.  The contents of a VLCP is produced during the  interactions that arise from discussions, reflections  and readings that can be suggested by any member  of the community. The knowledge is built as the  subject  learns  the  process  of  self-organization  of conceptual thought, as it needs to coordinate  its views with other views, arguments, evidence  provided by community members. Thus, through  VLCPs it is possible to produce knowledge in a  dialogic relationship, founded on collaboration and   opinion, one version doesn’t exclude the other  one: informality is one of the elements of a CoP  because  of  the  interaction  among  members,  a  process that develops in different ways depending  on the structure of formal or an informal groups.  Formal process of creation and implementation  of a CoP permits to insert the same structure of  the  community  into  the  organizational  frame,  as a substantial part of the entire organizational  frame. In our opinion, also according with Daniel,  Schwier and McCalla  2003 , CoPs are character- ized by informal learning goals and distribution  of responsibilities. This is valid mainly for dis- tributed communities of practice, for their defini- tion, communities of members are geographically  distributed on different countries.  In our perspective, Communities of Practice  can  be  developed  in  an  informal  way  through  Virtual Technologies. According to Schlemmer   2008, 2009 , virtual tools can be used to develop  characters of communities such as emotionality,  sense of membership, collaboration and coopera- tion. We define a Virtual Community of Practice  such as a CoP developed in Digital Virtual Environ- ments  like DVW3Ds or Web 2.0 environments ;  this kind of community can be fundamental for the  developing of productive organizations, because  the  underlying  elements  of  organizations  are  people  Porter, 2003; Nonaka, 1998; Davenport  and Prusak, 2006; Moretti, 2009 .  The community’s “level of virtuality” can be  different, if we are using Digital Virtual environ- ments or Web 2.0 tools for its development; in  the second case, we call it “secondary virtual- ity”   Moretti,  2010 .  This  type  of  virtuality  is  characterized by sharing and interacting mainly  through text and voice; the user is represented by  what he writes or says, and often groups work  without having an interaction between their virtual  representation. In this “secondary virtuality”, it  is possible to write, read, discuss, work or learn  together, but it is not possible, in most cases, to  sense the presence of the users and to perceive  and  build  the  digital  space  around  their  own.   154   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  cooperation, where all members can develop their  capacity of expression and listening, in a process  of autonomy  in terms of identifying their own  needs learning, as well as ways to develop it  and  authorship  with regard to responsibility for the  content of their action   interaction, the relation- ships that produce knowledge or establishing .  Monitoring and evaluation is undertaken by all  members continuously.  Individuals  who  act  and  interact  in VLCPs  become  more  committed  and  responsible  for  their  own  learning,  they  feel  more  engaged  in  contributing to the learning advancements of their  colleagues, which enables individuals to establish  and strengthen emotional ties, besides providing  the development of processes of collaboration and  cooperation. The success of a VLCPs depends on  the active contribution of each of its members over  time, so that through collaboration and coopera- tion it can achieve the common goals set by the  community.  VLCPs are born fundamentally in relation with  the need of innovation, competencies development  and in the belief that the needs of the learner can- not always be satisfied by the formal education  and  classic  training  courses.  Online  Learning  doesn’t  need  a  classic  and  hierarchic  structure  like traditional courses: learning passes trough  social  processes,  experiences  and  knowledge  share. This new ‘format’ of social organization  modifies the way in which people are in relation  with  information,  learning  and  production  of  knowledge: according to Castells  1999 , one of  the ways to develop communities and, therefore,  produce and share knowledge  Nonaka, Takeuchi,  1998  is the informal way.  Digital Virtual Technologies can implement  this  kind  of  community:  according  to  Moretti   2010 ,  VLCPs  can  be  developed  in  Digital  Virtual  Environments  because  of  the  presence  of different kinds of expressing cooperation and  collaboration. In DVW3Ds, above all, members  of communities can collaborate not only in writing  documents together  that happens, for instance, in   tools such as Google Docs or Wikis , but also in  building objects together, in realizing simulations  or participating them in order to experiment digital  training. The immersion, fundamental character  of DVW3Ds, permits the development of interac- tions between members; they can build knowledge  objects, they can build a digital representation of  abstract concepts, they can share experiences and  practices in an environment that permits a lot of   virtual  actions.  We  suggest  that  use  of  DVW3Ds  permits  the realization of the so-called  Castells, 1999   ‘real virtuality’, a ‘virtuality’ experimented from  members trough their avatar, digital virtual repre- sentations that members use in order to live and  work in virtual worlds.  In our perspective, the use of Metaverse Tech- nology for the development of communities can  be shown in the definition of ECODI  Schlemmer,  2008,2009 .  An ECODI is a digital space, namely a physi- cal space but created through the contribution of  ICTs; it is a 3D space where people and objects  are  characterized  by  three-dimensionality,  that  provides the sense of “presence” more than in a  chat or an environment of Web 2.0. The digital  space is populated by virtual objects and users,  and they interact with each other, that is, an en- vironment, understood as a space of relations.  An  ECODI  could  not  exist  without  people  who populate it, i.e., in the case of DVW3Ds,  the Avatars, bearers of users’ personality that is  expressed through them: an empty ECODI doesn’t  exist, since the reports that are interwoven among  avatars are the foundation of the own existence  of the digital space.  An ECODI is a “room” for coexistence, which  means  that  avatars  interact  with  each  other  in  the digital space creating the own space, that is  characterized as the sum of their relations, not as  a private space, but as a shared space, that can be  one of the privileged places for the creation and  implementation of virtual communities.  155   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  The  use  of  Metaverse  Technology   Second  Life  to create and support VLCPs was developed  in several UNISINOS research projects, such as  UNISINOS Island, ECODI RICESU and ECODI  UNISINOS VIRTUAL. All these projects aimed,  on the first side, to offer to the University Commu- nity spaces of digital connivance and interaction  between users, and to develop learning processes  and creation of good practices in the field of Edu- cation and Professors Training; on the other side,  the Research Group GP e-du UNISINOS CNP q,  that has planned and developed these projects,  has  also  developed  its  research  in  the  field  of  Technology Learning through the observation of  its members and their activities.  CASE STUDIES  The research design was “explorative”  Di Franco  2001 . The goals of the study are to find out new  relationships among learning and community’s  phenomena, to define post-hypotheses and sug- gest  drivers  for  further  research   Guala  2000 .  The field research followed two steps:  a.   Field  research,  based  on  qualitative   methodologies;  b.   Data analysis and interpretation.  According to Yin  1984 , the research design  adopts different methodologies, in order to make  possible the triangulation of data. In accordance  with the research design, each step of the study  was aimed at building new categories and defin- ing  emerging  variables  for  the  next  phases  of  the research. According to Richards and Moore   2009 , the Group has followed the hermeneutic  approach where the researcher has to pay atten- tion in dialogue processes of share and interaction  that happen in the research setting, because they  represent the ground for building meanings.  The field research followed the following steps:  a.   Analysis  of  the  context  and  preliminary   research;  b.   Field research, based on qualitative methods; c.   Data analysis and interpretation, aimed to the  formulation of ex - post research hypothesis  for further investigations.  Communities were investigated starting from  the perceptions of the communities’ own mem- bers, and from their technologic and intellectual  products. The phases of the field study:  1.   open-ended interview with the Community   manager  s ;  2.   documents collection and analysis; 3.    analysis of communities’ distance commu- nication tools  blog, forum, chat, meetings  in Second Life ; semi-structured  interviews  with  the  core  group and the coordinator of the community.  4.    UNISINOS Island. The project was developed  in 2006, aiming to create the representation of  the  University,  in  the  Second  Life  Metaverse.  Then some icons of UNISINOS were simulated,  such as: Communitary Center and Library  these  space are simulations of physic spaces ; Research  Group - Digital Education – GP e-du UNISINOS  CNPq, Convivence Center, sandbox, and others;  these spaces are imaginary spaces, created with  the propriety of MDV3D .  This project represents the “main box” for the  development of all the other investigations and  projects realized through the Metaverse technol- ogy. The aim of the project was to create a general  ECODI  where  events  and  specific  researches  should be realized.  The main reason for the creation of the island  in  SL  was  UNISINOS  Research  in  Education,  where we seek to better understand how to place   156   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  the processes of teaching and learning using this  technology. One goal was to create a virtual space  of digital information, communication and inter- action for the academic community UNISINOS,  so  that  teachers,  researchers  and  students  can  explore, experiment and experience this new space  within the Education Online while potentiating  the processes of teaching and learning, so are the  objects of research for GP e-du.  This  project  is  open  to  the  entire  academic  community  of  UNISINOS,  and  currently  the  main  activity  developed  in  the  context  of  the  island UNISINOS refers to research on Digital  Education. Such research involves the creation  of  space  and  exploration,  experimentation  and   experience of these spaces for students and teach- ers. On the UNISINOS Island are also available  general information about the University, spaces  of interaction for digital virtual coexistence are  presented dissertations, Meetings digital virtual re- search groups, exhibitions, events, among others. ECODI-RICESU   Digital  Virtual  Living  Space of the Network of Catholic Institutions of  Higher Education . The project was developed in  2007 2008, and consisted specifically in creating  a virtual space of digital information, communi- cation and interaction for the development of a  virtual learning community of practice within the  Network of Catholic Institutions of Higher Edu- cation – RICESU, and development of training   Figure 1. UNISINOS Island  157   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  and  educational  proposals  in  Metaverse,  contributing  to  the  development  of  both  local  and  network  actions,  constituting  a  micro-grid   micro-community   to  allow  the creation of a new GT, the GT-ECODI  RICESU. Therefore, 13 teams of different  IESCs  were  built,  totalling  39  physically  distant participants, who have worked to- gether in a digital virtual presence, in the  context of the island in RICESU MDV3D- SL.  Besides  the  teachers,  counselors  and  responsible  for  training  processes,  three  teams  were  formed  with  the  members  of  GP  e-du.  Each  team  consisted  of  a  guid- ing master and a scholar in basic scientific  research,  responsible  for  monitoring  four  IESCs 4; one team was responsible for five  IESCs. These teams had the primary func- tion of monitoring the learning process of  participants.  Methodology  and  materials   texts,  tutorials,  videos,  challenges,  etc.   used  in  the  two  training  processes  were  built  by  GP  e-du,  which  caused  the  need  to create specific objects in space for the  training process, as panel integrator  help,  mural,  schedule  meetings,  guidelines  for  large screen projection, virtualteca, diary,  forum, central teleports, etc . Participants  also used it as a space for the development  of training processes, the “trunk” of their  own IESC, where they deposited the chal- lenges  made  to  their  IESC,  which  devel- oped the project-based learning problems.  These spaces can be viewed in the follow- ing  figures.  During  the  training  process,  besides  the  SL  Metaverse,  different  tech- nologies were used, such as: blog, discus- sion forums, Youtube, etc.  Currently, the main activities developed in the  context of ECODI-RICESU refer to meetings of  the Steering Committee, meetings of the WG -  Working Groups and organization development of  virtual events, developed in SL. In the context of   processes for building 3D spaces in the Metaverse  Second Life, offered for Catholic Institutions of  Higher Education - IESCs that integrate RICESU  in the context of GT-EDUDI. The ECODI was  built and realized into the UNISINOS Island.  This project incorporated two stages, as fol-  lows:      The first milestone was the acquisition of  an island in the Metaverse-SL to create the  Island  RICESU   modeled  using  the  spe- cific  characteristics  and  properties  of  the  technology  of  Digital  Virtual  Worlds  in  3D ,  which  took  shape  after  the  creation  of  different  spaces  Digital  Virtual  3D  -  EDV3D for common use of RICESU such  as the “host” virtual digital RICESU, the  joint  projects  of  the  Network,  as  well  as  areas for collaborative   cooperative work,  spaces for meetings, discussions, lectures,  among others, created with the objective of  bringing about the formation of ECODI to  enable the development of VLCs and VCPs  in  the  context  of  Digital  Education,  and  more specifically for Education Online in  Metaverse. Therefore, the core of coexis- tence Network  common area of RICESU   was constituted by spaces for each IESCs  that integrate RICESU, so that they can de- velop their specific projects. The second step consisted in offering two  training processes  of 80 hours  for IESCs  teachers     researchers     practitioners  that  integrate  RICESU.  Each  of  IESCs  indi- cated a teacher from the areas of pedagogy,  technology - 3D design and programming  and architecture; these three professionals  were the beginning of what could become  a  subgroup  of  research  and  development  in Metaverse technology. Thus, each com- ponent  of  the  IESC  RICESU  indicated  three  participants  to  represent  them  in  both the formative process, aiming to cre- ate  “nodes”  of  institutional  development       158   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  different spaces that integrate the IESCs ECODI- RICESU it is possible to perceive different levels  of development and activity patterns and distinct  objectives. For example, in the PUCSP space it  is possible to observe an audience that is used  for presentations, events, meetings, etc.. In the  PUCRS space, we found an area where general  information  is  available  on  the  University,  ex- hibition spaces for works and researches in the  context of SL and also a digital virtual space for  meetings, meetings, lectures, presentations, etc.  There is also an area where simulations are cre- ated.  Therefore,  by  walking  around  the  island  you’ll find that each IESC develops some kind  of activity in those spaces created.  It  is  interesting  to  note  the  rise  of  a  suvra- community  of  practice,  constituted  by  several  members of the 13 Universities. Members of 13   Institutions developed a form of virtual interaction  that was finalized to the creation of several com- mon projects between the suvra-community and  the local organizations on Brazilian ground, i.e.  international projects and collaborations between  institutions and local productive systems. They  realized  several  joint  projects  in  the  South  of  Brazil, developing them mainly in Second Life  and partly using e-mails, forum and blog. One  example of a common developed project is the  constitutions of GE  Grupo de Estudo , in which  members are from different institutions, and work  on common themes: Business and Administration,  Digital Library, Quality, Collaborative Technolo- gies, and others.  ECODI UNISINOS VIRTUAL - 2009 2010.  The project deals specifically with the develop- ment  of  a  Digital Virtual  Living  space  for  the   Figure 2.

In this context the Pro- gram Graduate Education and Graduate in Busi- ness Administration is also involved.  Several activities are currently developed in  ECODI  PPGs:  Research  in  Digital  Education   teaching and learning processes with Metaverse  Second Life technology ; Classes at the under- graduate  and  postgraduate  level   Masters  and  PhD ; Extension courses – continuous training;  Workshops;  Work  Guidelines  for  graduation,  Master and PhD thesis; Meetings of the Research  Group; Display   exhibition of works; scientific and  academic events  participation and organization   - International Congress on Education; Presenta- tion of papers; Lectures; Defense of dissertation  and PhD thesis.  This  last  projects,  still  in  the  development  phase, aims to use the potentialities of DVW3Ds  not  only  for  under-graduated  and  graduated  students  but  also  for  PhD  students  and  high- level education people. Nowadays, the number of  Master and PhD thesis discussed  and sometimes  realized  in the ECODI is growing up  we have 5  discussion only in 2010, into the PPG in Educa- tion ; the participation of professors is growing  up too, after the first period of “learning to learn”  about the platform and technology’s use. The so- called “Digital Divide” plays here an important  role, not only because of the problem of the use  of technology, but mostly because of the problem  of  “faith”  in  the  technology  possibilities.  It  is  interesting to note here that the development of  this specific project was possible only after the  presentation of the results of the others projects to  the Academic Community. The Academic Com- munity needed not only “quantitative” results, but  after all, a motivation to participate in a project  different by the others and that previewed a direct  involvement of Professors and Researchers.  provision of Online Education in the context of  UNISINOS VIRTUAL - Graduation. The digital  virtual space reflects a methodology that promotes  processes of teaching and learning grounded in  an epistemological interactionist   constructivist    systemic approach, that currently arises as an area  of coexistence of provocative learning.  In this context two pilot projects are being de- veloped: the subject “Physics of the Earth System”,  linked to the graduate course in Physics, and the  discipline “Teaching and Learning in the Digital  World”, linked to the Pedagogy graduate course. Results of this projects are still in develop- ment, because the period of research observation  is still not ended; nowadays, students’ communi- ties in the ECODI are developing capacities and  competences of:                 Creation  of  new  objects  in  collaboration  with other members; Collaborative work around a creative idea; Collaborative  production  of  learning,  quantifiable  in  the  exchange  of  lessons’  materials, production of tests, reports and  learning documents; Creation  of  various  digital  virtual  com- munities,  that  rise  in  the  Second  Life  Metaverse, in UNISINOS spaces, and then  continue to grow up both in Second Life  and in the Real World and other technol- ogy tools  Web 2.0: forum, blog, chat, wiki  etc.   ECODI PPGs  Programas de Pós-Gradu- ação  UNISINOS - 2008-2010 - “Virtual Space  in  Digital  Living  Programs  Graduate   stricto  sensu  - ECODI-PPGS UNISINOS: a proposal  for the researchers’ training”.

Thus,  all  kinds of communities live together, from the most  traditional, territorial based community, to those  constituted by different social movements and built  in digital virtual spaces, such as VLCPs; VLCPs  permit the emergence of spaces rich in subjects’  action and interaction, in the context of sharing   practices and building knowledge collaboratively  and cooperatively.  In this framework, perspectives and trends are  to identify communities of online gamers, particu- larly those linked to form MMORPG  Massive  Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games , focused  on meeting game challenges. These communities  develop collaborative and cooperative competi- tion, where each player competes against the others  to be the best player, and to get the most relevant  items. However, many times, the competitors come  in groups and the player needs to join a group and  to establish a relationship of collaboration and  cooperation in order to achieve certain common  goals. Therefore, players that provide a higher  level of cooperation and greater numbers of bonds   Figure 3. ECODI UNISINOS VIRTUAL  161   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  Figure 4. PPGs working  of this type become more evolved. This concept  can be applied to different organizations, which  can benefit from it. Another perspective and a  tendency for VLCPs, consists precisely in VLCPs  nomads-hybrid, ie VLCPs using different Web 2.0  technologies combined with 3D web technologies  such as Digital Metaverse and Virtual Worlds in  3D, including games and simulations. What does  “nomads hybrid” mean? Hybrids subjects have  a physical and digital identity, such as a physi- cal existence  physical body  and digital virtual  existence  body technologized-avatar ; they live   simultaneously in the physical world and in the  digital virtual world. Both “spaces” are exploit- able, and these “spaces” don’t refer to a “pure  space” as an a priori condition of experience of  the world as we find in Kant  1983  apud Sch- lemmer  1998 , but constitutes the main object of  experience, where the avatar and the subject  an  individual not separable in his multiple identity   lives, creating and re - creating his identity; he  lives, creating digital virtual living spaces, where  a world happens.  162   Virtual Learning Communities of Practice in Metaverse  Does the “digital native”, the “zapping gen- eration”  Veen, Vrakking, 2006 , is building his  objectivity  and  subjectivity  from  this  hybrid  dimension?  They  are  nomads  because  of  their  constant roaming, ignoring boundaries, to search  for new spaces that can satisfy their desires and  interests.  ”While experts are still talking about the real and  virtual, people are building a life in which borders  are increasingly permeable . ...  In the future, the  porous borders will be most interesting to study  and understand  Turkle, 1999, p. 118    According to Turkle  1999 , the defense of the  borders between virtual and real efforts to locate  certain types of experience in one or other dimen- sion; currently is prevalent among specialists than  among users, citizens of virtual communities, to  refuse the idea of the existence of defined borders,  and to clearly express the human desire to have  access to several things simultaneously.  “Real  relationships  are  those  in  which  people  feel connected enough to give them importance.  It is these relationships that determine the way  each is perceived  ...  or the way they see their  own ability to relate to others. ”  ...  In life on- line, people find themselves in a position to play  different roles, adopting different personalities in  different parts of the network. See and experience  many aspects of themselves. Living intensely this  multiplicity  ...  In this sense, life online resumes  an aspect of everyday life to take him to a higher  grade.  ...  For many people, the virtual commu- nity allows a freer expression of many aspects of  themselves. But it is also something that you live  in the “rest of life.”  ...  To the extent that things  are closed and the space is reduced, cyberspace  offers something on the order of space-game: a  chance to trial absent from the rest of his life in  the RV  ...  I want to stress that the best possibili- ties for the development of the communities are in   places where they cross the virtual experiences and  the rest of life. ”  Turkle, 1999, p. 119, 120, 121   Members  of  this  generation  live  together,  co-inhabit new spaces, being through and in the  communities  created,  leaving  the  concept  that  exists only one space to live, one community, one  world, one universe.

The main arguments behind this resistance and the theory’s  basic concepts are discussed. Then a critique of an example of the application of technological minimal- ism to the use of Second Life in education follows. Technological minimalism advocates the minimum  use of technology needed to transmit content. The text argues that in the current stage of education  technology potential educational tools should not be chosen based on that criterion. Technology and  education cannot be easily separated anymore. As a conclusion, this chapter suggests a new form of  minimalism: a minimalism of content.  INTRODUCTION  There  is  a  personal  and  existential  motivation  behind this chapter. When I started to use Second  Life  SL  in education in 2007, Brazilian distance  education  researcher  Wilson Azevedo  was  the  main critic of my experiences. He based his criti- cism on Mauri Collins’ and Zane Berge’s concept  of  technological  minimalism   TM .  While  we   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch011  debated in a mailing list, I enrolled in the course  ‘Teaching and Learning in Second Life’ at Boise  State University  Spring 2008 , and guess who  the professor was? Mauri Collins! The mother,  if  you  will,  of  the  argument  used  by Azevedo  to criticize the use of SL in education was my  instructor  about   and  in   SL.  But  that  was  not  the whole puzzle: the “father” of the argument,  Zane Berge, also followed the course in SL, as an   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

In my debate with Azevedo, I could use  the authority of my teachers in SL and he could  use the authority of the proponents of TM – but  they were the same educators! This chapter tries  to make sense of that surreal experience.  The chapter is based on bibliographic reviews  as well as my own experiences with SL. Further- more, my thoughts were also shaped by my debate  with Azevedo and some discussions I had with  both Collins and Berge during the course.  I  initially  address  the  main  arguments  by  Azevedo  against  the  use  of  SL  in  education.  Subsequently I criticize the principles of TM and  an  article  by  Berge  where  these  principles  are  applied to SL. I then conclude with a discussion  about education technology and a proposition of  a new type of minimalism.  The objectives of this theoretical chapter are,  though, to present and discuss a common resis- tance against the use of SL  and, therefore, virtual  worlds  in education, and propose a new focus for  education technology. A focus that is not based  on the criterium of minimum technology, but on  minimum content.  BACKGROUND  Second Life is an online 3D virtual world devel- oped by Linden Lab and launched in 2003. Users  can interact with each other through avatars, their  3D virtual representation, using voice and text chat,  in addition to other tools. Objects can be easily  built, to which scripts, textures, animations, and  gestures can be added.  SL is being used as a tool by many institutions  around the world, as the following selected ex- amples illustrate. Mattar  2008  discusses the use  of SL as a learning environment. Molka-Danielson  & Deutschmann  2009  present a Scandinavian  educational project in SL, with guidance on build- ing simulations and integrating virtual worlds into  education. Clark  2009  presents the use of SL  for teaching genetics. Wankel & Kingsley  2009    explore the theory and case studies on the use of  virtual worlds in education. Other references will  be indicated during this chapter.  Other authors, however, criticize the use of  SL in education. Young  2010  argues that there  was a hype much more related to marketing than  to education, and now colleges and universities  are retreating.  One of these critiques is based on the theory  of TM,  defined  by  Collins  &  Berge   1994   as  the  minimum  use  of  technology  in  support  of  instructional objectives. There are many simpler  technological alternatives to virtual worlds avail- able, according to the principle of TM, therefore  there would be no sense in using SL in education.   Berge, 2008   Although TM is not a pervasive principle, its  arguments can be taken as typical examples of  general positions against the use of virtual worlds  in education. Azevedo’s arguments, in turn, can  then be taken as a didactical application of the  principle of TM for evaluating the use of virtual  worlds in education. These ideas will be discussed  in this chapter.  AZEVEDO’S CRITIQUE  OF SECOND LIFE  In  several  discussions  in  a  distance  education  mailing list in Portuguese  Lista EaD-L , Wilson  Azevedo argues against the use of SL in educa- tion. His arguments can be divided into four main  points: funnel, smoke, withdrawal, and 3Ducation.  A brief discussion of each of them follows.  Funnel  There is a technological funnel to use SL, through  which only a few can pass, what turns it into an  elitist and exclusionary tool.  This is actually a real funnel, which should  however open up as hardware develops and band- width increases. In UK universities, for instance,   167   Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life  Education is thriving in Second Life. This enthu- siastic subculture is abuzz within the Second Life  realm, constantly interacting inside and outside  Second Life. Educators are exploring every pos- sible tool the 3D virtual world offers and estab- lishing best practices along the way.  It is also worth registering the growing use of  SL as an environment for academic events. While  only 1,200 or so different avatars participated in  Second Life Best Practices in Education in 2007,  in 2009 3,647 participated in Virtual Worlds Best  Practices in Education and more than 6,000 in the  2010 version. These numbers demonstrate that SL  is still a valuable tool for educators.  Withdrawal  A  very  high  percentage  of  users   much  higher  than in other Internet services  creates accounts  in SL but never comes back. SL is not attractive  for the majority of its registered users who never  become active. We should listen to them to better  evaluate SL’s applicability to distance education. Elizabeth Knittle explains the feeling of an  educator getting “inworld”  inside Second Life   for the first time:  I looked around and I thought, this is crazy. I just  couldn’t see the value of it, so I left. But then people  starting blogging about it – a lot of people – so  I had to reconsider. I decided that if I was going  to understand this thing and be able to answer  questions about it intelligently, I really just had to  suck it up and get in there and participate. Once  I connected with people inworld, it made all the  difference.  Waters, 2009   The movement of education in virtual worlds  continues and to evaluate the pedagogical use of  environments such as SL there is a need for im- mersion in them. Azevedo admits he has entered  one or two times, walked around, felt it, and did  what the majority of users do: never went back.   already fewer academics are complaining about  technical issues when using SL, such as inadequate  equipment   Kirriemuir,  2009 .  In  addition,  the  virtual world’s applications may be considered  cheaper than video conferencing.  Badger, 2008   Smoke  Too much smoke, little fire: SL was a bubble.  Too much artificial noise in the beginning, with  many potential uses foreseen in education, but no  real benefits. What will remain, two years from  now  that was 2007 , when the fascination has  passed? No practical applications and no impact  in distance education.  Even if correct, Azevedo’s prophecy covers  only half of the hype cycle. An innovation graph  usually  shows  that,  after  a  technology  trigger  and a peak of expectation takes place there might  be a period of disillusionment, and that, in turn,  might be followed by a slope of enlightenment  and a plateau of productivity. And what piques the  interest of an educator is not exactly a SL graph,  but a graph that shows the use of virtual worlds  in education.  Less than one year after Wilson’s prophecy,   Kelton  2008  stated:  Many people believed that virtual worlds would  end  up  like  the  eight-track  audiotape:  a  fond  memory of something no longer used  or useful   [Azevedo  used  PointCast  as  an  example].  Yet  today  there  are  hundreds  of  higher  education  institutions  represented  in  three-dimensional   3D  virtual worlds such as Active Worlds and SL.  Indeed, the movement toward the virtual realm  as a viable teaching and learning environment  seems unstoppable.  Where are we now, years after Wilson’s proph- ecy? Harrison  2009  discusses how education  followed an inverse path as an exception to the  hype and subsequent disappointment with SL by  corporations:  168   Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life  This is not the description of a user withdrawal,  but of an educator refusing to test a tool.  3Ducation  What difference does the use of 3D simulations  make to learning? There is no more than dazzle  in the answers available. Those who use SL in  education were not able to show that a significant  difference  exists,  that  is  to  say,  they  were  not  able to prove positive results on the use of virtual  worlds in education.  Educators  who  are  inworld  provide  lots  of  answers,  among  them:  3D  graphical  setting,  game-like environment, multimedia presentation  tools, experiential learning, experimentation, im- mersion, simulation, cross-reality, role-play, social  network knowledge construction, collaboration,  co-creation, retention, participation, engagement,  the use of avatars, sense of social presence, under- standing the learning process, price, etc.  Batson,  2009; Calongne, 2008; Dawley, 2009; Harrison,  2009;  Lifton,  2007;  Lifton,  Laibowitz,  Harry,  Gong, Mittal, & Paradiso, 2009; Lifton & Paradiso,  2009; Trein, 2010; Walker & Rockinson-Szapkiw,  2009; Wallace & Maryott, 2009; Weusijana, Svi- hla, Gawel, & Bransford, 2009   According to Clark  2009 , online education  created a need for online laboratory experiences,  and SL offers a new dimension to scientific edu- cation:  Virtual  experiments  performed  in  Second  Life  laboratories  offer  students  activities  that  are  both hands-on and minds-on, making it possible  for students to replicate classic experiments or  perform laboratory activities that might be too  dangerous, too expensive, or too time-consuming  in the real world.  Historically  the  discussion  of  interaction  in  distance education did not give much importance  to  the  learner interface  or  learner technology  component of the learning environment. To the   three categories of interaction initially proposed  by  Moore   1989   –  learner content,  learner  instructor,  and  learner learner,  Hillman, Willis,  and Gunawardena  1994  add a fourth one: the  interaction between the learner and the interface,  justified by the development of technologies used  in distance education. In addition, Burnham and  Walden  1997  talk about a learner-environment  interaction,  an  interplay  or  mutual  influence  between the learner and his or her environment,  which helps or hinders learning.  Mattar   2008   argues  that  SL  provides  an  interesting type of interaction for students, pro- fessors, and content with the environment. 3D  virtual worlds have brought back to the learning  experience at least part of the sense of a physi- cal space that was taken from us by traditional  learning ‘environments’. When an avatar gets too  close to you, it bothers you. When you bump into  an avatar, you apologize. Educators who master  virtual  worlds’  pedagogy  have  the  opportunity  to design new, creative and unpredictable types  of learning.  Kapp & O’Driscoll  2010  present a long dis- cussion on how three-dimensional environments  force  us  to  review  our  pedagogical  principles,  supporting learning and collaboration. Content- centered  instructional  design  models  are  inap- propriate both for the scenario we live in and for  today’s students. The authors argue that design is  the key element in 3D environments.  TECHNOLOGICAL MINIMALISM  Follows a discussion of what is explicitly the basis  for all of Azevedo’s arguments: the theory of TM. This is the famous definition of TM  Collins   & Berge, 1994 :  We are defining technological minimalism as the  unapologetic use of minimum levels of technology,  carefully chosen with precise attention to their   169   Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life  students  might  prefer,  and  feel  motivated  by,  more technology? Why leave the technological  level decision only in the hands of the instructor? Six years later, Collins and Berge  2000  state:  “‘Technological minimalism’ is a valid method- ological  stance  that  can  guide  choices  among  technologies that are already proven to be robust,  available, and relatively inexpensive.”  As technologies change rapidly those choices  are not so simple. But we can also be afraid that  TM, read literally, would prevent us from testing  the pedagogical potential of new technologies that  are still not robust, available and inexpensive. This  is one of the motivations behind the resistance to  test SL in education, as it is clear on Berge’s text   2008 , commented in the next section.  One  interesting  example  of  the  application  of  TM  is  the  analysis  of  the  use  of  video  in  education. Collins and Berge  2000  discuss the  negative impact of streaming video technologies,  which had added cost, but not gains to learning.  However, we know today that video and anima- tions, when appropriately used, open pedagogical  possibilities we cannot reach simply using text or  minimal technology. Snelson  2008 , for example,  researches these results. It is not, though, just a  simple question of adding a little bit of technology  to one side, and measuring the results on the other,  to check if it is worth it: everything changes. Even  if using video, audio, and animations really does  not guarantee an automatic gain in teaching and  learning, this does not mean that we should not  use these technologies. This is a basic fallacy: if  the growth of A does not guarantee the improve- ment of B, so no  or minimum  A. Learning is not  simply the measurable results of an equation, but  a journey of exploration.  Technology  is  not  the  cure  for  education,  but this does not mean we need to be afraid of  it. Instead of cutting it down to a minimum we  need to develop faculties’ abilities to explore and  effectively use technology in education, through  quality  professional  development  programs.   Mattar, 2009   advantages  and  limitations,  in  support  of  well  defined instructional objectives.  completed by:  There is wisdom in technological minimalism – the  more bells and whistles a delivery technology has,  the more expensive and complex the equipment  needed, the greater the limitations on student ac- cess, the greater the claims on time and travel  e.g.  to live videoconference sites , the more extensive  the technical support needed and the greater the  chance of inopportune equipment failure.  First of all, as this article was written more  than fifteen years ago, there is naturally a need  to  revise  some  concepts. As  one  example,  the  authors state that “content can not interact, hold  a dialogue, nor answer back” referring to Moore   1989 . This discussion was actually later extended  by Anderson  2003 , who introduced the concept  of content content interaction. It is possible today,  with web 2.0 tools, to produce learning objects in  which content, from a certain moment on, starts  to renew and update by itself, through interaction  with other objects and content. You can, for in- stance, build a RSS page about a topic, so during  a course this page will be automatically updated,  without need for interaction with human beings. The main concept of the article that needs to  be revised, however, is the one of TM itself. In  1994 students were different from today so mini- mal technology today is different from minimal  technology fifteen years ago. Besides that, what  is minimal for an educator who does not regularly  use digital tools might also be significantly dif- ferent from what is minimal for an educator who  has already adequately integrated technology into  his teaching practices.  Why, then, not think about different levels of  technology in a course, so that a student could  choose the optimal level according to his or her  preferences? Why limit the level of technology  in a course to the minimum, if some  or many?    170   Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life  BERGE’S CRITIQUE  OF SECOND LIFE  A typical example of the application of TM to  education is Berge’s critical review of SL  2008 .  The reasoning is the same: if an easier alternative  is  available,  why  use  something  more  compli- cated? “Generally, teachers and students in SL  cannot accomplish anything that they could not  accomplish in regular Websites”  p. 30 . Almost  everything done in SL  with many more barriers   can  be  performed  online. According  to  Berge,  there is no justification to use SL in education  unless  educators  figure  out  what  to  do  in  3D  virtual worlds that can’t be more easily done in  other environments. Neither is it worth the steep  learning curve to master its effective use.  A  typical  technological  minimalist  should  then sit down and wait until a specific technology  matures and becomes useful in education, as if  testing and adapting technologies for educational  purposes should not also be the responsibility of  an  educator.  Either  technology  would  become  educational by itself or other educators should  test these tools, while the technological minimalist  comfortably watches, encapsulated and protected  from any mistakes by not experimenting.  SOLUTIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS:  EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY  AND CONTENT MINIMALISM  Education Technology is the research and practice  field of the use of technological tools in education.  It involves exploring the pedagogical potential of  these tools and integrating them into education. The obsession with a minimum level of tech- nology cannot imprison us and block our tests.  As the medium is, in many cases, at least part of  the message, technology is not simply a support  for  the  transmission  of  content  –  actually,  no  software is pedagogically neutral. In this sense,   TM can be seen as a ‘conceptual’ minimalism, an  excessive theoretical simplification, which might  limit  instead of improving  learning.  The choice for TM should be the minimum  level of technology needed to reach an objective.  This presupposes that it is simple to compare lev- els of technology and outcomes; that the level of  technology does not affect the results; and that the  objectives of a course should be pre-determined  before  it  starts. An  opposite  perspective,  how- ever, claims that the curriculum – and learning  objectives – should be open and indeterminate,  collaboratively built during the course upon the  world of the real students. Peters  2004, p. 62 ,  for example, states that in the post-industrialized  distance education, the objectives are usually un- known in the beginning of the learning process,  which is not systematic, but random and intuitive.  Curricula should be open to discovery, investiga- tion, improvisation, indetermination, creativity,  and innovation, conceived as something in course,  unstable  and  dynamic.  From  this  perspective,  there  is  simply  no  way  of  pre-determining the  minimum of technology needed to reach well- defined instructional objectives. And the reason  for that is that there are no well-defined objectives,  nor content, before the learning experience starts. So much concern about the use of technolo- gies  above  the  minimum  may  not  make  sense  anymore,  and  some  educators  might  be  using  the  TM  argument  to  justify  their  resistance  to  learn new technologies, needed to teach the new  generation  of  students,  or  at  least  adequately  communicate with them. After all, why learn or  teach our students how to use technology instead  of doing pure teaching? Why should we confuse  the delivery platform with what is being delivered? Clark   1983   claims  that  media  are  “mere  vehicles  that  deliver  instruction  but  do  not  in- fluence student achievement any more than the  truck that delivers our groceries causes changes  in our nutrition”  p. 445 . But nutrition does not  include interaction with the truck, while education  implies interaction with and within technology.   171   Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life  not be ashamed to say: it is about technology in the  same sense that it is about education, not an edu- cation carriage pulling the subaltern technology. Focusing  on  education  does  not  preclude  focusing on technology, just as not focusing on  technology  does  not  guarantee  better  focus  on  education. The level of technology used changes  the educational process and its outcome.  According  to  constructivism,  the  focus  of  education is not on content, but on the process   Kanuka  &  Anderson,  1999 .  Quinn   2005   claims that we should not think about the design  of content, but on constructing experiences and  environments for learners to make decisions and  reflect  about  the  decisions  made.  Our  starting  point should not be to organize content, but how  the learner will act. Digital game-based learning  theory  Prensky, 2007  teaches us to start from  engagement and interaction, not from content and  instructional  design.  Richardson   2006   points  as a great change in education the collaborative  construction of social content. As virtual worlds  like SL involve a predisposition to collaborate,  there is no need to create and recreate courses and  content all the time: “At its core, Second Life is  a rich ecosystem of learning experiences that are  open to the public. Teachers don’t have to create  everything from scratch.”  John Lester as cited  in Waters, 2009   The  use  of  web  2.0  tools,  games,  and  3D  virtual worlds, without fear of venturing above a  minimum technological level, allow us to think  of a ‘minimalism of content’. That is to say, to  include a minimum level of ready content in the  design of courses, while motivating the learning  and use of tools by students to search, collect,  organize, and produce content during the course.  Different  tools  and  different  levels  of  technol- ogy should be adopted according to the interests  of different students. This can be accomplished  without  an  intense  focus  on  content   there  is  free content available to be used for almost any  course  and without fear of technology. Instead of  instructional designers trained to polish content,   The truck is not an environment for nutrition, while  technology is an environment for education. In a  layer even previous to the metaphor, delivery of  instruction is exactly what Freire  1982  criticized  as the “banking concept” of education.  Collins and Berge  2000  argue that, leaving  technology  aside,  students  and  teachers  could  concentrate  on  what  matters  most  –  teaching  and  learning. This  presupposes  a  clear  separa- tion between technology  or form, on one side   and education  or content, on the other . There  seems to be a certain level of naivety in this be- lief: here is the content we want to transmit, pre- determined, and for that transmission we should  find the minimum level of technology. If we use  more technology than needed, we risk spending  resources and taking the focus from content. As  if technology did not alter, radically, many times,  the content itself. As if learning to use new tools  would not be, in its own right, a precious type of  learning. As if siding with minimum technology  would mean a great victory, or a great choice. As  if it would be wiser to stop in time because of the  constant progress of technology.  The  TPCK  –  Technological  Pedagogical  Content Knowledge model, on the contrary, pro- poses the integration of content, technology, and  pedagogy  Angeli & Valanides, 2009; Mishara  & Koehler, 2006 . Technology cannot be clearly  separated from education anymore, it is not pos- sible to conceive both unbound. Depending on  the technology you choose the learning outcomes  will  be  different.  Technology  is  not  neutral  in  relation to education; it is not possible to project  educational objectives, slice them, and at the end  simply choose the minimum technology to deliver  that content. The tools affect not only content, but  the whole process of teaching and learning. The  equation became much more complex.  According to Batson  2008 , for more than  twenty  years  we  stated  that  it  was  not  about  technology, but about education. This rhetoric,  however, does not make sense anymore, if it ever  did, because it does a disservice to us. We should   172   Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life  we need designers capable of developing technol- ogy, environment, interaction and learning:  We often see the roles associated with design as  content or institutionally centred – instructional  designers, project managers, graphic artists, net- work specialists. However where are the designers  for learning or the interactive architects? Where  are the collaborative environment specialists? We  operate in a learner-centred collaborative context  and yet our design models are too often predicated  on face-to-face and teacher-centred paradigms.  If we are to achieve the full potential and benefits  that an online environment affords then we must  rethink  the  philosophies  and  practices  that  we  bring to the design environment.  Sims, 2006   FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  Many more studies are certainly needed on the use  of virtual worlds in education. Augmented reality  and mobile devices have brought new dimensions  for the use of virtual worlds in education, such as  dual or cross-reality  Lifton 2007, Lifton et al 2009,  Lifton & Paradiso 2009  and mobile simulations  and games  Klopfer, 2008 .  The importance of the environment in experi- ences in virtual worlds is also a very interesting  area of research. As online education used, since  its beginning, primarily text interfaces, the inter- action of teachers and students with the virtual  environment can be analyzed as a new variable in  the educational process, and its results measured. The character of the representation of our iden- tity in avatars, and how it affects online learning,  is also a growing and interesting area of research.  Schlemmer, Trein, & Oliveira  2009  and Trein   2010   are  exploring  this  direction. Trein’s  re- search concludes that with the creation of virtual  digital identities in SL the user feels engaged in  a rich, immersive and interactive experience due  to the sense of being the avatar and an integral  part of the environment. As a consequence, the   synchronicity of being together and the possibil- ity of expressing our corporality in virtual worlds  increase the feeling of presence and belonging,  contributing to the overcoming of the paradigm  of distance and the lack of physical presence in  online education.  3D  Virtual  Worlds  push  us  to  explore  new  pedagogies, questioning the excessive importance  given  to  content  in  online  education,  and  new  technologies allow us to exercise unimaginable  ways  of  socializing,  interacting,  and  learning.  Peer  2  Peer  University   http:  p2pu.org  ,  for  example, is an online community of open study  groups organized around open content available  online, and peer to peer assessment.  CONCLUSION  This chapter has criticized several reservations  against the use of Second Life in education based  on the principles of technological minimalism.  What is being proposed is that 3D virtual worlds,  such as Second Life, bypass the need to establish a  minimum use of technology in education, in addi- tion to calling for a minimum of content. Data and  content do not give us meaning; interaction does:  Content has always been the center of the human- computer interface. We have lived now for decades  with the ‘desktop’ and the ‘filing cabinet’ being  the primary metaphor for the human-computer  interaction. In learning, we spent years imple- menting learning management systems that are  essentially prisons for learning content. We had  a focus on content that reflected the hierarchy of  our organizations and of our learning models that  were available at that time. Now with the emer- gence of live avatar-based virtual environments,  we have the opportunity to move beyond content,  beyond rigid hierarchies, beyond the desktop, to  a learning environment focused on the context of  learning.  Burns, 2010, p. xi .  173   Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life  This is the same person but a new discourse,  which somehow ends the puzzle: time has come  for the death of technological minimalism, and  maybe the birth of content minimalism.  Second Life is today a free and open tool with  which educators and students are intensively ex- perimenting, and the importance of these experi- ments is not the level of technology used, but the  courage of these educators and students to explore  new dimensions in teaching and learning. Fur- thermore, the inspiration for these experiments is  not technological minimalism. This technological  minimalism, in its original approach, would not  allow us to engage in these tests, for which the  importance of content is lower than interaction.  Second  Life  will  die  someday,  but  this  reflec- tion may form the foundation not only for the  exploration of other virtual worlds, but also of  new technologies that might potentially be used  in education.

Instead, we should be wary of poor quality  professional development programs for teachers  to  integrate  technology  into  education.  While  our students master several tools such as virtual  worlds, many teachers are still far behind in using  these tools in education. As Chris Dede states:  I believe the greatest challenge facing educators is  empowering students to master such 21st century  skills as understanding and resolving complex,  novel  situations;  collaborating  with  a  diverse  team both face-to-face and across distance; and  producing knowledge by filtering and synthesizing  information. This requires fluency in information  technology for collaboration, information synthe- sis, and decision making. Schools of education  should make these types of learning experiences  central to teachers’ preparation.  Thatcher, 2005   Technological minimalism will not help us with  that challenge. It is interesting that this perspective  finds an echo in Berge’s new work. One year after  his mentioned article, he completely changes the  tone when referring to Second Life  Smith and  Berge, 2009 :  The  possibilities  for  educational  success  are  virtually endless.  Second Life is distance education 2.0. Develop- ment  of  MUVEs  will  take  distance  education  to  new  heights  over  the  next  decade.  In-world  educational events will be the primary source for  distance education.  Trips to museums, theaters, conferences, school,  and many other places can be accommodated in- world because of the technology of digital imita- tion and design. Because of that, another benefit  to in-world learning is that it can be a more cost  effective alternative to distance education.  174   Technological Minimalism vs. Second Life  Batson, T.  2008, June 8 .

The third position will be investigated further as the argument looks  into peculiarities of the evolving hybrid space that result from the combination of changes to the physi- cal through the fictional space. This continues the ongoing dissolution of the magic circle’s boundaries  and illustrates how fictional worlds expand into even non-game locations. Building on Popper’s system  of the 3 worlds, it is suggested that today’s fictional game worlds have already changed our physical  environments. In that, it partially closes the argument back to the earliest dreams of cyberspace but ar- rives not at a new mindspace to “log in” but instead at a new physical space in need of re-evaluation.  INTRODUCTION  Early on, spatiality has been noted as a defining  element of digital media. However, the kind of  space involved changed over time. Starting from  a perspective mainly informed by Human Com- puter Interaction  HCI  and Game Studies, this  paper looks at the development of space in video   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch012  games as it reaches out of the digital virtuality  into the physical domain. This is a necessarily  limited  view  at  the  complexities  of  the  debate  about space and our engagement with it. It focuses  at the increasing role of the physical domain in  digital game worlds and will sketch out three steps  in the development of video game spaces: from  an idealistic mindspace to the contested virtual  game worlds of commercial video games to the  more current interconnections between physical   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

The Players’ Dimension  Gibson’s work, and the Cyberpunk genre in gen- eral, have principally served to excite interest in  newly developing interactive computer systems. In  a social order whose economic and technological  rationale still seems centered on a Marinettian  notion  of  progress  -  where  ‘progress  is  right,  even  when  it’s  wrong’  -  the  lack  of  address  to  the cautionary aspects of the genre is perhaps  understandable. It is not surprising that a society  preoccupied with technology and consumerism  can more readily grasp the potential pleasures  of new media rather than predictions of the so- cial decay they might cause. Whatever Gibson’s   best  intentions, his work has created a desire  for cyberspace technologies in advance of their  production. Their current unavailability thereby  renders  them  objects  of  desire  par  excellence  for a high-tech consumer culture untroubled by  vague speculations as to their dystopian potential.   Hayward, 1993   Inspired by the promise of the new digital tech- nology and its usage, the prophets of cyberspace  called for a new kind of space, defined by a new  society, somehow stepping beyond the problems of  the flesh, at times stepping beyond the biological  altogether  Moravec, 1988 . These were places  to “log in” to a higher level of cyber-enhanced  consciousness and “drop out” of reality with its  social, economic, and political flaws.  Visionaries such as Douglas Engelbart, whose  perspective originated not from the cyberspace  fiction  of  Gibson  but  from  a  more  practical  and technological basis, promised “augmenting  man’s intellect”  Engelbart, 1988  with the help  of this new technology. In Engelbart’s case, this  famously included the mouse as control device  that offered new interaction options to the user.  Others expanded this perspective to a conquest of  new knowledge spaces through digital technology.  Cyberspace as such a deterritorialized knowledge  space was seen as the “civilization’s new horizon”   Levy, 1997 . As a techno-social construct offering  “a form of universally distributed intelligence”   and virtual game spaces. Although this paper will  suggest three – rather roughly defined – positions  in this development, it should be noted that these  positions do not necessarily contradict each other  in practice. As our involvement with game worlds  grows from an ongoing media history and widen- ing literacy, these three categories should be seen  as interwoven and parts of an ongoing evolution.  To clarify their differences, though, they will be  treated as separate entities.  The  three  entities  outlined  here  represent  three  different  yet  interconnected  answers  to  the question posed by the spatial representation  and practices in digital media. Thus, instead of  an excluding view that would replace one stage  with a new one, it is suggested to understand the  argument for stages as a cumulative one. Game  worlds can be understood as mindspaces as well  as virtual worlds as well as hybrid spaces. The  differentiation, as will be argued in the closing  section, happens in our actual engagement with  them, which can shift rapidly.  CYBERSPACE  Ever since the early days of digital media, vision- aries saw them as a new accessible space and a  world to explore. Howard Rheingold hoped that  cyberspace may be “a new laboratory of the spirit”   Rheingold,  1991 .  Supporting  the  idea  of  the  “spirit world” Barlow claimed “[o]urs is a world  that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not  where bodies live. We are creating a world that all  may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded  by race, economic power, military force, or sta- tion of birth”  Barlow, 1996 . Reflected in these  positions we see the visions of Gibson and other  visionaries as they popularized that mix of Sci- ence Fiction and technological origins that came  together to seed “cyberspace.” But it had to be  a mainly futuristic forward-looking perspective.  182   The Players’ Dimension  its aim was to provide “the mutual recognition  and  enrichment  of  individuals  rather  than  the  cult of fetishized or hypostatized communities”   Levy, 1997 .  As references to existing communities in many  of these works show, these perspectives were cer- tainly not devoid of social context. Many scholars  noted that these new spaces had to be discussed in  the context of existent cultural studies that offered  valuable debates from the conquest of the “new  world” as digital colonialism  Gunkel & Gunkel,  1997  to questions of body, gender, and identity   Stone, 1998 . The space itself, though, remained  a kind of new and yet-to-be-defined location with  new opportunities focused on the improvement  of the individual as well as the “collective intel- ligence” of the community at large.  VIRTUAL WORLDS  When  the  first  wave  of  game  worlds  became  available  on  household  computer  systems  it  looked very different from the promised cyber- space systems. Instead of embarking on the quest  for  a  new  freedom  offered  by  the  technology,  these commercially available worlds remediated  existing  forms  from  architectural  structures  to  interactive functionality and audio-visual presen- tation  Bolter & Grusin, 1999 . With remediation  comes  a  re-implementation  of  existing  media  politics. The result were not the digital promised  lands but familiarized virtual worlds that could  be discussed with the help of disciplines such as  anthropology or cognitive sciences. For example,  instead of logging in like Neo in The Matrix and  downloading knowledge modules to ones brain,  these worlds were seen as bases for perceptual  learning  Greenfield, 1984 . Perceptual qualities,  cognitive processes during play, and psychological  states such as flow or immersion offered criteria  adapted from neighboring disciplines to analyze  these worlds. It is telling that an extended discus- sion in academia worried about which discipline   should be responsible for the critical analysis of  these worlds – now that they had become artifacts  available and worthy of study. The more the game  environments consolidated as media, the more the  players’  relationship  to  them  became  relevant.  One did not seamlessly log in to a new world but  the limitations of our perception influenced our  orientation  in  the  virtual  space   Henry,  1992 ,  spatial understanding was realized as dependent  on navigation in physical spaces  Anders, 1998;  Darken & Sibert, 1993 , gender was not eliminated  in these worlds but found new forms of represen- tation  Jenkins, 1998 , navigation was identified  as crucial  Guenzel, 2008 , as was the interplay  between spatial construct and visual presentation   Nitsche, 2009 .  Revisiting  their  hopeful  positive  outlooks  visionaries like Rheingold adjusted their projec- tions. Rheingold had to admit that the “unalloyed  positive social benefit”  Rheingold, 2000  that was  attributed to cyberspace in earlier writings  in this  case: in Rheingold’s original 1985 edition of the  same book  had not materialized. The predicted  new enlightenment had not happened here – at least  not yet. Instead, these worlds turned into virtual  piazzas,  arenas,  and  labyrinths.  The  designed  spaces of all those ever-evolving game worlds lay  the grounds for the emergence of game worlds as  fictional environments in countless video game  settings.  They  used  existing  fictions,  physical  and cognitive conditions, and media techniques  to form their own entities. The Sony Playstation  2 slogan “Live in Your World. Play in Ours” il- lustrates that eventually these game spaces were  seen and marketed as self-sufficient environments  next  to  the  “real”  world.  Players  visited  these  worlds from time to time, and engaged with their  particular rules and regulations.  Instead of a holistic virtual mindspace, these  spaces  were  legion  and  defined  by  clear  de- marcation lines – each one defined by a unique  configuration incompatible to the others’. Each  game set up a world for its own. As Dodge and  Hitchins  realized,  when  they  worked  on  maps   183   The Players’ Dimension  clans, tribes, guilds, countless chat communities,  and virtual citizens of branded individual online  worlds. Often these communities were described as  equipped with new technological features around  which a specific community could evolve as it al- lowed users to express and explore their own  and  others’  social realities. The technical prowess of  the underlying virtual world co-shaped the forming  of the community. The new evolving communities  where  investigated  by  countless  scholars  from  very different perspectives including the social  activities within these worlds  Ducheneaut, Yee,  Nickell, & Moore, 2006 . Based on these shared  social realities, players formed connections that  expanded beyond the virtual and into the physical  world  Taylor, 2006 . Even though these effects  were noticed by many, a certain surprise prevailed  when they materialized. Seemingly shocked, some  authors realized that real social life grew on the  Petri dish provided by the virtual  Dibbell, 1999 .  The virtual world had become an accepted own  fictional location that attracted a lot of research  to the degree that the reference back to the social  realities of the players had to be re-discovered.  HYBRID SPACES  To repeat the initial caveat: the three positions  marked out here are presented as historical, that  means  that  there  are  continuous  overlaps  and  gradual transformations. It also allows for breaks,  rejections, and full-blown refutations to develop  over time. These, too, are part of virtual space  history. Some of the most acclaimed visionaries  of the cyberspace era, like Lanier, have turned  into sharp critics  Lanier, 2009 . Consequently,  the positions outlined so far should be read as  debated  and  dynamic  points  on  a  trajectory.  Along this trajectory one finds the third position  suggested here. It is based on the aforementioned  growing interdependencies between the virtual  and the real and might be best introduced with the  commercial campaign at the launch of Nintendo’s   for cyberspace structures: “cyberspace does not  consist of one homogenous space; it is a myriad  of rapidly expanding cyberspaces, each providing  a different form of digital interaction and com- munication”   Dodge  &  Kitchin,  2001 .  These  spaces offered access and opportunity for personal  growth as outlined by many scholars before but in  a highly specific way. Their effects were suddenly  measured, contextualized and compared to other  media, and their inner workings were gradually  disseminated in relation to their individual rule  systems in the discipline that emerged as its new  academic  home,  Game  Studies.  The  resulting  game  worlds  might  not  answer  the  call  for  a  consciousness-enhancing  unified  virtual  future  but they proved to be immensely successful as  virtual playgrounds. Their new spatial structures  offered solutions to many problems of game design  from the aforementioned remediation to narra- tive, cinematic and dramatic influences. Maybe  most importantly, these worlds were realized as  dynamic social spaces where emergent play could  evolve. One social construct that seemed to work  exceptionally well in this context was the idea of  the “magic circle.”  The arena, the card-table, the magic circle, the  temple,  the  stage,  the  screen,  the  tennis  court,  the court of justice, etc., are all in form and func- tion play-grounds, i.e. forbidden spots, isolated,  hedged  round,  hallowed,  within  which  special  rules obtain. All are temporary worlds within the  ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of  an act apart.   Huizinga, 1950  here cf  Salen &  Zimmerman, 2006    The  conditions  of  engagement  with  these  worlds was seen as something outside our daily  routine, as a special state that transforms players  according to the circumstances of the virtual arenas  they enter. Within these circles, societies formed  based on the conditions of the given worlds and the  interactions with them. Depending on the provided  virtual  environment,  different  groups  evolved:   184   The Players’ Dimension  Wii console in its difference to the Playstation 2  slogan used to identify the second stage of game  space  development  above.  Instead  of  praising  the qualities of the new hardware, showing off  the graphical wonders of the new generation, or  at least advertising the titles available at launch  date, Nintendo’s TV commercials looked from  the virtual world into the living room. A camera  seemingly set inside the TV set observed players  in their living rooms using the new Wii controller  as they were obviously interacting with some- thing off-screen behind the camera. The virtual  world they played with remained left open to the  imagination of the audience, supported by sound,  movement of the controller, and occasional light  or visual effects. Instead of looking into the virtual  to introduce a polygon-constructed playground,  the Wii looked outwards into the living room to  emphasize the physical as part of their concept  of the game world. The result illustrates the shift  of perspective that led to a new invasion from  the virtual game world into the physical realms  of daily life.  Effects of the digital revolution have been iden- tified from transformations of urban landscapes   Mitchell, 1995 , to public spaces, and individual  model  homes  such  as  Georgia  Tech’s  “Aware  Home.” On the one hand, we find the emergence  of “smart spaces” equipped with new technology  that adds new functionality to the location, like  technologies for assisted living or more efficient  work  places.  On  the  other  hand,  we  sense  the  expansion of fictional worlds that infuse the ex- istent space with new meaning instead of actual  functionality. This effect depends on technology  such as new interfaces, new sensors, new hard-  and software, but it uses them as stepping-stones  to develop a fiction and not as an end of means.  The result of these worlds is not the visible and  functional presence of new technologies to provide  new forms of usability through digital technol- ogy but a change of the existent perception of  the  everyday  surroundings  through  expanding  game universes. While both are interconnected,   the goal is not an expansion of the technology but  the development of the fiction.  Augmented  Reality  applications  display  in- formation on my favorite restaurant, hovering as  virtual bubbles right next to it. Google Map’s street  view positions “me” next to “my house” which  looks most likely different than it does in the pres- ent physical world. The Build-A-Bear Workshop  expanded from physical shops to create your own  stuffed animals to an online service where animals  are designed virtually and then shipped to their  future owners – or remain completely digital in  their video games. This is not only a technical  expansion but also a fictionalization of my physi- cal surroundings. As a result, we have to re-think  our existing spaces as the new dimension of the  digital has been added to them.  SERIOUS PLAY  Facilitating this kind of rethinking, the role of  the game systems had to change. A key word of  the evolution of game systems is the notion of  convergence. Here, convergence is applied as a  step into a new quality of space. The formerly  distinct game console became a networked me- dia center, able to replace traditional TV formats  by  streaming  downloadable  content  and  offer- ing increasingly hybrid services like Netflix or  facebook next to their original gaming domain.  Media usage – including game usage – evolved  into an open field of experimentation. Because  these media had become partially responsible as  contributors to the socialization process of their  audiences, the blurring of media boundaries also  blurred the confinements of the virtual playground.  The effect can be traced in the reactions of the  visitors to these playgrounds. The perception of  some players to take a game world as “real” or  “serious” is not new. Already in 1990, at the dawn  of  online  worlds,  Richard  Bartle,  one  of  their  pioneers interrogated the blurring between offline  and online life, between playing it and “living it”:  185   The Players’ Dimension  the  formerly  clearly  located  game  world  leaps  into the physical everyday-world to change our  perception of and engagement with this former  non-game world. McGonigal traces these effects  in an ARG community’s response to the attacks  on the World Trade Center: after the 9 11 attacks,  discussions flared up in the Cloudmaker commu- nity – key ARG players – whether the network  of many collaborating players in a game world  could be used to solve the mystery of the attacks.  As ARGs mainly depend on the cooperation of  players in solving very complex puzzles that are  seemingly situated in the “real” world, this ap- peared to some players as a viable option. It had  become a way of life.  For many, working closely with the Cloudmak- ers group had profoundly affected their sense of  identity and purpose, to the point that a game  mentality was a natural response to real-world  events.  McGonigal, 2003   Not only did the play activity change the play- ers’ abilities and performances, but the missing  boundaries of the play space also changed their  engagement  with  the  physical  world  and  the  historical  problem  at  hand.  The  game  space’s  functionality, part of its virtuality, had been inte- grated into the non-game space via the extension  of the fictional universe. Explaining this effect,  McGonigal refers back to Levy’s principle of “col- lective intelligence.” For her, an ARG such as I  Love Bees has the power to facilitate “a visceral,  first-person, hands-on experience of collaborative  cognition, networked cooperation, and real-time  coordination. Players develop a familiarity with  CI [= Collective Intelligence] techniques through  direct experience”  McGonigal, 2008 . For game  spaces, this means that the spatial practices of the  player change. The player rapidly moves between  physical  and  digital,  fictional  and  factual,  and  these movements, physical as well as imagined,  are the new frontier to be investigated.  Surely, though, things which wield this kind of  emotional power over people can’t be mere games?  The passions roused in  traditional  MUAs [=  Multi-User Adventures] have the kind of fire to  them normally reserved for religious or political  evangelism. People aren’t so much playing the  MUA as living it.  Bartle, 1990   Bartle’s virtual environments were predomi- nantly  text-based  but  that  did  not  stop  players  from including them in their version of “reality.”  Even given the technical limitations, these worlds  were immensely attractive for players. Not unlike  cyberspace’s conscious-altering qualities, exces- sive play experience was described as “addictive:”  MUDs [= Multi-User Dungeons] are addictive,  as we who play them are well aware. Gibson and  the rest were right about the addictive possibili- ties of cyberspace. They were just wrong about  the magnitude.  Bryant Durrell, founder of the  online world Islandia cf  Bartle, 1990    Where to find a balance between the two poles  was and still is debated but the infusion of the  physical world with digital space – as exempli- fied with the Wii launch – does not necessarily  follow the dualism of virtual versus real, online  versus offline, play versus life. It combines them. A second example to illustrate this emergence  of a hybrid space are Alternate Reality Games   ARG   and  their  battle  cry  of  “This  is  Not  a  Game.” The Wii still embraced the living room  of the player from a fixed perspective, namely  that of the stationary console. In contrast, ARGs,  posterchilds of convergence, cannot be located in  a single media form or location. In fact, “[p]art  of what characterizes an ARG is that the game  universe is not explicitly limited to a particular  piece of software or set of digital content”  Kim,  Allen,  &  Lee,  2008 .  If  the  playground  is  not  defined anymore, then the perception of an ongo- ing play state and play space can take over. As  the play state becomes part of the everyday-life,   186   The Players’ Dimension  The  way  these  players  make  sense  of  their  surrounding spaces shift and alters the quality of  physical space as well as that of the fictional digital  game world. In this case, digital media project a  new quality onto already existing environments  even if there is no factual change in their physical  conditions but only a perceptual shift. The Cloud- makers did not have a pre-designed puzzle at their  hand for 9 11, there were no definite clues in the  media landscape pre-implanted, but players looked  at the situation as a game state. The physical world  had been changed by the “virtual realities” of the  digital game construct.  SHAPING SPACES  Game worlds today use both techniques. They  invade the physical spaces with the help of new  technology  just  like  “smart  spaces”  and  they  expand the fictional world through a shift of per- ception. Both are interconnected. An ARG like I  Love Bees that uses GPS-based treasure hunts as  well as complex networks of web sites and code  snippets, expands beyond a given horizon because  these technologies are accepted to be ubiquitous  in our every day life.  We  had  a  few  basic  design  principles:  Come  into the players’ lives in every way possible. We  hosted Web sites for you to browse, sent emails  to your inbox, and arranged for faxes to be sent  to your office ‘by mistake.’ We got a gravel-voice  Microsoft employee to record a menacing mes- sage from a robot revolutionary and then called  players on their phones, which was electrifying,  particularly at the home where a player’s grand- mother answered the call.  Then we had a polite  conversation with the police, but that’s another  story. ”  Sean Steward, author for The Beast cf   Montola, Stenros, & Waern, 2009    Because the game includes usage of formerly  non-game devices  like the telephone  its effects  reach beyond the agreed-upon-demarcation line  that was the magic circle. A teddy from Build-A- Bear might be born in digital space but will sit on  a real world toy chest. Because these technologies  travel with us, blend into their surroundings, and  increasingly are found everywhere, the intercon- nected game space can be everywhere. Conver- gence and ubiquitous computing have driven the  development of game worlds into a phase where  they are not bound anymore to be experienced  through a window that carries the player away  through immersion into the virtual, but instead  they diffuse into any location they want. Because  we do not have to log in anymore, no place is left  untouched and the logging out becomes the real  challenge.  Game  spaces  as  virtual  stages  have  devel- oped  an  expressive  vocabulary  that  does  not  merely reject the limitations of the magic circle  “inside” a computer system. Video game worlds  have outgrown the magic circle as they settle in  today’s media space. A wave of new interfaces  such as guitars  Guitar Hero , bongos  Donkey  Konga ,  complete  band  set  ups   Rock  Band ,  dance mats  Dance Dance Revolution , motion  controllers   Nintendo’s  Wii ,  steering  wheels,  cameras  Microsoft’s Kinect , microphones, cell  phones and tablet computer as game platforms as  well as many other technologies have digitized  our households. Not only do they change existing  architecture, as the coffee table has to give way  for the Rock Band drum set, but they are also  signs of the acceptance of the hybrid space as a  fictional  space. As  more  technologies  become  commonplace in our environments, this projection  grows more likely – even if these technologies  are not actively used by the audience. The media  landscape often successfully closes this loop for  us, often via commerce. A Green Day video for  their song “Last of the American Girls” might  be delivered by the avatars of their video game   187   The Players’ Dimension  open but to describe this shift and its effects on  our knowledge of the world, the essay concludes  with a reference back to the philosophy of Karl  Popper.  Popper  argues  for  three  different,  yet  equally “real” worlds:     World 1 consists of the physical facts such  as plants, humans, magnetic and physical  forces.     World 2 is the mental  psychological world  individual   consisting  of  experiences,  thoughts, beliefs, and emotions.     World  3  is  the  world  of  “products  of  the  human mind”  Popper, 1980  that are not  individual experiences but interchangeable  objects such as language, fiction, and sci- entific theories.  Especially  Popper’s  defense  of  an  absolute  knowledge in World 3 has been debated but this  debate is not at the heart of how his distinction  will be applied here. Following Popper’s model,  WiFi coverage as a question of signal strength and  transmitter positioning is an element of World 1;  the data of a specific web page, such as the text  of a digitized Shakespeare writing would be part  of World 3; a web user reading this text and de- veloping an unique understanding of it would be  part of World 2. However, a simple transition of  this model on more dynamic and interactive texts  is not unproblematic  Tavinor, 2005 . In interac- tive digital media a data set would not rely on a  single version of the Shakespeare play but instead  provide a “possible world” realized in a dynamic  manifestation of the text that could be a blog, a  game session, a chat room, or an event organized  by the Second Life Shakespeare company. We  might speak of rules and systems as underlying  and shared elements of the “human mind.” In other  words, a pre-designed quest in World of Warcraft  is a World 3 object, conducting the quest and the  player’s  experiences  are  a World  2  object,  the  computers involved are World 1 objects.  Green Day: Rock Band performing the piece on  a virtual game stage for a broadcast on the tele- vision network MTV, which acquired the game  company Harmonix, designers of Rock Band, in  2006. The video creates an association with the  game even for those who do not play or do not  own that specific version of the Rock Band fran- chise and it spreads the game’s visuals as equal  to other MTV videos to everybody watching the  video broadcast. The connection is much more  effective for the viewers familiar with the game  and its functionality, though. For those players   viewers the game world and non-game world have  morphed into a hybrid navigated by the player,  not unlike it did in I Love Bees.  Its first shift was their playful participation in  the music through the game that stages the player  as part of the band; the second is the re-shaping  of the “reality” of Green Day itself. In a media- driven world that has already seen fictional pop  stars like the cartoon pop band Gorillaz, a virtual  Green Day line up remains credible enough. That  this change is indeed very “real” surfaced in the  debates  on  Kurt  Cobain’s  representation  as  a  playable avatar in Guitar Hero 5 that were seen as  threatening to his legacy. His widow, Love, called  them “lethal”  Michaels, 2009 , as they depicted  Cobain as a singer of songs that were not seen  appropriate to his musical status. The possible  misrepresentation of the artist as a virtual being  and the public’s reaction show that the borderlines  have blurred between the musician’s performance  space, the virtual game space, the media space,  and  the  actual  singer  and  band  members,  who  are simulated in the avatars’ movements and lip  synched animations. As the representation comes  full circle through countless commercial media  outlets, the effects of the converging hybrid game  space become at times painfully tangible.  The  shift  questions  the  distinction  between  fiction  and  non-fiction  and  presents  an  episte- mological challenge. As this change into hybrid  game spaces is an ongoing phenomenon that is  still gaining momentum, the challenge remains   188   The Players’ Dimension  In comparison, Benedikt argues: “cyberspace,  we might now see, is nothing more, or less, than  the latest stage in the evolution of World 3, with  the ballast of materiality cast away—cast away  again, and perhaps finally”  Benedikt, 1991 . It  was the goal of this essay to point out that this  “casting away” of the materiality is in fact not the  defining action and that, instead of disappearing,  the “ballast of materiality” is returning to a center  stage, changed and reinvigorated by the digital. Bolter and Grusin are closer to this argument  as they argue against Benedikt that “cyberspace  refashions and extends earlier media, which are  themselves embedded in material and social en- vironments”  Bolter & Grusin, 1999 . But while  remediation sees an evermore-complex family tree  of media rooted in social and physical conditions,  Popper  separates  into  different  interconnected  worlds of different distinct “realities.” Without  disagreeing with Bolter  Grusin, this essay used  the media aspect as a means of transition between  those “realities.” It is through the experience of  information through various media that the “real- ity” of the game world affects the “reality” of every  other world and that the game space can spill over  into the world of our everyday life.  Where do these trends lead us? A change of  reality has been discussed particularly in pervasive  gaming communities  Montola, et al., 2009  with a  specific emphasis on the game design mechanisms  that facilitate such a change. Spinning it further,  the concept of a “gamification” of life has been  recently popularized  Priebatsch, 2010; Schell,  2010 , which is based on an even more aggres- sive inclusion of game mechanics in everyday  world behavior. This can include reward points  for appropriate social behavior or personal per- formance – from points collected for using public  transportation to motivational rewards to support  a more sustainable personal lifestyle. Gamifica- tion implies that game rules take over real world  conditions. To the extent that this is based on an  extension of the fictional world created by a virtual  system, this claim mirrors the argument made in   this chapter. But unlike the emphasis on the means  in which the game design can re-shape the real  world in an almost law-like force, the emphasis  here is on the fictional. Our everyday environments  tend to become play grounds not because of the  law of a game highscore, enforced by implanted  sensors, tracked by huge data mining endeavors,  and tied to some grand reward scheme of neces- sarily gigantic proportions. The change this paper  suggests  grows  from  a  different  understanding  of  our  surroundings  based  on  the  connections  of game worlds across the boundary of real and  virtual. It does not depend on additional hardware  but on the realization that the digital world has  become part of the physical one. Existent game  consoles have already changed our surroundings.  As this reality sinks into our consciousness these  consoles’ game worlds re-shape our idea of the  world we live in. Gamification is not taking over  life but game worlds simple fall into place in the  framework that Popper presented and future dis- cussions need to realize this new unity of space to  truly make sense of the digital worlds we create.

We posit that through the process of agency, the authorial nar- rative, structurally positioned at the conceptual core of the virtual world, may contribute to the diversity  of variables involved in the creation of a framing  Goffman, 1974  in which the users will engage in  interaction among themselves. According to Dramaturgical Sociology, the resulting meaning from an  interaction strongly depends on the context in which it is situated; such notion is precisely the reason  why, by observing an environment so intensely imbued by symbols from popular culture, European folk- lore and medieval fantasy, we may also examine how such signs may assist in the creation of behavioral  scripts – and how these are played by the players interacting in the virtual world.  “In the theatre the audience wants to be  surprised - but by things that they expect.”  Tristan Bernard, French Dramatist     DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch013  Despite  the  usual  media  framing  referring  to  MMORPGs  as  mere  video  games  –  or,  in  an  oversimplification,  games  –  it  is  necessary  to  point out that such terminology does not convey  a proper treatment of the complexity caught up  in  the  social  and  psychological  facets  of  these  environments. Such phenomena lacks two distinct   Copyright   2012, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  characteristics of these virtual worlds:  1  firstly,  it summarily ignores the aspects of world that are  projected by the environments, with their own  rules, acting up both inherently, concerning the  rules of the world, or related to the practices of  appropriation, evoking the social rules created by  the players on their own;  2  secondly, if we take a  closer look in the functions such environments are  prone to assume, we may approach a ruling that  may address virtual worlds not as merely game  systems, but will focus on the features concerned  with the communication processes or spatial ap- propriations. Previous research in this field has  pointed  out  several  of  these  practices,  ranging  from behavioral modifications based on contact  with virtual worlds  Yee, 2007  to the possibility  of experimenting an environment like World of  Warcraft   Blizzard  Entertainment,  2004   as  an  arena for mere flânerie through a digital theme  park  Aarseth, 2009 .  This latter proposition sustains the core of the  argument  of  this  paper. Aarseth   2009   brings  forth,  by  discussing  spatial  practices  in  World  of  Warcraft,  the  thoughts  of Angela  Ndalianis   2005  about the various aspects of contemporary  entertainment and how the diegetic space, leaves  the safe haven of cinema and television screens  and transports itself to theme parks in which we  are able to wander through the fictional world and  watch wonders that previously could only be ex- perienced through special effects. However, there  is another of Ndalianis’  2005  arguments that is  directly connected to Aarseth’s  2009  thoughts:  Entertainment  forms  such  as  computer  games,  comic books, theme parks, and television shows  have  become  complexly  interwoven,  reflecting  the interests of multinational conglomerates that  have investments in numerous media companies.  One media form serially extends its own narrative  spaces and spectacles and those of other media  as well. Narrative spaces weave and extend into  and from one another, so much so that, at times, it   is difficult to discuss one form of popular culture  without  referring  to  another   Ndalianis,  2005,  p. 157 .   Aarseth  2009  is especially concerned how  Ndalianis  2005  deals with theme parks as envi- ronments in which we are able to enter the diegesis.  The Norwegian scholar establishes a comparison  in order to address the spatial practices developed  by World of Warcraft  WoW  players. If Ndalia- nis   2005   is  particularly  interested  in  aspects  of the Jurassic Park franchise – the movie, the  video game and the theme park at Orlando  FL,  EUA  – Aarseth  2009  approaches the problem  from another angle: he believes the way visitors  behave at theme parks is very alike to the way  WoW players build up their gameplay practices. According to him  Aarseth, 2009 , such com- parison is legitimate because WoW players are not  able to effectively modify the world under their  avatars – and even if they try to do it, by engag- ing  mobs  and  slaying  monsters,  these  quickly  re-spawn, and the locus returns to its initial state.  While some MMOGs allow their players to create  buildings and govern towns or districts, in Azeroth  the player is a ghost-like guest on an uncaring,  slick surface, a stranger in a strange land. The  nature of the game dynamics can be compared  to  a  theme  park  ride,  the  Fordist  paradigm  of  assembly-line mass entertainment as pioneered  by Disney: “Move along, please, more enjoyable  monsters and sights await around the next cor- ner.” The flying transporter beasts on their fixed  trajectories resemble most of all a scenic conveyor  belt or a monorail train taking tourists or workers  to the next attraction or work site  Aarseth, 2009,  p. 114, emphasis added .  Although  the  deliberation  about  entertain- ment venues seems to depart from the argument  of this paper, it is necessary to point out that the  emphasis  added  to  the  citation  presents  an  in-  193   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  process. We actually would rather refer to such  process as merely illusory – vision supported by  the work of additional researchers  MacCallum- Stewart  and  Parsler,  2007;  Krzywinska,  2009   – and finally posit that such illusion actually is  structured between the diegetic and systematic  aspects of a MMORPG, or, in a simpler way, that  the illusory agency process may be split into two  branches, one related to the rules, the other related  to the narrative supporting the environment. Our  efforts  questioning  the  agency  process  intend  to, finally,  2  express that the fictional agency  may incur in the formation of behavioral scripts,  suggesting actions and attitudes that should be  performed by the players – both concerning the  aspects of the gameplay, the social aspects of the  situational context.  ON THE COMPOSITION  OF MMORPGS  According to the work of Jesper Juul  2005 , the  pivotal understanding of video games as composed  by rules and fiction is the offspring of a debate  that defines the field since the 1990s, when Es- pen Aarseth  1997  published his treatise on the  systematic and interactive aspect of certain types  of text – cybertexts – and Janet Murray  1997   published her essay on the dramatic nature of the  new aspects of media. Even though both books  are not the only ones defending their respective  alignments – Espen Aarseth’s Cybertext: Perspec- tives on Ergodic Literature and Janet Murray’s  Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narra- tive in Cyberspace – they certainly are the more  emblematic,  therefore,  more  often  cited  when  addressing the dichotomy ludology-narratology. Historically, narratology has been more uni- versally discussed which caused the first video  game studies to concern the fictional aspects of  such media  Murray, 1997; Ryan, 2001; Laurel,  1993 . The issue on addressing this medium solely   teresting thought: even though MMORPGs are  usually  considered  an  immediate  reference  on  how open-ended a video game can actually be,  such possibilities are certainly subordinated to the  Worlds of Code  Pargman, 2003  created by the  programmers and designers responsible for the  construction of the virtual world as a symbolic  product subject to consumption – and as ergodic  text  Aarseth, 1997 .  It  is  important,  at  this  point,  to  realize  that  video games are devices that enclose a particular  feature, commonly referred as the simple presence  of interactivity. They require a particular kind of  action so they are able to produce any meaning.  Even though we may say that traditional repre- sentational media demands activity from readers,  Galloway  2006  clarifies that there are several  differences separating video games from books  and movies – and this is the reason why he dismiss  the idea of interactivity and embrace the notion  that video games are actually an “action-based  medium”  Galloway, 2006, p. 3 . Given that we  are heading towards this argumentation, we should  introduce, in order to add a measure of complex- ity, the notion of agency, which basically is how  a player may exert his will into the game world.  Even though we shall properly address this con- cept further in the paper, it is worthy to note that  although the range of actions that a character in  WoW can perform is absolutely conditioned by the  player’s will, it is also conditioned by the actions  the system allows him to execute.  If we consider video games as devices struc- tured by a close relationship between rules and  fiction  –  composition  previously  defended  by  Juul  2005  – and specially considering our recent  work regarding the immersive process related to  video  games   Ferreira  and  Falcão,  2009 ,  this  paper aims at  1  discussing the fact that if we  consider a specific facet of the notion of agency  concerned with MMORPGs,  Krzywinska, 2009;  Murray, 1997 , we may be able to achieve a par- ticular understanding of the completeness of such   194   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  through this specific theoretical lens, obviously  is due to the lack of a simple component, the key  to this research: the fact that video games are,  after all, games.  In video games, the performance of the actor  is actually demanded by the system, and without  it there is no possible event. Meanwhile, if we  observe  the  so-called  ‘passive’  narratives,  the  spectator reader solely allows the diegetic events  to follow their course, and the action performed  by  him  is  restricted  to  the  psychological  and  cognitive processes involved in the act of fruition   Machado, 2007 .  This discrepancy between video games and  traditional representational media, however, must  be carefully handled: scholars like Janet Murray   1997   consider  this  dichotomist  notion  rather  dangerous, believing, instead, that the game is but  a particular form of drama, where a great amount  of the classic strategies of narrative analysis will  still work.  Although every game has its rules, we often  come across games that besides rules, also project  a fictional world that helps to frame the context  and position the characters in a particular given  universe. According to Juul  2005, p. 121 , rules  and fiction compete for the players’ attention–  even they showing up traces of asymmetry. This  is related to the fact that we can talk about rules  without necessarily referring to fiction, although  it is impossible to deal with fiction in video games  without  considering  the  rules  portrayed  in  the  universe. Juul  2005, p. 123  discuss this issue  when addressing what he calls incoherent worlds  – worlds where the narrative cannot necessarily  explains what happens in the game world, and the  only thing that can actually do that is the rules.  It is interesting to remark that when discussing  fiction, and considering the fact that the video  games can actually project worlds, Juul  2005   makes  use  of  the  concept  of  possible  worlds,  borrowed from analytical philosophy. According  to the author, “In its most basic form, possible  worlds can be understood as abstract collections   of states of affairs, distinct from the statements  describing those states”  Juul, 2005, p. 122 . What  he is trying to convey is the fact that in any work  that makes use of a fictional world – a book, for  instance – the portrayed scene is far much smaller  than the world around it. Take British writer J. K.  Rowling’s  Harry  Potter  and  the  Philosopher’s  Stone, for instance: the action takes place in a  British countryside castle. However, we expect –  we even know – that the world outside Hogwarts  is as big and detailed as the world we experience  in a daily basis.  Although we may be imbued by the conscience  that the fictional world projected by a specific  work on a specific medium is larger than what  we  actually  contemplate,  we  may  affirm  that  such gaps also depend strongly of the readers  players  in  contact  with  any  given  world.  This  is why we consider these worlds as incomplete   Juul, 2005, p. 122  taking us to the principle of  minimal departure  Ryan, 1991, 48-60 , created  by Marie-Laure Ryan to deal with the problem of  incompleteness in fictional worlds: she believes  that when a piece of information about a particular  world is not specified by its author, we usually fill  in the blanks, using our understanding of reality.  Such explanation prevents authors of describing  minimal and transparent rules when portraying  their worlds, like the law of gravity, for example.  This issue is deeply related to how these fictional  worlds  may  be  represented  in  video  games  in  general. According to Parlett  1999, p. 6 , “How  representational a game is depends on the level  at which it is being played and the extent of the  player’s imagination.”  The idea of discussing rules and fiction is to  address properly the elements of game presented  in a MMORPG. It’s valid to highlight the fact  that if such environments tend to display aspects  of a game, they are also projected in order to be  used as virtual environments dedicated for the  phenomena  of  mediated  communication.  It  is  not uncommon at all to observe players engaged  in strictly social activities, such as chatting on   195   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  and fictional spaces in the component of social  appropriation. This may be seen, for example, in  Second Life  Linden Lab, 2003 , where complex  rules of etiquette were created by users, as well  as islands which are dedicated to a specific fic- tional aspect: replicating places from WoW or the  Victorian England.  ON  ILLUSORY  AGENCY  We have mentioned before that what character- izes video games as a medium that is different  from  traditional  representational  media  is  the  necessity of interaction – the need for the player  to act, pressing buttons and controlling levers so  there is a narrative progression, thus making the  story being told develop further. The main dif- ference, therefore, is the fact that we are finally  able to control the actions of the main character  of a tale, deciding what will be done and which  ways will it take.  According to Brazilian scholar Arlindo Macha- do  2007 , one of the particular components of the  immersive process in video games is the notion of  agency, where the actor experiences the feeling  that his decisions actually matter to the decisions  placed in particular determining points of a nar- rative. The point here is: when interacting with  a text, are we able to experience this so-called  sense of influence?  Strictu sensu, the answer is yes – as mentioned  by Machado  2007 , an electronic narrative needs  interaction to work properly. Even in the most  simple cases – a two way flux, for example – one  of the options need to be chosen, so the reader  would be able to access specific points in the story. If we observe through a wider lens, though, we  may realize that no matter how open ended and  full of possibilities is the narrative, it will always  answer to a matrix of results that was predicted by  the game designers. When this does not happen,  if an appropriation or an accident of gameplay   public  channels,  interacting  with  one  another,  role-playing. Taking World of Warcraft as an ex- ample, this feeling becomes even more present:  although there may be meaning on experiencing  the world in a lonely way – thus interacting with  the authorial cybertext only – the world is designed  according to a specific logic where the effective  evolution will only be achievable by participat- ing on a larger – quasi-omnipresent – network of  people controlling other characters and building up  both a social-economic, as well as psychological  fabric. Concerning this social prerogative pres- ent in WoW, Aarseth  2009, p. 115  states that  the proper understanding to such phenomena is  accepting that it consists of a “automatic social  cruelty”  –  a  craving  for  frequently  interaction  with a personal network of contacts and with the  ‘generalized other’, to reference Mead’s notion   1934 , for generally it is not enough to deal only  with  the  limited  group  of  known  people  from  offline contexts, if the objectives are related to  effective progression in the MMORPG.  Those who fail the group fail themselves in the  quest for leveling up, and soon find themselves  looking for another group. The automatic social  cruelty of this mechanism is as elegant as it is un- ethical. Casual players must fend for themselves;  disloyalty to the group and to the game is its own  punishment. On a higher institutional level, the  guilds function as player-policed assembly lines  in an attempt to ensure that the most dedicated  players receive all the rewards and benefits the  game has to offer  AARSETH, 2009, p. 115 .   We  should  make  clear,  at  this  point,  that  MMORPGs  are  a  particular  component  of  a  larger  category:  the  virtual  worlds.  This  con- ceptual separation is due to the fact that virtual  worlds are generally projected to be interaction  environments, supposedly disregarding the game  structure here represented through the dialogue  between rules and fiction. And even when they do  it, they place the responsibility of creation of rules   196   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  reveals a detail that was not projected, the game  will likely experience a glitch, or a bug.  This line of thinking leads us to question the  true application of the agency process, due to the  fact that what happens is actually programmed,  projected. Further: consider, for example, games  where the agency only gives the player the pos- sibility of changing a few features of the character,  never experiencing power over the story being  told   MacCallum-Stewart  and  Parsler,  2007 .  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  such  issue  is  not  restricted  to  single  player  video  games,  where  the  reader  experiments  production  of  meaning  in a relationship that may be generally reduced  to a human-machine interaction; meanwhile, we  may identify this same subject in the relationship  established between readers and WoW, where it  is actually enhanced by the way the quest system  links players and the world.  In  World  of  Warcraft,  there  are  thousands  of choices at hand to be made: the player may  work in secondary professions, simply chat, and  pursue more mounts or vanity pets. Everything is  subscribed to decisions of the game design. It is  possible, then, to question the idea of agency, to  address it, according to Krzywinska, as illusory:  Undertaking quests lends the player a sense that  they are playing a role in the history of the game  world.  While  this  is  important  in  stitching  the  player into the game’s overarching narrative, it is  however a form of ‘illusory’’ agency because it is  patently obvious to any player that they undertake  the very same tasks already completed by others   Krzywinska, 2009, p. 127 .  We are not saying there is no appropriation on  the side of the players. According to Janet Murray   1997 , one of the features that help defining the  MUD culture is precisely the capacity of dealing  with transforming environments, even if it is not  a material transformation. The author  1997, p.  145  relates a story where a student, tired of slay- ing dragons, simply began to host parties. The   additional players would bring food and drinks,  and role-play their characters, conferring them a  personality. In World of Warcraft, such appropria- tions do exist: servers are separated by categories,  and there are those in which role-playing not only  is possible, but also endorsed.  This behavior apparently provides an exten- sion  to  the  sense  of  agency,  since  interaction  between players may create a variable amount  of narratives. However, following the same logic  portrayed previously, non-projected system ac- tions are impossible to perform. Combat between  members of the same faction, for instance, may  only be performed in special circumstances, what  limits the possibility of story creation.  However, we may realize the illusory agency  works on distinct ways – and that, as explained  by Murray  1997 , such appropriations actually  give the players the possibility of experiencing  new  situations,  enhancing  the  agential  forms,  setting them free, until they find out another at- tempt of suppression by the system. We should  acknowledge that unlike the sense of consequence  that keeps us from doing whatever we want in  the  offline  world;  in  a  MMORPG  the  internal  laws of the system limit behaviors severely. On  a daily basis, theoretically, at least, nothing keeps  us from doing whatever we want to, but to each  action, there are consequences that must be dealt  with. Although the idea that every action leads to  a consequence is also true in a MMORPG, some  actions simply cannot be performed by the way  the internal rules work. Once more, the decisions  of game design frame the way the players may act. We may, then, refer to agency as a relative pro- cess that could be split into two different branches,  both of them answering to the structure chosen to  represent the above-mentioned aspects of games in  MMORPGs. Our intention is to particularly posit  this division into two micro-processes, subscribed  to the notion of agency, where the  1  first will take  action concerning specifically rules, and the  2   second will be interested in the action concerning  the narrative factor of the MMORPG. From this   197   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  focuses on the progression of a series of stories  that takes the player, according to his level, to the  end of the game – it tells the story in a slightly  chronological way, since the player may ignore  one or entire sequences of quests.  Such stories may involve chores a player would  provide to a community, like the quest “Are we  there, Yeti?”, in which the player should use a toy  to scare non-player characters  NPCs  at the town  of Everlook, in the zone known as Winterspring;  or may be part of complex sequences known as  chains, that usually represent significant events to  the fictional world of Azeroth. As a fine example,  we have the chain “Veteran of the Wrathgate” that  portrays an important point on the recent story of  the MMORPG.  The second way diegetic agency may be found  in  World  of  Warcraft  regards   b   strategies  of  role-playing:  ways  players,  after  creating  their  characters, may confer personalities and live their  own stories which may or may not be connected  to authorial narrative as built up by the producer  of the MMORPG. It should be pointed out that  role-playing is considered more a strategy of ap- propriation than properly a practice inherent to the  environment. According to MacCallum-Stewart  and  Parsler   2009 ,  a  player  that  consciously  role-plays in WoW seeks to create a character that  transcends the game mechanics, and therefore,  produces a plausible, self-defined reality.  This is not to say that the player lives their char- acter’s life  though some do , but rather that they  direct that character’s actions, not as a player  controlling  a  game  avatar,  but  rather  like  an  author, scripting their protagonist  MacCallum- Stewart and Parsler, 2009, p. 226 .  This precise sub-category of the micro-process  of fictional agency is of great concern for this  paper: does the actual idea of dealing with the  limitation of actions influenced by the narrative  aspect of the world and supported by the discus- sion on illusory agency limit the behavioral pos-  point forth, applying this division, we will address  these micro-processes as  1  operational agency  and  2  diegetic agency, respectively.  In the first of the micro-processes, we deal with   1  operational agency, that concerns specifically  the issues related to the rules of a game. Using  this concept, it is expected that we analyze purely  the  gameplay.  Operational  agency  consists  of  the feeling of accomplishment the player experi- ences when interacting through interfaces, with  the game, returning a direct answer on the digital  environment. Regarding WoW and the structure  of  progression   Juul,  2005   through  which  the  game design frames human behavior, this sense of  operational agency would evolve in a progressive  way, according to the levels a character acquires  – a level 70 character has way more possibilities  of action concerning its interface than a level 7  character, for instance. In order to illustrate with  a game subscribed to the structure of emergence   Juul, 2005 , in which the rules are completely  stated the moment the player engages the activ- ity, consider Tetris  Alexei Pajitnov, 1984 : the  pressing of a button just to make the falling pieces  rotates is a case of operational agency.  In  the  second  case,  regarding   2   diegetic  agency, we will consider specifically the actions a  player may perform concerning the advancement  of  the  narrative  aspects  involved  in  the  game.  We may realize that it is impossible to discuss  diegetic  agency  without  mentioning  interface  operation mechanism – which takes us to Juul’s   2005  questioning about the phenomenological  superiority  of  the  technical-systematic  aspects  of the rules.  Concerning World of Warcraft, diegetic agency  may work on two different ways: the first  a  re- gards the way the player levels, making choices  and completing quests – which, we may argue,  although deeply connected to the rules system, also  have a strong narrative background that explains to  the player the idea of travelling to another city to  deliver a letter, or slaying a thousand mobs so you  can find one single object; this quality of agency   198   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  sibilities in an environment like an MMORPG  by creating scripts? We seek to argue about this  possibility by establishing an articulation between  Dramaturgical Sociology and the theoretical body  previously discussed in this piece.  ON HOW THE WORLD  OF  WARCRAFT  MAY BE A THEATRE  The effort to compare the aspects of social re- ality  as  experienced  and  the  dramatic  theater  construction, presents itself as a fruitful area for  scientific  research.  Erving  Goffman,  Canadian  sociologist who lived in the United States in the  1950s, by publishing the book The Presentation  of  Self  in  Everyday  Life,  coined  the  term  and  defined boundaries for what is now referred to  as the Dramaturgical Theory  or Dramaturgical  Sociology  - having been inspired, by the work  of literary theorist Kenneth Burke, who in 1945  proposed  a  theoretical apparatus referred to  as  ‘Dramatism’:  a  method  for  understanding  the  social uses of language.  The sociological apparatus proposed by Goff- man  1959  had the intention to understand the  way in which the micro-social relations occur,  which, for the sociologist, can be understood as  performances on a big stage - hence the impor- tance of that famous Shakespearean quote that  illustrates the Globe Theater in London: “Totus  Mundus  Agit  Histrionem”   All  the  World  is  a  Stage , which turned into a premise of dramatic  sociology: “All the world is not, of course, a stage,  but the crucial ways in which it isn’t are not easy  to specify”  GOFFMAN, 1959, p. 72 .  The central idea of the most important work  of Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Every- day Life, that gives a basis to the dramaturgical  sociology is that social reality, formed from the  interaction process, can be explained if directly  confronted with the specific relativity concerning  the  way  the  representations  of  tragedies  occur  “In a play, actors try to convey to an audience a   particular impression of the world around them.  Through the use of scripted dialogue, gestures,  props, costumes, and so on, actors create a new  reality for the audience to consider”  Kivisto and  Pittman, 2007, p. 272 .  However, even if we consider the contribution  of Goffman  1959  for the field of sociology and  communication studies, it is important to empha- size that the Canadian was not the only one to make  a direct comparison between human behavior and  dramatic structures. Brenda Laurel  1993 , in her  book Computers as Theatre, takes a step forward,  not speaking about relationships face to face that  Goffman speaks, but trying to encapsulate the full  range of computer mediated interaction.  Published in 1993, and under the need of a  theoretical update*, given the transformation of  social contexts – and especially the use of computer  and telecommunication technologies as vectors  of  mediated  interaction  –  the  author  offers  an  important contribution to this work by doing this  structural analysis of mediated interaction and by  using the Aristotelian dramatic categories. The  category of Enactment offers us a wide viewing  angle, especially for the differentiation made by  the  author   Laurel,  1993,  p.  50   in  the  drama,  spectacle is all that is seen - but in activity between  man and computer, it becomes simply the sensory  dimensions of the action being represented: visual,  auditory  and  kinesthetic. The  definition  of  the  category, to the author, goes perfectly with the  argument assumed in this work: “Aristotle defined  the enactment in terms of audience rather than the  actors”  1993, p. 51 .  It is important to realize that, for the Canadian  sociologist, the reality and the very notion of self  are also defined in terms of audience: Goffman   1959  believes that a subject and his situational  context could not be defined individually, or in a  unitary way, but instead, according to everything  – all of the intertexts and symbolic representations  – inherent to his surroundings.  199   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  tion which a message should be understood, the  concept is reworked by Goffman  1974  in a way  that a frame provides not only as a message to be  understood - but what kind of messages can be ex- pected in an interaction: structures of expectations  are formed, for the Canadian sociologist  Goff- man, 1974 , on whatever face to face interaction  by introducing frames that organize the speech  and guide the interaction situation.  In an implementation in the field of game stud- ies, Goffman’s sociology was used by Klastrup   2003  to explain how the frames of representation  in virtual worlds occur. For the Danish scholar,  whenever we enter a virtual world, we take the  role of actors, ready to work in a representation of  ourselves that may be more or less according to our  personality offline. This proposition is similar to  what Goffman  1959  believes: we can consider,  making the seemingly simple relationship between  the Canadian sociologist and Danish researcher,  that to enter into a virtual world can be considered  simply entering a new social context - where we  can be caught up by living with new audiences,  we have the ability to develop new characters and  build new representations.  The elements of rhetoric associated with the  medieval fantasy genre, however, act as symbolic  delimiters  of  the  social  context  when  a  player  enters in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Thus,  when entering the world, the player, through the  social framing structure as suggested by Bateson   1972 , regarding the reception of messages and  metacommunication;  and  by  Goffman   1974 ,  in  the  creation  of  expectation  cascades,  both  purely communicative  which may flow from the  game or the players, the object or activity  and  social - adjusts to the social reality experienced,  knowing that such representations may be - or not  - engendered. “We perform differently, also in a  virtual world, depending on the specific cultural  and social setting that we find ourselves situated  in”  Klastrup, 2003, p 196 .  We, therefore, believe that such fictional ele- ments of WoW’s structure - which, according to   This self itself does not derive from its possessor,  but from the whole scene of his action . . . this  self is a product of a scene that comes off, and  not a cause of it. The self, then, as a performed  character, is not an organic thing that has specific  location . . . [the individual and his body] merely  provide the peg on which something of collabora- tive manufacture will be hung for a time. And the  means for producing and maintaining selves do not  reside inside the peg  GOFFMAN, 1959, p. 252 .  Then given the importance of interaction and  social environment in training both the behavior  and the very essence of the subject - and with  reservation we can speak of such things - the en- vironment in which the interaction occurs, then,  and where the social context is build, it is always  an extremely important variable in this study. It  is necessary to mention that although Goffman’s  most representative work is The Presentation of  Self in Everyday Life, the key concept used to  investigate virtual worlds - the script one - was  coined in his Frame Analysis  1974 .  To finally demonstrate, with a quite fruitful  example, how the fictional agency occur in the  interaction between players, we should focus on  the  concept  of  script,  to  see  how  this  happens  and  how  it  interacts  with  the  elements  of  rhe- torical fantasy and, therefore, suggests behaviors.  Schechner  1988  believes that the scripts actually  not necessarily imply exact actions - better than  that, they suggest only codes of conduct - types  of actions that should be used. Scripts are nothing  more than “basic code of an event” - they consist  of statements of actions: to act, when to act, how  to act, to perform rituals in a certain event; a wed- ding, for instance.  Besides the concept of scripts - pre-determined  sequences of actions that define a situation well  known to the speaker, and can be grouped in a  schemata - Frame Analysis  Goffman, 1974  of- fers the very concept of frame; previously used by  Bateson  1972  to explain the ways of negotiation  that the subjects can arrange the level of abstrac-  200   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  Krzywinska  2009, p. 124  combine elements of  a classical mythology plot, fruits of recent hybrid- ization between the classical forms of myth and  the rhetorical structures of fantasy and derivative  forms of popular culture and video games – work  to strongly influence the social context, thus limit- ing the number of actions that can be developed  by a character when interpreting the role chosen  for this.  We should realize, however, that the informa- tion encapsulated by the game’s fictional discourse  are not few - they permeate various cultural mo- ments  and  dialogue  with  various  subcultures:  the  race  of  gnomes,  for  example,  is  given  to  experimenting with technology, approaching the  ideals of steampunk fiction; while the race of the  draenei, given its origin and arrival in the world  of Azeroth  in case of the fall of its space cruiser  - Exodar  interacts very strongly with aspects of  science fiction. That many elements gives vent  to  numerous  forms  of  ownership  and  fictional  agency, when the players dialogue.  ON PERFORMING AND  SATISFYING EXPECTATIONS  Practices of role-play like those referenced above  happen when the players choose to concentrate  in the creation of a personality to a chosen char- acter – and when they perform the actions of the  character  as  if  they  were  their  own.  However,  World of Warcraft’s game design restricts a great  number of possibilities of creation of a personality  by the time of the character’s choice. As pointed  out by MacCallum-Stewart and Parsler  2009 ,  the  limitations  of  the  avatar’s  customization  frustrate several role-play expectations. That also  happens because each one of the selectable races  is portrayed in a sexy way, with large muscles,  hips and breasts, among other features.  The main argument concerning the issue of  role-playing in online environments concerns the  fact that the agonistic aspects of the game are way   too evident to be ignored – and the traditional pen- and-paper RPG is experienced in a different man- ner. Most of the players, according to MacCallum  e Parsler  2009, p. 227 , are interested in leveling  their characters, and to role-play does not help  this aspect, instead, it slows progression down.  The  only  facet  of  core  gameplay  in  World  of  Warcraft likely to be affected by role-play is the  building of interpersonal relationships, which can  in turn lead to more productive gameplay. How- ever, these relationships can be built up equally  well without the need to role-play  MacCallum  and Parsler, 2009, p. 227 .  Our aim here is not, however, ‘what motivates  the act of role-playing’, but to focus on an a pos- teriori effect: once such nature of performance  is set in motion, what kind of behavior will the  player develop? The example brought into light  to illustrate such argument happened at the Lothar  server, in the Chinese version of WoW. Ironforge,  home  of  the  dwarves  was  being  invaded  by  a  massive group of members of the opposite fac- tion, the Horde, and both players and NPCs from  the Alliance were already defeated, exposing the  lone sovereign Magni Bronzebeard. Standing by  the side of the king, Plapla  Figure 1 , a paladin  character, confronted alone the whole raid group  approaching  the  king. We  need  to  step  back  a  moment and pay attention to the player’s inten- tions, here: he or she could simply run from the  city or exit the game for a moment, for as soon  as the king died, Ironforge would be left alone.  Instead, Plapla drew her sword and shield and  used the chat system to threat the enemy arm.  She, then, yelled “thou shall not be passed” and  the battle took place.  Despite the obvious syntax error, Plapla’s ut- terance  which should have been Thou shall not  pass  may have been based on pure chance – a  simple coincidence – but it could have been in- terpreted as referencing one of the more important  works concerning the relationship between mass   201   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  Figure 1. Plapla and Magni Bronzebeard against the Horde  media and medieval fantasy, genre which WoW  draw its essence from. Thou shall not pass† is a  famous phrase used by Gandalf in his struggle  against the balrog of Morgoth, at the bridge of  Khazad Dûn – in the first of the movie adaptations  of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, entitled The  Fellowship of the Ring  2001 , for the cinema.  We should state that the behavior portrayed  by the player controlling the character is part of  an archetype that echoes through the rhetoric of  fantasy, and alludes to outnumbered and decadent  heroes – the Rohirrim in their struggle at Helm’s  Deep,  or  Gondor’s  decadence  at  the  Pelennor  Fields – who sacrificed for a greater cause, on a  further reference to Tolkien’s work  1954 .  We should realize that according to the theoreti- cal background previously discussed in this paper,  Plapla’s  behavior is originated in the narrative  features  of  the  MMORPG. A  quick  evaluation  of the situation would show that on a matter of  gameplay, there was not much to be done, since  no personal gameplay technique would change  the outcome of the circumstances – summarizing,  there was no way Plapla could appeal to the rules  to help, the situation was set. Such narrative char- acteristics are not exclusive to the MMORPG: as  we previously highlighted, its fictional structure  strongle dialogues with a number of other works  framed the same genre – medieval fantasy, in this  case – and with a whole lot of other symbolic  structures of contemporary culture.  202   Structures of Agency in Virtual Worlds  Conforming to what is expected from a player  who  engages  the  practice  of  role-playing,  the  actions of a character are led through the same  direction the rhetoric of fantasy seems to guide:  the one that says it is better to die honorably in  the battle fields than run and become a coward.  Yee  2007  has discussed behavioral confirmation  – the theory suggesting that the expectations of a  perceiver may be enough to make a target behave  in a particular way. “In line with self-perception  theory, they conform to the behavior that they  believe others would expect them to have”  Yee,  2007, p.27 . Two factor, then, would act as limiters  – and upholders, at the same time – of the sense of  agency:  i  the symbols shared with the rhetoric of  fantasy – that work as scripts drawn through the  history and through a dialogue within the culture –  that would teach us, eventually, certain guidelines  on how to behave in particular situations; and  ii   the expectations – if we address role-players, of  course – of the players, of the generalized other,  in a given situational context.  FINAL THOUGHTS  Through this paper, we have discussed the notion  that the narrative may offer modes of appropriation  and fruition, concerning the MMORPG WoW, that  are not necessarily linked to the way the rules of  the game act on the player. More: we have argued  that  such  narrative  draws  borders  and  ensues  a  particular  behavior  –  or  at  least,  behavioral  expectations – that may influence, according to  the modes of gameplay  MacCallum-Stewart and  Parsler, 2009  how the player will approach the  MMOG.  We sought to emphasize through the argument  that some notions of Canadian sociologist Erving  Goffman, as well as a number of other theoreti- cal devices that are concerned with the matter of  behavioral dramaturgy may be applied to analyze  the behavior of characters and players in virtual  worlds – the narrative steps up to be an important   part of the technical and social variables involved  in this process, clearly appearing in the definition  of the situational context.  Finally, the major contribution aimed by this  paper to the field of game studies is the execution  of a critical thought related to the notion of agency   Murray,  1997;  Machado,  2007;  Krzywinska,  2009; MacCallum-Stewart and Parsler, 2007 ; we  have posited the division of the agency process into  two micro-processes, according to the structure  of understanding of video games as cybertexts,  aiming to shed some light over the associations  between the facets of games and fictional spaces.

KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS  Agency: In her book named Hamlet on the  Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace,  Janet Murray  1997  posited interactivity as the  combination of the procedural and the participa- tory properties of a system, which together would  namely  afford  the  pleasure  of  agency.  Similar,  in a way, to its socio-philosophical counterpart,  agency refers to the capacity of individuals to act  independently and to make their own free choices. Dramaturgical Sociology: Dramaturgy is a  sociological perspective stemming from symbolic  interactionism.

Case Study: The Sims®  Pascaline Lorentz  University of Strasbourg, France  ABSTRACT This chapter will present sociological analysis of the offline video game The Sims®, from the first ver- sion to the third one. The focus is on the social impacts of virtual relationships on gamers at stake in  the gameplay. With the game The Sims®, we would like to analyze the process of socialization involved  in the relationship between the gamer and his Sim. The gamer, here a teenager, has to figure out how to  behave when he is an adult with responsibilities. The primary socialization is his family, and the sec- ondary one is the avatar in the game; we will demonstrate that gamer will learn all the classical steps  of socialization that lead to become a social being and are included in the gameplay. The study of these  two times of the socialization process is relevant because they take part of the construction of the Self.  Nowadays, teenagers also become a social being and an adult through gaming at video games.  This chapter relies on a sociological doctoral research led in France, in Russia, and in United Arab  Emirates. Results of the survey tell us how most gamers of the poll use characters to experiment social  life and build identities by confronting their virtual behaviours.  INTRODUCTION  The difference between gaming and learning could  be very narrow and for a few years, serious games  have been developed and studied by researchers  because they have noticed that a video game can  teach the gamer something  Greenfield, 1994 ;   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch014  Gee, 2003  and vice versa. Simulators and simu- lation games used to be classified among what  we now call serious games. Incidentally, when  Will Wright proposed his video game, The virtual  dollhouse, which is a simulation of life, nobody  supported his idea  Ichbiah, 1998 . The point of  the game is to manage the life of a Sim, an avatar,   Copyright   2012, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.   Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  and to deal with his wishes and aspirations. The  difficulty is the independence of the Sim. This  virtual character is able to do actions on his own.  Managers thought that a video game simulating  life would not be able to entertain gamers, which  is what it was supposed to be aimed at.  However simulating life has always been the  goal of video games creators and a few years after  the first try, the American engineer, Will Wright,  achieved to convince a new manager to develop  his game. Now, The Sims® has become famous  world wide.  Howbeit, few sociologists focused on this video  game as a work field. Hence, the wish of working  on it for a doctoral research in Sociology appeared.  This chapter will present a sociological point of  view  on  virtual  worlds  about  communication  between the gamer and his avatars. Past research  focused on interactions between gamer – computer  – gamer it consists in a real relationship with its  codes and norms up to what is going on when there  is no other gamer at the end of the network. In his  book, Dubey  2001  argued that the utopia of vir- tual society would rely on the technical substitute  of social link and would be built by virtual knots.  Where lonely people, connected to each other by  a virtual network, live the main idea would be the  need  of  rethinking  social  life   Bouvier,  2005 .  Besides, Schmoll  2000  explained that virtual  worlds existed through the reality of the commune  imaginary universe created and shared by gamers.  This argument can be pursued in more details with  the example of online communities. As a matter  of fact, these communities are real thanks to the  relationships  their  members  have  created  and  maintained. Thus, we could consider that there  is no interest for studying social relationships in  a game with a gamer – computer system interac- tion.  Leaving  the  topic  of  online  communities  on one side, we shall give a different approach  to  another  aspect  of  virtual  communication.  If  it is said that communication has to be between  two different people, can we also say that there  is communication between one real person and   a virtual one? Gamers spend a huge amount of  time playing their favourite game. Is it conceiv- able that there is nothing happening during this  gaming time? All the social process involved in  this relationship takes a part in the construction  of gamers’ identity  Süss, 2006 . We may foresee  the opportunity of studying various social aspects  of virtual life. This text relies on a sociological  doctoral research led with 180 teenagers living  in  Strasbourg  in  France   “S” ,  in  Moscow  in  Russia  “M”  and in Abu Dhabi in United Arab  Emirates  “AD” . The sample is small because the  point is to study the correlation between different  variables in a homogenous population  Javeau,  1990 . There is 55% of girls and 45% of boys in  this sample. They have filled a survey composed  of 67 questions and some of the results appear in  the text below.  The point is about focusing on what the social  impacts of these virtual relationships and all the  effects of communication between the gamer and  his avatars are. We will give the same meaning  to virtual characters, avatars and Sims with no  distinction. Can we claim that these relationships  are pointless, they have no social impacts, and are  useless – and have no effects on gamers – just  because  they  take  place  between  a  real  gamer  and its virtual identity? This is precisely why we  shall analyze the gameplay of the video game The  Sims®, then explain the process of socialization  which takes place in this gameplay and we will  finally  develop  the  way  gamers  use  avatars  to  fulfil social experiences.  THE SIMS® PRESENT A  REAL VIRTUAL LIFE  In this first part, the purpose will be to expose and  underline all the social aspects and possibilities  of communication in the game The Sims®. The  player has to deal with many status bars related  to Sim’s needs such as Hunger, Energy, Social,  Comfort,  Social,  Hygiene,  Bladder  and  Room   207   Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  for the first version. If the status bar is green, the  Sim is satisfied. On the contrary, if it turns red,  the Sim will become more and more independent  and it will be harder to manage him.  Possibilities of Interaction with  the Gameplay: A Very Rich  Virtual Communication  The desire for gaining constitutes one of the main  motivations of video game players. However, The  Sims® is a no-end game rewarded by no victory  at all; the only purpose is to stay alive. But this  is  not  so  simple,  because  the  creation  and or  the maintenance of relationships will - through  meetings, exchanges, and discussions - consti- tute the principal activity of the latter, intra and  inter-family.  This section is about all the different kinds of  relationships  family, friendly, professional  the  avatar can maintain during the game. First of all,  the gamer has to create his own character then he  has to imagine his own life that is to say to buy  a house, to find a job, to meet new people and  make friends with them, improve his knowledge,  practice sport or music or paint. The avatar will  have three different centres of relationships: his  house,  his  office  and  community  places.  This  aspect is one of the most important changes in  different versions of the game. In the first one, all  the action is focused on the household. Then, in the  second, there are more possibilities to go out and  to meet new people. In the last one, relationships  are the main point and the gamer can, thanks to  his Sim, go wherever he wants to, except to the  office. It should be noted that the place granted to  the relational aspect in the three versions evolves  somewhat, while remaining essential. But the level  of difficulty can be raised up by increasing the  number of Sims living in the same house. If the  gamer chooses to get a roommate for his avatar,  he will have to handle their relationship too. After  a while, someone could move in and there would  be a household to orchestrate.  208  Practically, the rules of the game remain the  same for all versions but the easiest way to make  the Sim differs. Thus, in the first version, it is the  number of friends which determines the social  position of the Sim! Compelled to invite some- one every day to maintain these bonds, the latter  hardly has any entertainments. As the Sim does  not get older, we consider the situation wealthy  when the avatar has almost twenty friends and is  at the top of his career. In the second version, on  the other hand, prospects of promotion require  fewer friends, the wages depending first of all on  professional skills. As time is taken into account, a  delirious time trial has settled up and the gamer has  to do everything to get his avatar wealthy before  his retirement. In addition, the Sim does not have  more leisure time, because an increased attention  must be carried to the children, who also grow up.  In the last opus, the relational aspect is essential.  Less easy than in the other versions, striking up  a friendship is more difficult and above all takes  a lot of time to be solid.  The principal difference existing between the  first and second and third versions resides in the  integration  of  the  concept  of  time  and,  conse- quently, of the cycle of life: the character is born,  grows, becomes an adult, ages and dies. During  their virtual existence, Sims become parents and  are in charge of the education of their children,  whose physical and intellectual development is  taken into account by the interfaces of the game.  For example, the characters will have to teach  the baby to walk, thus contributing to his good  motor development. Although the father has the  opportunity of playing a big role in the education  of  his  children,  the  question  of  parental  leave  arises exclusively for the mother, who remains at  home to take care of the baby. It is then possible  to call upon a nurse - which is systematically a  woman, so that the mother can rest, enjoy other  occupations or go back to work.  We  can  notice  that  a  lot  of  different  ideas,  values and norms are presented in the game. The  interest of this type of game is the fact that the    Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  player  expresses  himself  but  also  the  training  and  the  incorporation  of  behaviour  relative  to  a character. As Goffman  1959  said, “life is a  theatre” where the subject plays a part. In these  video games, the people are offered a multitude of  roles which they may incarnate or not whenever  they have dangerous actions to perform  soldier,  spy… . Games consisting in simulations of life  have an enthralling interest for the young people.  The rules and the codes which reign there must  be integrated by the players to continue the game   Padilla-Walker, 2006 . When the rules approach  the rules which are applicable in the real world,  the use of these games has a considerable stake.  Values and Norms Set in the Game  Games form integral part of the culture and:  “culture arises in the form of play that it is played  from the very beginning”  Huizinga, 1955 .   This game was created by an American en- gineer so the point is to simulate American life  and values. Analyzing these values is relevant to  understand what the ideology of the game is. The  main idea of the game is relationships and their  maintenance and the point is about which actions  the gamer has to give priority to reinforce these  bounds. The game consists of standards and rules  and the interactions are framed. For example, a  Sim who meets a new Sim cannot fly into his  arms and the direct consequence of such an inap- propriate act, or sanction, is the rejection of the  Sim he has met, along with a red status bar. This  attempt at transgression of the standard implies its  assimilation by the gamer. In fact, the interactions  are coded and the gamer must understand that to  make  friends,  there  are  different  stages  which  have to be respected there. In general, he must  start talking to the Sim he has met, then after a  certain time, depending on his feelings; he can be   allowed to joke or to raise less general questions  and so on. In this example, we note that the game  follows rules which are flexible but present. At  this  point,  we  can  apply  Durkheim’s  analyses   1893  about societies and social sanctions. As he  has argued, a behaviour which is not appropriate  will be sanctioned in a social way.  Indeed, this game is controlled by standards  which will produce values. What is interesting is  precisely the fact that these modes of interaction,  as Trompenaars  1995  showed it, depend on the  cultures to which the subjects belong and conse- quently, the players will integrate the standards of  the game, which in fact was created by American  developers, who have been socialized according  to American values. To illustrate this matter, let  us take the example of the meeting between two  people  of  countries  from  southern  Europe  and  between two people from northern Europe. The  perception  of  distance  is  completely  different  because inhabitants of southern Europe definitely  have closer contacts than those living in northern  Europe as the American anthropologist Hall  1973   explained. Consequently, the players coming from  different cultures will assimilate values they are  not traditionally accustomed to.  Concerning close relationships, the game ap- pears rather avant-garde, insofar as the avatar is  free to maintain heterosexual, homosexual and or  bisexual relationships. More largely, couples can  be formed in a completely free way, without any  social, ethnic or sexual discrimination. Devoted  to the topic of sexuality in the first version of the  game, Consalvo’s study observes that:  “it allows players the chance to create worlds  of their own choosing—worlds that can include  “Sim” people of varying genders, races and sexual  orientations  who  coexist  without  homophobia,  racism or sexism”  Consalvo, 2003 .  209   Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  Moreover,  the  game  allows  polygamies  or  bisexual  characters  and  single-parent  families.  Furthermore, a large scale investigation on the  public of The Sims® needs to be carried out to  determine whether for teenagers who play this  game,  this  sexual  tolerance  constitutes  an  ad- ditional factor of interest or not.  In fact, this liberal aspect of the game is a seduc- ing point for teenagers because they are more open- minded  Percheron, 1980  to new ideas and social  schemes. However the poll shows that teenagers  have a very conservative way of thinking gender  choices. For instance 78% of them give a priority  to cooking knowledge for women and 66.5% to  mechanical knowledge for men. Likewise, only  24.6%  of  them  choose  to  adopt  children  and  among them 3.3% say that they choose adoption  because the couple is composed of people from  the same sex. By the way, 62.3% are composed  of families. Further, 59% of them answer “no” to  the question: “Do you make different generations  of your Sim live together?”, although it could be  a very helpful strategy. Albeit young people are  quite liberal for political ideas and the gameplay  is really rather open-minded as far as their way of  gaming is concerned, they are very conservative  for their way of gaming.  The main idea of the game is that money helps  you to get a better life. The consumerist ideology  of the game has often been criticized  Flanagan,  2003; Pearce, 2006  but the point is to simulate  life. Of course, a kind of parody of life can be  perceived   Frasca,  2001   but  teenagers  do  not  feel it. They say:  “it is like real life”  Girl, 13, M , “it is everyday  life but virtual”  Boy, 14, M , “it is better than  real life because I can do everything I want to”   Girl, 13, AD ; “the game helps us for our future  life”  Boy, 13, AD .   For teenagers, the game is simply a simulation   of real life and they consider it that way.  Meritocracy is completely part of the game and  is an underlying ideology. If the Sim does every- thing he can, like working hard, being friendly,  buying  good  quality  items,  cooking  well  and  resting enough, he will become wealthy as well  as happy. Teenagers are not so credulous because  they realize important matters:  “I can notice the difficulty of being an adult and  the simplicity of being a kid”  Boy, 14, AD .  Gamers can use cheating codes that 9.5% of  them employ, to get money with any efforts. They  understand that codes change the gaming activity:  “Life is difficult without cheating codes”  Boy,  15, AD .   So, as a whole, the game promotes capitalistic   and meritocratic values.  After analyzing values and norms set in the  game, we shall wonder if there can be socialization  through gaming at The Sims® or how a gamer can  be socialized through gaming.  A REAL SOCIALIZATION  THROUGH A VIRTUAL WORLD  We are now going to use theoretical paradigms  about socialization. The goal is to demonstrate  that there could be a virtual socialization through  video gaming.  When Caillois studied games in 1958, he was  far from suspecting that one of its concepts was  perfectly adapted to the gamers of The Sims®.  Indeed, the mimicry category of games suits well  to this video game and he explained:  210   Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  “any  game  supposes  temporary  acceptance,  if  not of an illusion  even though this word means  enter in the game: in-lusio , at least of a closed,  conventional universe and, with certain regards,  fiction.”  Caillois, 1958 .  The goal of this type of game is to interpret  a character and to take pleasure in doing it. The  main point for us is the observation it makes on  the actor-player. He says:  “as it is about a play, it is not primarily question  of misleading the spectator. The child who plays  train can refuse to be kissed by his father by saying  to him that the engines are not kissed, it does not  mean that he really believe he is a true engine.”   Caillois, 1958 .   Thereby, we shall focus on the process hap-  pening during the game.  Implication of the Gamer  in Playing Practice  The virtual body resulting from the virtual reality  has singular characteristics and a main aim which  is to answer the greatest possible realism. In fact,  the virtuality of this body does not spare the gamer  its realistic constraints. As Milon specified:  “it [the virtual body] is different from the artificial  body to the direction where the artificial body is  a body entirely manufactured and factitious. The  virtual body is consequently  …  a not yet updated  body which potentially contains all the evolutions  of the real body”  Milon, 2006 .   Since Greenfield wrote:  Scientists agree to admit that video gaming  can  generate  gamers’  knowledge   Gee,  2003;  Shaffer, 2007 . Then, the question is more about  the gamer’s attitude, is he passive or active? If  he is only passive, he is subjected to choices he  has to do for his avatar. As well, it would be only  a reaction to a stimulus sent by the system. The  relationship between the player and his Sim would  be  reactivity  or  interactivity?  By  studying  the  relationship between the gamer and his characters  more deeply, we shall try to understand if this  relationship can be defined as interactive. Using  Weissberg’s definition  2000 , a double determi- nation of the interactive posture which is both an  auto-communication and a meta-communication  appears, he separates these two aspects because  for him auto-communication is made up of ac- counts and the meta-communication places the  communicating person in the centre of the com- munication process production. Thus on the one  hand, the player will be rocked by the gameplay  and on the other he will act on it to modify it and  adapt it to its will. Weissberg even says that:  “the program works like a simulator of role com- posing”  Weissberg, 2000 .   So, we can note that the player does not confine  himself to reacting, answering the stimulus of the  gaming software. In the meta-communication, he  is the creator of the dialogue and he intervenes.  The player of video games is not passive; he does  not undergo his activity. On the contrary, he is an  actor who will direct his practice according to his  choices. As Sid Meier said:  “the play is a succession of interesting decisions”   Meier, 2004 .   “I claim that these games  video games  exert a  cognitive influence with large scales, they allow  a social diffusion of processes of perception and  knowledge, which without being unknown in our  civilization, were never popularized at this point”   Greenfield, 1994 .   He has a margin of freedom and uses it to be  able to act on the game. In research on video games,  the modding studies the way the gamers create  new forms of games inside the gameplay. With  regard to the game The Sims®, Tanja Sihvonen   2009 , a Finnish doctor in media sciences, has led   211   Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  her work about modding, which analyzes all the  games the gamers have created inside the game.  This attitude shows that the player’s reactivity  dominates his activity. According to it, reactivity  and activity are different considering the origin  of the action, i.e. in the case of reactivity it is  not the player who is the cause of it, and he only  answers to it. The gamers of The Sims® are able  to create games in their play and they intervene  by  meta-communication  to  influence  the  play  activity.  Moreover,  the  game  studied  here  is  a  simulation of life and the protagonists’ actions  have consequences the gamers take into account  when  they  make  their  choices.  In  fact,  in  the  study, we noted that the children will tend to test  behaviours in the game to see what occurs before  adopting them in real life:  “to see what really occurs”  Boy, 13, S  and “to  make them do silly things in The Sims to avoid  them in true life”  Boy, 14, M .   Thus, we can see that the children who play are  aware of the consequences of their actions because  they  test  them  in  the  game  before  doing  them  for real. This is closely akin to the idea that they  need to give meaning to their practice  Tisseron,  2006 . So, we can maintain that the relationship  between the gamer and his Sim is interactive and  we suppose that social mechanisms can happen  through it.  Socialization is the social process which makes  a subject become a social being. Indeed, as of  childhood, the new born evolves in a particular  social  context.  He  learns  how  to  behave  and  answer people’s expectations. This process will  last throughout life and comprises various stages:  primary  socialization  in  the  family,  secondary  socialization at work. We are particularly inter- ested in the question of knowing if a process of  socialization between a subject and an avatar, that  is to say a virtual character, exists. The gamers of  The Sims® must orchestrate the life of a virtual  character.  Many  constraints  frame  the  playing  practice and the player must respect them. Whereas   212  the studied players are involved into a construction  of an identity, why makes them incarnate such or  such role in the play?  The socialization can be virtual because of all  the choices the gamers have to make during their  game. Actually, in The Sims®, gamers build lives  for their avatars and embodiment is really intense  due to these responsibilities.  Elements Learned through Gaming  Recently, the study about avatars by the Norwe- gian researcher Rune Klevjer  2006  explained  why it is not because the events are imaginary  or unreal that the objective facts, generated by  standards and rules, do not have a certain reality.  Before him, Kendall Walton’s work  1990  took  up the idea that representations are fictions but it  does not mean that they are not true. This leads  us to think that this virtual interaction has real  consequences, which can generate socialization. The game enables gamers to integrate a lot of  different social competencies and the appropriate  way to behave. As the gamer orchestrates a Sim’s  life from birth to death, a girl claims she learned:  “how to take care of a family, to manage money,  to live alone”  Girl, 12, AD .   When the Sim is a baby, the gamer has to take  care of him continuously, namely to feed him, to  change him, to wash him, to entertain him, to have  him rest and so on. All these activities, though  very basic, are understood and assimilated by the  gamers. As a boy says:  “I learn how to take care of the baby, it’s difficult”   Boy, 12, AD .   At primary school, the Sim has homework to  do every day, which takes a lot of time. At the  same time, the Sim will try to strike up relation- ships with his schoolmates. His parents will scold  them for acting foolishly. The interesting point  is the evolution of the baby Sim, because every    Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  action he has done, viz. every choice the gamer  has done for him, are taken into consideration  and all these choices influence the future temper  and knowledge of the baby Sim. Hence gamers  realize that they should take care of Sims babies  because of the future.  Then the teenager Sim enters secondary school  and can work part-time to earn some pocket money.  From this moment on, the Sim will discover love  relationships, family constraints, difficulties of  adult life. If the gamer chooses a job for his teenager  Sim, he quickly realizes that there is not so much  free time left. As we have said, relationships are  at the heart of the game and opus after opus it is  more and more difficult to manage them while  being  over-booked  by  various  activities.  Our  gamers are teenagers, they look for learning how  sociability works  Danic, 2006 , how relationships  can be maintained, how seduction has an impact  on someone else. They say:  “I learn how friendship is stricken up”  Boy, 14,  AD , “I learn to organize my schedule”  Boy, 13,  M , “I learn to build relationships and to maintain  them”  Girl, 13, AD .  After all this education time, the Sim grows  up and becomes an adult. The game will provide  him with a professional life and does not let the  gamer  watch  what  happens  at  work  but  in  the  last opus, the gamer can choose between “Hard- work”, “Meeting colleagues”, “Helping the boss”,  “Nothing unusual”, “Try something new”, etc. for  his Sim’s attitude. Choosing a state of mind is not  neutral, because professional life is part of sec- ondary socialization and identity is developed at  work  Dubar, 1992 . Power, ambition, hierarchical  relationships, team spirit, strategy are all at stake  in professional life. The teenagers reproach the  game for not letting them orchestrate their Sims  at school and at work. They want to manage their  Sims’ actions everywhere and continuously. This  reproach shows the intellectual embodiment of  the gamers.  All these aspects seem very basic but there  are not because they are at the root of rules in  modern societies. To this end, we have to learn  how to behave, what we can say, what we can do  and especially the limits of our freedom. Through  gaming The Sims®, teenagers really become aware  of all these phenomenons. They finally consider  that they take part in an entire world which is  ruled, even better that they should consider their  actions plus their consequences before deciding  and acting. This point matters to understand the  construction of a social being because the effects  on teenagers’ behaviours are the first aspect. Af- terwards, teenagers will think about themselves  and try to consider who they want to be and how  they can become who they want to be.  CHOOSE YOUR VIRTUAL  IDENTITY AND ACTION!  Then the gamer has to choose between two dif- ferent  approaches  of  his  avatar  identity  before  embodying his Sim. Video games captivate the  young people and they are devoted to it without  limits, they represent a kind of “numerical mod- elling clay”  Tisseron, 2006  and the difference  with the plays of yesteryear is not so big:  “the offline player does nothing else but engage  in a high-tech version of the traditional plays of  childhood”  Tisseron, 2006 .   Just as a child used to do with his toys, the play- ers will learn how to behave through the playing  practice. We will study these two different cases  and explain the reasons why the gamer chooses  one or another.  From Classical Virtual Identity…  The first stage of socialization by interpretation  of roles proposed by the American sociologist,  George  Herbert  Mead   1934 ,  is  the  imitation   213   Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  of “The significant other”, i.e. the mother, the  father, the teacher. In fact, according to Mead, the  children, while adopting a role they know well,  will socialize and integrate the various behaviours  that the society, in which they grow up, expects.  Thus, the young child will learn how to behave  in society because he seeks to be defined in it by  interpreting the roles of the others. As we say,  the  player  has  an  interactive  relationship  with  his Sim and we postulate that while interpreting  various roles via his characters, socialization is  in process. So do we allow us to take up Mead’s  expression  “The  significant  other”  to  say  that  this virtual other is much closer to the identity  of the player. What we want to show here is that  when the gamer and the Sim he creates are alike,  the realism of the game supports the process of  identification. In the group where players and the  characters they have created are alike, we mainly  find the youngest teenagers of the sample, that is  to say 39.5% are 12 years old and less. They are  mainly boys - 65% of them- and they regularly  play as soon as they do not have school. This group  of players will create a character which resembles  them so as to be able to test social behaviours but  also so as to learn, in a virtual way, how to react  in society. As a matter of fact, adolescents want  to know what can happen if they adopt such a  behaviour or not.  Thus it is like if the child “imitated”, accord- ing to the meaning of Tarde  1890 , of the social  behaviours but there in a virtual way. Due to the  very simple idea of the gameplay, everyone can  play at The Sims® even if they have never played  video game before  Griebel, 2006 . The reason is  that a gamer’s first reflex is to create a Sim who  resembles him and to orchestrate his life accord- ing to his own wishes.  Notwithstanding, this is a game and players  understand  easily  and  quickly  which  action  is  allowed  and  which  is  not.  For  instance,  if  the  goal is to make the biggest number of friends, the  gamer had better not try to insult another Sim or  hit him. The consequences of his actions are easily   214  understandable and the gamer, here a teenager,  will integrate these social rules implicitly.  Nevertheless, after practising with a virtual self  who resembles him for a while, the gamer will  choose to create an avatar, which is very different  from him, the dreamed self.  …to Non-Common One!  After experiencing a virtual self who is very like  him, the gamer, getting older, will try a virtual  identity which is very different from his own. On  account of the fact that:  “a game is a universe in which a player must  unroll a particular story in a whole of possible”   Natkin, 2004 .  The  gamer  of  The  Sims®  can  overstep  the  limit of his imagination and to this end play with  a very original Sim. Indeed, the game is so full of  possibilities that teenagers will be able to enjoy  themselves  to  the  full.  Thus,  by  getting  older,  children move to another stage of socialization by  interpretation of “The generalized other”  Mead,  1934  to characterize fictional figures created by  the child who will invent a role. Sometimes the  gamer gives up fictional characters, and sometimes  he invents a role. However, Mead insisted on the  normalized and regulated aspect of this phase of  the game. Indeed, the child becomes aware of the  fact that he takes part in a ruled society. The child  goes further to search for his own identity by con- fronting it with the others. In this group, girls are  in the majority  56% , the average age is 13 years  old and the players use version number 2 as much  as version number 3. This element translates the  gamers’ will to use the most possibilities the game  offers, point of the last version  namely the third .  With this stage, we notice that the teenager seeks  to transgress these rules, by creating an atypical  character, in order to have fun:   Is there a Virtual Socialization by Acting Virtual Identities?  “it is funny, they are different from others”  Boy,  13, AD , “to have fun especially what I cannot do  with myself”  Boy, 14, AD , “because you don’t  often see original people in real life so it is funny  to see what an original Sim can do”  Girl, 14, M .   The players, here adolescents, continue their  training  of  life  in  society  and  thus  socialize  gradually  themselves  by  incarnating  various  roles. Initially they seek to define their identity  with respect to themselves then they will seek  their identity by confrontation with the glance of  the others. The virtual Sim enables them to carry  out experiments which they could not try in real  life. They are perfectly aware of the limits of their  actions in life and clearly state it:  “to test things which we can’t in real life”  Boy,  12,  S ,  “we  can  do  what  we  want  like  killing  parents so that the teenagers are quiet”  Girl, 14,  AD , “to make silly things without being scolded”   Girl, 13, S .   As Pierre Bruno explains:  “the playing element in the game of simulation is  the knowledge to acquire”  Bruno, 1992 ,  and it is this very particular aspect of the game  The Sims® which appeals to so many teenagers.  This process of acquisition of social competences  shows that the player, while being embodied in  his practice, approaches the game in a cognitive  way and integrates norms and rules explicitly and  implicitly. Thus, as the gamer builds his identity  socially via the playing practice, we observe that  the interactivity, which characterizes the relation- ship between the player and the characters, could  take the shape of an interaction, although virtual.  All these identity paradigms have a very significant  role in the gamer’s real life.  CONCLUSION  According to all of these facts and theories, we  have to admit that the virtual relationship between  the gamer and his avatars has a real role, social  effects  and  behavioural  consequences.  Even  if  this social process seems to be virtual for the most  refractory people, we can say that there is at least  a “Sim socialization”. First results of the survey  tell us that most polled gamers agreed to confess  that they learn something when they play. Some  of them even say they feel “more prepared for  real life”  Boy, 12, S  after all. In fact, all these  identity paradigms have a very important role in  the gamer’s real life.  In addition, I wish to underline that this game  is very appreciated by girl gamers, which distin- guishes it from the video game field. In an article  in  a  French  journal   Lorentz,  2011 ,  I  analyze  this process and the reason why this game is the  first one that girls have massively adopted. At  the end of this analysis, it is possible to affirm  that the video game The Sims®, which was not  specifically created for girls, has certain particular  characteristics: not only does it hold the public’s  attention, but it also appeals to it, because of the  presence of gendered stereotypes integrated as of  childhood, singularly by the means of toys. This  point is also relevant because the construction of  gender is a part of an identity paradigm and youth  is the decisive time of life for it.  REFERENCES  Bouvier, P.  2005 . Le lien social.

We are  concerned with developing virtual environments capable of providing, in a world full of challenges,  more than adventures and excitement meant to push the narrative forward. In the search for recovering  classical concepts and integrating them into the metaverse we also seek their episteme so that experi- ence construction can be contemplated by means of lateral thinking, that is “thinking about thinking”  in a way similar to the Greek concept of mathema. Can we develop creative thinking? What is the role  of games? Which characteristics of games can open up paths to creative thinking? The classical culture  and the classical puzzles can give us an opportunity to answer these questions.  INTRODUCTION  Since ancient times, puzzles have been used by  people to reconstruct knowledge for new genera- tions. In other words, the knowledge developed  and  accumulated  throughout  generations  has  been transmitted to new generations by means  of thought-provoking puzzles, which have been  making possible the reconstruction of past knowl- edge. Creative thinking and some abilities such as   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch015  imagination and abstraction have been associated  to the process of reconstructing the knowledge  developed by our ancestors.  The “living world” – lebenswelt– also encom- passes what is known as metaverse and therefore  this dimension of our experience is in constant  metamorphosis. We can try a ride in a new world  or we can even take advantage of this experience  in  the  metaverses  to  create  relevant  cognitive  structures, venturing ourselves beyond the mere   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

In the following parts of this article, we are go- ing to resort to two examples of games to consider  the world of metaverses. One of them - Myst Uru- live - opens up ways for the collective construction  of knowledge and the other, the academic game  Ilha Cabu, poses a paradigm of transposition of  puzzles into metaverses. These two examples will  help  us  grasp  the  epistemological  possibilities  displayed by puzzles as a means for broadening  horizons and enabling several forms of thinking   lateral thinking  in metaverses.  An Ontological Issue: The  Creative Thinking and Puzzles  as a Discovery Game  Considered as the basis of the Western World,  Greek culture is the birth place of the promethean  perspective centered in the production and  the  transformation of knowledge, which in our times  can be interpreted as a continuous game of cogni- tive transformations undergone by our culture and  science. We’ve reached this state of affairs along  with  Freud   1915 ,  Lacan   1953 ,  Fink   1960   and Gadamer  1960 , due to the amplification of  the idea of the epistemophilical pulsion  Wissen- trieb , which concerns the essential structure of  the game of desire of the subject who expresses  himself in the game of language and knowledge.  It will be in the continuum of the gorge opened  by this game structure that we find the world of  games displaying genuine movements of psycho- cognitive transformations and reconstructions. It is  precisely at the interface between knowledge and  games that the open dimension of the metaverses  is found. Although the issue under discussion al- lows for multiple approaches, we will follow the  analysis of the game Myst  1993-2010 , which  is modeling and paradigmatic at the same time,   220  as has been pointed out by Murray  2003  and  Manovich  2001 . Based on the analysis of Myst  we intend to show the recovery of classical values  and, at the same time, point out the process and  the objective of the construction of knowledge. It is important to point out that thinking about  games and metaverses comprises the consideration  of the creativity involved in playing a game; that  is, in the game we are faced with the incessant  playing and endless possibilities which are as- sociated with our own actions in the living world. On considering the philosophical ideas about  games, Gadamer’s works are worth considering.  Gadamer  1999  states that the correlations be- tween the movements in games and the actions  accomplished by men in the living world make  men and games become involved in a relation- ship based on mutual complicity. It is inside the  game  that  man  fulfils  his  purposes. The  game  is supposed to be taken seriously. It is then that  game and man turn out to share the same nature  in a co-constitution process that is realized in the  game itself. This state of affairs concerns move- ments of “back and forth” which correspond to  cultural expressions such as “to play a game”.  This everyday expression reveals the gender and  the ontological structure of the game activity: the  verb “play” followed by the noun “game” takes  into account the movement which persists in the  incessant action of playing, comprising its act and  its strength, extending its semantic scope in such  a way that meaning can only be expressed in the  following way: “we play and the game plays with  us”. It is precisely then, at the moment of action  between man and game that the games’ ontologi- cal character emerges.  It is possible to say: “enter a game” or “play  a game”. What happens here is a relation, which  implies both the game and the player: a “back- and-forth” in a continuous movement. It is inside  this movement structure that the player has the  possibility to create and recreate his experiences  regarding the game. Those who play know very  well what the game is and that which is being done    The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  is ‘just a game’ but they do not know what they  ‘knows’ in this activity, as Gadamer  1999:175   shows us. This perspective prompt us to assert  that it will be in the game, in fact in any kind of  game, that reside the essential experiences which  will lead us to new discoveries.  This has to do with the fact that in the move- ment of the game we, as subjects of the game,  are capable of “living other lives”, in the same  way one who can live a life expressing himself  in fantasy, in reading, in watching a movie or in  any other kind of expression stemming from self-  transformation. It will be in the act of playing, in  the fantasies as aesthetics forms of the game, that  humanity expresses its desires, fears, fantasies and  dreams. It is in the game that the experience of past,  present and future traditions meet. As Gadamer   1999  warns us “it is the game that is played or  that unravels itself as game  sich abspielt1 . In  fact, no fixed subject is playing there. The game  is the consummation of the movement as it is.  It is in this perspective that our ontological  reflection enables us to state that we are one with  the game. Upon entering it, the player and the game  blend together inside the game itself. It will be  inside the game that both creativity and imagina- tion may grow, making it possible for the player  to  access  his  creative  and  reality-transforming  potential. On maintaining himself in the game,  the player gets hold of a space for the exploration  of experience. Thus, creativity and imagination  constitute themselves in dispositions which are  enhanced and fulfilled at the very happening of  the phenomena, culminating in the sense to be  achieved inside and by the own game. In his work  Homo Ludens, Huizinga  1938  argued that games  belong to an absolutely primary category of hu- man life, as essential as reason  Homo sapiens   and  utensil  making   Homo  faber .  The  Homo  ludens, being at the same time contiguous and  at the basis of Homo sapiens and Homo Faber  categories, stands for the basis and development  of culture, and is one of its ontological columns.  Agreeing  with  Huizinga   1990   who  states  the game is prior to culture, we observe that the  game is constituted in one of its ontic basis or,  according to Heidegger  1927  in Sein un Zeit, the  game would constitute itself in one of Dasein’s  existential ways. Supporting the same point of  view, Huizinga show us that the concept of game  presents itself as a distinguishing and fundamental  factor, being present in everything which occurs in  the human world. Huizinga  1990  states that it is  in the game and through the game that civilization  is born and develops. Being part of the culture,  the game is constituted in the striking engine of  its transformation. There is a mysterious potency,  something which defines the game and at the same  time makes it enigmatic, enchanted, encompass- ing everyone who engages in such an activity.  Huizinga also identifies it as a practical activity:  playing a game, which, when free and consciously  taken as “not serious” and exterior to daily life,  possesses the capacity to absorb game and player  in a process, which we have more recently referred  to as immersion, following Murray  2003 . It is  an activity free of all appeal, material and exterior  to the game and which has no interest apart from  the game itself. It is accomplished inside its own  space-time limitations and further limited by rules,  which are specific to the game itself.  Since the definition established by Huizinga,  the word “game” has been assigned to a multitude  of human manifestations as, for example, to any  type  of  competition,  production  of  knowledge   from enigmas to puzzles , poetry  as a “game of  words” or simply wordplay , art, craftsmanship,  philosophy and ultimately to culture as a whole.  It is based on this perspective that many scholars  after him begin to think of the man’s world as  a  continuous  and  ever-changing  game   see  for  example Fink, 1960; Gadamer, 1960 .  However, to understand the meaning of the  phrase  “not  serious”  as  assigned  to  games  by  Huizinga, we need to regard the expression from  its phenomenological point of view. It is not about  bringing out something trivial or not important. To   221   The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  the contrary, the phrase “not serious” puts the game  into  a  dimension  other  than  bureaucratic:  “not  serious” indicates that the game has a character  of immanent freedom. Huizinga states that games  in their “non-serious” character seduce and cast  us into it, making us absorbed by it both in space  and time, and freeing us from everything else.  We adhere to games spontaneously, “get inside  it” and, by means of this movement, we proceed  to a state of suspension of reality outside games.  It is in this sense that we open up possibilities to  several  forms  of  freedom  manifestations,  such  as fantasy and imagination, expressed inside the  space for playing. It is certain that when we play  it is pleasure we aim at. But, unlike many daily  activities, we do not have ways to predict or even  anticipate their appearance inside games. For us  to be able to face the effects of games, we have  to let ourselves be led inside it by the game’s own  movement, every time we re-enter it. We frequently  say:  new  game,  new  surprises.  Recalling  here  Heraclitean thought, in the same way as we never  bathe in the same waters and everything flows as  well as changes, in games, everything changes and  flows. Such a thing concerns the “back-and-forth”  movement proposed by Gadamer.  When the philosopher points out this “back- and-forth” movement he wants to draw attention to  the fact that “playing is being played”  Gadamer,  1999, p.181 . With that expression he means that  it is in the very act of being played that the game  reflects its playful behavior, and then the game  and the player become one. The player can not be  thought of as a mere participant, but as a compound  unity, being the game-player inside the creative  and particular universe of the game’s space, in  which the rules point the way to be taken and by  which it is possible to stay in the game and make  it go on. On the other hand, this game conception  shows us that the game does not sub exists in pure  dependency  of  the  player. To  the  contrary,  the  game will always be there, being the responsible  for provoking and instigating the player to persist  in it. That aspect has more recently been pointed   222  out in relation to digital games  Cf. Turkle, 1997  and Murray, 2003 . The approach presented here  shows us that we play the game and by it we are  played: “the real subject of the game […] isn’t the  player, but the game itself. It is the game which  keeps the player in the path, which draws him in  the game, and which keeps him there”  Gadamer,  1999:181 .  If we agree to a concept of game based on an  ontological condition  and  intend  it  to  be  com- pletely identified on digital games, it is imperative  to choose an exemplar model able to illustrate  our conceptual perspective. In order to do it, we  have chosen among the array of existing games,  a paradigmatic game  as Murray, Manovich and  others have pointed out  which was created in the  90’s, as a first-person game and got, in 2010, a new  version including first and third person modalities.  It is the series of games Myst  1993; 1998; 2001;  2003; 2004; 2005; 2006; 2008; 2010 . Currently  it has been transformed in a genuine metaverse.  According to many researchers, such as Trukle,  Murray, Manovich, Miles among others, Myst can  be considered, along with Doom, created in 1993  and Zork, created in1980, as a paradigm-game,  given that they not only constitute a landmark  in the history of technology and games, as well  as  they  introduce  the  fundamental  models  of  computer  narrative,  interface  and  playability  that are still largely used in the communities of  both producers and users. Notwithstanding the  numerous attributes of Myst, there is one which  is worth calling attention to: puzzles inserted in a  narrative between two worlds  the virtual nature  of the game and the real nature of the book .  By presenting puzzles as components of the  story, as portals to new worlds or yet challenges  and allegories that shed some light on the elements  of the narrative or on the story of a character,  Myst presents a crucial component, introducing  the  practical  idea  of  game   puzzle   inside  the  play   game . There  are  many  kinds  of  puzzles  in Myst, from those involving the concatenation  of behavior patterns to produce a given result to    The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  jigsaws of varying complexity. In this sense, a  jigsaw – puzzle – consists in a game in which the  player must solve a given problem and, to solve it  he has to make use of reasoning  in many different  modalities . The puzzles define a way of playing,  in which the primacy of reasoning overcomes any  other type of psycho-social-cognitive competence. David Miles  1996  defends the point of view  that Myst represents a new and compact art form,  since it gathers characteristics of different classical  origins. In Myst there is a combination of forms  and representations considered by some digital  media critics as outdated. The form of narrative in  Myst pay classical RPG games such as Zork2 and  Dungeons & Dragons3 the reverence they deserve  Furthermore, the narrative structure associated in  an innovative and tridimensional way of naviga- tion in Myst makes the player remember a syncretic  epic adventure that combines elements of Homer’s  Odyssey and Julio Verne’s science-fiction genre.  Another striking feature of Myst concerns its style.  It can be thought as a “movie” varying between  surrealism and art-nouveau whose creation was  motivated by the will of improving puzzle reso- lution. In 1996, as Heim made prophecies about  the metaverse, Miles envisioned all the potential  that a narrative associated to a game could offer  to players and to culture.  Discussing the relations between ludology and  narratology, Frasca  1999  states that a puzzle in  the ludological concept would be equivalent to a  ludus, that is to say, it would be equivalent to a  problem which needs to be overcome so that the  player can move forward in the game. Walking  around the spaces of Myst, the player is faced with  innumerable  possibilities  of  exploration.  Each  player, at his own game pace, has the possibility of  reconstructing Myst’s story in different ways and  through different paths. As a system and a game,  Myst introduces a culture and an architecture that  stems from its narrative structure. This culture is  based on one of the elements of the game nature,  which resides in its surprise element, thus build- ing the base of its mysteries. It is the puzzle that   provides the elements of connection between the  narrative,  the  local  culture  and  its  structure  of  mystery. It is by facing, uncovering and decipher- ing the puzzles in Myst that the player assimilates  more and more elements of the Myst culture and,  thus, is able to understand its story better. In his  analysis  of  Myst,  Carroll   1997   presents  us  a  surprising description of what we are capable of  developing in this mysterious world of Myst, in  which as he points out the player must turn into a  talented amateur archeologist. In order to accom- plish that the player must view every artifact and  ask, “What is that for? What does it do? Which  physical  principles  are  being  followed?  What  biological urge is being served?” Speculation is  not just encouraged; it is necessary”.  If we are convinced by the arguments given in  the preceding brief discussion of the game Myst,  we will certainly reach the conclusion that such  speculations  hypothesis  are at the basis of the  logical-mathematical thinking we inherited from  the West. It is based on the question dialectics that  explanation can be built as an answer or yet, it is  from new evidences that we are able to reconstruct  the question, given a process of reversibility and  transposition. On linking facts that are apparently  distinct we are, in other words, inferring global  hypothesis from local conclusions and these global  hypothesis are to be verified a posteriore. In here,  a  movement  can  be  detected  in  the  game  and  the space-time element in which it occurs is the  puzzle. It is in this sense that the puzzles of Myst  and the logical-mathematical thought structures  are associated. For a puzzle is an open and orga- nized logical structure which foster a reflexive  process culminating in the comprehension of a  given problem which constitutes the puzzle itself.  In a way, at the same time direct and derivate, the  way of investigation and experiencing of a puzzle  culminates in a broadening of horizons, that is to  say, it comprises a magnification of the aesthetical  experience taken in its phenomenological sense.  The continued puzzle resolution process will indi- cate, as an effect on the subject of the experiment,   223   The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  a magnification of his potential to formulate and,  consequently, solve problems. Here resides the  central nucleus of the transposition and revers- ibility issues regarding problem solution and they  require  more  complex  cognitive  constructions.  Both mathematics and logic history teach us that  sometimes we must “think in a different way” and  look for a new prism to solve a given problem.  Puzzles certainly offer a wide array of possibilities  for this kind of thinking experience.  We note that the broadening of horizons, which  is made possible by the experience with puzzles,  stimulates  acquiring  an  open  way  of  thinking  about the activity of dealing with problems of any  kind. It is then a continued process we wish to  stimulate and this process can be described as “the  game of reorganizing ideas” such as the idea of  building hypothesis or “promoting different ways  of thinking. This is what De Bono  1970  called  “lateral thinking”4. The lateral thinking approach  is promising since in real life, when we are faced  with  problems,  we  are  involved  in  an  activity  frequently more alike to that of solving a puzzle  than solving a traditional mathematical question. The ability of solving problems encompasses  a series of implicit competences in the process.  We certainly are not prone to solving a problem  we  happen  to  understand.  The  challenge  and  the  stimulus  are  to  solve  problems,  which  are  unknown to us. For Goldstein & Levin  1987 ,  problem solving is one of the ways of thinking  and it can be considered the most complex of all  intellectual functions. Solving problems is one of  the highest level cognitive processes and requires  the modulation and control of a lot of fundamental  routines or abilities  Goldstein & Levin, 1987 .  The  mankind  evolutionary  history  has  to  do  with  looking  for  challenges.  The  development  of cultures and consequently civilizations point  out to the strength and the commitment of human  thought on problem solving. The development of  abilities of observation, generalization, simulation  and abstraction are intrinsically related to problem  resolution. All of these abilities and challenges are   224  faced by the game player and among the games,  Myst, for its narrative features organized around  puzzles is exemplar.  If it is true that the structure of Myst’s design  is organized as an navigable space  Manovich,  2001 , open to the production of a more and more  mutable narrative  Murray, 2003 , it is also true that  the more we chronologically advance through the  versions of Myst  from 1993 to 2010 , the more we  tend to find both the organization and manifesta- tion of a logic of discovery  Tonéis & Petry, 2008 ,  which assumes innumerable though hard to be  parameterized proportions. Once immersed in the  game the player will be able, within his navigation  and investigation, to go deeper and get to know it  better. Consequently, he will be able to learn how  to solve problems or to learn from the game the  method to solving problems. Provided that this  is the emerging form of communication which is  experienced, our biggest challenge is overcoming  our limitations regarding the abilities to observe  and correlate pieces of information. However, this  situation implicates in the meeting of the player  and the game with its puzzles, a situation which  must be defined as an experience with the puzzle  being part of the game.  .It  is  an  experience  that  can  be  understood  as an encounter, a happenstance that moves us  and invites us to new discoveries. It underlies all  personal experience and derives from a reflexive  process. When something happens and moves us,  it causes a transformation, because the reflexive  act has a high transformative value and conse- quently influences the actions following it. This  experience in a given situation is designated by us  here as an aesthetic experience, and it constitutes  itself in an important piece of conceptual work  on phenomenology  Gadamer, 1999; Petry, 2003;  Tonéis & Petry, 2008 . In this case, the secret pas- sion between aesthetic experience and interactive  puzzle’s organization structured on principles of  mathematical logic, is one of the key elements to  problem solving.   The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  Based on the previous statements, we argue  that  a  cognitive  discovery  or  the  solution  to  a  problem which has drawn all our attention tend  to generalize its impact to other spheres of our  lives. Such a discovery certainly derives from a  reflexive experience, for in situations where we  develop a method “to get out of the problem” or  “to overcome an obstacle” as is the case in one of  the game’s puzzles being analyzed in this article.  This act turns out to be a way of acting positively  towards the construction of personalized knowl- edge, even when it is developed in a cooperative  environment. We truly believe puzzles in games  are powerful engines driving the continuity of the  narrative since the building of the narrative relies  on the player’s actions. In order to get to know  more  about  the  Myst’s  story,  for  example,  we  need to overcome the obstacles put in our way. In  fact, “these “puzzles” are similar in nature to the  tasks mythological heroes faced when pursuing  their goals and the various difficulties heroes in  fairytales face when are sent on some mission”   Berger, 2009, p.77 . When we accept the invita- tion to travel to Myst Riven, for example, no much  detail about how to complete the mission is given  to us. We find ourselves in a situation similar to  that  of  explorers players,  with  all  the  implica- tions that playing and exploring have. It is in this  sense that we interpret what Shigeru Miyamoto,  Nintendo’s main designer, said in an interview  about games. He thought of games as a trigger  for adults to go back to being primitive, primary  ways of thinking and remembering. An adult is  a child who has more ethics and morals, and that  is it. As a child, I am not creating a game. I am  in the game. The game is not for children it is for  me. It is for an adult who still has the character  of a child5.  In the interview given by Miyamoto, he refers to  one of the characteristics of the game, that of “being  for me”, which Merleau-Ponty would refer as “be  with him”. This characteristic designates the point  of encounter between the player and the game,  both of them becoming “one” and it is, as such,   fundamental to the problem solving process. Inside  the game environment it is the player who attributes  meaning to the problem, that is to say, we signify  what is real from abstractions and reflections and  it is in this movement of discovery, surprise and  encountering that we develop our mathematical- logical thinking, based on which the construction  of  inferences  and  correlations  between  objects  that are apparently unrelated is built. We enter the  game and risk ourselves in an activity by our own  choice and wish to join it. This characteristic of  the game is clarified in the following declaration  “the attraction that the game exerts over the player  resides exactly in that risk”. The game allows the  player to enjoy a freedom of choice which is, at  the same time, considered risky and hopelessly  restricted” Gadamer,  1999:181 . The “play” and  the “be played”, the double invariant determined  by the game reveals the oldest characteristic of  humankind,  the  production  of  knowledge,  the  possibility  of  learning  by  exploring  and  many  times making mistakes and looking for new ways  to improve oneself. This was probably what has  happened in the history of mankind and in the  intense exchange of information and knowledge  applications. The question isn’t “what we do” or  yet “what should we do”, but what, beyond our  wanting and doing comes upon us or happens to us  as Hegel expresses himself: when you give shape  to what is conceived and reproduced in thought,  you give shape to yourself. That statement of his  refers to the fact that when men acquires some  kind of “power’  können , he gains, by means of  this power, a self-conscience. In other words, the  human beings have a working conscience because  they are able to understand what is correct to say  and know that work gives shape to what is con  conceived and reproduced in thought  Giving shape to one’s “own self” is being aware  of one’s own self. It is also sharing experience and  accomplishing it because in that way experience  is accomplished too. In this sense the aesthetic  experience gets really close to the conception of  digital universe, as we have mentioned before in   225   The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  this article. The production of knowledge con- verges with the idea of shaping oneself. We un- derstand knowledge as result of a process, a work,  or an intellectual effort, prior to the praxis and the  technicality. This kind of knowledge, which is at  the same time specialized and ‘spatialized’, falls  between common sense and reflexive knowledge  and in spite of not being scientific, tends towards  it, because as it moves away from common sense  it starts correcting itself or even rejecting com- mon sense. In this way, we enrich common sense  with the results from science. The construction of  personal knowledge that permeates this scientific- historical knowledge, even departing from today’s  common sense is, most of the times, the result of  some past scientific investigation.  “To be a conscience, or prior, to be an experi- ence,  is  to  communicate with  the  inner  world,  with the body and with others, to be with them  rather than being beside them”  Merleau-Ponty,  2006:142 .  With  others,  in  other  words,  con- sciously knowing them, overcoming the frontiers  of what is already known, means conquering the  unknown in search of new experiences. In this  sense,  conscience  is  an  experience  undergoing  a  reflexive  process,  which  endows  us  with  re- learning traits.  A reevaluation of the knowledge assisted by  our senses and based on the association between  this and other worlds, which in former times used  to be considered prior to modeling of new con- cepts is necessary either in the context of facing  a puzzle in games or facing everyday problems.  In a process of assimilation and accommodation,  such experiences turn into conscious knowledge  for the possibility of resolution of new challenges  that may come6. When “we are”, we are open to  things, we are prone to things which might happen  to us and affect us. We, then, reach some enlighten- ing into the concept of aesthetic experience. This  experience takes place in a world, be it virtual or  real, in the solitude of a contemplative observer,  in some enthusiastic participation in a big party  and, in this way, memory, learning and conscience   226  become linked. It affects us and moves us pointing  out to the privileged moments in which the being  is open to opportunities. It indicates us that the  resulting comprehension will be operative, though  not machinic  Stein, 2003, p.45 .  In fact, we do not know the actual possibili- ties for being the learning experience creative,  for learning to experience creativity, or yet for  learning how to develop a creative and innova- tive thought. In spite of that, we can offer oppor- tunities  for  thoughtful  experiences  to  manifest  themselves in all their potentiality in situations  such as games, for example. But we know that  human  creativity  reveals  and  manifests  itself  into innovative associations and combinations of  plans, models, feelings, experiences and facts. We  believe that it is highly relevant to present oppor- tunities and encourage individuals to search for  new experiences, to test hypothesis and, mainly,  to establish new forms of dialogue. We consider  a puzzle to be a way of broadening horizons and  creating possibilities and, in this way, we are able  to build up dreams which are translated in this  willingness to imagine new worlds, to construct  inner worlds even before any kind of sensitive  impression is obtained. For the one who is open  to creative thought, the dream becomes reality at  the very moment one dreams, for it starts to be  built, incorporated into one’s activities in many  different ways.  Among  the  games  containing  puzzles  that  function as engines of a complex narrative, Myst  stands out, among other things, because it acquires  real-time multi-user characteristics on the Web,  allowing the members of the community of game  players to meet and exchange ideas, to come up  with plans together, etc. Myst is a special kind of  metaverse whose potential not only enlarges the  narrative’s horizons, but also claims for a new  approach  to  its  puzzles  from  a  psycho-social- cognitive perspective. It is in this way that the  Myst series, and more recently the Myst Uru Live  – online series – evolved as a form of metaverse  which contributes to the development of the com-   The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  munity of its players and to cyberspace explorers.  By means of the avatars, each player can take part  in the adventure in Uru live, solving the mysteries  of the D’ni civilization and playing the role of a  cyber-archaeologist. In a collaborative way, we are  guided to the interior of the metaverse and as we  face its puzzles new ways of thinking emerge, cor- roborating to the spontaneous development of each  subject and in doing so we equally contemplate  all the components of its psycho-social universe.  Whenever we withdraw from the structure of a  puzzle its logic we are moving towards successive  discoveries which will culminate in the learning  of new ways of thinking.  Davidson  2008  in his research work about  the Myst series analyzed the structure of the game  narrative in three different media: the CD-Rom, the  comic book and the book. His research, focusing  on the involvement of its players in these appar- ently divergent medias, revealed the immersive  power of the game. He also demonstrated that  the structure of the work transcended the digital  universe, highlighting another important aspect:  it is the hypertextual construction of Myst’s story,  which compelled its narrative to be communi- cated through different medias. This can be the  most remarkable change in our times: our digital  culture doesn’t follow a single media or a linear  form since it is released in multiple forms, me- dias and aesthetics. We are inter-connected; we  build hyperlinks with the intent of amplifying our  knowledge, our relations and our actions. The Uru  live metaverse offers the player the opportunity  for taking part in a story in which his presence in  the community of players is essential, not only  to getting a solution for the puzzles but also to  the building of the narrative, which, by different  medias, transforms players into more than readers  and navigators-explorers. In fact, it transforms us  into co-authors and co-actors of an open story.  The open story and the puzzles form the model- ing structure of the discovery logic developing  process in the heart of the community of players.  In it, creativity has fertile soil to thrive on.  The Ontologic Puzzles in the  Process of Knowledge Construction  We are aware that creativity can undergo great  changes as we engage into puzzle solving in this  immersive narrative media known as the meta- verse.The metaverse can be enriched by making  use of classic puzzles because they provide an  adequate environment to presenting logical prob- lems taken from the history of problems which  have troubled human thought. Such a procedure  based on Murray  2003  and Manovich  2001   involves the transformation of a problem from  mathematical-logic history into a puzzle inside a  metaverse is called transposition. Transposition  can be seen as an historical and cultural factor and  a way of providing “new links” to the development  of creative processes. In the process of building  a puzzle, taking Myst as a paradigm, transposi- tion deals with mathematical logic problems in  the  metaverse  environment.  In  the  process  of  solving a puzzle the concern is with the technical  mathematical logic language used to formulate  concepts and to  create the immersive environ- ments,  such  as  metaverses  and  games,  which  exhibit relevant cognitive abilities which can be  acted upon by game players. The formulation of  puzzles by our research team and their incorpo- ration into the metaverses and games takes into  account the process of transposition. This was the  case of the game and metaverse project entitled  Cabu Island7 which comprises a great number of  puzzle transpositions.  As in Myst, Cabu Island uses puzzles to entice  the player to develop creative ways in order to  search for solutions to the problems. Upon ar- rival on Cabu Island the player sees a huge Hanoi  Tower, built in stone and placed at the top of a  mountain. The Hanoi Tower alludes to the myth  of creation and its presence gives the player the  clue that the game is about to start.  Recalling  Miles   1996:4 ,  who  argued  that  Myst is in accordance to the fourth law of medias  proposed by Marshall Mcluhan: “the initial devel-  227   The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  opment of a new media will recover characteristics  of the previous medias.”, we might say that the  design project developed in Myst works out the  recovery of conventions and forms of literature,  cinema and graphical design, combining them in  the multimedia-hypertext-CD-ROM8 media. The  same happens in Cabu Island, a kind of academic  game, which recovers previous forms of cognitive  constructions  with  the  objective  of  giving  rise  to  new  interpretations.  Cabu  Island  introduces  logical-mathematical transpositions in the form  of puzzles. One such an example of transposition  consists of the formulation of a problem based  on a story taken from the Treatise of the Art of  Arithmetics, by Bento Fernandes9. The story is  about an apple orchard.  A gentleman has fallen for a lady and can’t have  from her his wish. The lady wants him to bring  her 9 apples from the King’s garden. Fulfilled that  condition, she shall accept him joyfully. Then the  gentleman goes to the King’s garden and there he  comes upon 3 doors, and in front of each door there  is a doorman; the first doorman tells him he can  go on, but that he has to give him half the apples  he had brought plus 2. The second doorman tells  him he can go on, but that he has to give him half  the apples that he had brought plus 3. The third  doorman also tells him he can go on but that he  has to give him half the apples he brought minus  4. I ask you: how many apples does this gentle- man needs to pick up so that, at the end, he has  exactly 9 apples, no more no less than that after  giving each doorman the number of apples which  has been asked for?  Lagarto, 2009   In order to derive a formula for calculating  the required number of apples we can rely on the  conceptual understanding of an abstract and func- tional numerical model. A function is defined by  an equation. Then, “x” can stand for the number  of apples. The most important thing is getting out  through door 1  “gate” in the case of Cabu Island    228  holding 9 apples, so that the gentleman can give  them to the lady.  Being “x” the total number of apples,  Door  gate  1: x – 0,5x – 2 = 9 → 0,5x = 11→  x = 22   {The gentleman should be carrying 22 apples   when he passes through the second door}  Door  gate  2: x – 0,5x – 3 = 22 → 0,5x = 25→   x = 50   {The gentleman should be carrying 50 apples   when he passes through the third door}  Door  gate  3: x – 0,5 x + 4 = 50 → 0,5x = 46  → x = 92   {Therefore, the gentleman will have to get 92   apples if he wants to held 9 at the end}  In  search  of  the  heuristics  for  solving  the  puzzle, we came to find different ways of think- ing, one of them being the recursive algorithm,  i.e. by means of a deductive reasoning we can  choose the opposite direction from that proposed  by the puzzle. Given that at the end nine apples  must be hold, it is by the end that we must begin.  How many apples have we got to collect? The  arrival at a port is the output of the previous one  and that characterizes what is called a recursive  algorithm, since the last gate in the entry will be,  for the sake of the exit, the first one.  The main idea in this game development is to  observe the construction of knowledge as a natural  process. The result of this process is to show the  building up of knowledge as a product of a mental  dynamics. A mythological Ent’s creature and three  guardians were used to show the transformation  of a logic problem into a game experience. The  Ent claims an apple to the player. Apples can be  found in a tree in the center of the maze. But on  the way to the apple tree, there are three guardians    The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  who also demand a certain number of apples to  the player. The player is the one who performs  the actions regarding knowledge transformation  because he needs to create a strategy to calculate  the number of apples necessary to give to each  guardian and leave one apple for the Ent. A  Analyzing the total number of apples necessary  to solve this puzzle, we can build up a relation  between the number of apples to the Ent denoted  “x” and the total number of apples to be picked  up in the Tree denoted “y”, based on the follow- ing ratio:  y = 8x + 20   If x = 1, then y =  8 * 1  + 20 = 8 + 20 = 28.  Therefore, to deliver one apple for Ent, we would  have to pick up 28 apples. The same applies to the  original problem if we want to deliver the final  nine apples to the lady, then we have to pick “y  =  8 * 9  + 20 = 92” apples.  We have considered the potential of games  for  knowledge  construction  processes.  At  the  same time, we argued that logical mathematics  is a powerful instrument for man’s cognitive de- velopment and the learning processes of making  decisions, given the fact the it provides us ways  to exercise our creativity. D’Ambrosio  2002:4   states: “mathematics provides the necessary in- struments for an evaluation of the consequences  of the chosen decisions”. The essence of ethical  behavior is a result of the knowledge of the con- sequences of the decisions we make. So we can  build up knowledge that structures itself through  reevaluations. Such an opportunity must be pres- ent at every moment of our formation. It is not  the amount of information, nor the sophistication  in Mathematics that can, alone, provide useful  knowledge, but the ability to put that knowledge  into context. With that in mind, we wish to enjoy  the potential of metaverses on the widest array  of human life.  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Thinking in a creative and innovative way, as well  as exercising the potential of solving problems in  the world we live in is an ability, which can also be  developed by using games. Traditional elements  can be incorporated into games and be associated  to enriching experiences of high playability. Ev- erything that moves us, takes our time and changes  us is capable of turning us into epistemologists,  detectives, researchers, etc. Thinking about new  ways of thinking immersed in the digital universe  and being part of an exciting story, we are much  more than characters, we are the main actors of  our own development. Lateral thinking and mental  agility are essential in a changing world.  Looking for new ways to create metaverses  which encompass a bigger number of  applica- tions aiming at building up cognitive structures  in  any  kind  of  field,  for  example  in  education  and in business, requires a deep analysis of the  theoretical pre-assumptions which support them  and a thorough research of the classical-scientific  literature. The human being is not defined solely  by work, but by game as well. Not only children,  but also adults like and need to play. That is why  we watch soccer matches, for example. We are  much more Homo ludens than Homo economicus.  We do not live solely for economic interests. In  the Homo ludens, the homo mitologicus lives on,  that is, we live in the light of myths and faith, be- ing conscious or not about it. Men are at the same  time prosaic and poetical. As Hölderling stated,  men inhabit the earth poetically, but also prosai- cally, and if prose did not exist, then men could  not enjoy poetry. Even truer today, when science  discreetly abandons certain mechanical elements  to assimilate the game between the certainty and  the uncertainty, puzzles can be used to encourage  the constant spirit of discoveries starting from the  groundings of all primordial uncertainty.  On valuing self-correction, something,which  can  be  done  in  metaverse  environments,  each  individual  becomes  capable  of  regulating  his   229   The Epistemological Character of Puzzles in the Metaverse  abilities. Enlarging his observation and analysis  capacity, the individual can improve his current  cognitive  abilities.  The  self-esteem,  resulting  from overcoming obstacles in a game, becomes  an ally in his search for possible methods to solve  problems,  since  his  aims  are  not  restricted  to  simply “getting the right answers”. By offering  an opportunity to the creation of their heuristics,  adolescents and young adults will feel more free  to  explore,  to  assume  their  errors  and  to  self- regulate, each of them operating on a certain level,  but always doing it in a significant way. Even if  logic  and  mathematics  can  look  mysterious  to  them, they will not be seen as their adversaries  anymore. The main contribution of this chapter is  not discussing the concepts and methods related  to games but something much more fundamental  which has to do with the belief that games and  metaverses, by means of the aesthetical experience  they provide, can be thought of as sophisticated  forms of human intellect which hold the legacy  of the tradition accumulated by our ancestors and  which can be projected into the digital existence  unveiled to the Dasein.

The game is published by Wizards of the  Coast. Its origins are the miniature wargames   mainly Chainmail . D&D’s publication is  considered as the origin of modern RPGs  and was published in Brazil by Grow.

According to the Oxford English diction- ary, Lateral Thinking is “…a way of think- ing which seeks the solution to intractable  problems through unorthodox methods, or  elements which would normally be ignored  by logical thinking.” Edward De Bono differ- entiates this from vertical thinking, which can  be described as traditional, logical thought;  vertical thinking looks at a reasonable view  of a problem or situation and works through  it, generally in a path of least resistance. On  the other hand, Lateral Thinking suggests that  the student or problem solver should explore  different ways of examining a challenging  task, instead of accepting what appears to  be  the  solution  with  seemingly  the  most  potential  and  going  forward.  De  Bono  is  not  opposed  to  vertical  thinking;  he  sees  Lateral Thinking as complementary  each  make the other more effective .

Section 5  Sustenance:  Virtual Health Care   234  Chapter  16  Virtual Simulations and the   Second Life Metaverse:  Paradigm Shift in Neuropsychological   Assessment  Thomas D. Parsons  University of Southern California, USA  ABSTRACT In neuropsychology’s received paradigm, the “normal science” of assessment and treatment planning  appears to be approaching a paradigm shift: first, there are the general developments in other neurosci- ences that inform the practice of neuropsychological assessment. Second, there is the shift in the purpose  of neuropsychological assessment from differential diagnosis of brain pathology to predictions about  activities of everyday functioning and treatment planning. Third, there is growing need that neuropsy- chologists update their outdated technology for ecologically valid assessments. The impending paradigm  shift may be well served to include the utility of virtual worlds for ecologically valid neuropsychological  assessments. Actualization of the potential of virtual worlds for assessment will require the following:  comparisons with well-validated neuropsychological measures, data storage, improved documentation  of specific computer hardware and software used in experimental methods, and enhanced methods and  result reporting by the researchers publishing studies on virtual worlds.  INTRODUCTION  Neuropsychological assessment represents an inte- gration of a systematized neurological assessment  of functional cortical and subcortical systems and  a precise scaling of psychometric measurement.

In addition to measures of intelligence  e.g., IQ   and achievement, the neuropsychological assess- ment is made up of a battery of tests to examines  multiple areas of functioning that also have an   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

The following represents a set of cognitive  functions that is likely to be assessed: learning  memory,  intelligence,  language,  visuopercep- tion,  and  executive-functioning.  The  historical  development of neuropsychology has resulted in  a “normal science” that is informed by develop- ments  in  psychology,  neuroscience,  neurology,  psychiatry, and computer science. Each of these  “informing disciplines” has gone through changes  that  challenge  theory  and  praxes  of  neuropsy- chological assessment. These changes are what  Kuhn  1962 1996  describes as paradigm shifts,  in which new assumptions  paradigms theories   require the reconstruction of prior assumptions  and the reevaluation of prior facts. For psychol- ogy, the paradigmatic shifts are found in the move  from mentalism  i.e., study of consciousness with  introspection  to behaviorism  Watson, 1912 , and  then cognition  Miller, 2003  as now understood  through  connectionist  frameworks   Bechtel  &  Abrahamsen, 1990 . Neurorehabilitation has un- dergone a paradigm shift as a result of influences  from basic and clinical research  Nadeau, 2002 .  For psychiatry  e.g., neuropsychopharmacology   the “paradigm shift” has been found in an under- standing of psychiatric disorders and molecular  biology  models  that  account  for  gene environ- ment development  interaction   Meyer,  1996 .  Likewise, neuroscience has seen a shift related  to the understanding of communication between  nerve cells in the brain—shift from predominant  emphasis upon electrical impulses to an enhanced  model of chemical transmission  Carlsson, 2001 .  For neurology  and a number of related branches  of neuroscience  a shift is found in new ways to  visualize the details of brain function  Raichle,  2009 . Finally, we are seeing shifts in computer  science in the areas of social computing  Wang,  2007 ,  information  systems   Merali  and  McK- elvey, 2006 , and even the video game industry   Zackariasson and Wilson, 2010 .  Developments in the area of neuropsychologi- cal assessment parallel several of Kuhn’s observa-  tions concerning the nonlinear trend of progress  in the history of science  Kuhn, 1962 1996 . For  example,  the  naive  assumption  that  traditional  neuropsychological assessment procedures would  continue to maintain prominence following the  advent of neuroimaging characterized an earlier  status quo, a period Kuhn referred to as normal  science. The  untenable  presumption  that  tradi- tional paper-and-pencil batteries  or automated  computerized versions  were generally capable of  forming accurate judgments about the everyday  functioning  i.e., ecological validity  of persons  tested on the basis of observation was another  received  belief  that  characterized  this  soon  to  be archaic era of practice. According to Kuhn,  “paradigms”  are  initially  recognized  scientific  achievements  that  for  a  period  provide  model  problems and solutions to a community of prac- titioners. For the most part neuropsychologists  are interested in “normal science” research based  upon  previous  neuroscientific  realizations  that  provide the foundations for neuropsychology’s  further practice. From a Kuhnian perspective, the  unprecedented achievements of notable neuropsy- chologists, for example Wernicke or Luria, have  provided the context for the neuropsychological  research of the next generations and their theories  are adequately open ended to allow for a variety  of  problems  to  be  explored.  For  example,  the  localization and connectionist theories begun by  Wernicke  culminated  in  Luria’s   1973   theory  of three interacting functional systems. From a  Kuhnian perspective, the attainment of a paradigm  is found in its potential for achievement in still un- finished examples and normal science consists in  the actualization of this potential. Further, normal  science is interested in answering questions and a  revolution occurs in response to a “crisis” when  theory and praxis cannot be integrated and neu- ropsychological research problems can no longer  be adequately resolved. In neuropsychology, such  a paradigm shift would result in a community of  neuropsychologists coming to view their theory  and practice quite differently.  235   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  neuropsychological  performance  beyond  what  are currently available using traditional methods.  Reliability of neuropsychological assessment and  treatment of affective and cognitive disorders can  be enhanced in virtual worlds by better control  of the perceptual environment, more consistent  stimulus presentation, and more precise and ac- curate scoring. Virtual worlds may also improve  the validity of neurocognitive measurements via  the increased quantification of discrete behavioral  responses, allowing for the identification of more  specific cognitive domains. Virtual worlds could  allow for cognition and affect to be assessed and  treated in situations that are more ecologically  valid. Participants can be evaluated in a virtual  world that simulates the real world, not a contrived  testing environment.  Virtual worlds offer the option to produce and  distribute identical “standard” simulation environ- ments in which performance can be measured and  treated. Within such digital scenarios, normative  data can be accumulated for performance com- parisons needed for assessment diagnosis and for  treatment rehabilitation purposes. In this manner,  reusable archetypical virtual worlds constructed  for one purpose can also be applied for applica- tions addressing other clinical targets. This chapter  will provide a review of such a retooling approach  using virtual environments that were originally  developed as a controlled stimulus environment in  which cognitive processes could be systematically  assessed in persons with various neurocognitive  and affective deficits.  The  organization  of  this  chapter  is  as  fol- lows.  In  section  one  a  brief  overview  will  be  given of the historical development of clinical  neuropsychology’s normal science and the crisis  state that is leading to a paradigm shift. In section  two, a brief discussion of current applications of  computer-based neuropsychological assessment  are  described.  In  section  three,  there  will  be  a  discussion of the utility of virtual worlds for eco- logically valid neuropsychological assessments  that make use of current technological advances.   The advent of neuroimaging caused a crisis  state in the normal science of neuropsychological  assessment. During a pre-neuroimaging paradigm  focusing  on  localization,  neuropsychologists  received referrals from neurosurgeons to psycho- metrically localize brain damage. However, over  the past few decades a number of developments  in neuroimaging have made virtually obsolete the  normal science of localization by neuropsycho- gists.  Unfortunately,  technological  progress  in  clinical neuropsychology has not been made at  the rate that is found in the other clinical neuro- sciences  Dodrill, 1997 . As a result, the normal  science of neuropsychology is increasingly be- ing questioned as it uses outdated methods  e.g.,  paper-and-pencil tests . What is needed is a shift  to  technologically  advanced  and  ecologically  valid neuropsychological assessment that made  predictions of the patient’s real world function- ing. A response to this need may be found in the  virtual worlds that are being created for clinical  neuropsychology applications. Potential virtual  world use in assessment and treatment of human  cognitive  and  affective  processes  is  becoming  recognized as technology advances. Such simula- tion technology appears to be distinctively suited  for the development of ecologically valid virtual  worlds, in which stimuli are presented in a con- sistent and precise manner. As a result, subjects  are able to manipulate objects in a virtual world  that proffers a range of potential task demands. A further development of this emerging para- digm for clinical neuropsychologists may be found  in the expanding metaverse of virtual worlds such  as Second Life  SL; Linden Lab, San Francisco,  Calif.  that proffer tools  i.e. scripting and graph- ics  and environments that facilitate the creation  of virtual environments that can be made available  to potentially thousands of research subjects in  an economical manner  Bainbridge, 2007 . The  population of users in Second Life has reached  more than six million virtual citizens  Boulous,  2007 .  Within  virtual  worlds,  it  is  possible  to  systematically present cognitive tasks targeting   236   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  Obstacles and limitations are discussed in section  four. A discussion of future directions is given in  section five.  NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL  ASSESSMENT: FROM  LOCALIZATION TO ACTIVITIES  OF DAILY LIVING  The neuropsychological assessment has histori- cally been characterized as both a refinement and  an  extension  of  the  neurological  examination   Benton, 1985 . Much of what is now considered  part of neuropsychological assessment originated  from localizationist attempts of late nineteenth  and early twentieth century physicians to improve  evaluation of the cognitive capacities of persons  with  brain  disease   e.g.,  Broca  and  Wernicke  aphasics . Part of this has to do with the fact that  many widely used neuropsychological tests were  constructed before the advent of neuroimaging  and emergence of much of the currently available  information  relating  altered  behavior  to  brain  dysfunction.  During  this  pre-neuroimaging  era  localization  required  clinical  neuropsychology  to  establish  standardized  assessment  measures  for a normal science capable of identifying the  neurocognitive  effects  of  brain  dysfunction.  Standardized assessment in neuropsychology is  largely due to its historic development from Al- fred Binet’s tests of intelligence and the United  States’s entry into the World War I in 1917  see  Anastasi and Urbina, 1997 for a review . During  this  time  Robert  Yerkes,  Arthur  Otis,  and  the  American Psychological Association developed a  group administered version of the Stanford-Binet   i.e., Army Alpha , and a novel group adminis- tered assessment composed of nonverbal tasks   i.e., Army Beta . A shift occurred with Yerkes   1917   move  Binet’s  age-scale  approach   i.e.,  tasks fluctuate with age and developmental level   to a point-scale methodology  i.e., tests selected  based upon specified functions  over. Ultimately,   the Army group administered measures reflecting  an amalgamation of Yerkes’s point-scale approach  and Binet’s task-specific approach to measuring  cognitive  performance.  Further,  a  performance  scale developed by David Wechsler was included  in an Army battery,  1920  that was made up of  subtests developed primarily by Binet and World  War I psychologists. A major shift in testing oc- curred when Wechsler applied testing procedures   i.e., group and individual  developed for normal  functioning persons to the construction of a clini- cal test battery. Following World War I, Wechsler  assembled the Wechsler-Bellevue battery, which  included both Verbal and Performance Scales. By  the 1940s a number of specialized neurocognitive  tests were available to clinicians for assessing the  mental capacities of persons with brain disease.  The additive effects of these tests provided the  foundation for the normal science found in today’s  neuropsychological assessment procedures  see  Lezak et al., 2004 .  As  mentioned  above,  during  a  period  fo- cusing  on  localization,  the  normal  science  of  neuropsychologists  involved  the  development  and  administration  of  measures  based  upon  a  localization paradigm that focused upon double  dissociation—two neocortical areas are function- ally dissociated by two behavioral measures, each  measure is affected by a lesion in one neocortical  area and not the other  Pribram, 1971 . It is im- portant to note, however, that with the advent of  neuroimaging, the need for neuropsychologists to  localize brain damage has been greatly reduced.  Unfortunately, many neuropsychologists continue  to rely on “localization” as the chief basis for vali- dating neuropsychological tests. As Ronald Ruff  has contended, although neuroimaging caused the  role of neuropsychology to shift from localization  to documentation of neuropsychological deficits  for prediction of real world functioning, clinical  neuropsychologists many times fail to develop  ecologically oriented assessments and continue  to  use  localizationist-developed  test  batteries   Ruff, 2003 .  237   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  COMPUTER AUTOMATION OF  PAPER-AND-PENCIL TESTS  In  the  1980s  there  was  some  initial  interest  in  computerization of various assessment measures  and  neuropsychologists  transferred  a  number  of  paper-and-pencil  measures  to  the  personal  computer platform. Initial attempts at assessing  the equivalence of these measures to traditional  tests were made. A few examples of computer- ized  versions  of  traditional  paper-and-pencil  neuropsychological  tests  include:  the  Raven’s  Colored Progressive Matrices; the Peabody Pic- ture Vocabulary Test;  Category Test  subtest  of  the Halstead Reitan Battery; and the Wisconsin  Card Sorting Test. Further, in the past decade, a  number of computerized tests of neurocognitive  function  have  been  developed:  CogSport,  Im- PACT, ANAM, and Headminder. Computer-based  neuropsychological assessments offer a number  of advantages over traditional paper-and-pencil  testing: increased standardization of administra- tion; increased accuracy of timing presentation  and  response  latencies;  ease  of  administration  and data collection; and reliable and randomized  presentation of stimuli for repeat administrations   Schatz & Browndyke, 2002 .  Despite these computerized versions of tradi- tional paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tests,  the vast majority of current neuropsychological  assessment procedures represent a technology that  has not changed since the first scales developed  in the early 1900s  e.g., Binet and Simon’s first  scale in 1905 and Wechsler’s in 1939 . For the  past few decades, the Wechsler scales  in various  manifestations; e.g., WAIS-R, WAIS III  have been  the most widely used neuropsychological tests.  While automated versions were developed of the  original WAIS in 1969 and again in 1980, these  automations provided only rudimentary stimulus  presentation and limited data recording. Since the  1980s, the automated versions are all but aban- doned and now the focus is upon slight revisions of  the paper-and-pencil versions with computerized   Clinical neuropsychologists are increasingly  being asked to make prescriptive statements about  every-day  functioning   Long,  1996 . This  new  role  for  neuropsychologists  has  resulted  in  in- creased emphasis upon the ecological validity of  neuropsychological instruments. To establish eco- logical validity of neuropsychological measures,  neuropsychologists focus on demonstrations of  either   or  both   verisimilitude  and  veridicality   Franzen and Wilhelm, 1996 . By verisimilitude,  ecological validity researchers are emphasizing  the  need  for  the  data  collection  method  to  be  similar to real life tasks in an open environment.  For the neuropsychological measure to demon- strate veridicality, the test results should reflect  and predict real world phenomena  Chaytor and  Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003 .  In  addition  to  the  controversy  related  to  whether  or  not  current  indices  found  on  com- monly used paper-and-pencil neuropsychological  tests give us sufficient detail for prediction of the  potential everyday difficulties likely to be faced  by patients  Wilson, 1993 , a dearth of research  has addressed the degree to which neuropsycho- logical testing is ecologically valid  Nussbaum  et al., 1995 . Review of the ecological validity  of neuropsychological tests has provided support  for the superiority of verisimilitude tests as the  results from these measures tended to be more  consistently related to the outcome measures than  the traditional paper-and-pencil tests. However,  a problem for the verisimilitude approach is that  these instruments do not appear to be migrating  from research laboratories into the applied settings  of clinical neuropsychologists  Rabin et al., 2007 .  An additional problem for this approach is that  although  these  neuropsychologists  have  devel- oped instruments that more closely approximate  skills required for everyday functioning, have not  made use of advances in computer technology.  As a result, they are in danger of continuing the  negative trend that deemphasizes psychology’s  role as a science.  238   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  scoring. In fact, the latest revisions of the Wechsler  scales  e.g., Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale— Third  Edition;  Wechsler  Intelligence  Scale  for  Children—Fourth Edition  offer little more than  cosmetic change and improved standardization.  This lack of technological advancement of the  Wechsler scales is important because according to  a 2005 study surveying assessment practices and  test usage patterns among 747 North American,  doctorate-level clinical neuropsychologists, the  Wechsler Scales were the most frequently used  tests  in  their  neuropsychological  assessments   Rabin, Barr, and Burton, 2005 .  Robert Sternberg  1997  pointed out over a  decade ago the discrepancy between progress in  cognitive assessment measures like the Wechsler  scales and progress in other areas of technology.  Sternberg  used  the  example  of  the  now  obso- lete black and white televisions, vinyl records,  rotary-dial telephones, and the first commercial  computer made in the United States, UNIVAC I  to illustrate the lack of technological progress in  the standardized testing industry. According to  Sternberg, currently used standardized tests differ  little from tests that have been used throughout  this century. For example, while the first edition  of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale appeared  some years before UNIVAC, the Wechsler scales   and similar tests  have hardly changed at all  aside  from primarily cosmetic changes  compared to  computers. Although one may argue that innova- tion in the computer industry is different from in- novation in the standardized testing industry, there  are still appropriate comparisons. For example,  whereas millions of dollars spent on technology in  the computer industry typically reflects increased  processing speed and power; millions of dollars  spent on innovation in the testing industry tends  to reflect the move from multiple-choice items  to fill-in-the-blank items. Sternberg’s statements  are as true now as they were over a decade ago.  While neuropsychology emphasizes its role as a  science, its technology is not progressing in pace  with other clinical neurosciences. Sternberg also   points out neurocognitive testing needs progress  in ideas, not just new measures, for delivering  old technologies.  The recent shifts in computer science in the  areas of social computing  Wang, 2007 , informa- tion systems  Merali and McKelvey, 2006 , and  even the video game industry  Zackariasson and  Wilson, 2010  reflect a growth in telecommunica- tion and internet-based technologies. Given these  advances, it is becoming increasingly possible to  conduct social and behavioral science research  via the internet. Researchers have reported the  development  and  use  of  a  handful  of  internet- based neurocognitive assessment measures. An  internet-based neurocognitive screening for adult  head injuries has been developed  Erlanger et al.,  2003 ; the Cognitive Stability Index  CSI . The  CSI assess neurocognitive functioning in persons  with known or suspected primary central nervous  system illness  Erlanger et al., 2002 . The CSI  is  made  up  of  ten  subtests  that  comprise  four  domains: attention, processing speed, response  time, and memory. In addition to use with adult  head  injury,  it  has  been  applied  as  a  measure  of  cognitive  function  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate traumatic brain injury  Erlanger et al.,  2003; Erlanger et al., 2002 , Alzheimer’s disease   Lichtenberg et al., 2006 , and multiple sclero- sis   Younes  et  al.,  2007 .  Other  internet-based  cognitive  assessments  include  IntegNeuro  and  WebNeuro. These assessments are being used in  healthy controls and clinical populations. Reli- ability, validity, and norms for comparison with  clinical groups are being established for both the  IntegNeuro  Paul et al., 2005  and the WebNeuro   Silverstein et al., 2007 .  While standard neuropsychological measures  have been found to have adequate predictive value,  their  ecological  validity  may  diminish  predic- tions about real-world functioning  Chaytor and  Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003 . Regardless of the  medium  e.g., paper-and-pencil; computer auto- mations; or internet delivered , traditional neuro- cognitive measures may not replicate the diverse   239   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  Virtual world applications that focus on treat- ment of cognitive  see Rose et al., 2005; Parsons  2009a   and  affective  disorders   see  Powers  &  Emmelkamp, 2008; Parsons et al., 2008a , as well  as assessment of component cognitive processes  are  now  being  developed  and  tested:  attention   Law et al., 2006; Parsons, et al., 2007  spatial  abilities  Beck et al., 2010; Parsons et al., 2004b ,  retrospective memory  Parsons & Rizzo, 2008b ,  prospective  memory   Knight  &  Titov,  2009 ,  spatial  memory   Astur  et  al.,  2004;  Goodrich- Hunsaker  and  Hopkins,  2010 ;  and  executive  functions  Elkind et al., 2001; Pugnetti et al., 1998;  McGeorge et al., 2001 . The increased ecological  validity of neurocognitive batteries that include  assessment using virtual scenarios may aid differ- ential diagnosis and treatment planning. Within a  virtual world, it is possible to systematically pres- ent cognitive tasks targeting neuropsychological  performance beyond what are currently available  using  traditional  methods   Rizzo  et  al.,  2004 .  Reliability of neuropsychological assessment can  be enhanced in virtual worlds by better control  of the perceptual environment, more consistent  stimulus presentation, and more precise and ac- curate scoring. Virtual worlds may also improve  the validity of neurocognitive measurements via  the  increased  quantification  of  discrete  behav- ioral  responses,  allowing  for  the  identification  of more specific cognitive domains  see Gaggioli  et al., 2009 . Virtual environments could allow  for neurocognition to be tested in situations that  are more ecologically valid. Participants can be  evaluated in an environment that simulates the  real world, not a contrived testing environment   see Gorini et al., 2008 . Further, it offers the po- tential to have ecologically valid computer-based  neuropsychological assessments that will move  beyond traditional clinic or laboratory borders.  Technological  advances  in  computing  and  the World Wide Web in the last couple decades   Abbate, 1999  have allowed for internet-based  virtual worlds testing with potentially more diverse  samples in respect to socioeconomic status, sex,   environment in which persons live. Additionally,  standard neurocognitive batteries tend to exam- ine isolated components of neuropsychological  ability, which may not accurately reflect distinct  cognitive domains  Parsons et al., 2004a, 2005 .  Only a handful of neuropsychological measures  have been developed with the specific intention  of tapping into everyday behaviors like navigating  one’s community, grocery shopping, and other  activities of daily living. Of those that have been  developed,  even  fewer  make  use  of  advances  in computer technology. It is important to note  that the ones that have been applied to computer  technology also run this risk of not offering the  ecological validity needed for assessment of real  world functioning.  VIRTUAL WORLDS OFFER  ADVANCED ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY  Virtual worlds offer an advanced computer in- terface that allows humans to become immersed  within a computer-generated simulation. Potential  virtual world use in assessment and rehabilita- tion of human cognitive processes is becoming  recognized as technology advances. Since virtual  worlds allow for precise presentation and control  of dynamic perceptual stimuli, they can provide  ecologically valid assessments that combine the  veridical control and rigor of laboratory measures  with a verisimilitude that reflects real life situa- tions.  Additionally,  the  enhanced  computation  power allows for a range of the accurate recording  of neurobehavioral responses in a perceptual en- vironmental that systematically presents complex  stimuli. Such simulation technology appears to  be  distinctively  suited  for  the  development  of  ecologically valid environments, in which stimuli  are presented in a consistent and precise manner.  As a result, subjects are able to manipulate three  dimensional objects in a virtual world that proffers  a range of potential task demands.  240   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  and age than traditional samples that are often  drawn  from  undergraduate  university  students   Gosling et al., 2004 . Virtual worlds are made  up of online communities in which persons inter- relate in simulated environments. The continued  progress in the development of robust technologies  such as more rapid and secure internet connections  has led to the ever increasing interest in social net- works  Boulos & Wheeler, 2007 . Virtual worlds  provide users to experience social interaction as  they participate in individual and group activities.  The virtual world Second Life proffers multiple  medical and health educational projects  Boulos,  Hetherington, & Wheeler, 2007 . Although these  programs focus primarily on the dissemination of  medical information and the training of clinicians,  a handful of private islands in Second Life  e.g.,  Brigadoon for Asperger’s syndrome; Live2give  for cerebral palsy  have been created for thera- peutic purposes. In a recent article by Gorini et  al  2008 , the authors describe such sites and the  development and implementation of a form of  tailored  immersive  e-therapy  in  which  current  technologies  e.g., virtual worlds; bio and activity  sensors; and personal digital assistants  facilitate  the interaction between real and 3-D virtual worlds  and may increase treatment efficacy.  In a recent article in Science, Bainbridge  2007   discussed the robust potential of virtual worlds for  research in the social and behavioral sciences. For  social and behavioral science researchers, virtual  worlds reflect developing cultures, each with an  emerging ethos and supervenient social institu- tions  for a discussion of supervenience see Hare,  1984 . In addition to the general social phenomena  emerging from virtual world communities, virtual  worlds provide novel opportunities for studying  them. According  to  Bainbridge   2007 ,  virtual  worlds  proffer  environments  that  facilitate  the  creation  of  online  laboratories  that  can  recruit  potentially thousands of research subjects in an  automated  and  economically  feasible  fashion.  Virtual worlds like Second Life offer scripting and  graphics tools that allow even a novice computer   user the means necessary for building a virtual  laboratory. Perhaps even more important is the  fact that social interactions in online virtual worlds   e.g., Second Life  appear to reflect social norms  and interactions found in the physical world  Yee  et al., 2007 . Finally, there is the potential of virtual  worlds to improve access to medical rehabilitation.  Klinger and Weiss  2009  describe the evolution  of virtual worlds along to two dimensions: 1  the  number of users; and 2  the distance between the  users. According  to  Klinger  and  Weiss,  single  user and locally used virtual worlds have devel- oped  into  three  additional  venues:  1   multiple  users located in the same setting, 2  single users  remotely located, and 3  multiple users remotely  located. According to Klinger and Weiss, single  user, locally operated virtual worlds will continue  to be important for rehabilitation within a clinical  or educational setting. However, the literature, to  date, has been limited to descriptions of system  development and reports of small pilot studies   Brennan,  Mawson,  &  Brownsell,  2009 .  It  is  anticipated that this trend is changing and future  years will see evidence of the effectiveness of  such virtual worlds for therapy.  OBSTACLES AND LIMITATIONS  For social and behavioral scientists to make good  use of internet-based virtual worlds, there is need  for empirical, procedural, ethical, and professional  practice guidelines. A general literature review  reveals that most internet-based virtual worlds’  development  efforts  have  been  conducted  in  relative isolation with varying standards for data  transmission,  platform  dependence,  normative  comparison, and clinical application. Although  guidelines are emerging for internet and data stor- age issues among collaborative researchers who  are scattered geographically  Marshall & Haley,  2000 , many virtual world studies fail to provide  sufficient quantitative information to allow readers  to evaluate the appropriateness of the analysis and   241   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  in  real-time  versus  store-and-forward  Internet- based  assessment.  These  issues  emphasize  the  need  for  technology  standardization  in  which  internet-based information may be exchanged. At  minimum, researchers should use the American  Psychological Association’s   APA   established  guidelines for the development, administration,  and interpretation of computerized assessments   APA, 1986, 1987 . Given the many changes that  have occurred in the years since these guidelines  were developed, there is need for a documented  standard beyond those recommendations offered  by the APA. There is a need for neuropsychology to  update such guidelines and maintain a professional  and guiding presence. Clinical practice is increas- ingly being impacted by the internet’s ability to  disseminate rapidly vast amounts of information  and facilitate the instantaneous exchange of ideas. Another issue is that the automated nature of  virtual world measures does not allow an examiner  to interrupt or stop the assessment and “test the  limits” or be more flexible with their evaluation.  Further, virtual world assessments may not pro- vide as much qualitative information as standard  evaluations  in  which  a  clinician  examines  the  type of errors a patient makes and the strategies  a patient might use to arrive at his or her answers   Woo, 2008 . Hence, any computerized assessment  should not remove a clinician from the equation.  Instead, virtual worlds, like automated neuropsy- chological assessments, should be viewed as a tool  to be used by a clinician, and not a replacement  of the clinician.  FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  The  “normal  science”  that  makes  up  clinical  neuropsycholoy’s cognitive and affective assess- ment is informed by developments in psychology,  neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, and computer  science. The paradigm shifts that have occurred in  each of these “informing disciplines” may reflect  an impending paradigm shift in neuropsychology.   to draw their own interpretations. For example, a  Meta-analysis by Parsons and Rizzo  2008a  found  that  the  inadequate  characterization  of  results  and design across studies made it impossible to  carry out an analysis to determine the influence  of  moderator  variables  upon  treatment  effects.  Hence, for clinical variables, such as presence,  immersion, anxiety and or phobia duration, demo- graphics  e.g. age, gender, and ethnicity , it was  not possible to calculate correlation coefficients  because numerous  studies did not report exact  values, and, for some parameters, the number of  studies was too small to meaningfully interpret  the r value. While the application of virtual worlds  to social and behavioral science can increase the  ecological validity of these studies allowing for  results to generalize beyond the controlled labora- tory context  Rizzo et al., 2004 , the ecological  approach to such research runs the risk of being  inconsequential because scientific progress neces- sitates greater emphasis on experimental control   Banaji and Crowder, 1989 . As a result, there is  a consistent tradeoff between enhanced fidelity  and experimental control.  There are some relatively obvious practical and  technical limitations of virtual world-based assess- ment that will cause clinical neuropsychology to  be slow in adopting computerization on a large  scale. For example, synchronization between the  user’s computer processor and the user’s internet  connection occurs with varying amounts of delay,  or error, in timing. As a result, it will be difficult to  standardize or control this delay with a degree of  consistency. At one time this was an issue for any  computerized testing. However, researchers have  since developed software solutions that provide  near-millisecond accuracy  Westall et al., 1989 .  Hence, there is a need for both the development  of internet-based measures and “measure devel- opment” software. Further, there is the issue of  crucial sources of error in computerized neuro- psychological assessment  Cernich et al., 2007 .  For example, various configurations and operating  systems are in use. A further example may be found   242   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  This impending shift is also reflected in the ways  in which traditional paper-and-pencil assessments  of cognition and affective presentations have been  replicated with general equivalence to their paper- and-pencil predecessors. Likewise, virtual world  applications that focus on treatment of cognitive   see Rose et al., 2005; Parsons 2009a  and affec- tive disorders  see Powers & Emmelkamp, 2008;  Parsons et al., 2008a , as well as assessment of  component  cognitive  processes  are  now  being  developed and tested. One example of such de- velopments can be found in a set of projects at the  University of Southern California’s Institute for  Creative Technologies  USC ICT . At USC ICT, a  number of projects have been designed, developed  and implemented using a Virtual Iraqi Afghani  theme. The Virtual Iraq Afghanistan world uses  virtual environments to assess and treat combat  related trauma, such as posttraumatic stress dis- order  PTSD  and traumatic brain injury  TBI .  This example is used because it represents the  evolution from 1  paper-and-pencil and automated  computer assessments to a virtual world environ- ment   Virtual  Reality  Cognitive  Performance  Assessment Test ; 2  extension of VRCPAT to a  virtual reality exposure therapy; and 3  finally an  instantiation of in Second Life.  First, in one set of these environments at USC  ICT, Thomas Parsons  Parsons et al., 2008a, 2008b,  2008c, 2009b  and colleagues have recycled the  virtual graphic assets built for the combat tactical  simulation training game, Full Spectrum Warrior,  to  develop  a  Virtual  Reality  Cognitive  Perfor- mance Assessment Test  VRCPAT . The VRCPAT  project is embedding the metrics and 2D stimulus  presentations from a well established computer- ized  assessment  battery  of  cognitive  function  known  as  the  Automated  Neuropsychological  Assessment Metrics  ANAM  and validating the  results on standard paper-and-pencil measures.  Preliminary  results  suggest  that  the  VRCPAT  measures a capacity that is a valid test that provides  a unique opportunity to reliably and efficiently   study cognitive function within an ecologically  valid environment.  Second, in related work at USC ICT, Albert  Rizzo, Parsons, and colleagues, are using the same  Virtual Iraqi Afghani environment for virtual real- ity exposure therapy  VRET  with soldiers who  have experienced trauma resulting in disrupted  affect. The Virtual Iraq Afghanistan system built  from a user-centered design process has been tested  in  an  open  clinical  trial  with  PTSD-diagnosed  active  duty  service  members.  The  participants  were service members who recently redeployed  from Iraq and who had engaged in previous PTSD  treatments  e.g., group counseling, SSRIs, etc.   without benefit. The VRET exposure exercises  followed the principles of graded prolonged be- havioral exposure and the pace was individual- ized and patient-driven. Initial analyses of results  from the first 20 Virtual Iraq treatment completers  have indicated positive clinical outcomes. Of the  first twenty patients to complete treatment 16 no  longer meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD at post  treatment. It is important to note that the VRCPAT  and the VRET for combat-related PTSD projects  developed  at  USC ICT  are  not  online  virtual  worlds. Instead, the Virtual Iraqi Afghani world  uses an offline immersive virtual environment.  Third, virtual world environments that mimic  USC ICT’s VRET approach have been developed  at USC ICT in Second Life by Jackie Morie. The  Second Life instantiation is called the Transitional  Online Post-deployment Soldier Support in Virtual  Worlds  TOPSS-VW . The TOPSS-VW project  uses the facility of online virtual worlds to create  a place of camaraderie and healing for returning  United States military veterans—virtual space that  can help them deal with problems related to their  time of service and also assist in their reintegration  into society  Morie et al., 2009 . Finally, Parsons  and Morie at USC ICT are currently planning to  implement VRCPAT in a Second Life Virtual Iraq  Afghanistan. The goal will be to development and  validate a handful of internet-based neurocognitive  assessment measures using Second Life.  243   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  valid. Participants can be evaluated in a virtual  world that simulates the real world, not a contrived  testing environment. Virtual worlds offer the op- tion to produce and distribute identical “standard”  simulation environments in which performance  can be measured and treated. Within such digital  scenarios,  normative  data  can  be  accumulated  for performance comparisons needed for assess- ment diagnosis  and  for  treatment rehabilitation  purposes. In this manner, reusable archetypical  virtual worlds constructed for one purpose can  also be applied for applications addressing other  clinical targets.  REFERENCES  Abbate, J.  1999 .

Each of these “informing disciplines” has gone  through changes that challenge theory and praxes  of neuropsychological assessment. Developments  in the area of neuropsychological assessment par- allel several of Kuhn’s observations concerning  the nonlinear trend of progress in the history of  science. For example, the naive assumption that  traditional  neuropsychological  assessment  pro- cedures would continue to maintain prominence  following the advent of neuroimaging character- ized an earlier status quo, a period Kuhn referred  to as normal science. The untenable presumption  that traditional paper-and-pencil batteries  or au- tomated computerized versions  were generally  capable of forming accurate judgments about the  everyday  functioning   i.e.,  ecological  validity   of persons tested on the basis of observation was  another  received  belief  that  characterized  this  soon to be archaic era of practice.  A further development of this emerging para- digm for clinical neuropsychologists may be found  in the expanding metaverse of virtual worlds such  as Second Life. Within virtual worlds, it is possible  to systematically present cognitive tasks targeting  neuropsychological  performance  beyond  what  are currently available using traditional methods.  Reliability of neuropsychological assessment and  treatment of affective and cognitive disorders can  be enhanced in virtual worlds by better control  of the perceptual environment, more consistent  stimulus presentation, and more precise and ac- curate scoring. Virtual worlds may also improve  the validity of neurocognitive measurements via  the increased quantification of discrete behavioral  responses, allowing for the identification of more  specific cognitive domains. Virtual worlds could  allow for cognition and affect to be assessed and  treated in situations that are more ecologically   244   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  Bechtel, W., & Abrahamsen, A.  1990 .

Ecological  Validity:  To  establish  ecologi- cal  validity  of  neuropsychological  measures,  neuropsychologists focus on demonstrations of  either   or  both   verisimilitude  and  veridicality.  By verisimilitude, ecological validity researchers  are emphasizing the need for the data collection  method to be similar to real life tasks in an open   Virtual Simulations and the Second Life Metaverse  environment. For the neuropsychological measure  to demonstrate veridicality, the test results should  reflect and predict real world phenomena.  Neuropsychological  Assessment:  A  neu- ropsychological  assessment  typically  evaluates  multiple areas of cognitive and affective function- ing. In addition to measures of intelligence and  achievement, it examines a number of areas of  functioning that also have an impact on perfor- mance in activities of daily living.  Normal Science: Kuhn’s idea that the theory  and praxes of a scientific community  e.g., neuro- psychologists  are firmly based upon one or more  past  scientific  achievements  that  the  scientific  community acknowledges for a time as supplying  the foundation for its further practice.  Paradigm:  Kuhn  defines  a  scientific  para- digm as having the following: 1  that which the  researchers in the scientific community choose to  observe and scrutinize; 2  the kind of questions  that are supposed to be asked by researchers in  the scientific community; 3  the structure of these  questions; and 4  the ways in which the results  of scientific investigations should be interpreted. Paradigm Shift: From a Kuhnian perspective,  this  represents  a  shift  in  professional  commit- ments to shared assumptions that occurs when  an  anomaly  subverts  the  existing  tradition  of  scientific practice.  Scientific Community: Kuhn’s idea of a sci- entific community entails that neuropsychologists  as a community cannot practice its trade without  some set of received beliefs.

More broadly, there is a growing body of experience and supporting evidence  on the benefits of virtual worlds for professional information sharing, clinical simulation, healthcare  delivery, and as a research tool. Virtual worlds have empirically demonstrated outcomes as a simulation  tool that increases knowledge and of health professionals, and initial explorations in regard to healthcare  delivery show promise. Key challenges for wider adoption of virtual worlds within the health profes- sions include a lack of established standards around privacy, a fragmented approach to collaboration  and marked skepticism toward virtual worlds as a platform for health care delivery. Recommendations  for formalised collaboration mechanisms, agreement on standards, and future research avenues are  put forward, with a focus on virtual worlds as a tool that increasingly will be central to professional  learning and practice.  INTRODUCTION  A majority of the focus on virtual worlds to date  has been on their applicability to education more  broadly  as  opposed  to  health  care  specifically.  For health professionals, health researchers and  academics, a range of unique opportunities and  challenges present themselves in relation to virtual   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch017  worlds, which have evolved to be a cost-effective,  clinically appropriate learning tool, health inter- vention environment and research platform.  This chapter will therefore look at three broad  areas on virtual worlds and health. First, the use  of virtual worlds for general training purposes and  professional information sharing will be discussed.  Second, the context for the use of virtual worlds  for clinical simulation will be established, includ- ing a case study showing its utility in the field of   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

Virtual Worlds and Health  ronment,  the  ability  to  make  mistakes  without  causing harm and the ability to reflectively discuss  both adverse and desired outcomes. Simulation  has traditionally been of a procedural nature i.e.  insertion of a urinary catheter, but this has been  expanded to the psychosocial aspects of healthcare  delivery such as health assessment and counsel- ing, to the point that procedural training may be  more considered a clinical laboratory process than  true simulation.  There is a large body of research work con- firming the efficacy of clinical simulation – with  some caveats. A study by Bambini et al  2009   confirmed  the  utility  of  traditional  simulation  mechanisms  in  improving  clinical  judgement,  communication and general confidence. Gordon  and Buckley  2009  in an assessment of gradu- ate nurses’ ability to respond to patient clinical  emergencies, not only found an improvement in  technical confidence but also an increase in non- technical  aspects  such  as  information  sharing,  voicing concerns and using external resources. A  systematic review of the 2003-2007 literature on  the efficacy of high-fidelity simulation in health  sciences training, found an overall increase in as- sessment and clinical skills performance – whilst  also recommending a more rigorous and uniform  approach to evaluation of simulation outcomes   Harder, 2010 .  A framework proposed by Jeffries  2005  is  a useful basis for any discussion on nursing and  simulation. The framework identifies the pivotal  role simulation can play in generating learning  outcomes,  whilst  increasing  satisfaction  and  self-confidence of those who have participated. It  emphasises the role simulation plays in developing  critical thinking skills, which are crucial for any  nurse to demonstrate competence in an increas- ingly complex working environment. A discus- sion paper from Clancy et al  2008  emphasises  the utility of virtual environments in simulating  complex systems that nurses work within on a  daily basis. Specifically, the authors assert that  such simulations deliver superior outcomes for   surgery. The related area of clinical modeling for  more effective health care delivery will also be  explored, with examples of work underway on  hospital workflow logistics and the use of smart  objects. Finally, the use of virtual worlds as a health  research tool will be illustrated, with a particular  emphasis on the link between virtual world and  physical world health behaviours.  The three areas for discussion provide a snap- shot of the work underway within the health field,  but do not encapsulate its full breadth. The issue  of addiction has been purposely avoided as the  research base is markedly disparate to the other  areas discussed in this chapter, so doing it justice  within  the  space  constraints  is  difficult.  For  a  small proportion of the population, use of virtual  worlds can indeed become problematic. This is  no way detracts from the larger population that  currently and potentially will benefit from virtual  worlds, but the negative aspects should not go  unacknowledged.  BACKGROUND  Clinical Simulation: The  Link to Virtual Worlds  The utilisation of virtual worlds within the health  domain has arguably been a longer term one than  in other fields. This is predominantly due to the  regular use of simulation in the medical, nursing  and allied health fields over many decades. The  use  of  three-dimensional   3D   simulations  for  specific surgical procedures is particularly well  established, with the earliest references to its use  occurring in 1987 for fibre-endoscopy  Cooper  and Taqueti, 2008 .  For nursing and most allied health profession- als, clinical simulation is also a standard compo- nent of undergraduate training and remains a tool  for workplace-based learning. The rationales for  their use in the health professions are obvious in  a lot of respects: a semi-realistic learning envi-  252   Virtual Worlds and Health  both patient and nurse due to their ability to encap- sulate the whole system as opposed to traditional  reductionist approaches that attempt to investigate  one small aspect in isolation. A 2011 multisite  evaluation  study  of  an  end-of-life  simulation  for  nursing  education  demonstrated  enhanced  student knowledge in caring for someone at the  end of their life, as well as increased levels of self  confidence, communication skills and satisfaction  with the approach overall  Fluharty et al, 2011 .  Virtual Worlds and Health:  The Broader Picture  The body of research and practice on health and  virtual worlds is at formative stages, with an em- phasis to date on describing the current and future  virtual worlds landscape and recommending broad  areas for further research. One key exception to  this, as will be discussed below, is psychosocial  research in areas such as the link between avatar  and physical world health behaviours,viewpoint.  The relative familiarity of the health professions  with simulation has meant that the step to 3D im- mersive platforms is a smaller one than for a lot of  disciplines. For the sake of this discussion, a virtual  world is defined as any platform that provides  an  immersive,  avatar-based  three-dimensional  space. As will be illustrated in detail below, virtual  worlds that offer end-user content creation  such  as Second Life, Unity3D and OpenSim  tend to  provide the most substantive options for the health  professions, but other platforms do provide adjunct  benefits for health-based research or interventions,  and these will be discussed as well.  The supporting research literature on health-re- lated use of virtual worlds has grown significantly  over the past decade in particular. The following  table provides a gauge of the explosion in virtual  worlds research since 1991. For the sake of this  illustration,  the  use  of  the  search  term  ‘virtual  reality  and  health’  was  used,  with  the  search  completed in January 2011 and limited to peer-  Table 1. Health-related virtual worlds research  1991-2010   Database name  Ovid MEDLINE PsycINFO CINAHL Google Scholar  1991-2000  results*  2001-2010  results*  48 14 199 56400  163 160 1729 115000  reviewed research or authored books  excluding  the Google Scholar component .  This  growth  in  research  and  discussion  on  virtual worlds and health is most evident in the  psychosocial  domain,  which  is  unsurprising  given the cognitive basis of most current virtual  reality experiences. Additionally, the psychology  of  immersion,  addiction  and  interaction  in  3D  environments involves complexities that sit in- trinsically within the psychosocial domain and  tend to be researched from that perspective. The  growth in research within the medical and nursing  fraternities  has  remained  substantial  but  of  a  comparatively smaller quantum. The establish- ment of journals devoted to the topic area has also  fostered the level of research undertaken – The  Journal of Virtual Worlds Research is one notable  example, although The Journal of Medical Inter- net Research and Presence also regularly publish  peer-reviewed virtual worlds research, amongst  others. This is providing the critical mass of pub- lications to ensure less explored aspects of vir- tual worlds and health are investigated and dis- seminated.  Some significant challenges remain in regard  to the more widespread use of virtual worlds in  healthcare training and delivery. First, ensuring  a  uniform  clinical  simulation  environment  for  users  can  be  problematic.  The  higher-end  PC  requirements  for  use  of  a  large  number  of  the  platforms can provide a roadblock in education  environments where numerous learning activities  are priorities for the same infrastructure. Second,   253   Virtual Worlds and Health  virtual environments for health-related purposes  is evolving, with such mechanisms having been  touted for more than fifteen years  Kancherla et  al, 1995 . The ability to overlay information from  the virtual environment onto a physical patient  or device is the next obvious step in utilisation  of virtual worlds in the health professions. One  hypothetical example would be the use of avatars  for initial training of midwives in antenatal as- sessment and then using an Augmented Reality  mechanism to overlay the key components of the  assessment onto a physical patient to bridge the  gap between simulation and reality. Inversely, a  busy antenatal clinic may collect assessment data  from a cohort of women and then use that data  to inform the behaviours of the avatars used in  clinical simulations. This essentially occurs now in  informing the projects developed to date, but AR  mechanisms will allow for better synchronisation  between learning environments.  An Issue of Promise  Virtual  worlds  provide  both  opportunities  and  challenges in regards to health. The only certainty  is that awareness of these environments is critical  for all health professionals, in order to gauge their  effectiveness for both those within the professions  and for the populations they serve. The research  base for virtual worlds and health is burgeoning,  with much more work yet to be done to establish a  concrete foundation for their day-to-day utilisation  across the board. To ensure widespread adoption,  a rigourous evidence base needs to be confirmed,  with the examples cited in this discussion part of  the initial cohort achieving that objective.  HEALTH PROFESSIONAL  TRAINING AND EDUCATION  there continues to be some instinctive resistance to  avatar-based platforms from both those receiving  the training and those responsible for delivering  it. A qualitative review of six papers on that issue  showed that educators unfamiliar with the area  tended to assume virtual worlds weren’t of real  educational value and that they were similar to  lower level arcade games  Rice, 2007 . Third, for  true adoption of these environments for healthcare  interventions, significant work around privacy and  medical record storage needs to occur. Like their  2D counterparts, virtual worlds have a long way  to go before safe and effective medical record  storage becomes the status quo.  There are medium-term solutions on the hori- zon for all of these issues however. The increasing  maturity of web-based virtual worlds will assist in  driving adoption as the combination of perceived  usefulness  for  communication  and  ease  of  use  evolves. For the so-called ‘digital natives’ - those  who have grown up knowing nothing other than  internet access - there is a natural affinity to using  online mechanisms for health information, due  to their attitude to technology being informed by  their constant exposure  Fetscherin et al, 2008 .  This exposure is quickly expanding to the use of  immersive environments for purposes other than  entertainment and socialisation. The success of  the American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life in  Second Life is one such example of non-profit  volunteer work being undertaken virtually  ACS,  2008 . Overall, there is real momentum toward  innovative and cost-effective clinical simulation  and virtual worlds are central to this. In relation  to privacy and medical records storage, work is  well underway to confirm international standards,  which could then be implemented within virtual  environments.  Augmented Reality: On  the Close Horizon  254  Although  Augmented  Reality   AR   isn’t  the  focus  of  this  discussion,  its  combination  with   Arguably the most obvious use of virtual worlds in  the health context comes with the initial or ongoing  training of health professionals. Specific clinical    Virtual Worlds and Health  simulation will be covered later in this chapter,  however there is a wide range of general health  education and training initiatives already imple- mented within virtual worlds. The availability of  more general health science education and train- ing is particularly relevant to disciplines where  aspects of health sciences such as biochemistry,  genetics and physiology are required as theoretical  background rather than being intrinsic to practice.  Being able to use immersive options for learning  can provide cost effective learning and increase  retention of knowledge via increased engagement  with the subject matter and a fuller understanding  of its context  Cannon-Bowers and Bowers, 2009;  Wankel and Kingsley, 2009 .  Broadly, the areas where virtual worlds are  utilised include health-related science  anatomy,  physiology, epidemiology , core health informa- tion  diseases, health risk factors  and professional  information sharing  forums of mutual clinical  interest,  conferences .  Each  will  be  discussed  below, including points on future evolution likely  in each area.  Health-Related Science  The use of 3D environments to illustrate health- related science concepts is very well established,  particularly within the anatomy and physiology  fields.  There  are  numerous  non-immersive  3D  anatomical  modeling  options  available  to  stu- dents, however those are not the focus here. Us- ing Second Life as an immersive example, over  the past five years a range of anatomical models  have been developed that provide a particularly  unique opportunity: the ability for an avatar to  walk through key anatomical structures. A well- established  example  of  this  is  the  Ohio  State  University’s model of the human testis  Danforth,  2008 , which has been established in Second Life  for well over three years. It provides a large scale,  multi-stage anatomical exhibit covering both the  structures themselves in addition to detailed, real-  time physiological illustrations - in this case the  various stages of sperm development.  Biology concepts are pivotal to most disciplines  in the health professions, and a range of work has  been  conducted  in  that  field  in  virtual  worlds.  Evolution, genetics and genetic mutations have  been a popular focus from a range of institutions  in both Second Life and OpenSim. This popular- ity is partly due to the scripting language in both  environments  providing  the  ability  to  simulate  issues such as mutation in an effective way. One  example of this is the work being done in Open- Sim by Dr Paul Decelles, whereby evolutionary  processes are being explored through replication  of virtual organisms  Decelles, 2010 . Projects  like this provide a useful learning opportunity for  health professionals learning the human sciences  as it provides an illustrative point that consolidates  knowledge in that area.  Epidemiology is another area of interest and  from a mainstream media viewpoint, the Mas- sively  Multiplayer  Online  Role-playing  Game   MMORPG  World of Warcraft was cited as a  test-bed for disease transmission. After a glitch  in  a  2005  software  patch  released  by  Blizzard  Software,  players  who  engaged  in  battle  with  a dungeon boss called ‘Hakkar’, were infected  with  ‘Corrupted  Blood’  which  depleted  their  health. This is a normal gameplay mechanic, but  in this specific case the disease was able to be  transferred out of the dungeon in question to the  wider World of Warcraft population. This led to  widespread ‘deaths’ amongst lower-level players,  with the associated inconvenience of needing to  walk back to one’s corpse in-game. A discussion  paper by Logfren and Fefferman  2007  citing this  particular event, identified the opportunities for  reproducing epidemic scenarios using large virtual  environments like World of Warcraft.  There were key weaknesses in the 2005 event  however, including the fact that the transmissibil- ity  was  100%  and  the  level  of  applicability  to  physical world human movements was limited -  there has been a degree of criticism of the level   255   Figure 1. Dalaran – a city in World of Warcraft  Virtual Worlds and Health  of enthusiasm about what is argued as a flawed  model   Williams,  2010 .  That  said,  the  use  of  virtual worlds for epidemiological research re- mains a fertile area for exploration. In a discussion  paper  on  modeling  epidemics,  Gordon  et  al   2009b  make the argument that the link between  avatar and human is potentially strong enough in  freer environments like Second Life to allow for  substantive modeling of epidemics such as HIV  AIDS transmission due to the ability for all the  relevant  behaviours  to  be  simulated. Although  outcomes to date have been sparse in this spe- cific area, there is certainly agreement that vir- tual worlds can be a useful adjunct to physical  world  modeling.  With  the  ongoing  growth  of  virtual worlds usage and as these worlds become  more nuanced, the potential for epidemiological  research grows even more evident.  Consumer Health Information  Provision and Support  As a collaborative, social platform, virtual worlds  provide a strong option as a health information   256  and health support tool. This is an area where less  complex worlds such as IMVU and Habbo also  boast communities with a health-specific focus,  but this discussion will focus on the more complex  communities and presences that have evolved.  The University of Plymouth has a presence in  Second Life dating back to July 2007, devoted to  sexual health education. It combines video tutori- als, live seminars and interactive quizzes and initial  evaluations has shown it to be popular although  determining outcomes is problematic, given the  limitations in measuring traffic to particular areas  in Second Life. One of the cited successes came  with  a  seminar  on  sex  and  disability,  with  the  presenting speaker stating that the attendance was  much higher in Second Life than it would have  been face-to-face due to the sensitivity of the topic   Kamel  Boulos  and  Toth-Cohen,  2009;  Kamel  Boulos, 2010 . In the absence of metrics gleaned  from the virtual world platform, more traditional  session evaluation tools continue to be pivotal, and  even as in-world measurement improves, those  tools will continue to be important.   Virtual Worlds and Health  During 2010 a research project was undertaken  by Murdoch University’s Kirsty Best, on the utility  of Second Life for supporting those experiencing  Myalgic Encephalitis   Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  The qualitative research focused on the role of  Second Life as a means to reduce social isola- tion for those experiencing the illness. At time  of  writing  the  feedback  from  participants  was  showing outcomes in regard to lessened social  isolation and increased knowledge around man- aging life with Myalgic Encephalitis   Chronic  Fatigue Syndrome. Cited negatives included the  complexity of the technology and issues for some  participants in installing and using Second Life  effectively  Holloway, 2010 .  A project led by the Texas Obesity Research  Center at the University of Houston is also worth  noting  in  this  section  because  of  its  focus  on  providing  evidence-based  information  around  obesity. For the research, active recruitment was  undertaken  within  Second  Life,  with  162  par- ticipants taking part in a range of interventions  including extensive information provision on diet  and physical activity. Activities were centred on  three areas: a ‘Café Pavilion’, ‘Physical Activity  Pavilion’  and  ‘Information  Pavilion’.  Specific  activities  included  choosing  foodstuffs  from  a  virtual refrigerator with associated recipes and  dietary guidelines, avatar engagement in physi- cal activities such as walking and jumping for 30  minutes  maximum  per  day,  and  completion  of  questionnaires on diet and physical activity. The  results of the project showed mixed results - on the  positive side, the authors state that “obesity preven- tion interventions can be effectively designed and  implemented within virtual worlds”  Siddiqi et al  2010 . Less desirable outcomes revolved around  retention of participants and user-experience issues  with Second Life – a regular finding of virtual  worlds research to date.  The three examples cited here illustrate the abil- ity for health professionals to disseminate relevant  information to populations that may be otherwise  difficult  to  access,  or  where  the  sensitivity  of   the topic makes face-to-face interventions more  challenging.  Additionally,  health  professionals  can learn a great deal from the communities of  mutual interest that have developed around health  issues  –  such  groups  provide  an  ideal  base  on  which to build collaborative projects with health  consumers.  Professional Information Sharing  The use of virtual worlds for information sharing  between health professionals is well-established.  Second Life has been the focus of the majority of  work, although more recently OpenSim has gained  significant traction, as has Unity3D. One of the  key challenges in this area is actually defining the  scale of information sharing occurring.  This author has encountered a range of pro- fessional groups within Second Life since 2006,  including  nursing,  medicine,  counseling  and  mental health. Some come under the auspice of  professional bodies; others are driven by university  academics, with the remainder being formed by  communities of interest within professions. One  of the latter is the Online Therapy Institute, which  focuses on Second Life and its usefulness in coun- seling   therapy. Founders DeeAnna Merz Nagel  and Kate Anthony see virtual worlds offering an  improved level of sensory experience over other  ‘remote’ counseling modalities such as web-chat  and discussion forums, with a related improve- ment in therapeutic outcomes  Holloway, 2009 .  Their initial work in Second Life has been in the  information-sharing domain, providing familiar- ity instruction and a virtual space for collegiate  interaction. There is an acceptance that virtual  worlds  like  Second  Life  do  continue  to  have  limitations in regard to establishing identity and  ensuring privacy  Gorini et al, 2008 , and that  until such issues are resolved it is difficult to offer  substantive counselling interventions outside of  finite research study boundaries. The concepts of  privacy and identity in virtual worlds are fraught  with challenges, including the likelihood that an   257   Virtual Worlds and Health  nuanced content creation options will be critical  for  the  adoption  of  virtual  worlds  as  a  central  information-sharing tool for the health professions.  At present, those involved are early-adopters and  innovators providing proof-of-concept modeling  that will form the basis of that longer-term view.  CLINICAL SIMULATION  Virtual Worlds as Simulation  As discussed in the Background section above,  clinical simulation is a well entrenched learning  tool with a significant body of evidence supporting  it. The large majority of this evidence revolves  around the use of simulation laboratory settings  rather  than  virtual  environments;  however,  the  body of literature on simulation and virtual worlds  is growing as well. It is also arguable that the bulk  of the evidence supporting laboratory simulation  can be applied to virtual worlds to some extent, in  that virtual worlds are essentially another tool in  the simulation arsenal. There are certainly issues  specific to these environments that do not apply  to more traditional simulations, but there are as  many similarities as differences. Cooper and Ta- queti  2004  illustrate the lack of clarity around the  clinical simulation field generally, citing the fact  that in procedural simulation, there has been no  review of the field and that there remains confu- sion over definitions and outcomes of simulation  beyond a particular device or approach. A review  of surgical simulation by Sturm et al  2008  found  that although clinical simulation did transfer suc- cessfully to the live clinical environment, the ten  randomized trials and one comparative study were  “of variable quality and did not use comparable  simulation-based training methodologies”.  The lack of definitional clarity to date with  clinical  simulation  provides  a  unique  opportu- nity for the nascent area of virtual worlds-based  simulation. Because of the relative infancy of 3D  virtual worlds, the reality is that there are only a   individual seeking counselling within a virtual  world is predicated on a desire for absolute ano- nymity, and the professional challenges that brings. Another noteworthy example of professional  information sharing is the International Virtual  Association of Surgeons  IVAS , which had its first  conference in 2008. Initiated as a demonstration  of the cost-effectiveness of virtual conferences,  the central purpose of the meetings are sharing  of information, including discussion of medical  imaging, research studies and related professional  issues.  IVAS’  continued  growth  is  not  assured  however,  with  concerns  acknowledged  around  verifying identity and the inability to conduct true  hands-on workshops that would be possible in a  face-to-face context  Leong et al, 2008 . However,  the fact that IVAS has had some success to date  within one of the most highly-technical, ‘hands- on’ professions, bodes well for the use of virtual  worlds more widely as an information sharing tool. Looking at the issue of information sharing in  virtual worlds more broadly, the use of open-source  virtual worlds like OpenSim will arguably lead  to more effective information sharing, for three  reasons.  First,  there  is  an  established  body  of  evidence that the success of virtual communities  is related to the degree of system quality, service  quality  and  information  quality   Lin  and  Lee,  2006 . Therefore, OpenSim’s lower price point,  ability for greater end-user customisation and the  boutique customer service approach by some grid  administrators  meet  those  criteria  for  success.  Second, the ability to create an OpenSim-based  world behind a firewall at minimal cost provides  a  superior  option  for  professional  information  sharing where security of information is a prior- ity or where the scale of content creation makes  worlds like Second Life cost-prohibitive. Finally,  collaboration in the health professions is most suc- cessful where common structures are in place, and  OpenSim provides interoperability with Second  Life and the gamut of OpenSim-related grids.  In the longer term, the drive toward secure,  interoperable virtual environments that provide   258   Virtual Worlds and Health  handful of platforms complex enough to accom- modate effective simulation. If work is continued  on standardisation and interoperability between  platforms, then some of the pitfalls of the simu- lation field more widely  lack of replication of  research areas, fragmentation of approaches  may  be avoided. There has been some significant work  on this to date, through the open-source OpenSim  and its high degree of interoperability with Second  Life protocols. Additionally, OpenSim allows for  use of other virtual worlds protocols, which has  been demonstrated successfully with the Unity3d  platform over the past couple of years  Hughes,  2009 . If the level of cooperative evolution and  innovation continues, then more rigorous research  outcomes are likely to be generated as the founda- tion on which research methodologies are applied  becomes more solid and widely accepted.  Clinical Simulation: Limitations  and Successes  In  addition  to  the  Imperial  College  case  study  given below, a number of virtual world clinical  simulations have been developed that have demon- strated positive outcomes. All have a commonality  in that they address specific clinical pathways,  require accurate replication of clinical decision- making and provide a comprehensive simulation  experience transferable to actual clinical practice.  Additionally, each has cited similar limitations  that require further investigation. To illustrate the  specifics of the successful and not-so-successful  aspects of clinical simulation, it is pertinent to  cite two examples: the Second Life in Education  in New Zealand  SLENZ  project and a research  initiative by the University of Alberta.  The  SLENZ  project  contained  a  midwifery  clinical simulation at the core of its activities, with  the aim to build  in Second Life  a best-practice  birthing unit, within which midwifery students  could then be trained in a range of aspects of the  birthing process from the initial phone call from  the expectant mother through to delivery of post-  natal care. According to a qualitative evaluation  undertaken  on  the  project   Winter,  2010 ,  the  combination of the best-practice birthing facility  and the ability for students to role-play both the  midwife  and  birthing  woman  provided  useful  outcomes from the perspective of both the students  and the educators. More specifically, a number  of the students participating had their skepticism  toward the virtual world simulation  and to some  extent Second Life  turned around to the point of  agreement that the simulation was a very useful  tool. On the negative side, both the students and  the educators involved found the learning curve  for Second Life quiet steep, experienced techni- cal difficulties including bandwidth issues due to  the remote locations of some students, and found  that the need to employ an experienced Second  Life content creator provided a set of challenges   Winter, 2010 .  The University of Alberta initiative also con- tained two aspects. The first was the development  of scenario-based training simulations for Emer- gency Medical Technicians  EMT  that involved  procedural  and  communication  domains.  The  second was a communications skills education  program utilising ‘Standardized Patients’ – in this  case Second Life avatars. In both cases, similar  outcomes to the SLENZ experience were demon- strated, with yet again an emphasis on the inher- ent limitations of consumer virtual worlds like  Second Life and a desire for exploration of even  more flexible and comprehensive environments  for simulation development  Chodos et al, 2010 . The  SLENZ  and  University  of Alberta  ex- periences to a large extent encapsulate the chal- lenges  for  simulation  in  non-specialist  virtual  environments. There is a growing awareness of  their usefulness, mixed with concerns over their  complexity and the need to overcome resistance  to  their  use.  This  resistance  is  exacerbated  by  negative  coverage  by  some  of  the  mainstream  media  revolving  around  sex,  gambling,  addic- tion and relationship breakdowns. Once relevant  exposure to virtual worlds occurs, resistance tends   259   to break down and in its place awareness develops  of the scope of learning opportunities that these  environments provide.  staff.”  Imperial College London, 2010 . Over the  time of its operation, the MMDL has instigated a  number of projects:  Virtual Worlds and Health  Medical Device Education A  simulation  was  created  within  Second  Life  designed  to  increase  familiarity  with  specific  medical devices such as insulin infusion pumps.  Eleven surgical nurses, of which ten were novice  users of the specific insulin pump, completed a  clinical  scenario  with  a  scripted  patient  avatar  and an in-world instructor. The feedback from  the nurses involved showed that all felt it was a  useful training tool, there was increased confi- dence in using the physical world equivalent of  the device, and 82% were willing to recommend  the training to colleagues  Kinross et al, 2009 .  The applicability of medical device familiarity  training for both emerging and experienced clini- cians is absolute: just as virtual worlds continue  to evolve at a rapid pace, so do the iterations of  medical devices available. For universities and  health delivery services, the ability to script virtual  world objects that replicate new medical devices is  both cost-effective and clinically effective in that  most educators are unable to supply real working  versions of each new medical device being used.  Clinical Scenarios A  number  of  clinical  scenarios  have  been  de- veloped for both doctors and nurses, to develop  clinical decision-making skills. In this instance,  an avatar patient was scripted to exhibit a range of  symptoms, with the health professional required  to undertake an appropriate assessment, make a  relevant  diagnosis  and  provide  the  appropriate  care with the equipment provided in the simula- tion  Imperial College London, 2010 . The de- gree of intricacy of the simulation allows for a  near-direct mirroring of actual clinical practice  and work environment, which informed the de- velopment of the hospital wards and treatment  areas. At time of writing, substantive outcomes  of the clinical scenarios were still being written   Simulation: The Future  Although  simulation  is  one  of  the  most  well  entrenched aspects of virtual environments and  health, the drive to improve the quality of simula- tion is greater than ever. The cost-effectiveness  of  virtual  worlds  like  OpenSim  and  Second  Life,  whilst  providing  opportunities  for  more  widespread simulation use, have a great deal of  evolution to undertake before providing the level  of  immersion  that  some  of  the  more  specialist  virtual reality devices can provide. That evolu- tion is likely to occur at an increasingly acceler- ated pace, is likely to have mirroring of physical  world data at its core, and will heavily involve  augmented reality mechanisms where appropri- ate. The increasing interest by government in the  use of virtual worlds may also provide a catalyst  for more substantive funding of non-commercial  virtual worlds development. The United States  Government  in  particular  has  an  active  virtual  worlds strategy and the conjunction of the De- fense Forces’ interest in virtual worlds support  for  returned  servicemen   as  discussed  below   is likely to be one of the key drivers for quality  improvement in the space worldwide.  Case Study: Imperial College London  Surgical simulation is well entrenched in medical  training, but widening its use has been dependent  on cost and availability. The Department of Bio- surgery and Surgical Technology at the Imperial  College London, formed the Medical Media and  Design  Laboratory   MMDL   in  2007,  focused  specifically on “innovative and efficient means  for  communicating  complex  health  messages,  the  visualisation  of  future  health  care  delivery  models, medical device development, professional  networking and educational tools for patients and   260   Virtual Worlds and Health  up, with the MMDL team confident of replicat- ing the medical device study results cited above  in regard to learning outcomes. Another related  project underway involves a scenario designed  to train health professionals in gaining informed  consent from individuals with a learning disabil- ity. The ‘Pathways for Consent’ project, although  quite different to assessing medical needs, uses the  same delivery medium and is essentially identical  in that the highly configurable nature of objects  in Second Life means that a unique simulation  experience is generated.  CLINICAL WORKFLOW MODELING  Unlike  clinical  simulation,  which  tends  to  be  focused on individual outcomes, clinical model- ing primarily involves processes and workflow.  The ability to create content in virtual worlds that  replicates the physical world provides a number  of opportunities for those looking at improving  how  medical  facilities  work,  whether  they  be  hospitals, ambulances or community health cen- tres. Thompson and Hagstrom  2008  provide a  useful summary of the link between smart objects,  health care and virtual worlds. The key benefit is  the ability to test the interaction of smart objects  such as Radio Frequency Identification  RFID   tagged devices with the wider facility environment  to determine both the benefits and challenges of  that interaction. Using a hospital as an example,  smart objects may be the medical devices that  adjust their behaviour based on biometric data,  the lighting system that ranges from low light to  operating theatre quality depending on the number  of staff present in the room, or an orthopaedic chair  that communicates with each patient’s RFID tag  and adjusts its position based on clinical need. The  modeling of these devices within the virtual world  allows for the identification of issues and prioritisa- tion of improvements. As Eguchi and Thompson   2010  state: “the smart object interface protocols  we develop can be platform-agnostic, so they can   operate either in the real or virtual world”. This is  the critical point for clinical modeling in virtual  worlds: direct interoperability with the physical  one. Once that has been achieved, a major bar- rier to widespread acceptance amongst the health  professions is potentially overcome – the concern  over applicability to everyday practice.  Stroulia et al  2009  illustrate the close inter- action between the virtual and physical worlds  with their Smart Condo project. It provides for  assisted  living  at  home  through  the  extensive  use  of  sensors  to  support  a  range  of  medical  and  daily  living  needs,  with  the  data  gathered  visualised within Second Life. Once again there  is an opportunity to use physical world trends,  in this case home-based care as a cost-effective  alternative to traditional care options, to promote  the effectiveness of virtual worlds in healthcare  delivery – in this case to visualise clinical data.  To state the case even more emphatically: there  is finally the potential to build a useful clinical  picture of an individual’s management of their  health and related activities of daily living, in their  own  home,  with  its  implications  for  improved  management including the crucial psychosocial  aspects of health.  Although  the  work  on  clinical  modeling  in  virtual  worlds  is  at  a  formative  stage,  it  does  provide an opportunity to increase awareness of  its usefulness amongst populations of people who  may not otherwise have realised its application.  The  work  on  smart  objects  and  assisted  living  gives virtual worlds a direct influence on activities  of daily living for elderly people, or others with  multiple co-morbidities including chronic disease.  This not only involves their use as test-beds for  physical world implementation, but includes their  use as data visualisation tools for health profes- sionals involved in case coordination of numerous  individuals with varied health issues. The data  visualization aspect also potentially provides the  opportunity for a health professional to replicate a  complex in-home model for a different individual  with similar needs, saving time and money com-  261   Figure 2. An avatar patient for assessment  Virtual Worlds and Health  pared to starting over for each person. Once this  level of adoption has occurred, virtual worlds will  be no stranger a concept than personal medical  alarms are currently.  VIRTUAL WORLDS RESEARCH  AND HEALTH OUTCOMES  Intrinsic  to  the  progression  of  any  field  is  the  ability to bridge the divide between research and  practice. The driving force for the health profes- sions is improving the health of individuals and  the  communities  they  reside  in,  so  given  the  relatively short existence of 3D virtual worlds,  the real health outcomes being demonstrated are  encouraging. Two broad categories encapsulate the  work completed to date: studies comparing virtual  worlds  to  other  modalities,  and  virtual  worlds  specific research, with the latter the focus of this  discussion. The unique attributes of the virtual  world environment provides both opportunities  and  challenges  for  the  researcher,  particularly  around issues of consent, confirming identity and  scheduling follow-up where required. The focus of  a lot of research undertaken within virtual worlds   262  has fallen into two areas: ethnographic studies of  behaviour, or measurement of impact on actual  health  mental or physical .  Ethnographic Studies  Virtual worlds by their nature offer a different  level of interaction between individuals and groups  compared to either physical world interactions or  non-3D online interactions. Ethnographic studies  of virtual worlds populations have occurred for  well over a decade, a notable example being the  detailed study of a multi-user dimension  MUD   written by Cherny  1999 . A striking recent ex- ample is a study by Portnoy et al  2010 , which  investigated the degree to which virtual environ- ments  could  indicate  propensity  to  engage  in  risky interpersonal behaviours, even though the  ramifications  of  virtually  exhibiting  those  be- haviours is essentially non-existent. As has been  demonstrated in a range of contexts across virtual  worlds research, the results showed that the sense  of  presence  generated  for  the  participants  was  significant enough to perceive interpersonal risk  in the absence of actual negative consequences.   Virtual Worlds and Health  Sexuality  and  sexual  health  have  been  one  of  the  more  dominant  aspects  of  ethnographic  research undertaken to date, and this is an area  that has obvious connotations for the health sector.  Boellstorf  2008 , in his extensive anthropological  investigation of Second Life, devotes a significant  amount of time to the issues of intimacy, friend- ship and sexuality. Not surprisingly there were  a range of views expressed to the author during  his  fieldwork,  but  the  common  and  somewhat  unsurprising theme is that to a large degree, the  behaviours  exhibited  in  virtual  worlds  either  are a reflection of, or a reaction to, their physi- cal world iterations. To a large extent this is the  central value of health research in virtual worlds:  the ability to engage with people who are using  virtual worlds to express themselves more openly  than they otherwise would have. This can lead to  the identification of strategies to improve health  outcomes, delivered within virtual worlds, in more  traditional  health  contexts,  or  in  both  environ- ments. The real power of ethnographic research  for the health professions is reinforcing the fact  that virtual worlds are not a technological aspect  to be factored in – they are just another extension  of human expression that needs to be considered  in a holistic approach to health.  Health Impacts  One of the larger bodies of evidence that demon- strates the impact of virtuality on health, is research  into the use of virtual reality to ameliorate the ef- fects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD .  One  of  the  more  recent  studies  by Wood  et  al   2010  involved the use of virtual reality tools in  treating 30 military personnel over 350 sessions,  with  the  results  confirming  the  use  of  Virtual  Reality Exposure Therapy as an effective and safe  intervention. Rizzo et al  2009  investigated the use  of the ‘Virtual Iraq   Afghanistan’ PTSD Therapy  Application on 20 personnel and found that 16 no  longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD after  treatment. During 2010, the United States’ Defense   Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA   announced a funding opportunity to develop its  ‘Healing Heroes’ program, which is to provide  comprehensive telehealth support to its active and  veteran military personnel who have experienced  PTSD, traumatic brain injury or major depressive  episodes. The first layer of the support requested  for  development  is  “avatar-based  simulation,  virtual environments, serious games, web comics,  and other forms of ‘new media’”  DARPA, 2010 . The research to date on PTSD and virtual envi- ronments illustrates to a large extent the roadmap  for virtual worlds development in coming years.  The military-level work in this area involves more  than just visual and auditory immersion – the use  of  smells,  sensations  and  temperature  are  also  utilised, as are a range of mechanisms such as  meditation, visualisation techniques and physi- ological  monitoring.  Translated  to  the  broader  community,  these  more  intensive  immersive  techniques  are  already  being  utilized.  Gaming  consoles like the Nintendo Wii have provided a  lot of momentum in regard to promulgating the  concept of haptic interfaces, with research sup- porting the use of virtual reality as an adjunct to  other treatments. With the technology now at a  consumer level, it is allowing more widespread  analysis of its efficacy. Using virtual reality for  individuals who have had a stroke has led to more  effective rehabilitation  Merians et al, 2002; Kim  et al 2008 . A subsequent study using the Nintendo  Wii has also demonstrated positive rehabilitation  outcomes  Saposnik et al, 2010 . Other platforms  such as the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox  have recently followed suit with location aware  controllers or motion detection, further cementing  the approach in the wider community.  A final area of significant momentum in virtual  worlds health research, is on the link between an  individual’s physical world health behaviours and  those of the avatar they control. The link between  the size, shape and physical activity behaviours is  a focus of interest for its potential application to  preventative health measures in a society where   263   Virtual Worlds and Health  OpenSim worlds, there remains a raft of difficul- ties. A more formalised dialogue needs to be estab- lished, with the aim of maximising interoperability  between all virtual environments. There is some  significant momentum toward web-based virtual  worlds and this may be the foundation of interoper- ability efforts, but the ideal outcome would be an  outcome-driven interoperability framework rather  than one driven by technology considerations only.  Any such developments should include input by  educators and health professionals.  Agreement on Standards for  Simulation in Virtual Worlds  The research literature on the use of simulation in  the health professions points to the need for agree- ment on simulation standards to ensure maximum  quality of simulation but also to provide the basis  on  which  more  significant,  replicable  research  can  be  undertaken.  Development  of  standards  would require an inter-disciplinary body, which  would seek input from each profession on needs  idiosyncratic to that profession. The scale of such  an undertaking would best be integrated into cur- rent professional peak body structures – although  the current level of awareness of virtual worlds  issues makes this a longer-term proposition. In the  meantime, key innovators in the field collaborat- ing on standardisation would provide the impetus  for the work required.  Central Directory of Places for  Professional Information Sharing  The current body of health information existing  within virtual worlds is highly fragmented, and due  to the well-developed virtual worlds being 3D, data  is difficult to search for in the traditional sense.  The vacuum has been filled to date by informal  efforts around Wikis and other knowledge-bases.  There remains a need for a peer-refereed repository  of information on virtual worlds and health. The  ability to achieve this will hinge on the broader   gaming and sedentary pursuits have continued to  grow. A study by Dean et el  2009  utilized ‘heavy’  and  ‘thin’  avatars  in  Second  Life  to  interview  respondents on their physical activity and weight.  The published findings involve only 29 respon- dents and the authors emphasise the findings as  preliminary, but they warrant discussion for the  trends they flag. The first outcome was support  for the hypothesis that those engaging in physi- cal activities in Second Life were more likely to  engage in physical world exercise. Second, those  who had thin avatars reported a lower average  Body Mass Index than those with larger avatar  sizes. Finally, those who were interviewed by a  researcher with a thin avatar were nearly twice as  likely  64.3% versus 33.3%  to report that they  believed their avatar to be also thin. The respon- dents interviewed by the heavy avatar were nearly  twice as likely to report that they didn’t believe  their physical world weight and size to be ‘about  right’ compared to those interviewed by the thin  avatar   66.7%  versus  35.7% .  These  findings,  when expanded upon with further research, are  likely  to  be  pivotal  in  regard  to  the  design  of  health interventions within virtual environments.  SOLUTIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  The  claim  is  repeatedly  made  in  this  chapter  that  virtual  worlds  provide  a  useful  option  for  the health professions, albeit at an early stage of  development. For the adoption of these environ- ments to become widespread and intrinsic to both  education and clinical practice, it is proposed that  the following steps need to occur:  Interoperability  The current state of play with interoperability be- tween virtual worlds is mixed. Although OpenSim  and  Second  Life  have  commonalities,  and  the  hypergrid protocol allows for movement between   264   Virtual Worlds and Health  issue of acceptance of virtual worlds as a key tool  for the health professions, as only then will there  be a ‘specialty’ that resources can be devoted to.  E-Health Standards Compliance  Critical to the evolution of virtual worlds as a health  intervention will be their articulation with emerg- ing e-health standards. The Health Level Seven   HL7  protocols have been under development for  many years, and user interfaces are a core com- ponent  Health Level Seven International, 2010 .  Ensuring that future virtual worlds development  is cognisant of HL7 standards is the key part of  the equation – the standards themselves are broad  enough to easily accommodate the needs of new  virtual worlds applications.  Further Development of Expertise  in Data Visualisation Within  the Health Professions  With few exceptions, a disconnect exists between  those developing virtual worlds and interpreting  their data, and the health professions. With the  burgeoning  growth  in  online  health  initiatives,  there needs to be a greater emphasis on capability  development in data visualisation within the health  field. This has obviously already occurred with the  growth in health informatics as a specialty, but the  sub-specialty of analysing the data gleaned from  virtual worlds interventions and its relationship  to real world outcomes, is at best in its infancy.  An Agreed Research Agenda  for the Health Professions  As  has  been  demonstrated  in  this  discussion,  there remains an enormous amount of work to  be  done  to  establish  the  empirical  framework  for the use of virtual worlds in health. Like any  research endeavour, it needs to be driven by the  key decision-makers within each respective field.  In most cases these are the educators and senior   clinicians who determine both research and educa- tion priorities. Without a collaborative dialogue,  the risk of unwanted replication of research in  some areas, lack of replication in others and no  research activity in key areas remains a high risk.  The  growing  interest  in  translational  research  provides some promise here, as the professions  look to take advantage of the linking opportunities  such an approach engenders.  FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  The scope for future research in regard to virtual  worlds  and  health  is  enormous.  The  nature  of  virtual worlds has provided some challenges for re- searchers attempting to apply traditional research  techniques, but adaptation has certainly occurred  and will continue to evolve. A key component of  future research will be the establishment of agreed  approaches to data collection in virtual worlds  where  establishing  identity  can  be  challenging  and where protecting privacy rightly remains a  key concern.  More specifically, it is proposed that the fol- lowing research areas warrant particular attention:  Avatars as Vehicles for  Health Behaviour Change  The research to date on the link between avatars  and physical world lifestyle change is promising.  Further in-depth quantitative studies looking at  the outcomes of virtual world health interventions  around lifestyle risk factors need to be undertaken.  This may revolve around an interactive module  offered within a virtual environment, with group  support  also  provided  in  the  same  context. To  ensure that any evidence of success is emphatic,  the  measurement  of  outcomes  should  include  objective  biometric  measurements  rather  than  reliance on self-reported data as has largely oc- curred to date.  265   Virtual Worlds and Health  or populations. The pace of technological change,  combined  with  the  shrinking  health  workforce  comparative to a growing population, means that  cost-effective options for training, collaboration  and intervention has never been more imperative.  There  is  a  respected  history  within  the  health  professions  for  clinical  simulation,  and  this  is  likely to provide the basis on which acceptance  of virtual worlds will become widespread within  the university sector. Like any initiatives adopted  academically, the ability to bridge the gap between  theory and clinical practice will be critical in the  coming decade to ensure this emerging field gains  the  attention  it  deserves. There  is  no  certainty  that virtual worlds will become central to clinical  practice. What is certain is that virtual worlds hold  enough promise to test their claims in a detailed  and rigorous way, to support the research to date  that points to their ability to gain health outcomes  not able to be achieved elsewhere. It is the unique- ness of virtual environments, combined with the  emotional power that individuals place in their  avatars, that makes a powerful case for collab- orative translational research to confirm the role  virtual worlds will play in the health professions.

Further research on the psychology and sociol- ogy of body image and therapeutic interventions  delivered in virtual worlds could provide another  tool to engage individuals who otherwise may not  seek out assistance. The efficacy of computer-brain  interfaces to directly control avatar appearance  with thoughts or emotions is a related area deserv- ing of further attention.  Decision-Making  Research  on  simulation  supporting  clinical  decision-making is well established, but decision- making more broadly needs further exploration.  Whether it is sexuality, substance use, peer interac- tion or informed consent, virtual worlds provide  a unique option that needs rigourous definition.  Creating scenarios in virtual environments that  inculcate  decision-making  skills  is  a  relatively  simple task that could deliver substantial outcomes  in a range of health-related areas, particularly in  enhancing confidence and competence in clinical  practice.  Integration  The acceptance of virtual worlds within the health  professions will require a solid evidence base that  places them within an overall framework rather  than as a standalone tool. This is already the case to  some extent, but further research that demonstrates  the successful integration of face-to-face, 2D on- line and 3D online aspects in required, whether  as a health intervention or clinical education tool.

The substances covered are tobacco, al- cohol, and illegal drugs. By definition, physical health concerns the body but there is an indisputable  physiological component to mental health  for example, vitamin D is related to depression . I suggest  that embodiment – as a distinctive characteristic of VWs when compared to other virtual spaces  e.g.:  chatrooms  - should present great potential for health professionals when considering VWs for the  design of prevention or treatment health programs. VWs free users of time and space constraints. This  further justifies the use of VWs as alternative or complementing spaces of intervention. The anonymity  of these environments reinforces this idea, as addictions that were socially acceptable just a few years  ago have become socially stigmatizing  e.g.: smoking . In the case of virtual worlds such as Second Life,  anonymity is combined with embodiment, and this compounded effect, which is anything but simple, is  particularly important for health professionals and health promotion advocates interested in exploring  the use of virtual worlds in the treatment of substance abuse.

Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  An important part of publications in the area  of Health and virtual worlds has been devoted  to Education and the use of virtual worlds for  higher education in Health. Although the impor- tance of this topic is irrefutable, this chapter is  not devoted to the use of VWs for the education  and training of professionals and students in the  field of Health in general or of addictive behavior  in particular.  Although computers can cause addiction, this  chapter is not about the so called ‘electronically- induced addictions’ such as compulsive Internet  use   including  time  spent  in  virtual  worlds ,  computer game playing, or online gambling. In  fact, it should be noted than in clinical settings,  health  professionals  are  skeptical  about  using  the  term  ‘addiction’  to  these  cases,  and  prefer  ‘process addiction’ to designate dependencies to  processes - as opposed to dependencies to sub- stances  Brenner, 1998 .  TERMINOLOGY USED  Central to this chapter are notions of two very dif- ferent disciplines: virtual worlds on one hand and  substance abuse, on the other. So, I must clarify  the terminology pertaining to both, very distinct,  fields, before proceeding any further.  The  term  ‘substance  abuse’  is  used  in  this  chapter as a synonym of a pattern of harmful use  of any substance, whether natural or chemically  prepared, for the purpose of altering one’s mood.  Drugs are the main type of substance that drive  abuse for purposes of mood alteration  Roberts  & Koob, 1997 . For purposes of this chapter, I  will consider patterns of harmful use, for mood  alteration, of alcohol, nicotine and illegal drugs. For  the  term  ‘  virtual  world’,  this  chapter  adopts Richard Bartle’s definition  2003  in his  “Designing Virtual Worlds”, which is an excellent  reference book on virtual worlds. Bartle makes  a clear distinction between real, imaginary and   CHAPTER’S ORGANIZATION AND  SCOPE  Given the centrality of the ‘body’ in VWs, sec- tion 1 focuses on embodiment by approaching  the topic under five different spotlights offered  by five different disciplines that have ‘embodi- ment’ as a key topic: Feminist and Gender Studies,  Ethics and Moral Philosophy, Psychology, Film  studies and Health.  Sections 2 offers some background information  on addictive behavior and provides a framework  for  the  study  of  addictive  behavior  related  to  substance abuse in the field of Health. Prevention  and treatment in this field make use of practices  that are evidence based. Some of these practices  include  social  support  –  such  as  face-to-face  meetings - and access to information of medical  authority. These will be summarized in that section. Section 3 discusses VW-assisted health inter- ventions for the treatment of substance abuse. For  this chapter, I am considering alcohol, tobacco  and illegal drugs. This overview, based on type  of substance abuse, underlines not only the com- monalities but also the specificities across types of  substance abuse. It does so by presenting them as  both challenges and opportunities for VW- based  health interventions, whether they are geared to  prevention or treatment.  Section 4 presents a proof-of-concept that I  have  developed  and  designed:  the  ‘biographic  space’. It is a storytelling-based space in Second  Life  SL  that explores the media richness of VWs  to represent the state of change of the user of that  space in her struggle against addiction.  These are the sections covered by this chapter. When discussing vast topics such as this one  and presenting it to a community that is not neces- sarily in the field of Health, it is equally important  to say what a chapter does not cover. Hence, in  the next paragraph, I justify why some areas are  not within the scope of the discussion.  272   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  virtual by noting that virtual is all that is not while  having the effect or form of that which is. Bartle  goes on to stress that since virtual worlds simulate  environments,  when  different  individuals  can  simultaneously affect the environment, the world  is known as being a ‘multiuser environment’; and  that the environment, however, continues to ex- ist independently of being visited   occupied by  individuals and so, and in most cases, it develops  internally regardless of visitors and occupants.  Bartle  calls  this  property  the  ‘persistence’  of  virtual worlds.  Bartle points out other features that most virtual  worlds share:  1  a physics that is particular to the  world  automated rules that allow users to impact  the world ;  2  interaction of individuals with the  environment and other users of the environment  is channeled through a character or representation  of the self;  3  feedback to actions in the world  takes place almost instantaneously. Furthermore  the word is shared and  at least to some extent   persistent.  According to this definition, a strategic war  game, for example, would not classify as virtual  world since the user is not mapped onto a single  avatar.  I would add, for further clarification, a few  more lines on self-representation in VWs, mul- tiusage and ‘game quality’ of a VW:  Self-representation - Although the term ‘virtual  world’ is used today to designate 3D virtual en- vironments, not all virtual worlds have anthropo- morphic  or even graphic  depictions of users as  avatars. The avatar is the proxy of a user operating  in a virtual 3D world. However, this proxy may  be an abstract depiction, or for instance, a sound.   Multiusage - When VWs allow for multiple us- ers and the content and engagement is similar  to those of a game, these worlds may be called  MMORPGs   massively  multiplayer  online  role  playing games .  ‘Game quality’ of a VW - There has been a lot  of discussion on whether popular VWs such as  Second Life can be called a game, let alone a  MMORPG. Whether to consider a VW a game is  largely a function of the specific context of use  and the persuasive strategies used by its creators  to keep users engaged and interacting. For pur- poses of this chapter I will not delve into those  fine distinctions. In line with Bartle’s definition,  and in this chapter, a VW will not be considered  a game unless there is a clear underlying script  or at least an objective laid out as a sequence of  actions the user must take when interacting with  the environment.  I will use ‘avatars’, ‘residents, ‘members’ or  ‘citizens’ to designate users of a VW. These terms  are not innocuous in terms of branding strategies  on behalf of the VW developers. The Linden Labs,  for example, label their Second Life members of  ‘residents’  arguably  to  promote  loyalty  among  their pool of users with a paid membership.  Finally, and in section 4, I use the term ‘self- organized  communities’  to  designate  sponta- neously  formed  groups  of  individuals  whose  reason  for  organization  and  whose  agenda  are  ‘born’ in the virtual environment and not in real  life. As opposed to federal agencies, NGOs and  corporate organizations that exist in real life and  have a presence in one or more VWs, then, self- organized communities do not have a preexisting  formal organization in real life. However, it is not  uncommon that the regularity and   or intensity of  work in the VW leads to the organization expand- ing to real life as well.  1. THE IMPORTANCE OF  EMBODIMENT IN VIRTUAL WORLDS  As mentioned in the Terminology section, though  virtual worlds are often used as a synonym of 3D  virtual worlds, not all virtual environments include   273   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  the  center  of  the  real-virtual  diode. Although  this is central to VWs- assisted health interven- tions, this introduces a series of considerations,  not  the  least  of  which  being  the  continuation  of gender and race discrimination in the virtual  world. Furthermore, the proxy representation is  synonym with over-simplification and reduction,  which promotes traditional stereotypes.  Ethics and Moral Philosophy  Philosophers including those in the field of Ethics  and Moral discuss embodiment in cyberspace - or  cyborgisation - as the undermining of the power  of the body by the Internet. However, more re- cently. prominent scholars in this field argue for  the importance of reclaiming this body agency,  which  they  see  as  an  anchor  for  values.  Steve  Matthews  2008  notes that “if IT affects the way  others see me, especially in virtue of the ways it  alerts various modes of social communication,  then it will come to affect the way I see myself”.   144  The use of prosthetic enhancement along  the lines of Stelarc’s work has been the subject  of heated discussion in the realm of Ethics. One  school  of  thought  is  the  transhumanist  school,  which defends prosthetics on the basis of its power  to surpass human limitations  from Newtonian  limits like speed to more human limitations such  as  health  deterioration  and  age .  Opponents  to  transhumanism describe what they believe to be  biases propelling the development and acceptance  of such technologies. Namely, non- transhumanists  see a bias towards functionality and efficiency  that, they claim, may compel assent to a view of  human people de-emphasizing what they consider  to be humanity’s and personhood’s defining char- acteristics, in favor of a different sort of ‘values’:  upgrades, versions, and utility.  Psychology  A  number  of  scholars  have  been  looking  at  to  what extent can findings of social interaction in   a user representation in the form of an avatar. The  embodiment may be achieved in other more subtle  and abstract ways, such as a proxy: a visual  or  aural  minimal   abstract representation that simply  signals tele-presence. Often, that representation is,  however, a full avatar  a visual representation of  the self , built according to the sophistication and  customization allowed by specific virtual world  considered. I believe this is important to clarify  as ‘embodiment’ is, as I defend elsewhere  Boa- Ventura & Saboga-Nunes, 2010 , an important  quality of digital environments used in Health in  general, and in the treatment of addictive behaviors  related to substance abuse in particular.  Having  an  avatar  representation  in  a  world  such as Second Life means that I can coincide  in space and time with other people who are also  embodied through their avatars in the same space  and time that I am visiting. This opens up interest- ing discussion on the feeling of community, as it  relates to the treatment of substance abuse and I  will discuss it after summarizing next a number  of methodological approaches to the body.  Feminist and Gender Studies  Feminist and gender studies have played a key  role in emphasizing the role of embodiment in  cyberspace  Haraway, 1994 . Indeed, feminist  theory is particularly well suited to discuss and  understand embodiment  Meynell, 2009 . I think  this credit is due because, like Sherry Turkle and  Char Davies, I believe that the body occupies a  central position in VWs… a position that, I add,  must  be  taken  seriously  in  any  VW-mediated  health  intervention.  The  reputed  invisibility  online as well as what Hansen called the “de- coupling identity from any analogical relation to  the visible body”  Hansen, 2006: 145  deserves  some justified skepticism today, especially when  taken as one step towards an idealized race and  gender  neutral  ‘environment’.  Increasingly  graphic,  with  high  audio  and  video  quality,  today’s virtual worlds put embodiment back in   274   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  the read world propagate to virtual worlds, given  the virtual representation of the self  through an  avatar .  Gaze,  attractiveness  and  interpersonal  distance are some of the attributes that have been  studied in virtual worlds with the aim of compar- ing how they play out in virtual settings, when  compared to real world.  Yee and Bailenson  2007  used de-individual- ization and self- perception theory  Bem, 1972 , to  conduct a study where they concluded that virtual  reality users may adjust their identity to that of  their avatars rather than the more expected op- posite phenomenon. This is known as the Proteus  effect. The same authors note that “ in line with  self-perception theory, [users in online environ- ments] conform to the behavior that they believe  others would expect them to have”  p. 274 . In  their study avatar’s height and attractiveness were  the two physical features of the avatar  features  of the virtual embodiment  relevant in the study.  Overall, more attractive avatars, as well as  on a  separate study  taller avatars positively affected  other  avatars’  trust  and  willingness  to  become  intimate.  This  is  line  with  studies  in  classical  psychology on attractiveness  see, for instance  Dion,  Berscheid,  & Walster,  1972 .  In  Proteus  Effect research, avatars’ interactions with other  avatars  are  influenced  by  their  own  and  other  avatars’  physical  characteristics   Dean,  Cook,  Keating & Murphy, 2009 .  Fox and Bailenson  2009  found that humans’  real world behavior is influenced by their own self- representing avatars’ behavior. In their experiment,  participants who watched their self-representing  avatars   which  were  designed  to  mimic  to  an  extent their real physical characteristics  being  physically active  such as running on a treadmill   were more prone to engage in exercise in the next  24 hours than those participants who watched an  avatar doing nothing or a non self-representing  avatar doing exercise.  In particular, Bailenson et al  2003  concluded  that in their experiment on behavioral and emo- tional  reactions  to  an  avatar’s  personal  space   invasion and body space “participants exhibited  patterns of interpersonal distance behavior with  respect to virtual humans similar to that which  decades  of  research  using  actual  humans  have  demonstrated”  831   In a way, these studies in Psychology – notably  those  conducted  by Yee  and  Bailenson   2007   and Bailenson et al  2003  - are at the basis of  any validation of health interventions in Second  Life as they report conclusions of experiments  that  suggest  that  healthy  behaviors  evidenced  by avatars in virtual worlds may affect healthy  behaviors in real life.  Film Studies  Several film theorists have discussed Dziga Ver- tov’s kino-eye in light of current virtual worlds.  Landay, for example contextualizes this new vir- tual kino-eye within well grounded film theories  of gaze and spectatorship such as Christian Metz,  Anne Friedberg and Vivian Sobchack  Landay,  2009 . Among the insights brought by these theo- rists, one is particularly relevant to a discussion  of  VWs  and  embodiment:  Francesco  Casetti’s  idea that cinema at the cutting edge  like IMAX  or 2001 Space Odyssey  relates not to ‘more than  movies’  as IMAX theaters advertise themselves   but rather to the return to the real drive of ‘going  to the movies’, whereby the apparatus acts like a  “snare ready to capture whoever enters its radius of  activity”  Casetti, 1998:8-9 . Different VWs allow  for different default camera positions. VWs may  offer different gazes, depending on the number  of camera views allowed in world. For example,  in SL the default camera view is positioned from  behind the avatar’s head while in other VWs, the  default view maybe a bird’s eye view of the avatar  or its front view.  Health  In  the  field  of  Health,  ‘embodiment’  in  online  environments  is  arguably  a  problem  of  trust   275   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  2. FUNDAMENTALS OF SUBSTANCE  ABUSE AND ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR  The Brain’s Reward Circuit and  Substance Use and Abuse  The use of certain substances – such as nicotine,  alcohol and illegal drugs such as marijuana – often  leads to addiction and psychological dependency.  This is, in fact, what justifies the change from  substance use to substance abuse. The use becomes  abuse because drugs increase the concentration of  dopamine in the brain’s reward circuit. This reward  circuit ultimately aims at survival. Dopamine is the  chemical involved with sex drive and satisfying  hunger  Kelley, 2002 .  When one craves for a specific food and one  finally consumes it, there is a feeling of pleasure,  which  is  channeled  via  a  surge  of  dopamine.  Substances like nicotine and heroin entail an ab- normal surge of dopamine and because the brain  remembers that surge, it wants to experience it  again, and again  and yet again .  In his or her attempts to quit tobacco, there is,  in the smokers’ brain, a battle between the limbic  system  primitive brain  and the part of the brain  that controls rational thought.  To increase the problem, abnormal surges of  dopamine  change  the  way  in  which  dopamine  receptors normally work. By becoming less recep- tive to the effects of the body’s natural dopamine,  the  ability  to  experience  pleasure  decreases.  Use  therefore  may  become  abuse.  This  is  the  nature of the cycle of addiction – a body that is  de-sensitized to normal levels of dopamine and  needs ever-increasing exposure to drugs  whether  smoking, drinking or shooting intravenous drugs   to experience the same amount of pleasure that  in  the  beginning  of  the  process,  a  single  ciga- rette, glass of alcohol or injection would impart   Volkow, 2009 .  reputation. If one cannot meet the medical care  or  health  information  provider  face-to-face  or,  worse, if these specialists are embodied in what  seem to be little more than on-screen animated  cartoons, can one trust the medical authority of  the information received? In the specific case of  mental health embodiment as in a having agency  over a representation of my real body may be an  empowering  process.  Many  have  reported  on  the liberating effect of the use of Second Life by  physically impaired individuals. Many scholars in  the field see empowerment as a goal for therapy   Tomm,  1987;  Anderson  &  Goolishian,  1988;  Gergen, 1994 .  However, the idea of accessing an environment  that allows for the embodiment of both patients  and care provider   health professional   health  information provider is complicated by regula- tions such as HIPA  Health Information Privacy  Protection Act  in the US. These regulations need  to be in place to ensure that personal medical in- formation is not accessed by others  or, in the case  where there is an unintentional public disclosure,  that release of information is not sanctioned by  universities or federal agencies .  The article ‘Does this avatar make me look  fat?’  Dean et al, 2009  was a groundbreaking  study conducted by a team of the NGO ‘RTI In- ternational’  based at the Triangle Research Park,  North  Carolina   on  the  impact  that  the  virtual  representation of the self - the avatar – has on  the real self. These findings - along with those  of earlier studies in Psychology mentioned above   Bailenson et al, 2005; 2007; Fox & Bailenson,  2009   may  have  a  tremendous  impact  in  the  analysis of VWs potential in behavioral change,  as they suggest that by reaching virtual patients   avatars , health interventions can actually lead  to  behavioral  change  in  the  real  life  patients     individuals.  276   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  Factors with Positive Impact  in Traditional  not Computer- Supported  Interventions for the  Treatment of Addictive Behavior  on the Basis of Substance Abuse  A number of randomized clinical trials  RCTs   have shown that Internet-based treatment is as  effective  as  face-to-face  treatment   and  more  effective than no-treatment . However, research  has focused more on anxiety and mood disorders,   burn-out, panic, depression, headache, insomnia   than substance abuse  where obesity seems to be  the  most  common  type  of  behavioral  disorder  studied . In this section I will cover those factors  that health professionals have been integrating  in the design of interventions for the treatment  of  substance  abuse,  in  traditional  settings   in  other words: in non-computing settings . In fact,  a number of factors may positively impact treat- ment by hindering the development of substance  abuse. The impact of these factors may vary with  age group, gender and type of care  e.g.: managed  cared – individuals who are appointed by the court  of law to enlist a rehabilitation program - as op- posed to self-appointed care .  Social Support  Studies  on  the  impact  of  social  support  in  the  treatment of substance abuse present mixed re- sults. That impact may vary with factors such as  gender and age. For instance, Richter, Brown &  Mott  1991  conducted a longitudinal study to  understand how social support affected the out- come following adolescent chemical dependency  treatment.  They  concluded  that  social  support  was in fact important and that self-esteem was  also  a  key  post-treatment  factor.  Other  studies  have examined how general social support during  adolescence  provide  a  significant  amelioration  of all seven young-adult problem areas: health  problems, psychosomatic symptoms, emotional  distress, interpersonal relationships, family prob-  lems,  loneliness  in  romantic  relationships,  and  self-derogation  Newcomb & Bentler, 1988 . In  a  different  study  aimed  at  a  higher  age  group,  and specifically on tobacco, results were mixed  regarding the dyadic efficacy in partnered smokers  indicating that partners’ mutual support does not  necessarily translate in higher quit rates  Sterba,  Rabius, Villars, Wiatrek & McAllister, 2010 .  Behavioral Counseling  There seems to be more of an agreement on the  impact of this factor than on social support. Access  to behavioral counseling, which includes access  to information and resources such as telephone  counseling and self-help materials, has a positive  impact in overcoming addiction to alcohol, nico- tine and illegal drugs  Whitlock, Polen, Green,  Orleans & Klein, 2008 .  Access to Information  While access to information can be part of behav- ioral counseling, it has a value on its own. Hav- ing access to information in the local hospitals r  community centers positively impacts treatment  of substance abuse  V. Rabius, personal commu- nication, September 4, 2010 .  Screening at Intake  Studies suggest that a large number of individuals  who are admitted to treatment of substance abuse  do not return to begin the program. The specific  case of managed care has deserved studies in this  area and they show that there seem to be differ- ences associated  with the type of  dependency:  individuals  dependent  on  alcohol  only  have  a  higher probability of retuning to initiate treatment  than those who are drug-dependent. Screening at  intake has been employed to assess each individual  context  work-place pressures as well as the pa- tient’s perception of the importance of treatment   and to that extent be a good indicator of prevision   277   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  the world, which help address health disparities  in low income households. Unfortunately virtual  worlds  are  resource  intensive  and  to  this  date,  worlds such as Second Life still impose certain  hardware  specifications  that   still   translate  to  computer equipment at a cost that not anyone can  afford  fast processors, up-to-date video cards .  Furthermore, most worlds also require fast Internet  connections and often, a monthly membership fee.  All this means that the population that has access  to the right equipment and the right Internet speed  to interact with virtual worlds is not the same that  is considered - in the US and in many other coun- tries - as the priority population where to focus.  Learning Curve  Having enough skills in Second Life to navigate   walk, fl, communicate through voice, text and  body gesture  follows a steep learning curve, which  can be ruthless in the case of groups that have  not been exposed to VWs. Furthermore, solving  technological problems  may  get  in  the  way  of  addressing the real, addiction, problems. Many  scholars  have  noted  this  problem  which  is  not  particular to the study of addiction but that may  permeate other areas  See, for example on a study  about self-esteem among a Second Life inWorld  group of women with disabilities, Nosek, Whelen,  Hughes, Porcher, Davidson & Nosek, 2010 .  Demographic Bias  The compounded effect of the two previous items-  inclusiveness  and  learning  curve  –  inexorably  lead to a demographic bias, which is at odds with  the ethical  and arguably utopian  principle that  everyone should have the same access to health  resources.  I  consider  it  as  an  independent  fac- tor hindering the wide adoption of VWs in the  treatment  of  substance  abuse  as  there  may  be  many other factors  whose impact has not been  sufficiently studied  such as age, average annual  income and prior exposure to games, leading to   to starting treatment  Weisner, Mertens, Tam &  Moore, 2001 .  The screening at intake may also include the  measurement of the addict’s self-efficacy, a term  coined by Albert Bandura  1997  to signify one’s  confidence in quitting the addictive behavior  in  the context of this chapter that behavior is smoking,  alcohol drinking and the intake of illegal drugs .  3. VW-ASSISTED HEALTH  INTERVENTIONS FOR  THE TREATMENT OF  SUBSTANCE ABUSE  Factors Hindering the Generalized,  Systematic Use of VWs in a Near  Future in Health Interventions for  the Treatment of Substance Abuse  Inclusiveness  Those of us who were early adopters of virtual  worlds  may  feel  compelled  to  see  in  them  the  ultimate  panacea.  However,  users  of  virtual  worlds are still a minority of the world popula- tion due to a number of factors not the least of  which being how resource- demanding VWs are  on the machines that run them. The number of  VW users was estimated at .3% in 2008 and has  been estimated as being 80% of active Internet  users in 2011  Gartner Inc, 2007 . However, it  is reasonable to believe that those who have the  easiest and fastest access to VWs are not the gross  of the priority target population in most national  healthcare programs, and will not be so for several  decades to come. This is a real hindrance when  considering any health intervention program. As  a case in point, MedicAid is a large program in  the  US  to  provide  medical  care  to  households  that  would  otherwise  have  trouble  accessing  that aid  U.S. Department of Health & Human  Services – Center for Medicare and MedicAid  Services, 2009 . Similar programs exist all over   278   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  a demographic bias in the use of VWs for the  treatment of substance abuse.  Then  IM  Spike  Willard  to  request  a  schedule  weekly meeting.  Metrics  That’s it. Job done.”  While VWs allow for the quantification of param- eters that may be pertinent in VW- assisted health  interventions, there are problems of human subject  consent that can be more complex than in more  traditional  research  settings.  Furthermore,  and  though the interaction with the environment can  be measured, some parameters may require costly  and or complex instruments of measurement that  the health professional may not be equipped to  tackle. An example is the systematic measure- ment of interpersonal distances among a support  group, which is nothing but a simple parameter  to measure in a world such as SL.  Researchers are concerned over the lack of  access  to  good,  manageable,  quantitative  and  qualitative data, especially if that access is further  complicated by the proprietary nature of the VW  at hand.  Virtual Worlds with a Representation  in Health Interventions  Virtual worlds that have been studied in relation  to their potential in health issues include Second  Life, Kaneva, There and IMVU  Norris, 2009 .  In addition, given the popularity of Second Life,  studies conducted in this environment tackle a  wide  range  of  areas  and  methodologies.  Good  examples of this diversity of approaches are the  celebration of The Worlds Aid’s Day at Karuna’s  island on December first, and the pursuit of AA  meetings at many SL sims. This is how a recovered  alcoholic describes how anyone can seek help in  the form of an AA support group in SL:  “To set up a 12 step meeting.  Figure out a weekly time that suits you.  Of all VWs, Second Life is probably the best  known. It claims 14 million registered accounts  and  many  islands  that  have  been  occupied  by  colleges  and  universities,  federal  agencies  and  corporations. The average age of a Second Life  resident is 35 and edges upward, showing the same  demographics trend as Facebook and MySpace. What  virtual  worlds  have  of  unique  is  that  they offer health professionals, practitioners and  psychologists alike, an environment that allows  the modeling of health behaviors in a way that  can be highly immersive and reactive  because  it reacts to actions in the environment .  Virtual Reality: Focus on  Perceptual Tricking and Impact  on Health Interventions  I will open this section by addressing not a virtual  world per se but a technology that is  or may be   at the basis of virtual environments – Virtual Real- ity  VR . I say “may” because as Alan Craig and  other experts in the field have stressed, there is no  virtual reality in Second Life and similar VWs.  The latter have evolved independently of the first,  cumbersome,  virtual  reality  simulators.  Rather  than acting on the perceptual system to trick it into  experiencing an environment through immersion,  they convey that immersive experience through  mentally and emotionally engaging content.  Virtual  reality  has  been  used  in  behavioral  change notably for the treatment of phobias from  the first groundbreaking report demonstrating the  efficacy of immersive computer-generated virtual  reality  VR  and mixed reality for the treatment  of arachnophobia  Carlin, Hoffman & Weghorst,  1997   to  more  recent  studies  on  virtual  reality  exposure for the treatment of post-traumatic stress  disorders  experiences  such  as  those  following   279   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  as the fear of driving following a motor vehicle  accident  Walshe et al, 2003   4. PROOF-OF CONCEPT:  ‘BIOGRAPHIC SPACE’, A  STORYTELLING-BASED  WATI  WEB-ASSISTED  TOBACCO INTERVENTION   USING SECOND LIFE  I am proposing a model that I call ‘biographic  space’, which embeds the successive stages that  a smoker may go through during the attempt to  quit smoking. I consider the type of intervention  that this proof-of-concept as part of the WATIs  since these can be defined as any web assisted  health interventions for the treatment of tobacco  and nicotine dependency.  The stages referred above, and embedded in  the  model  include  emotionally  loaded  aspects  such as deciding to quit and post cessation with- drawal. The design of this space is informed by  storytelling, a topic of my practice research, and  explores the so called ‘rich media’ affordances of  virtual environments as well as the possibility of  integration  or mashing  different media in and  with Second Life.  These ‘biographic spaces’ are spaces in Second  Life  though there is no reason why they could  not be implemented in other VWs , that can be  explored by smokers anytime   anywhere internet  access is available, and provide information to  assist smokers wanting to quit. The information  acquired  that  way  is  media-rich  and  addresses  primarily the emotional component of the quit- ting process.  The space will enable the visitor to experience  the successive stages of the quitting process by  telling the life of a fictional character through the  architectural space and the objects in that space. I  am modeling these stages based on Prochaska and  DiClemente’s Stages of Change Model  1982 .  The stages are pre-contemplation, contemplation,   9 11  e.g.: Freedman, Hoffman, Garcia-Palacios,  Weiss, Avitzour & Josman, 2010   Virtual reality has been most used in health  interventions aiming at the treatment of phobias.  However, the fact that VR immersion is achieved  through the compounded effect of computer graph- ics and peripheral devices allows a richness of input  channels and consequently great potential to study  combined stimuli in substance abuse  Rothbaum,  Hodges, Ready, Graap, & Alarcon, 2001 .  One particularly important area has been drug  craving  research   Bordnick  et  al,  2004 .  The  analysis  of  drug  triggers  and  stimuli is  known  as ‘cue reactivity’. One caveat of traditional cue  reactivity techniques is the lack of standardiza- tion. Techniques using VR cue reactivity extend  previous research by offering a controlled setting  for the analysis of reactions to drug cues.  In sum, virtual reality allows to explore cue  exposure methods since exposure to stimuli VR is  computer-controlled. Hence, health interventions  using VR in the field of substance abuse have  proved particularly helpful in craving research as  assessments of reactivity to stimuli can be done  in real time, as opposed to traditional settings.  Virtual  reality  interventions  making  use  of  virtual reality have proved effective in a number  of RCTs for certain phobias. The limited type of  psychosomatic problems that computers in gen- eral and virtual reality environments in particular  have covered leads many sociologists to rule out  large-scale use of computers for therapy and as- sessment in the near future  Emmelkamp, 2005  Virtual reality has been used in the facilitation  of emotional processing in the treatment of dif- ferent disorders such as phobias  Rothbaum et al,  1995 , complicated grief  Botella et al, 2008  and  fear of flying  Rothbaum et al, 2000 . In many  cases there is some type of script or at least an  activity that the patient should perform. To this  extent, some of the applications using virtual re- ality in exposure therapy explore also computer  games. This fusion of games and virtual reality  has been used in the treatment of disorders such   280   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  Figure 1.  preparation, action and maintenance, and relapses  may send the individual back to the contemplation  stage  See Figure 1 .  The  visitor’s  state  in  the  transtheoretical  model is assessed through a survey that assigns  her a stage. The house  intimate space  inhabited  by the fictional character has a series of personal  records and memories that reflect the stage iden- tified for the user as a result of the answers to the  survey. Under a narrative theory framework, this  ‘biographic space’ is a diegetic one, insofar as  situations and events are recounted, but has some  mimetic aspects, to the extent that the space is  ‘experienced’ in the first person, and thought this  first person experience in channeled through an  avatar.  The user can access the biographic space at any  time and engage the life of the fictional character   at the very user’s own stage of behavioral change   including relapse   See Figure 2 . The scripted  environment conveys the fictional character’s life  during his her attempt to quit smoking through  voice, written text, still images and movie clips  – all of these media channels document the emo- tional stages experienced during a typical attempt  to quit smoking.  For the concept of this storytelling model I  strongly  inspired  by  the  first  computer  game  blockbuster: Myst. In it, the technological restric- tions at the time were partially responsible for a  whimsical environment, where characters were  not  represented  per  se,  but  through  objects  evocative of their personalities and actions  Cyan,  1993 .  The  proof-of-concept  explores  two  features  of Second Life that I deem key to the support   281   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  Figure 2.  282   Virtual Worlds and Behavioral Change  of addictive behavior change – the ‘anywhere    anytime’ support and media richness.  Users register to enter the space. The registra- tion originates unique IDs so that users’ interac- tions with objects, and number   duration of visits  can be recorded using tools for metrics available  in SL. The state of change according to the trans- theoretical model, which was determined by the  staging algorithm is recorded for each user and  later part of a triangulation process.  CONCLUSION  In this chapter I have provided an overview of  existing VWs assisted interventions for behavioral  change associated with three types of addictive  substances: tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs. The  examples shown illustrate the potential that VWs  have in the fighting addictions that are socially  damaging, by offering an anonymous platform  for  meetings,  especially  important  in  the  case  of social stigma  that often accompanies addic- tions , and by offering it 24 h and arguably from  any place  work or home . I have noted that the  demographics targeted by most national Health  programs tackling socially damaging addictions  do  not  coincide  with  the  demographics  of  use  of  virtual  worlds,  and  this  disparity  increases  with the sophistication of the platform in ques- tion. To this extent, and not unlike other areas   augmented  reality  for  instance   there  seem  to  be two polarized tendencies: towards the ease of  use, and unobtrusive technology on one end and  complex, hardware intense platforms, on the other.  Geopositioning, by promoting the juxtaposition of  real and virtual spaces, may promote simplicity   small, mobile  over complexity  large, cumber- some , but there will always be a place – notably  in R&D whether led by universities or large cor- porations – for resource-demanding solutions that  will not be within the layman’s reach in any near  future. Health practitioners should engage in this  scenario in a very near future to ensure that their   voice is heard in discussion topics as important  as credibility, accountability and metrics in VW  supported health interventions for the treatment  of substance abuse.

In our research, we faced a two-sided methodological problem.  We had to theorize the virtual and its relation to the actual, while simultaneously creating practices for  an effective ethnographic method. Our solution, named after the Roman goddess of the hinge, Cardea,  theorizes the “virtual” as desubstantialized and nondualistic; “residents” as fluid, multiple, and distrib- uted cyborg-bodies; and “cloud communities” as temporary, outsourced groups of emotionally bonded  residents. These three qualities enable a classic form of ethnography based on participant observation,  which is possible on Second Life because the platform enables immersion, a prolonged time in the field,  as well as the bodily practices necessary for thick description. The Cardean method unveils online re- ligion operating as “Liquid Salvation”—which is defined by consumerism, radical individualism, and  pragmatic religious practice.  INTRODUCTION  On January 31, 2009, I logged onto the metaverse  platform  Second  Life   SL   and  teleported  to  a  Christian dance club to talk with resident Deborah  Devine.1 Deborah had only been using SL for a   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch019  few months, but she had considerable experience  in  other  3-D  and  2-D  multiuser  environments,  including World of Warcraft and email listserves.  Over the past weeks, I had been keeping in touch  with her and occasionally stopped by her virtual  jewelry shop. After a few minutes of small talk,  I asked Deborah about her Christian practice on  SL. She explained to me that SL made spending   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

Photo by Sabrina Epps   time with the Christian community easier because  “they are very visible, [and] there are scheduled  activities like Sunday services, prayer meetings,  and Bible studies.” I asked her if the online com- munity differed from that of her actual world. There  was a pause: “Where in my RL [real life] could  I go to a dance and meet people from around the  globe and listen to a French man sing and play a  mean guitar?”  Deborah  is  not  alone  in  practicing  religion  in metaverse platforms. More and more people  spend more and more of their lives online. As  the  Pew  Internet  and  American  Life  Project  notes, “cyberfaith” is the fastest growing form  of religious practice  2000-2010 . The Cardean  method analyzes religious practices on 3-D meta- verse platforms by documenting what Bronislaw  Malinowski calls the “imponderabilia of actual  life”  1961 [1922] . Imponderabilia are social phe- nomena of great importance that cannot possibly  be recorded by interviews, recording devices, or  quantitative methods, but must be interpreted in  the full actuality of their cultural context.  Ethnography is the tried and tested approach  for documenting the imponderabilia of life, virtual  or otherwise. The main objective of this chapter is  to sketch out the Cardean Ethnographic Method  and the underlying theory and practice necessary  to conduct research of religious groups on 3-D  metaverse  platforms  such  as  SL. The  Cardean  Method was formulated by The Cardean Virtual  Research Team  CVRT , which in its final form  consisted of the principal investigator, one gradu- ate, and four advanced undergraduates from the  University of North Carolina, Greensboro, and  which  conducted  research  between  September  2007 and September 2010  Figure 1 .  Our methodology was driven by three funda- mental questions.2 What is the relation between  the virtual and the actual? How can one transfer  and  adapt  traditional  ethnographic  methods,  chiefly participant observation, to the cyberspace  of  3-D  metaverse  platforms? And  last,  do  the  religious identities and communities found reflect  their virtual environment, or are they representa-  289   Finding Liquid Salvation  Third, we discuss some implications of our  findings.  On  the  broadest  level,  the  Cardean  method is necessary for the simple reason that  tens of millions of people are entering and imagin- ing new virtual worlds, yet we know little about  their everyday life. More specifically, SL offers  ideal models of “liquid salvation,” which become  observable because, as Christine Hine writes, “the  Internet and similar networks provide a naturally  occurring field site for studying what people do  when they are online unconstrained by experimen- tal design”  2000 . What residents gain in SL is a  re-enchantment that is impossible in the actual late  modern world. Max Weber infamously claimed  that we now live in an age of disenchantment—an  epoch in which rationalization and intellectualiza- tion have destroyed traditional modes of wonder  and mystery  1976 [1958] . We argue that online  religions are both a cure and a symptom for our  unpredictable, globalized consumer culture. We  theorize  these  practices  as  “Liquid  Salvation.”  Salvation can be understood as deliverance from  suffering. Liquid Salvation—which is defined by  consumerism,  radical  individualism,  and  prag- matic religious practice—defines an expression  of, and a protest against, the suffering generated  by what the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman calls  “liquid  modernity,”  the  economic  system  that  is  historically  linked  to  the  second  half  of  the  twentieth century and is defined by the fluidity  of financial capital, an intensification of the free  market, globalization, and consumerism  2000 .  BACKGROUND: THEORIZING  THE VIRTUAL, RESIDENTS,  AND CLOUD COMMUNITIES  Before we can sketch out the Cardean Method,  it is necessary to describe the theory behind our  practices. The first hurdle was to analyze the rela- tion between the real and the virtual.3 Theories of  the virtual are based on a notion of the virtual as  that which seems to be there as opposed to what   tive  of  larger  changes  taking  place  in  the  late  modern world?  Because the CVRT conducted some of the first  ethnography in Second Life, we found ourselves  facing a two-sided methodological problem. We  had to theorize our main descriptive categories  while simultaneously creating techniques for an  effective ethnographic method. In practice, these  two sides formed in a simultaneous and dialectic  fashion with the theoretical emerging from the  methodological and the methodological guided  by the theoretical. Because we are limited here  by print media, we proceed in a threefold linear  fashion.  First,  we  define  the  background  con- cepts that position our topic. These include the  “virtual,” which we define as desubstantialized  and nondualistic; “residents,” those social entities  that weave together avatars with their users and  describe the bodily sensorium determined by 3-D  metaverse platforms; and “cloud communities,”  online groups that are temporary, flexible, elastic,  and inexpensive in the social capital required to  join or to leave.  Second, as the main focus of the chapter, we  illustrate the “Cardean Ethnographic Method,” a  team-based form of participant observation that  is modeled on a hinge. As in the actual world,  there  are  three  qualities  that  make  participant  observation  possible  on  virtual  3-D  metaverse  platforms: being present, prolonged time in the  field, and thick description. Presence is the feel- ing that the landscape, buildings, and especially  the inhabitants of a world are co-present with the  user—they are there. A prolonged time in the field  is required for a valid ethnography because it al- lows the researcher to become part of a group’s  everyday routine, to inhabit the insider’s world,  and to give the research the flexibility and fluidity  it needs in order to follow alternative hypotheses  that arise during the study. Thick description is a  method for interpreting both a social practice and  the context required for that practice to become  meaningful to an outsider.  290   Finding Liquid Salvation  is actually there  Rheingold, 1991 . The virtual,  then,  in  our  current  period  usually  denotes  a  distinction  of  “almost  so.”  This  understanding  arose because the virtual is tethered to interac- tive computer systems. In other words, to more  clearly see the virtual we need to disambiguate  it from two currently intertwined concepts: “In- ternet” and “cyberspace.” The “Internet” denotes  the hardware and software that compose a global  system  of  interconnected  computer  networks.  “Cyberspace” denotes the mediated social space  created by interconnected electronic communica- tions. It differs from telecommunication, which  has a sender and a receiver, because cyberspace  occurs in a virtual social environment  Krueger,  1991 . It differs from radio and television in that  the communication is two-way, synchronous, and  interactive. Linked to the Internet, cyberspaces  enable interactive immersive environments that  put  a  user  in  contact  with  other  residents  of  digital worlds and offer new places and forms of  socialization  Rheingold, 1993 . Such worlds can  be textual—as in newsgroups, chat rooms, and  MUDs  Multi-User Dungeons —or, as in SL, they  can use computer graphics to render 3-D models. Too often, virtual worlds are described as if  they were something created whole cloth by these  digital networks. Yet, being immersed in virtual  worlds is nothing new. For instance, being im- mersed in a good novel, a film, or even a well-told  story, can be understood as a form of the virtual.  In fact, it can be argued that virtual worlds have  followed human culture from its very beginning   Fornäs, 2002 . As M. Serres and K. Sauer write  in their book, Atlas  2006 , “Imagination, memory,  knowledge and religion are the vectors of virtual- ization that have enabled us to leave this ‘there’  long before the appearance of computerization  and digital networks”  cited in Lévy, 1998 . Nor  are virtual spaces dependent upon cyberspace. For  example, Margaret Wertheim argues that Giotto’s  Arena Chapel in Padua, Italy, transported view- ers out of reality into an architecturally virtual  space. She argues that Giotto’s work “blur[s] the   Figure 2. The Hinge. If virtual worlds are theo- rized as desubstantialized, then the experience   a  of the relationship between the virtual  b  and  actual  c  is not one of real and unreal, but rather  nondualistic.  Drawing by Greg Grieve   boundary between the virtual space of the image  and the physical space of the chapel”  Wertheim  & Leonard, 1999 .  If one disambiguates “virtual” from “cyber- space,” then one finds that virtualities are neither  “fake” nor immaterial, but are desubstantialized.  That is, the virtual cannot be reduced to material  or ideal, but it is a set of processes dependent  upon the actual, and realized in it, but irreducible  to a physical system. In such a case, the virtual,  as Pierre Lévy argues, “has little affinity with the  false, the illusory or imaginary. Nor does it mean  the opposite of reality”  1995 . For instance, the  experience created by watching a film is dependent  upon the physical celluloid, but its significance  cannot be reduced to it. If one sees the virtual as  desubstantialized, a second model appears. This  can  be  theorized  as  the  hinge,  which  models  the virtual world and the actual as nondualistic   Figure 2 .  Nondualism indicates that things appear dis- tinct while not being separate, and affirms the  understanding  that  while  distinctions  exist,  di- chotomies  are  illusory  phenomena.  The  hinge  places you in two worlds at once, and causes one  to be transversal. That is, perception of the vir- tual pivots in two or more intersecting but paral- lel social positions. In fact, virtualization impedes   291   Finding Liquid Salvation  Figure 3. A Resident  Drawing by Greg Grieve   in SL by the presence of the avatar, operated by  the user, and socialized by interaction with other  residents, their avatars, and occasionally the users  themselves  Figure 3 .  It is important to remember that a “resident”  is not always a one-to-one relationship between  a real-life user and a virtual representation. As  with most website user accounts, several avatars  might  belong  to  one  user,  and  conversely  one  avatar might be operated by more than one user  sequentially, or in some cases by more than one  user at the same time, as in the situation of one  avatar controlled by nine disabled persons  Au,  2008 .  Theoretically, residents can be understood as  cyborg, fluid selves, whose bodies are multiple  and distributed across a number of “windows.”  As Valentine Daniel argues, selves are signs: “As  a semiotic sign [they] are never actual: [they] are  always virtual”  Daniel & Pugh, 1984 . Donna  Haraway  writes  that  a  “cyborg  is  a  cybernetic  organism,  a  hybrid  of  machine  and  organism,  a creature of social reality as well as a creature  of fiction”  2009: 149 . Sherry Turkle uses the  metaphor of computer screen windows to illustrate  how residents cycle through cyberspace and the  actual world  1984 . For Turkle, “the self is no  longer simply playing different roles in different  settings at different times”  1996 . Instead, “the  life practice of windows is that of a decentered  self that exists in many worlds, that plays many   us from thinking in schemes of binary dichotomies  and in dialectic notions of synthesis  Nusselder,  2006 . Instead, both are real because the virtual  and the actual produce an effect  Lévy, 1998 .  Residents: Fluid, Multiple,  Distributed, and Sensorial  Cyborg-Bodies  In SL, users assume an identity—such as Debo- rah Devine—by creating an online character, an  “avatar.” In computing, an avatar is the on-screen  representation  of  the  user s ,  which  can  be  a  three-dimensional model such as in SL, a two- dimensional icon as used in many chat forums,  or a textual description as used in MUDs. In SL,  the default avatar shape is humanoid, but it can  be customized through a graphical user interface  that can modify gender, body shape, skin, hair- style, and clothes. Moreover, one can purchase or  create bodies and clothes, as well as attachments  and animation and sonic  voice  overrides. Such  customization results in the creation of male, fe- male, and androgynous human avatars, as well as  animals, robots, nekos, furries, and other fantasy  creatures such as dragons.  A metaverse platform resident is a social entity  that weaves together an avatar and its user within  the broader social context of the cyberworld. In  common usage, a resident is one who dwells in  a particular place, and implies, as in The Devil’s  Dictionary, that one is “unable to leave”  Bierce  & Steadman, 2003 . Linden Research defines a  “resident” as “a uniquely named avatar with the  right to log into SL, trade Linden Dollars and visit  the Community pages.” In Second Life, residents  are governed by terms of service  TOS , which  specifically allow users to retain all intellectual  property rights in the digital content they create or  own in SL. In our research, we employ the word  “user” to refer to the actual person “behind the  keyboard,” “avatar” to refer to the online image  of a user’s “virtual representative,” and “resident”  to indicate the cybersocial entity that is activated   292   Finding Liquid Salvation  Figure 4. Clint Using the “Triple Jewel HUD” to Perform a Gassho  Photo by Greg Grieve   roles at the same time.” As Turkle writes, “Now  real life itself may be, as one of [her] subjects  says, ‘just one more window’”  1996 .  What is important to remember here, is that  these different windows are inhabited not just by  minds, but also by bodies. As Anna Munster writes,  “Information does not simply represent a body  or corporeal experience; it renders the emergent  properties and capacities of bodies”  2006 . The  current ideology surrounding metaverse platforms  has been sustained by a rhetoric of dematerializa- tion, which has driven even deeper the Cartesian  wedge between mind and body. Katherine Hayles  indicates that such dematerialization is exacer- bated by “the postmodern ideology that the body’s  materiality is secondary to the logical or semiotic  structures it encodes”  1999: 192 . The normative  assumption seems to be that when one logs into   cyberspaces, we leave our bodies behind. Here it  is important to distinguish between what is meant  by “body” and by “embodiment.” Hayles argues  that  the  body  is  a  cultural  norm,  an  idealized  form,  while  “embodiment  is  a  specific  instan- tiation...enmeshed within the specifics of place,  time, physiology, and culture”  196 . In the same  fashion that Lacan’s “Real” undermines symbolic  orders, Hayles’s work suggests that embodiment  “inherently destabilizes” semiotic systems  197;  Lacan, 1966: 25; Lacan, 1978:49 .  In SL, embodiment of self involves three minor  factors and one major factor that are interdepen- dent. The minor factors are appearance, actions,  and communication. First, in SL embodiment is  determined by how one appears to others. A user  can change his or her avatar’s shape, gender, race,  species, as well as clothes, hair, and accessories.   293   Finding Liquid Salvation  especially as it pertains to an understanding of the  transparent operation of the senses.  Cloud Communities: Temporary,  Flexible, and Elastic Online Groups  Since at least April 1984, with the establishment  of  net.religion.jewish,  computer-mediated  reli- gious groups—such as those to which Deborah  Devine  belongs—have  existed  in  cyberspace.  Howard Rheingold argues that such groups turn  into communities “when people carry on public  discussions long enough, with sufficient human  feeling, to form webs of personal relationships”   1993 . All communities are socially constructed,  and even face-to-face groups, which use air to  speak, in the end depend upon media for people  to  perceive  themselves  as  members. There  are  many  different  types  of  communities  on  SL.  Some communities re-enact specific historical or  fictional spaces, such as medieval Japan, or John  Norman’s Gor novels. Some communities revolve  around events such as airship races, philosophical  debate, and role-play areas such as City of Lost  Angels. This can also include religious groups and  activities such as Bible study or silent meditation   Figures 5 and 6 .  While  the  CVRT  studied  Muslim,  Jewish,  Pagan, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, New Age, and  agnostic groups, we base our theory on two SL  religious communities: the Second Life Christians  and their ALM CyberChurch  1,529 members   modeled by its devout but unordained founders  after real-world Christian congregations, and the  Upaya Sangha that is modeled on westernized  Zen  Buddhism.  Participation  in  ALM  Cyber- Church includes Sunday services—with sermons,  hymns, and collection plates—as well as everyday  related discussions, fellowship meetings, and book  groups, and for many the association extends to  Christian-themed dance clubs. The Upaya Sangha  is part of a Buddhist community on SL that con- sists  of  five  groups—Buddha  Center,  Hikari  Buddhist Group, Upaya Sangha, the Zen Center,   Embodiment  is  also  determined  by  actions.  In  SL, one can gesture and change posture. When it  comes to religious practices, there are many reli- gious gestures, such as “Worship the Lord!” and a  Heads Up Device  HUD  called the Triple Jewel  HUD that allows one to gassho—a position used  for greeting, with the palms together and fingers  pointing upwards in prayer position  Figure 4 . Last, a user can change modes of communica- tion among different forms of text and voice. The  major factor of virtual embodiment occurs when  we are interpolated into a social network. Alter- ity is the very possibility and process of embodi- ment. While the body is never self-present, it is  not fixed by nature—it is a cultural norm. Embodi- ment is created in relation to others, as one is  perceived to be of a particular sex, race, or ethnic  group in a particular social setting.  We are not arguing for a return to essentialized  corporeal notions of the body. Instead, as Munster  writes, “[l]ike all technologies associated with our  sensorium, [new media require] us to undertake a  labor of perception. Information bodies [“embod- ied information” in Hayles’s terminology] no lon- ger summon the immediate presence of corporeal  existence, which can be affirmed through habitual  codes and conventions”  180 . What is important  is the embodied sensorium. Walter Ong defines  the sensorium as “the entire sensory apparatus  as an operational complex…the organization of  which is in part determined by culture, while at  the same time it makes culture”  O’Leary, 1996;  Ong, 1967 . As shown in the work of Carpenter  and McLuhan  1960 , it is a natural extension to  recognize that different media alter the normative  perception of the world. That is, the “media is the  message” because different mediascapes—from  primarily oral, to manuscript, to print based, to  analogue, and finally to digital—will create dif- ferent “realities.” Ideologically, the sensoriums are  not neutral features; there are different winners and  losers in each sensorium because of the produc- tion, circulation, and legitimization of knowledge,   294   Finding Liquid Salvation  Figure 5. Zen Buddhist Silent Meditation at Zen Retreat  Photo by Greg Grieve .  Figure 6. Christian Altar Call Following a Sunday Sermon at ALM CyberChurch  Photo by Kevin Heston   and the Zen Retreat. As of January 2010, these  five groups had 2,756 members, five regions, and  held approximately 75 events per week.  The term “community” defines a group that  forms relationships over time by interacting on a  regular basis around a shared set of experiences— this could be car enthusiasts or the members of a  remote mountain village. A “cloud community” is  an online group that is temporary, flexible, elastic,  and is inexpensive in the social capital required  to join or to leave  Figure 7 .  We  borrow  the  notion  of  the  “cloud”  from  computing, where it signifies an architecture in   which users access resources online from a host  of  different  servers—Google  Docs,  Blist,  and  SlideRocket would be examples. Cloud comput- ing users do not invest in infrastructure. Instead,  they rent what they need when they need it.  Virtual cloud communities have become im- portant because the passage into late modernity  has dissolved traditional religious communities  and institutions so that individuals have to actively  explore and create novel, elastic, temporary, and  flexible forms. Community experiences can be  generated by place or interest, but what defines the  concept of community is “communion”  Hodes,   295   Finding Liquid Salvation  interests, such as scripting, building, music, the  arts, and games, to name just a few. For instance,  one could join the group “East River Community”  if one is interested in things nautical. Or one can  join the “Seekers of the Black Caste of Gor,” if one  is interested in being an assassin. Members of SL  groups are able to interact via group chat and also  to send notices and to vote on proposals. Groups  can also give members different administrative  roles with different abilities, such as ejection, note  card-sending, and invitation. Groups can be role- playing, such as the Toxian City—Main Group  with 8,136 members. They can be educational,  such as the Institute for SL Ethnography with 39  members. They can be for entertainment, such  as the group Hot Sex with 544 members. On SL  some of the longest lasting and most active of  communities are religious, such as the Second  Life Christians with 1,529 members, Islam Every  Day with 213 members, or the Pagan site Anam  Turas Pagan Learning Grove with 944 members.  THE CARDEAN ETHNOGRAPHIC  METHOD: PARTICIPANT  OBSERVATION BASED ON  PRESENCE, PROLONGED  TIME IN THE FIELD, AND  THICK DESCRIPTION  Now that we have theorized the main descrip- tive categories, we can turn to the main focus of  the chapter. Namely, illustrating the Cardean or  hinge method for conducting ethnography in 3-D  metaverse  platforms  such  as  SL.  One  worries,  however, can ethnographers telecommute? Can  one be immersed in other worlds while sitting  in front of a computer screen? As Malinowski  cautioned,  to  document  the  imponderabilia  of  life, researchers should not sit in their armchairs  theorizing from a distance, but must spend time  learning about, and from, groups of people in their  natural surroundings  1961 [1922] . Yet, the myth  of the ethnographic field as a discreet, bounded   Figure 7. Second Life’s Zen Buddhist Community  Cloud  Drawing by Greg Grieve   1972 . In fact, in the social sciences, since the late  nineteenth century, the conception of community  has been associated with the hope of living within  more harmonious types of bonds, which are per- ceived to exist in more traditional societies and past  ages  Hoggett, 1997; Tönnies & Harris, 2001 . As  Zygmunt Bauman writes, “‘Community’ stands for  the kind of world which is not, regrettably, avail- able to us—but which we would dearly wish to  inhabit and which we hope to repossess”  2001 .  The longing for communion, even if it is just a  myth, is what drives people’s desire for online  community. The temporary, flexible, elastic, and  inexpensive nature of cloud communities makes  this desire possible in what Baumann defines as  “liquid modernity.” As Bauman writes, “Liquid  Life is a precarious life, lived under conditions  of constant uncertainty.... A society in which the  conditions under which its members act change  faster than it takes the way of acting to consolidate  into habits and routines”  Bauman, 2005: 1 .  Cloud communities exist on SL, and are best  analyzed by looking at “groups.” Groups provide  a way for residents to collaborate about shared   296   Finding Liquid Salvation  geographic locale is proving to be increasingly  outdated  and  untenable  as  globalization  blurs  the boundary between “here” and “there”  Fox,  1991; Gupta & Ferguson, 1997; Kohn, 1995 . In  fact, a “field site” can no longer be seen merely  as a physical location, but rather must be viewed  as the intersection between people, practices, and  shifting terrains, both physical and virtual.  Rather  than  a  distant  space,  or  a  particular  type  of  media,  the  ethnographic  field  is  better  defined through a set of methodological practices   Appadurai, 1986 . What became clear during our  research is that the need to theorize a new style  of ethnographic research arises not only because  SL differs from traditional actual world field sites,  but also because SL’s 3-D graphic interface dif- fers from earlier text-based MUDs and the World  Wide Web. The shift from a web-based to a 3-D  platform changes the method needed to study a  field. For instance, Christine Hine has developed  a ten-point methodological framework for virtual  ethnography  2000: 63-645 . Yet her work focuses  on listserves, websites, and chat rooms. None of  these media have the wide range of new sensorial  information that 3-D metaverse platforms, such  as SL, offer.  Sometimes it is most efficient to put new wine  in old bottles. During our research, we found what  worked best was a classic ethnographic method  consisting of practices of participant observation  and thick description  Malinowski, 1961 [1922];  Geertz, 1973; see also Clifford & Marcus, 1986;  Gupta & Ferguson, 1997 . During our fieldwork,  we meditated and prayed, explored temples and  churches, prostrated before Buddha images, knelt  before Christian altars, went to Dharma talks and  Christian  fellowship  meetings,  and  argued  in  open discussions about the nature of Buddhism  and  Christianity.  Our  participant  observation  was  recorded  in  shared  field  notes,  snapshots,  written  documents,  and  material  culture. What  makes participant observation a scientific research  method  as opposed to just “hanging out”  is, in  an  oxymoronic  fashion,  that  as  one  inhabits  a   world, one also needs to stand back and observe by  watching and listening, while taking both physical  and mental notes. “Observation” means logging  concrete documentation of social structures and  examples of everyday life and utterances. While  there is no standard set of methods for participant  observation, the three key practices are presence  in the field, emergent research design, and thick  description.  Presence: Virtually Being There  Often virtual communities are not considered as  valid fields because they lack the propinquity of  face-to-face groups. Such skepticism is not limited  to just experts. Many users see the Internet as  merely a source of information. As a sixteen-year- old Christian, experienced with religious blogs  and chats, said, “The Internet can never become  to me what the church is”  Careaga, 2001 . What  seems to be missing online is presence, the feel- ing that the landscape, buildings, and especially  the inhabitants are co-present with the user—that  they are there. Three-dimensional metaplatforms  counter this placelessness.  Imagine you already have a SL account. At  home, at the office, or in a coffee shop, you get  an electronic message reminding you that silent  meditation is going to start. You log on to your  SL viewer program much as you would a web  browser, such as Safari or Firefox. Your avatar  materializes in your home in SL. By looking at  the map, you can tell that a number of people are  already at the nearby meditation hall. It is a little  too far to walk, and you cannot fly in this region,  so you teleport over. You “rezz”  materialize  in  front of a wooden building, through the glass door  of which you can see a long wooden altar with  incense, candles, flowers, and a large statue of  Shakyamuni Buddha. This is the meditation hall.  You push through the door and greet everyone with  a gassho. You are welcomed with the emoticon  for gassho and the word namaste by many of the  sixteen  practitioners,  who  run  the  gamut  from   297   Finding Liquid Salvation  mouse and keyboard instructions, one can explore  SL, which includes 3-D builds, and environmen- tal sounds. Avatars can communicate with other  residents via voice and built-in public chat and  instant messaging. Residents can buy and make  clothes, objects, and buildings, as well as buy and  rent property. One can conduct business using the  in-world currency, run non-profit and educational  groups, role-play, and socialize in any number of  ways with others.  It is the “interactivity” with the platform that  gives residents the feeling that they are more than  “spectators,” and turns the screen’s pixels into  what William Gibson, in his novel, Neuromancer,  calls “consensual hallucinations”  1984 . Also,  it is interactivity that distinguishes the computer  from the cinematic mode of engagement. As Al- lucquére Rosanne Stone argues, “Interaction is  the physical concretization of a desire to escape  the flatness and merge into the created system. It  is the sense in which the ‘spectator’ is more than  a participant, but becomes both participant in and  creator of the simulation”  1991 .  SL’s immersive interactivity occurs through  “virtual  physicality,”  “hyper-interactivity,”  and  the  users’  employment  of  imagination.  Virtual  physicality indicates that residents are able to walk,  run, fly, swim, or teleport throughout immensely  variable,  virtual  physical  environments;  and  they are able to dance, cuddle, kiss, and hug one  another. We refer to this as “hyper-interactivity”  because it allows interaction with the dual “virtual- physicality” of SL—the ability to construct and  interact  with  the  environment  as  well  as  with  the  other  avatars.  This  dual  virtual-physicality  enhances, relative to other platforms, what Yee  and  Bailenson  describe  as  “the  psychological  experience of being able to move naturalistically  in  a  different  surrounding”   2009 . The  online  experience becomes not only a “psychological  experience of moving naturalistically,” but also  an experience of “being” naturalistically—both in  body and in a different space. This sense of “being”  is played out in a wide array of social interactions   those dressed in Zen monastic garb, to those who  look as if they should be out clubbing—elves, one  Gorean, and a small goat-like animal.  As the Buddhist example indicates, presence  is enabled by “immersion” and “interactivity.” In  the context of metaverse platforms, immersion  refers to the experience of being in the constructed  world. The screen is not a surface in front of the  user. Rather, the users lose themselves in the con- structed world. Immersion creates an experience  of locatedness “that organizes sensory informa- tion in such a way as to create a psychological  state  in  which  an  individual  perceives  himself  or herself as being present or having ‘presence’  in them”  Blascovich, 2002 . Immersion occurs  when the actual world is sufficiently muted, and  the virtual world is sufficiently heightened, creat- ing a feeling that one is no longer in the actual  world. For instance, consider the feeling of being  immersed in a good book and startled upon “re- turn” to the actual world. What makes immersion  more intense in virtual worlds is presence and  interactivity. In 3-D cyberworlds, “presence” is  enhanced by the greatly expanded sensorium and  increased interactivity with not only the avatars  of other residents, but also with the “virtual en- vironment.” Participation in SL usually involves  physical, albeit virtual, activity on the part of the  individual’s avatar. Significantly, these activities  are “publicly” observable and become part of the  SL  social  fabric.  Interests  and  associations  are  frequently signaled by tattoos, clothing, hairstyle,  and body configuration.  What makes immersion in SL more intense  than  in  other  online  media  is  the  metaverse’s  three-dimensionally  rich,  highly  interactive,  and complex Internet platform. Such immersive  navigation occurs when users move from seeking  information to navigating through worlds. The  goals of an immersed user are different from those  of one seeking to extract information. Instead of  text-based experience aimed at finding and con- necting pieces of data, the goals of an immersed  user include bodily sensory awareness. By using   298   Finding Liquid Salvation  and  relationships,  including  the  religious,  that  many  experienced  residents  report  are  equally  significant to their real-world relationships.  That  the  form  and  activities  of  the  avatars  are on display for the residents creates a unique  form of communication in which the importance  of the image is greatly elevated over text-based  Internet,  and  in  which  interactivity  is  greatly  enhanced  relative  to  both  televangelism  and  text-based Internet religion. That an individual is  “pulling the strings” to create the activities, and is  responsible for the “physical” appearance of the  avatar, creates a unique opportunity for a wide  range of personal messages and private associa- tions, including the “virtually” religious. Email  groups and chat rooms utilize a limited array of  simple images—emoticons—to convey meaning  beyond text. Image-rich, interactive 3-D cyber- space opens up the possibility of expression by  means of constructing “virtual” structures, forests,  oceans, cities, universities, churches, synagogues,  temples, and uniquely, the ability to use the richly  expressive avatar “body language.” Avatar facial  expressions are possible in SL, but they are not  regularly used. Other body language can be por- trayed; for example, by using “gestures” that are  readily available on the SL toolbar, it is possible  to bow, curtsy, kneel, play an instrument, dance,  or even toss a snowball. True, the body language  is the product of computer code and therefore not  spontaneous, but that does not prevent it from  being communicative.  Metaverse platforms such as SL allow individu- als to project themselves into, and to invite others  into, their dramas and fantasies, enabling users  to  form  communities  and  become  comfortable  with new ways of being. It is the incorporation  of  residents’  imaginations  that  makes  SL  dif- ferent from other 3-D interactive platforms that  are engineered by game designers. The primary  difference is in the fact that the users themselves  “build”  Second  Life’s  content.  The  shift  from  the  “traditional  models  of  corporate-controlled  production and distribution to more democratic,   non-hierarchical, [and] collaborative structures”   Schackman, 2009  affords an unprecedented level  of  interactivity.  Such  resident-created  content  is  pushing  computer-mediated  communication  from a modernist paradigm of calculation toward  a postmodernist one of simulation, which links  millions of users in new cyberspaces. Using “in- world” tools available to all residents, one can  make  objects  with  physical  qualities  and  even  give them scripted instructions, and thus create  buildings,  environments,  and  even  the  bodies  that one inhabits. In SL, one can visit shopping  malls, dance clubs, art and cultural sites, Hindu  temples, Christian churches, synagogues, Pagan  fire circles, and go on a virtual hajj and even visit  a Buddhist hell  to name a few . These builds can  be either “online religion,” such as the Grove of  the Greenman  Gai Rising Outerbanks 143, 181,  40  where cyberspace is the focus of practice, or  they can be “religion online,” such as the Saint  Michael Shrine  Charleville 141, 246, 21  that is  a copy of an actual church that exists in the actual  world in Tarpon Springs, Florida  Helland, 2000;  Karaflogka, 2002; Maxwell, 2002 .  A Prolonged Time in the Field  Returning  to  SL,  we  find  that  the  avatars  are  sitting on zafus and zabutons. These meditation  cushions  are  laid  out  in  semi-circular  lines  so  that when people sit on them they are facing the  altar. There are two cushions facing away from  the altar, and between them is a meditation gong   kesu , which is referred to as the “bell.” Sitting  on the right cushion facing away from the altar is  the meditation leader or timekeeper who—and I  quote from information given to me when I was  trained for this job—“is the person who holds the  meditative space for the sitting practice of others.” While the immersion and interactivity make  possible a field site, for a valid ethnography one  needs a prolonged time in the field because it al- lows the researcher to become part of the group’s  everyday routine, to inhabit the insider’s world,   299   Finding Liquid Salvation  using the web-based application Google Docu- ments  and later Dropbox . More time was spent  in-world during this period, with a minimum of five  2-hour sessions each week for both researchers.  Also during this period, more than 100 surveys  were obtained, and Heston designed the “Aleph  Technique,” which reads the profiles of avatars to  analyze the groups to which they belong  2008 .  Fairly quickly, the researchers discovered that it  was difficult to “bond” with such quickly rotating  avatars, and it was thus difficult to be immersed  in SL. That is, it was difficult to advance to being  a “resident.” The term “bond” describes how us- ers are psychologically attached to their avatars.  When users are bonded and immersed, they be- come emotionally engaged with the community.  Also, because the two researchers are both male  in actual life, we decided that it would be prudent  to involve women in the research team.  The  third  stage  of  research  began  in  Sep- tember 2008 with the addition of four advanced  undergraduates—Epps,  Davis,  Lampley,  and  Mallindine.  We  also  added  the  avatars Aleph,  Da5id, Juanita, and Kaiya to the protocols. Re- searchers shared their field notes using Google  Documents, and we also shared material culture  and  screenshots  using  the  web-based  program  Dropbox. We were still interested in gender at this  stage. Our original intention was for researchers  to embody a particular avatar for six weeks, and  then  to  exchange  with  another  member  of  the  team. Four weeks into the third stage, however,  the direction of the study was again altered in two  major ways: First, researchers were reluctant to  abandon their avatars, so a final allocation was  done and, for the most part, each person stuck  with one avatar for the remainder of the study.  Second, the study became both broader and more  focused. It was broadened because the idea of  studying only gender seemed limited, and so the  study was enlarged to encompass religious selves,  relationships, and communities. It became more  focused because SL was growing and changing  so quickly that the concept of studying all religion   and to give the research the flexibility and fluid- ity it needs to follow alternative hypotheses that  arise during the study  O’Reilly, 2005 . Moreover,  prolonged time in the field is necessary because  ethnographers have no clear idea what they will  find, and thus need to have an open, fluid, and  evolving research protocol. Unlike other social  science methods whose aim is to test a hypoth- esis, ethnography by definition is inductive, fluid,  and flexible, building upon the perspectives of  the  people  studied.  For  instance,  the  Cardean  research  protocol  evolved  through  four  stages.  Grieve, as the principal investigator, and Heston  first logged onto SL in October 2007—before the  platform had become known to the mainstream  media, and really before any academic, let alone  ethnographic  papers  had  been  written  on  the  subject. We had been invited to view one of the  first Asian  religious  sites,  a  Daoist  temple  run  by resident Sufigari Xenith, and became curious  about the possibilities of using the virtual world  as  an  ethnographic  site.  Visitation  of  SL  was  sporadic at first but evolved into a minimum of  three  2-hour  sessions  each  week.  Because  our  university’s  Institutional  Review  Board   IRB ,  a  committee  designated  to  monitor  academic  research involving human subjects, had not yet  approved the study, no data was collected in this  first stage of research, and we used the time to  learn the language and culture of SL.  In  the  second  stage  of  the  research,  Grieve  and Heston became interested in how identities  are formed in different SL religious groups, and  we obtained an IRB in February 2008. Because  of a vast already extant archive of primary and  secondary sources, we concentrated on how gender  identity is constituted by different SL religious  groups.  The  research  employed  three  different  avatars—Brandy, Clint, and YT—who embodied  female,  male,  and  neuter  genders.  Using  these  three avatars on a random and rotating basis, we  visited a number of different religious groups— Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Pagan.  Field notes were begun, and we compiled them   300   Finding Liquid Salvation  was abandoned, and we decided to concentrate  on the Zen Buddhist cluster and the ALM Cy- berChurch.  Participant  observation  continued  with each researcher logging on for a minimum  of two hours three times per week. In June 2009,  we ceased participant observation, and engaged  in one month of open interviews, in which the  group spoke with forty-two participants.  The fourth stage, which is ongoing at the time  of writing, began in September 2009 and will last  until September 2010. After the student researchers  graduated, Grieve worked alone. He concentrated  on contemplative practices in Second Life’s Bud- dhist cloud community. Grieve concentrated on  documenting changes that were occurring in the  Buddhist community—by leading meditation and  reading groups, as well as attending new events  such as dharma talks lead by actual-world Buddhist  clergy. With the help of Heston, a final large survey  is planned, in which we hope to gather around 200  responses. The completion of the survey will mark  the end of three years of fieldwork.  Writing it Down: Thick  Description in a Fluid World  As the time draws near, more people straggle in.  Just before the start of the meditation period, the  timekeeper types in public chat: “Please prepare  for thirty minutes of silent meditation.” The sit- ting period ends with one ring of the bell and a  brief dedication, usually: “By this merit may all  sentient beings attain complete awakening.” The  timekeeper then types the emoticon “_ !\_”  for  gassho . Most of the other people present also type  this emoticon into their computers, which causes  a cascade of _ !\_s to flow down the screen. You  then stand, gassho to the altar, and walk slowly  out of the zendo. Once you have left, you say  good-bye to your companions, teleport back to  your house, and then log off.  The goal of ethnography is to create thick de- scription. As Clifford Geertz defines the term, a  “thick description” describes both a social practice   and also the context in order for that practice to  become meaningful to an outsider. Geertz uses  the example of a wink. If someone winks, it could  mean that they are expressing sexual desire, trying  to communicate a secret, or they might “actually  have been fake-winking, say, to mislead outsid- ers into imagining there was a conspiracy afoot”   Geertz, 1973 . Without knowing the context, we  reduce the wink to the thin description that the  person is merely “rapidly contracting his right  eyelid”   1973:  7 .  In  a  similar  fashion,  in  the  context of SL one could accurately describe the  emoticon “_ !\_” as a series of lines. Yet, such a  “thin description” does not explain what this sign  means to an insider. In Geertz’s words, it neither  “uncover[s] the conceptual structures that inform  our subject’s acts,” nor allows us to “...construct  a system of analysis”  1973: 27 .  For example, a church service that concludes  with avatars approaching the altar and kneeling  in prayer suggests a different denominational bent  than a service that concludes with avatars stand- ing, arms reaching high as they sway to and fro.  Or, consider an example that continues gender  stereotypes from real life: A hands-folded, head- downcast posture of a conservatively dressed ava- tar will be interpreted as indicating a more demure  personality than a hand-on-hip, head-held-high  posture of a less conservatively dressed avatar,  especially if the dynamics of a provocative walk  are included in the latter. The intentionality should  be recognized as a unique form of communica- tion; the very fact that an avatar is assembled and  operated entirely by personal intention provides  rhetorical opportunities that SL residents use in  their interpretation of others, their formation of  community, their experience of religion, and to  convey their own SL “personality.” That these  abilities are intrinsic to religious gatherings and  activities in SL provides a significant increase,  relative to previous media, in the personal and com- munal expression of religion in 3-D cyberspace.  301   Finding Liquid Salvation  the materiality of the body. Realizing the material  nature of virtual reality, however, indicates that the  body is not dissolving into semiotic signs, but that  the cyberbody is desubstantialized and nondual.  Metaverse platforms hinge the cultural, abstract  construct of the body with the imbricated experi- ences of an embodied sensorium. It is from here  that we can recognize that the cultural construct  of the body is abstract, it prejudices the mental,  while embodiment is experiential, it prejudices  the sensual. As Munster would have it, metaverse  platforms “disclose a body’s potential for becom- ing different, for transmutation”  180 .  Last, the Cardean Method challenges defini- tions  of  what  constitutes  religion  and  expands  our understanding of community in our highly  mediated, late-capitalistic consumer culture. Our  ethnography suggests that “virtual reality” is not  an escape, but rather another “window” that people  utilize. While we did not look over the native’s  shoulder, we did look through their windows and  found that many people are practicing religion on  SL because it is a form of “Liquid Salvation.” That  is, because the passage from “solid” to “liquid”  modernity  has  dissolved  traditional  religious  communities and institutions, users have had to  actively explore and create novel, temporary, and  flexible forms of salvation. For instance, when I  asked Deborah how SL compared to other 3-D  platforms, she said, “It is very different here in  Second Life; I actually feel as though I’m sup- ported  here  when  I  am  tempted  to  do  things  I  shouldn’t do.” Now that we have found Liquid  Salvation, we need to use ethnography to analyze  it. We need to focus on the details of how Second  Life functions to re-enchant the lives of religious  residents, and how such re-enchantment is tied to  the expanded sensorium of Second Life and to the  greatly increased opportunities for understanding  the imponderabilia of a virtual life.  Solutions and Recommendations  Near the end of a conversation with SL resident  Deborah Devine, I told her about a National Broad- casting Company  NBC  segment, titled “Give Me  that Online Religion: Virtual Religious Services  are Gaining in Popularity,” featuring Professor  and Methodist Reverend Elaine Heath. I explained  to Deborah how I was researching religious com- munities in SL, and how in the video segment  Reverend  Heath  argues,  “The  Church  cannot  be the Church without flesh and blood interac- tion.” Deborah Devine laughed back, “That RL  [real-life] pastor is an idiot lol [laugh out loud].”  Deborah paused and then added, “Really does the  Holy Spirit have flesh and blood?” For Deborah,  not only is interaction with fellow practitioners  more readily available in SL, but the Holy Spirit  is available as well. There was another pause, and  then Deborah said, “This [Second] life is rich with  experience, and I can do it sitting in my nightgown  … sorry… now the dog needs me to take him out.  BRB [be right back].” With this, Deborah took a  break to attend to her dog in real life.  To  document  such  “imponderabilia”  that  make up a virtual life, we described the Cardean  Ethnographic  Method—an  ethnographic  tech- nique formulated to study religious practice on  3-D metaverse platforms. Methodologically, the  Cardean Method demonstrates that one can trans- fer and adapt traditional ethnographic methods  for the cyberspace of 3-D metaverse platforms.  The  Cardean  Method’s  theoretical  categories  include  the  virtual  as  desubstantialized  and  nondualistic;  residents  as  fluid  cyborg-bodies;  and  cloud  communities  as  temporary,  flexible,  outsourced  groups.  We  have  shown  that  these  make participant observation possible on virtual  3-D metaverse platforms because they allow for  the three classical elements: presence  immersion  with interactivity , emergent research design, and  thick description. On a theoretical level, our study  causes  one  to  rethink  the  relation  between  the  virtual and the actual, especially as it relates to   302   Finding Liquid Salvation  REFERENCES  Appadurai, A.   1986 .

As James Clifford has shown  in Writing Culture: The Poetics of Politics  Ethnography   1986 ,  “I”  is  even  more  problematic for ethnographic writing. Our  research team, in its final form, consisted of  the principal investigator and five advanced  undergraduates. We tried various methods,  but  eventually  found  it  most  effective  to  employ the first person, even if it indicates  research conducted by different researchers.  Accordingly, we treat the first-person singu- lar not as representing an actual, bounded  self, but as a social and discursive construct,  which emerges from our data.

Katleen Gabriels  Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium  Joke Bauwens  Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium  Karl Verstrynge  Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium  ABSTRACT This study is an examination of in-world morality of frequent residents of Second Life. Given the lack  of systematic research on morality in non-gaming virtual worlds, the authors conducted an explorative  small-scale, in-depth qualitative study with regular Second Life-residents. Drawing on cyber-anthropology,  cyber-sociology, and game studies, they explore to what extent ideas and pictures of in-world moral  behaviour differ from moral categories and definitions used in real life situations. Research findings  show, firstly, that communication and sanction mechanisms  e.g. gossip , known from real life, are im- portant means to create social control and group cohesion in Second Life. Secondly, the technologically  mediated context intensifies and provides new tools for social control  e.g. alternative avatar . Thirdly,  residents also make use of “out-world” systems to restrict or punish immoral behaviour  e.g. blogs,  discussion forums, Web search engines . In general, findings indicate that morality in Second Life is not  completely different from morality shown in real life. On the other hand, they also point at distinctive- ness in a mediated environment because of specific technological tools.  INTRODUCTION  Although today millions of people are spending a  considerable amount of time in three-dimensional  non-gaming  virtual  worlds,  little  systematic  research has  been done  regarding the question  of  morality  and  its  distinctive  nature  in  these   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch020  particular worlds. This lack is in sharp contrast  to the numerous media debates on Second Life.  Much ink has flowed in popular media discourses  about  the  alleged  absence  of  morality  in  this  social virtual world. In those ‘panic waves’ the  freedom that users have to experiment without  restraints is often linked with the upsurge of im- moral or amoral behaviour  e.g. Kuipers, 2006 .  Likewise game studies have shown much more   Copyright   2012, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.   Second Life, Second Morality?  interest in moral issues  e.g. sex, violence, ag- gression, cheating  in digital games like World  of Warcraft or first person shooter games as Call  of Duty: Modern Warfare or America’s Army  see  amongst many others Consalvo, 2005; Anderson,  2004; Anderson, & Bushman, 2002; Anderson,  Gentile, & Buckley, 2007; Anderson, Sakaoto,  Gentile,  et  al.,  2008;  Bushman,  &  Anderson,  2002; Ferguson, 2009; Mathiak, & Weber, 2006;  Weber, Ritterfeld, & Mathiak, 2006; Longman,  O’Connor, & Obst, 2009 .  Taking these observations as our setting, we  aim to provide a more evidence-based understand- ing of how people make sense of virtual morality.  Our research focuses on the popular and widely  known social virtual world Second Life  SL . SL  was created in 2003 by Linden Lab and is defined  as  “an  immersive,  user-created  online  world”   Au, 2008, p. x . Linden Lab does not impose  a game-oriented goal on its residents; they are  free to choose how to spend their time in-world.  Exactly this freedom to act and to experiment in  a world that is believed to be a second, different  or so-called “otherworld”  Dibbell, 1993  is the  starting  point  of  our  investigation. We  explore  how people who often engage in SL think about  morally un acceptable values and behaviour in SL  and how they relate morality in SL to morality in  ‘real life’: as analogue and correlated or discon- tinuous and disconnected. Social life has produced  different systems to restrict and punish immoral  behaviour in ‘real life’. One can ask oneself if these  systems also stand in virtual worlds. Or to phrase  the question more radically: does it really matter  that immoral behaviour is limited or punished in  virtual worlds, as these worlds are only ‘virtual’  and thus not rooted in actuality?  The specific focus in this chapter is on the  dynamics and mechanisms of social control: how  they are rooted in offline social conventions people  bring along when they dwell in SL, but also how  they are shaped and activated through the techno- logical design and tools of SL. In what follows,  we start with the theoretical background of our   study. We elaborate on a description of morality,  on the idea of virtual space as a moral space and  we discuss the distinctiveness of SL in relation  to the virtual environments of gaming. Next, we  present our methodology and research findings.  We conducted a small-scale, in-depth qualitative  study in order to examine the in-world morality  of frequent residents. We interviewed devoted SL- residents and discussed their moral experiences in  SL, in order to gain an understanding of the moral  nature of social interactions in SL. In particular,  the in-world prevention, exclusion, and punish- ment of immoral behaviour are discussed here.  MORALITY, ETHICS, AND SOCIALITY  Although morality and ethics are often interpreted  and treated as synonyms, clear distinctions can  be  drawn  between  both  concepts.  In  a  stricter  sense, ethics deal with the systematic and critical  reflection on morals and morality, and in doing so  they also refer to a specific field of philosophical  study. Morals and morality, on the other hand,  refer respectively to the habits and norms that are  given within a specific cultural context, and to the  individual reflection of those norms into personal  codes of conduct. Morality comes about whenever  a subject is conscious of his or her conduct, i.e.  when personal behaviour is reflected in an aware- ness that is not determined by a supra-personal   external   normative  source   e.g.  law .  Moral  persons reflect on and evaluate their behaviour,  principles, judgments, norms, and values on an  individual, personal level  for further discussion,  see a.o. Ross, 1967; Atkinson, 1969; Frankena,  1973; Williams, 1976; Mackie, 1990; Blackburn,  2001 . Since every human being develops a kind  of  morality,  it  becomes  an  object  of  scientific  research, i.e. in the academic discipline of ethics  or moral philosophy.  In  his  1989  book  Sources  of  the  Self:  The  Making of the Modern Identity, Charles Taylor  offers an interesting outline of the modern self   307   Second Life, Second Morality?  Virtual Space as Moral Space  Both from a theoretical and empirical point of  view, many cyber-anthropologists, -sociologists  and -commentators assert that virtual worlds are  socially  constructed  worlds   a.o.  Castronova,  2007; Boellstorff, 2008 . In spite of their computer- generated, artificial, and synthetic constitution,  virtual  worlds  are  “places  of  human  culture”   Boellstorff,  2008,  p.  17 .  Consequently,  they  become morally qualified spaces where people  can look upon themselves as related to and re- sponsible for online peers. In everyday offline  life, the moral relationship between the self and  the  other  is  often  conceived  in  terms  of  inter- related twin concepts, all expressing a spatially  configured relationship between the self and the  other:  presence  and  absence,  apparentness  and  invisibleness, proximity and distance, distinctive- ness  and  anonymity,  neighbours  and  strangers   Bauman, 1993; Silverstone, 2007 .  As Taylor argues “the very way we walk, move,  gesture, speak is shaped from the earliest moments  by our awareness that we appear before others,  that we stand in public space, and that this space  is potentially one of respect or contempt, of pride  or shame”  1989, p. 15 . Clearly, in virtual encoun- ters, we also appear before others in spatial respect,  but in three-dimensional, graphic, artificial, and  synthetic spaces, notions of ‘walking’, ‘moving’,  ‘gesturing’, ‘speaking’ have taken on a different  meaning. We often appear anonymously via ‘user  names’, we talk via chat text, and we are able to  construct a different identity  or presentation of  it  in terms of sex, race, age, and nationality. As  a consequence, technological innovations have  created a new kind of communicative space that  raises specific questions with regard to the mean- ing of moral claims and duties in virtual respect. As we appear before technologically mediated  others in cyberspace, one can ask oneself how we  have to deal there with otherness and responsi- bility. For instance, the so-called ‘cyber-other’ is  principally conceived as a technologically medi-  and modern morality. Taylor distinguishes three  axes of modern moral thinking: first, our sense of  respect for and obligations to others; second, our  understandings of what makes a full life; and third,  the notion of dignity, i.e. “the characteristics by  which we think of ourselves as commanding  or  failing to command  the respect of those around  us”  Taylor, 1989, p. 15 . Here as well, it is stressed  that morality goes further than mere respect for  others and obligations to them, as there is a no- tion of self-reflection and self-awareness. Taylor  further  focuses  on  the  essential  bond  between  identity  and  moral  orientation,  and  places  this  within the framework of ‘moral space’.  To know who you are is to be oriented in moral  space, a space in which questions arise about what  is good or bad, what is worth doing and what not,  what has meaning and importance for you and  what is trivial and secondary  Taylor, 1989, p. 28 .  Morality is primarily concerned with our rela- tion with the other and is therefore intrinsically  linked to sociality: to be able to live and work  together in harmony, public space and commu- nities have created a consistent set of rules and  norms. Likewise, different methods have also been  developed to reduce the possibilities of cheating  and to maximize the chances of successful coop- eration  e.g. Stevens, & Hauser, 2004 . Among  other things, we analyze signals of others to pre- dict if he or she is trustable  Hart, 1988; Bayliss,  &  Tipper,  2006 ;  we  have  developed  different  methods for cheater detection  Mealy, Daood, &  Krage, 1996; Yamagishi, et al., 2003; Chiappe,  & Brown, 2004 ; we ascribe high importance to  someone’s reputation in order to know if we can  trust her  Brown, & Moore, 2002 ; gossip creates  social control and group cohesion  De Backer,  2005 ; and we have created different forms of  punishment  Fehr, & Gächter, 2000 .  308   Second Life, Second Morality?  ated other whose commands or moral claims are  at least dubious or less compelling since proximal  relations are missing  Virilio, 1996 . Also, one  always has the possibility of switching the medi- ated communication off  cf. Silverstone, 2003;  Baym, 2007 .  Social Virtual Worlds  The fact that present-day three-dimensional social  virtual worlds have their origin in both virtual  reality and video games can explain why so many  people confuse virtual worlds with digital games  and simulations  Boellstorff, 2008, p. 42 . Apart  from their massively multiplayer nature, games,  virtual worlds, and simulations have in common  that  they  are  three-dimensional  environments  inhabited by avatars. Moreover, they can all be  defined  as  highly  interactive  virtual  environ- ments  HIVEs   Aldrich, 2009, p. 1 . However,  the absence of strictly controlled scenarios that  have been designed to develop specific compe- tencies and the lack of a predetermined goal  for  instance, moving to the next level  differentiates  social virtual words from virtual games  Aldrich,  2009, p. 1 . Because of the dissimilar configura- tion of games on the one hand and virtual worlds  on the other, the results of game studies cannot  be automatically and completely extrapolated to  virtual worlds. Nevertheless, there are overlaps  between  digital  games  and  virtual  worlds,  for  instance with regard to investment of time, emo- tions, and energy, social motivations, and close  relationships  e.g. Yee, 2006 .  With  regard  to  morality,  scientific  research  shows  that  specific  mechanisms,  for  instance  moral  conventions,  are  also  present  in  online  communities. Baym  2007  states that one con- sistent finding on online groups is that they are  normatively regulated. Other characteristics are  empathetic communication and social hierarchies.  The presence of offline moral conventions within  online  virtual  surroundings  is  not  remarkable,  because users tend to identify with their avatar.   Because avatars are the digital representations of  actual identities, they are not just fantasy or fic- tional objects: “They [avatars] are the embodied  conception of the participant’s self through which  she communicates with others in the community”   Wolfendale, 2007, p. 114 . Therefore, meaning  must be ascribed to avatar attachment, as avatars  are the means to appear before others in a com- munity that aims at connectivity and interactiv- ity. As a result of avatar identification, different  forms of actual morality also emerge in the virtual  world. Wolfendale states that avatar attachment  must become as morally legitimate as real life  attachment, for instance to material possessions  or  to  other  people   Wolfendale,  2007,  p.  115 .  “Avatar attachment is expressive of identity and  self-conception and should therefore be accorded  the moral significance we give to real-life attach- ment that play a similar role”  Wolfendale, 2007,  p. 111 . Identification with the avatar is also related  to the significance users assign to the reputation  of their avatar  cf. infra .  Second Life  One of the most widely known and popular virtual  worlds is called Second Life. Philip Rosedale, who  also founded Second Life’s development company  ‘Linden Lab’, created this virtual world. Second  Life was launched on June 23, 2003, and is freely  accessible via the Internet for any person above  the age of eighteen. Residents, i.e. users of SL,  interact with each other through avatars.  SL is defined as “an immersive, user-created  online world”  Au, 2008, p. x  and can also be  defined as an online Multi User Virtual Environ- ment  MUVE . SL is user-created, which means  that Linden Lab confines itself to the production  of software and infrastructure, and allows residents  to design the virtual world by building virtual ob- jects and make real profit by selling them. Linden  Lab does not impose a goal on its residents, who  are free to choose how they want to spend their   309   Second Life, Second Morality?  RESEARCH DESIGN: PROBLEM,  QUESTIONS, AND METHODOLOGY  The catchphrase “Free Yourself” in Linden Lab’s  video  advertisement  for  Second  Life  points  at  the freedom that residents have, for instance, to  construct a different online identity1. The liberty  to experiment and to create a new self has incited  a heated public debate, as many fear that every- thing seems to be allowed and possible within  the anonymous and unrestricted settings of SL.  In particular in connection with moral identity,  the  idea  of  avatars  experimenting  with  moral  values and behaviour, in beneficial and harmful  respect, has been occupying the mind of many  authors  Meadows, 2008; Castronova, 2005 . We  take this public concern and envisioned change  as our starting point. Considering SL as a ‘moral  space’,  what  are  the  mechanisms  that  regulate  social control in-world?  Drawing on Taylor’s ideas about morality in  terms of ideas, pictures, and sense-making pro- cesses  cf. supra , interpretative research provides  a valid methodological approach. In line with key  assumptions and concepts within qualitative-inter- pretative methodology  a.o. Denzin, & Lincoln,  2000a; Schwandt, 2000 , we attempt to understand  what is morally un acceptable in SL in terms of  the  meanings  residents  bring  to  it.  One  of  the  central aims is to acquire an inside understanding,  i.e. an insight in actors’ definitions of situations.  This entails Verstehen or getting inside the mind  of the actors to understand what motives, beliefs,  desires, feelings, and thoughts guide their actions   Schwandt,  2000,  p.  192 .  Equally,  we  aim  to  describe and unravel “routine and problematic  moments  and  meanings”   Denzin,  &  Lincoln,  2000b, p. 3  SL-residents encounter. Because our  research aims to grasp the meanings that constitute  human and more particularly moral actions, we  have  asked  SL-residents  to  explain  to  us  their  virtual experiences in their own words.  To this end, we conducted two focus group  interviews and four individual interviews. Starting   time in-world and how they attribute sense and  meaning to their in-world activities.  Because it can be looked upon as a collabora- tive and cooperative microcosm filled with avatars  that interact with each other in various ways, SL  is an interesting platform to study morality and  sociality. SL is particularly relevant to study social  interactions, since it consists of numerous “sims”   abbreviation of “simulators”, i.e. digital land in  SL  on which people, among other things, socially  bond, play role-playing games and go dancing. The  infrastructure of SL offers several possibilities to  make friends: there is a friend list, friendship can  be offered, one can become a member of various  groups on the basis of shared interests, avatars can  be teleported and friends can be located online via  the system. Linden Lab offers numerous ways to  communicate via chat, varying from voice chat,  instant messaging to group chat. This way, Linden  Lab stimulates social interaction and networking  and, consequently, SL can be described as a social  virtual world.  Community building and sociality are essential  in social virtual worlds like SL. Boellstorff  2008,  pp. 232-233  mentions three encoded categories  of social relations in SL: “friend”, “partner”, and  “group”. During his fieldwork in SL, Boellstorff  found out that socializing with other residents,  developing friendships and investing “time and en- ergy in finding, making, and maintaining friends”  was  the  “most  common  activity”   Boellstorff,  2008, p. 157, 181 . Friendships, relationships, and  several forms of fruitful cooperation are undoubt- edly positive effects that are generated by SL, but  there are also negative effects, mostly defined by  the common term ‘griefing’, i.e. “behavior in a  virtual world intended to disrupt the experience  of others”  Boellstorff, 2008, p. 252 . Frequent  examples of griefing are, amongst others, sexual  assault, harassment, crudity, offensiveness, stalk- ing, stealing, fraud, and cheating.  310   Second Life, Second Morality?  Table 1.

The  interviews were semi-structured: the interviewer  started  from  an  interview  guide  with  a  set  of  pre-determined topics, but equally left scope for  discussion  in the focus groups  and excursions   in  the  individual  interviews .  Except  for  two  electronic interviews through Voice Over IP, all  interviews  were  face-to-face.  However,  given  the availability of audio and visual cues and the  synchronous course of communication, the VoIP  interview comes close to face-to-face interaction. We used purposive sampling strategy to select  the respondents. Considering the importance of  language in interpretive research, all respondents  in our study were Dutch-speaking  13 Belgian   and 1 Dutch participant . Another characteristic  important to our study was familiarity with SL.  All respondents first logged in between January  2005 and June 2007 and were actively engaged in  SL since three to five years. The time that they are  in-world varies from 4 hours per week  minimum   to 12 hours per day  maximum .  Apart  from  these  characteristics,  we  aimed  for a heterogeneous sample in order to explore  the diversity and multiplicity of moral practices  in SL. Dimensions of variety in the sample were  socio-demographics   gender,  age,  education,  SES , and the kind of investments, expectations,  and gratifications people show in their SL-visits  and -stays  see table 1 for overview .  In the analysis of the interview-transcripts, we  used a distinct set of so-called sensitizing concepts   Blumer, 1954  as interpretive devices that draw  attention to the key features of the overall research  problem  Patton, 2002 . For the sake of our argu-  311   Second Life, Second Morality?  ment, focus was on how social and technological  factors determine the definition of morally un  acceptable  values  and  behaviour  and  how  SL- residents make sense of the difference and simi- larity between online and offline, second life and  so-called first life experiences. Throughout the  coding process, i.e. the process of labelling seg- mented parts of the interview texts, we took a  double analytic approach to the interview data.  On the one hand, we assumed that the respondents’  statements refer to a reality that is experienced as  a  given,  external  reality   e.g.  the  existence  of  specific groups in SL . On the other hand, we  assumed  that  in  the  way  people  describe  their  experiences, they equally construct the world they  are part of  e.g. the categorizations they make of  other groups in SL   cf. Alasuutari, 1995; Silver- man, 2000 .  increasing recognition of the commitments, rules,  and conventions in SL and, especially, stronger  settling  in  social  groups.  When  one  becomes  more embedded in a close group, SL gets serious.  Increasing socialization  with the norms, skills,  and customs  and identification  with their avatar   typify the process of ‘growing up’ in SL.  For a comprehensible reflection on our find- ings, we have inductively demarcated our results  in three different fields. First, we discuss the cor- relation between motivations and main activities  on the one hand and perceptions of morally un  acceptable behaviour on the other. Second, we  elaborate on the moral consequences of anonym- ity, traceability, and sociality as experienced by  SL-residents.  Third,  we  consider  the  types  of  social  sanctions  the  SL-residents  we  talked  to  discern and display when dealing with practices  they morally disapprove of.  EXPLORATION OF THE FINDINGS  The Influence of Motives on Morality  In agreement with other studies  Markham, 1998;  Turkle, 1995; Boellstorff, 2008 , the respondents  in our study consider their involvement in a virtual  world as part of significant life experiences. To  them, ‘virtual’ most certainly does not equal ‘not  real’. As regular and mature users who have been  in-world  since  a  number  of  years,  they  all  ac- knowledge the avatars as representations of human  beings and identities and not as soulless objects.  Equally, SL is a social virtual world to them and  for that reason they ascribe high significance to  the group and community they belong to. Apart  from the solitary moments actively sought out to  create or build objects, the experiences they talk  about are together with others. Furthermore, our  respondents consider SL not as a noncommittal  game, but as a ‘real’ social world, which entails  a  ‘serious’  investment,  whether  in  personal,  emotional, psychological or professional terms.  In this context, we noticed that our respondents  talked about ‘growing up’ in SL. This process was  described in terms of growing avatar attachment,   The analysis of the interviews showed that mo- tives for participating in SL and main activities  displayed  in-world  regulate  personal  views  on  what residents believe is un acceptable behaviour.  Respondents who are in SL because of professional  reasons  in table 1 labelled under ‘work’ and ‘cre- ation’  are aware that they are being supervised  and, this way, they make no distinction between  SL-behaviour and real life behaviour. Throughout  the interviews these respondents showed them- selves as less emotionally involved, as their ties  in SL are mostly work-related and their activities  focus on professional gratification to explore the  innovative use of SL and to develop software.  These respondents accept telling untruths about  age or gender in SL easier than in real life. For  instance, R6 and R13 think lying about gender is  not bad, as long as they have a good conversation  and relation with this person.  However, they do have a problem with illegal  issues, such as underage residents, infringement  of intellectual property  e.g. the stealing of vir-  312   Second Life, Second Morality?  tual objects that have been created by others , or  having sex with a child or animal avatar. Also,  telling  untruths  about  profession-related  skills  and  experiences  is  deemed  bad.  For  example,  R1 planned to work together with someone she  met in SL and who had always been emphasizing  in SL how skilful she was. When, after meeting  her in real life, it became clear that she had been  lying, R1 took offence at the deception. Clearly,  this kind of moral indignation is distinguished  from the more emotionally invested moral reac- tions they witness in-world. By using labels like  ‘drama’ to describe the moral outrage of others, it  becomes clear that they distance themselves from  ‘the fuss’ others can make in-world. They realize  that one always has to be aware of cheaters and  not to take everything for truth or reality.  This professional-detached position contrasts  sharply with the approach taken by respondents  who are in-world for social reasons, which leads  to  higher  emotional  investment.  Respondents  who are looking for love or friendship, have more  problems with lies about age and gender, especially  when they are looking for a partner. Equally they  believe that violations of Linden Lab’s terms and  conditions are impermissible. In general, they hold  the conviction that playing with someone’s feel- ings must be punished. In their stories they suggest  that these basic principles influence their in-world  behaviour. They also believe that it is permitted to  make use of a wide range of technological tools  offered and enabled in SL. For instance, they do  not  denounce  spying  on  someone,  whether  by  creating an ‘alt’  i.e. an alternative avatar , asking  someone else to do it, saving chatlogs, or making  screenshots of disclosing behaviour.  What all respondents have in common is the  importance  they  ascribe  to  ‘SL-seniority’:  the  longer someone is online, the more trustable he  or she is. They are suspicious when someone pre- tends to be a ‘noob’, i.e. a new SL-resident, but  turns out to be very experienced with the specific  tools of SL  e.g. walking around, teleport, scripts,  textures . All respondents indicate that when you   have built a close relationship with someone and  have invested time, emotions, and energy in this  person, lies are not accepted. There is also a gen- eral belief that cheaters will eventually fail, for  instance by betraying themselves or by showing  discontinuity in their behaviour. Many respondents  also have the tendency to verify the truthfulness  of a person on the web, through search engines  like  Google  or  on  social  networking  sites  like  Facebook.  Anonymity, Traceability,  and Sociality  The  sense  of  anonymity  and,  related  to  that,  the sense of traceability have an effect on how  in-world morality is conceived of. Respondents   R1, R3, R9  who have linked their SL-profile to  information that makes the real life connection  explicit and traceability easier  e.g. name, web- site , show themselves more conscious about how  they present and represent themselves in SL. They  express a stricter sensitivity to self-regulation, as  R1 explained:  From the moment that you realize that everything  that your avatar does can be traced back to your  real person, you do very few things that you would  not do in real life  R1 .  Conversely, when you do not reveal real life  information and leave no traces of personal identity  data, it seems easier to disappear and to start again   with an alt, i.e. an alternative avatar  because you  have no commitments. Still, the respondents in  our research all shared the idea that the tendency  to remain anonymous and untraceable was only  tempting when making its entry in SL. The ease of  openly expressing emotions, flirting, telling lies,  hence, the appeal of disengaged and uncommit- ted social interactions clashes at a certain point  in time with the socialisation process residents go  through. More particularly, respondents who do  not share links to real life information experience   313   Second Life, Second Morality?  loss of clients or contacts. When they are accused  falsely, they defend themselves, either in-world  or on blogs and forums. Especially blogs are im- portant means to restore one’s reputation in the  group. For instance, R1 has been falsely accused  of lying about her gender and of copyright issues.  As a defense, she wrote an extensive piece on her  blog. Respondents also talk about others to learn  more about their reputation and to find out if they  are trustable to cooperate with.  Social Sanctions  Finally, the respondents in our study talked about  the different mechanisms they know and apply  when  confronted  with  morally  unacceptable  practices. First of all, it is important to note that  the residents, and not Linden Lab, seem to regu- late these forms of sanctioning. As an everyday,  familiar and concrete example of ‘unacceptable  behaviour’, we discussed with our respondents  cheating in the most general sense. In line with  other studies on online communities  e.g. teenag- ers and social networking sites, instant messaging  boards , the mechanisms virtual communities use  for sanctioning objectionable behaviour are pre- eminently  communicative   Reid,  1999;  Baym,  2010 .  First, there is sanction through inflated com- munication. This means that the deceived person  will inform others, often close friends, about what  has  happened.  Although  the  respondents  state  that they only do this when the damage is worth  mentioning, they equally suggest that it is more ac- cepted in SL to make commotion about less grave  harm. Clearly, this form of punishment is closely  linked to reputation, i.e. punishing the cheater by  gossip to ruin his or her reputation. Respondents  point out that this happens on a regular basis and  is conventional in SL.  Second,  punishing  unacceptable  behaviour  also takes place through non-communication. This  means that all contact will be broken in a quiet  way, for instance, by ignoring the harm-doer or   stricter self-regulation when they become embed- ded in a network. As they have been in-world for  an extensive period, they have invested resources  like time, energy, emotions, and money and they  do not want to put these at stake. During the years,  our respondents have collected a group of friends  and connections in-world and many of them have  also met in real life. Being embedded in a close  network leads to social control  group cohesion,  group regulation  and regulates behaviour. They  are less inclined to behave badly as this might  lead to a loss of friends or being kicked out of  the group  cf. infra . An interesting example is  R2, who has created a female alt and thus has  swapped gender in-world. He cannot get out of  this lie, because if he will reveal the truth, he will  lose his friends in-world:  It started as a game and it ended as friendship.  If I tell it, I will lose their friendship. I can’t get  out of it  R2 .  Therefore, the respondents in our study, who  have been in-world for an extensive period, simply  represent their actual identity in order to avoid  situations as described by R2. Other academic  research shows that people, who often engage in  virtual  environments,  including  digital  games,  prefer being themselves “rather than experiment  with new identities and personalities”  Yee, 2006,  p. 15 . Moreover, our respondents explained that  they often share personal information in intense  conversations and that they are connected to out- world  i.e. not in SL  social networks, both offline   e.g. meetings in real life  and online  connections  via Skype, MSN, Facebook, different blogs and  forums .  For  all  these  reasons,  managing  and  controlling lies, biased truths or fictionalized data  about oneself is far from easy.  Obviously, residents who work or create in- world are also embedded in a network, albeit a  professional  or  business  set  of  social  contacts.  To them, it is essential to have and to maintain a  good reputation, as a bad name might result in a   314   Second Life, Second Morality?  by muting him or her, which is technologically  possible in SL. This way, chances are high that  the harm-doer will eventually become an outcast  and disappear.  Finally,  the  respondents  in  our  study  agree  on the principle that victims of serious harm will  exclude the harm-doer from his or her community  and banish him of her from the communicative  sphere,  i.e.  punishment  by  excommunication.  The cheater will be pilloried, not only in-world  but also on blogs and forums.  Although  these  three  mechanisms  recall  practices  in  tribal  societies  as  has  been  dealt  with within anthropology, evolutionary psychol- ogy and moral sciences, the communication and  information technological tools of SL enable an  intensification and stronger coordination of social  sanctioning. Compared to real life, it becomes  easier for the deceived persons to start an active,  almost organized campaign against the cheater.  It is striking how much technological tools affect  social  behaviour,  and  more  specifically  forms  of punishment. If there are proofs, for instance  incriminating   disclosing   screenshots  or  chat- logs, they are distributed by the deceived ones.  It is important to point at the significance of the  blogosphere here: the reputation of the harm-doer  is actively damaged on different blogs, not only to  give a clear signal to the cheater, but also to warn  others for him or her. There are also forms of group  punishment to make clear that the harm-doer is  no longer allowed in the group, for instance by  collectively removing him or her out of the friend  list or by banning him or her from sims.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  Regarding social control and the in-world preven- tion and punishment of immoral behaviour, our  findings show that SL can be looked upon as a  microcosm of actual social life. This is in line with  other substantial empirical evidence demonstrat- ing that people behave in a similar way in virtual   environments as in actual world situations  e.g.  Yee, et al., 2007 . We also pointed at the fact that  our respondents are conscious of the person behind  the avatar, which is intrinsically linked to the idea  of virtual space as moral space. They not only  feel related to other residents within their group,  they show respect for residents with whom they  have established a social relationship  personal  or  professional ,  and  they  are  aware  of  moral  and social duties. This way, SL is not an isolated  world in which “no such things as morals exist”   Meadows, 2008, p. 78  nor a separated world  for which users have a ‘second’ morality. Similar  to actual life, activities in virtual worlds include  various types of social interaction like hanging out  with friends, collaborating in groups, establishing  intimate relationships, and starting love affairs. As  a consequence, several aspects of human sociality  occur in SL, because residents take real life social  conventions and conduct with them.  However, as social virtual worlds like SL are  technologically  designed  and  constructed,  the  question how moral practices are contingent on,  activated by or disabled through technology needs  also to be taken into consideration. We already  pointed  at  the  complexity  of  cheating,  as  the  different views on what respondents consider as  unacceptable behaviour depend on their personal  perception  of  SL  and  their  in-world  activities.  Nevertheless, if someone has done serious harm  in SL, it feels unjust and, analogous to real life,  the  behaviour  must  be  punished  to  restore  the  harmony. It is remarkable to see how residents  make use of technological tools to start a well- structured  campaign  against  a  harm-doer   cf.  supra, excommunication . Organizing a similar  campaign in real life would be more complex,  simply because the tools are lacking  friend list,  screenshots, chatlogs . Also, causing commotion  and drama because of a harm-doer seems more  accepted in SL than in actual life.  The public debate on morality in social virtual  worlds is heavily framed in ‘moral panic’-terms.  Many express their worries about these worlds   315   Second Life, Second Morality?  Anderson, C.

Interestingly, our data put these panics into  perspective,  as  we  see  that  different  kinds  of  social mechanisms restrict unrestrained immoral  behaviour. Being traceable, being embedded in a  network, group cohesion, social control, amongst  others, lead to both self- and group-regulation.  Also, our respondents are ‘normal’ people as op- posed to deviant and pathological. This contrasts  with the stereotypical portrayal of a frequent user  of virtual worlds in various popular media: ugly,  isolated, alienated, escapist, and failed in his or  her first life. Obviously, we must point out that we  have been dealing with residents who were willing  to participate and to open up about experiences  that  have  been  heavily  stigmatized  in  various  discourses. This study, albeit explorative, local,  and small-scale, has aimed to contribute to a better  understanding of lived experiences and meanings.  In the future, the cultural and social diversity of  SL-residents, SL-groups, and SL-sims will need  to be taken more into account in order to reveal  similarities and differences. Also, the question of  how to study continuity and discontinuity between  so-called first life and second life morality keeps  bringing with it methodological challenges.

Many residents of   Second Life have one or more alts.  Morality: Morals and morality refer respec- tively to the habits and norms that are given within  a specific cultural context, and to the individual  reflection of those norms into personal codes of  conduct. We speak of morality when a subject is  conscious of his or her conduct, i.e. when personal  behaviour is reflected in an awareness that is not  determined by a supra-personal normative source.  319   Second Life, Second Morality?

We investigate the notions of belong- ing and community in 3D virtual worlds, and identify the ways in which “belonging” and “not belong- ing” are constructed and perceived, especially in relation to so-called employee avatars. We explore  the dimension of social stigma in virtual worlds and discuss the utility of the separate categories of  outsiders and interlopers for inhabitant characterization. Our motivation for doing so is to determine  the degree to which corporate presence can be mediated through the specific mechanism of employee  avatar appearance. In considering the possibility that some employee avatars may be perceived as  interlopers, we propose three methods for investigating the effect of their presence in virtual worlds,  called the “interloper effect.”  INTRODUCTION  Social virtual worlds such as Second Life are not  only a place in which users can socialize with  one another; companies have also turned to these  environments in order to explore new ways to  connect with one another, recruit new hires, and  offer  virtual  world  services   Brandon,  2007 .  Because of the complex nature of these environ-  DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch021  ments, social virtual worlds have been the subject  of a number of high-level discussions surrounding  online identity and online communities.  In addition to being a social virtual world, Sec- ond Life differs from other virtual worlds in that  its users can conduct monetary business with one  another directly through the use of Linden dollars   L$ , Second Life’s own virtual currency. Cur- rently, one can purchase 261 Linden dollars for one  US dollar.1 This differs from the economic systems  present in other popular game-based worlds, such   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  as World of Warcraft  http:  www.worldofwarcraft. com , in that the direct conversion between real  world currency and virtual currency is generally  not a feature of these environments.2 This ability to  conduct monetary exchange, in combination with  the ability to create virtual objects within Second  Life, has led real world companies such as IBM  and Sun Microsystems to invest in developing  content for, and having a presence in, this virtual  world  Brandon, 2007 .  This  chapter  focuses  on  the  virtual  world  professionals being deployed within Second Life  by companies and the appearance of their avatars.  Virtual world professionals are considered to be  persons who are deployed within a virtual world,  such as Second Life, for the purpose of representing  their company or organization within the virtual  world.  We  may  also  further  distinguish  these  persons from other members of the virtual world  community by describing the avatar they create  and maintain for this purpose as an “employee  avatar.” In this distinction, we acknowledge the  fact that these virtual world professionals may  maintain more than one avatar in the same virtual  environment; one or more for personal use and  one for professional use.  Current literature on avatars and avatar ap- pearance focuses primarily on the psychological  aspects of the relationship between the human  pilot and the avatar  e.g., Dibbell, 2001 , or the  mechanics  of  avatar  creation  interfaces   Pace,  Houssian, & McArthur, 2009 . In considering how  and why users customize their avatars a number  of  key motivating factors have been identified  in the literature, such as the desire to create an  idealized version of oneself  Ducheneaut, Wen,  Yee, & Wadley, 2009 , and fitting in  Neustaedter  & Fedorovskaya, 2008 . However, little attention  has been given to the appearance and behaviour  of avatars created for professional interactions in  virtual worlds. This chapter seeks to explore the  mechanics  of  avatar  creation  for  virtual  world  professionals and employee avatar appearance.  Specifically, how are virtual world profession-  322  als customizing their avatars and how are these  avatars perceived by other members of the virtual  community?  Interestingly enough, Second Life is not the  first multi-user virtual environment to be used  by professionals. A paper by Churchill and Bly   1999  identified the use of text-based MUDs in  the workplace. In their paper, the authors presented  the results of a series of in-depth interviews with  8  professionals  using  MUDs  for  work-related  interactions. The results revealed that use of the  MUD filled a valuable communication niche for  these distributed, off-site employees. The authors  described these text-based virtual rooms as giv- ing users a sense of “space” in which they can  feel “co-present.” On using the MUD to interact  with co-workers, interviewees expressed mixed  feelings.  While  some  enjoyed  using  the  space  for  collaboration,  others  disliked  the  metaphor  and preferred the use of email. One respondent  commented  that  she,  “has  multiple  characters   or ‘avatars’  and uses [the MUD] for social and  work purposes.”  RELATED WORK  For many users, the avatar is not only a means to  achieving agency within the virtual space; it is  the vessel which is an integral component of their  online identity  Meadows, 2008 . The ability to  customize our bodies in virtual worlds allows us  to fine tune how we represent ourselves in this  space. The creation and modification of an avatar  in a particular virtual world is always mediated by  the tools provided in that world; a factor that is  known to its inhabitants and that actually plays a  role in the formation of social perceptions. These  are often known as character creation interfaces,  or avatar editors.  While a great deal of research has examined  avatars and identity, comparatively little work has  been done to examine the mechanics of avatar  customization. Due to space constraints, this chap-   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  ter only discusses a handful of articles pertaining  to avatar customization in social virtual worlds.  Avatar Customization  Papers by Ducheneaut et. al  2009 and Neustaedter  and Fedorovskaya  2008  have identified some of  the motivating factors that guide users in custom- izing their avatars a particular way.  In Body and Mind, Ducheneaut et. al  2009   note a lack of data explaining how and why users  customize their avatars, as well as the user ease  and satisfaction with existing avatar creation tools.  They report on a study investigating these issues  through a questionnaire administered to more than  one hundred users of three virtual worlds: Maple  Story, World of Warcraft, and Second Life.  In their attempt to characterize the motivations  for the avatar modification trends they observed,  they identified three conceptual factors that they  hypothesized were contributing factors: idealized  self, standing out, and following a trend. The first  conceptual factor is self-explanatory: users may  choose to create an avatar that may bear some  resemblance to their real-life appearance, but with  idealized or desired features. The second factor  applied to users whose choice in avatar reflects  a desire to have an unconventional look, where  unconventional is described as being an avatar that  stand out as much as possible or whose appear- ance is drastically different from that of the user’s  appearance IRL  in real life . The third describes  avatars  that  have  been  modified  to  resemble  a  celebrity or reflect a popular trend in either the  real world or the virtual world.  Comparatively, Neustaedter and Fedorovskaya   2008   identify  four  conceptual  factors  which  they hypothesize are at play in avatar appearance  trends: realistics, ideals, fantasies, and roleplay- ers. According to the authors, the first describes  users who consider their virtual world life to be  an extension of their real world life and therefore  choose to create an avatar that most closely re- sembles themselves. The second is more in line   with the idealized self described by Ducheneaut et.  al  2009 . Fantasies are described as being users  who desire an entirely different life in the virtual  world. Lastly, roleplayers are described as being  users who, like fantasies, enter the virtual world  to experience life as someone else, but differ from  this category in that they do not maintain identity  continuity over time. The authors note that avatar  appearance editors may or may not meet users’  needs depending on which of the four aforemen- tioned factors represent their virtual lives.  A particularly interesting component of Neus- taedter and Fedorovskaya’s paper is the discussion  surrounding the social stigma of default avatars  in  Second  Life. As  was  mentioned  previously,  upon joining Second Life, new users are prompted  to choose an avatar from one of several default  configurations before entering the virtual world.  Once  in-world,  many  users  learn  to  customize  the appearance of their avatar through use of the  appearance editor, as well as potentially buying,  acquiring, or making new clothes, hair, animations,  for  their  avatar  to  wear  or  use. An  illustration  of the differences between the appearance of a  default avatar and one that has undergone much  modification is shown in Figure 1.  Once  members  of  the  community  become  familiar  with  the  malleability  of  Second  Life  avatars, they are easily able to identify default  avatars. The authors note that so-called veteran  users identify users with default avatars as being  “newbies.”  The  effect  of  this  social  stigma  is  twofold:  veterans  view  newbies  as  lacking  in  ability and assume that any social interaction with  a default avatar will be related to technical issues  surrounding the virtual environment. The second  effect is that newbies feel the need to modify the  appearance of their avatar as quickly as possible  so that their avatar signifies “belonging” to the  community.  From this it is very clear that the social signals  triggered by avatar appearance have weight. Ad- ditionally, it is clear that there are ways to signal  belonging and similarity between interactants in   323   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  Figure  1.  Avatar  with  default  cybergoth  attributes   left   compared  to  specialized  personal   attributes  right   order  to  have  successful  social  interactions  in  virtual worlds. Other related work has investigated  the link between credibility and avatar appearance,  specifically with regard to anthropomorphic and  non-anthropomorphic avatars. In the context of  this chapter, we refer to an anthropomorphic avatar  as being a non-human avatar with human traits,  such as a “furry”  see Figure 2 .3  Non-Anthropomorphic Avatars and  Credibility  Even though avatar bodies in Second Life begin  as human bodies, users can easily create or pur- chase  avatar  shapes  of  other  anthropomorphic  and non-anthropomorphic bodies. This has lead  researchers to explore how credibility is linked  to avatar appearance in virtual worlds and online  environments  McGloin, et. al 2009; Nowak &  Rauh, 2005, 2008  and how the presence of non-  anthropomorphic avatars effect social interaction   Morie & Verhuldonck, 2008 .  In exploring the link between credibility and  avatar choice in instant messaging, Nowak and  Rauh  2005, 2008  conducted a series of stud- ies. In the first step, 255 participants filled out a  survey where they rated a set of 30 static avatars  on their credibility, androgyny, and anthropomor- phism. The second step was a between subjects  experiment with 230 participants who interact with  partners represented by one of 8 avatars  high and  low androgyny, and anthropomorphism by high  and low credibility .  Results  of  this  study  revealed  that  avatar  characteristics  are  used  in  the  person  percep- tion  process.  Participant  perceptions  of  avatar  androgyny  influenced  their  perceptions  of  an- thropomorphism, which influenced attributions  of both avatar and partner credibility. Ultimately  they found that chat partners who used more an-  324   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  Figure 2. Non-humanoid avatars in Second Life – anthropomorphic avatars or “furries”  left  and the  flying spaghetti monster  right 4  drogynous avatars were perceived as being less  credible than less androgynous partners. In addi- tion to this, they also found that those participants  with more instant messenger experience saw their  partners as more credible regardless of the avatar  that represented them.  McGloin  et.  al   2009   conducted  a  similar  survey using the dimensions of credibility pro- posed by McCroskey and Yong  1981  in order to  investigate how avatar appearance influences the  processing of messages associated with avatars.  Specifically,  they  investigated  the  relationship  between credibility of text and credibility of avatar  choice. Participants in this study were presented  with what appeared to be a screenshot of a web  page designed to look like a popular electronics  retail site complete with customer reviews. Vari- ants on the stimulus included pairings of high or  low credibility avatars with high or low credibility  text. For example, a low credibility avatar, such as a  dinosaur, might be paired with a highly informative  and well-written product review. The results of this  study revealed that avatar credibility was predicted  by perceptions of avatar anthropomorphism and  realism. Additionally, review credibility seemed  to be more dependent on avatar credibility than  the credibility of the actual text. An even more   interesting result of this study was the positive  link between avatar homophily and source trust. While McGloin’s results might imply that there  is a certain comfort in the use of humanoid avatars,  it is important to consider the environment for  which the hypothesis was tested. While deviance  from “real world” ideals had a negative impact on  review credibility in an online store, this might not  be the case in every computer-mediated environ- ment. Consider the differences between the social  climate of an online website hosting reviews of  commercial products and a social virtual world  such as Second Life. In many social virtual worlds,  the  social  climate  is  “co-constructed”  between  its users.5 We refer to this as the co-constructed  nature of virtual worlds.  The Co-Constructed Nature  of Virtual Worlds  The  hypotheses  presented  in  this  chapter  are  largely based on the co-constructed nature of vir- tual worlds. Virtual worlds, whether text-based or  three-dimensional, have presented us with a new  space in which to communicate with others and  build new communities. In the early text-based  MUDs, users utilized text to create their physical   325   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  surroundings. Users would describe the “rooms”  they occupied in great detail, and these descriptions  were generally agreed upon, and co-authored with  the other inhabitants  Turkle, 1997 .  The co-constructed nature of virtual worlds  is  not  limited  to  atmosphere  and  décor;  social  contracts  also  emerged  within  these  digital  spheres. While a text-based virtual life may seem  insignificant compared to our physical lives, the  literature illustrates how deeply connected we are  to our other selves. In his article “A Rape in Cy- berspace”, Dibbell  2001  describes a “cyberrape”  that  occurred  in  a  MUD  called  LambdaMOO.  A  user  piloting  an  avatar  by  the  name  of  Mr.  Bungle  utilized  a  “voodoo  doll”  program  that  allowed him to essentially describe actions and  falsely attribute them to other player characters.  Mr. Bungle decided to use this program to make  it appear as though other player characters were  performing a variety of sexually explicit acts to  themselves,  to  other  player  characters,  and  to  Mr. Bungle. The human pilots, although safe in  real life, were subjected to reading this text and  having it appear as though it had originated from  their own keyboards. Still, the incidents involving  Mr. Bungle and the “voodoo doll” program left  users  feeling  violated  and  raised  awareness  of  user embedded values associated with avatar use. The experience of constructing and sharing a  virtual space of this nature also involves the co- construction of social contracts and their evolution.  The difference between the social contracts in these  spheres is perhaps best illustrated by Rheingold as  he recounts his experiences in joining an online  community called the WELL:  It became clear to me during the first months of  that history that I was participating in the self- design of a new kind of culture. I watched the  community’s social contracts stretch and change  as the people who discovered and started building  the WELL in its first year or two were joined by so  many others. Norms were established, challenged,   326  changed, re-established, rechallenged, in a kind  of speeded-up social evolution  Rheingold, 1999 .  The fact that Second Life’s areas are divided  up into individual islands makes it ideal for the  compartmentalization of communities, their aes- thetics, and social contracts. One such example  is best illustrated in Meadows’ I, Avatar, which  describes the different social contracts and resul- tant interaction between Furries and Gor in Second  Life  Meadows, 2008 .  Virtual World Professionals and  Avatar Appearance Codes  Professional appearance in real-world situations  is important in business relations. For this reason  it is not uncommon for corporations to employ  dress codes, which can extend beyond attire to  deal with hair colour and body piercing. These  are  the  properties  of  appearance  that  are  most  easily manipulated in the real world. The degree  to which one can manipulate the appearance of  one’s avatar in Second Life is almost infinite by  comparison. The avatar editor in Second Life al- lows users to control every aspect of their avatar’s  appearance with great precision. For this reason,  it is easy to consider how the notion of the dress  code could easily become an “appearance code”  when applied to virtual worlds  McArthur, 2008 . With regard to avatar appearance codes, how  detailed are these policies and do they match the  ideals of the virtual world? If a company wishes  to court members of the virtual community, how  will their employees be received? If the appear- ance  code  is  simply  a  direct  mapping  of  “real  life” ideals of professionalism onto virtual world  professionals, an appearance code could elicit a  negative effect. Preliminary work conducted in  2009 investigating employee avatar appearance  and avatar appearance codes suggests that a small  number of real world companies do employ such  policies  McArthur & Baljko, 2009 . Some par- ticipants in that study stated that their company    Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  expected  that  representative  avatars  be  human  with professional or business-casual attire. Other  participants stated that the policy only required  that avatars be clothed and that representatives use  common sense when making decisions regard- ing how their avatar looks and behaves within  the virtual world. Interestingly, in our data we  discovered that none of the policies neglected to  address the issue of non-human avatars.  If avatar appearance can signal “belonging”  within Second Life, what effects might an overly  corporate  appearance  code  have  on  employee  avatars?  One  proposed  effect  of  such  a  policy  is the “interloper effect”  McArthur & Baljko,  2009 . This term is borrowed from evolutionary  biology  Smurda & Haselton, 2002 , and in the  context of this work it is used to describe the dif- ferences among attributions of professionalism  and belonging in virtual worlds.  THE INTERLOPER EFFECT  In the case of employee-identified avatars, an over- ly corporate avatar may have a negative effect on  a virtual world professional’s social interactions.  This can occur if the appearance code is simply  a direct mapping of “real life” ideals of profes- sionalism onto virtual world professionals, where  the members of the community who are not there  in a corporate capacity may have intentionally left  these ideals out. We therefore hypothesize that an  appearance code could have a negative effect on  how virtual world professionals are received by  members of the community.  The  pragmatics  of  avatar  modification  has  several facets. First, the particular selections made  with respect to hair, clothing, and skin each have  their own social signals. But in addition, there  is a shared understanding among the members  of  the  on-line  world  as  to  what  these  choices  entailed --- the technical difficulty or ease or the  “monetary” expense of a particular choice. The  choices that a user makes have a social signal   that extends beyond mere appearance. What is  at work here is not only a user’s ability to use an  avatar appearance editor in a particular way, but  also the shared knowledge about the capabilities  of the appearance editor. Since the capabilities  off the appearance editor are known within the  community, how one customizes their avatar can  signal their intentions within the community.  In  the  case  of  employee  avatars,  the  actual  appearance  of  the  particular  avatar,  combined  with  the  shared  knowledge  about  how  appear- ance editing works, can signal to the community  that an appearance code has been imposed. For  example, clothing with logos are not part of the  default repertoire of appearance attributes, so those  encountering an avatar who is sporting such an  article of clothing will deduce that the encountered  user must have made some deliberate additional  appearance modifications, either by purchasing the  item in-world, or by creating the item themselves. An online survey administered in late 2008  investigated employee avatar appearance for 37  virtual world professionals  McArthur, 2010 . Of  those 37, only 5 indicated that the appearance of  their avatar was governed by an avatar appear- ance code. When asked if the policy addresses  non-human avatars, all participants indicated yes,  with three indicating that non-human avatars are  allowed by the policy.  Since we expected the specifics of each policy  to vary, thee participants were presented with ad- ditional open-ended questions that were designed  to gather the details of these policies. When asked  to describe the appearance code, some participants  stated  that  their  company  expected  that  repre- sentative avatars be human with professional or  business-casual attire. Other participants stated  that the policy only required that avatars be clothed  and that representatives use common sense when  making decisions regarding how their avatar looks  and behaves within the virtual world.  Next, participants were asked how much this  policy has evolved over the course of its use. All  participants indicated that the policy has remained   327   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  substantively unchanged since its inception. Three  of these participants did note that the policy had  been implemented after the company or organiza- tion had moved into Second Life.  Lastly, we asked participants whether or not  they  felt  as  though  their  company’s  policy  is  suitable for virtual world professionals deployed  within Second Life. Responses to this question  varied greatly. Two participants indicated agree- ment with the statement. Two participants sug- gested that the appearance codes were not very  suitable  for  3D  virtual  worlds,  but  understood  that the policies had been implemented so as to  avoid offending clientele. The remaining partici- pant expressed a lack of personal interest in the  existence of the policy.  So while the sample size was small, it is clear  that there may be mixed feelings among virtual  world professionals regarding the appropriateness  of policies governing employee avatar appearance.  It is interesting to note that, while the five policies  discussed varied, none of the policies neglected to  address the issue of non-human avatars. Clearly  those creating the policies have some understand- ing of the malleability of avatars in Second Life  if their policies include such guidelines, but what  is the basis for allowing or not allowing furries? Neustaedter and Fedorovskaya  2008  docu- mented the degree to which social stigma was  associated with an inhabitant’s use of the default  appearance characteristics in Second Life. If an  inhabitant’s failure to modify their avatar’s default  appearance had the deleterious effect of marking  him or her as and outsider in relation to the com- munity, what other types of avatar configurations  may have a detrimental effect on social interac- tion? In the case of avatar appearance codes, could  corporate governance have a detrimental effect on  in-world relations, and if so, how would we clas- sify this effect? We turn to evolutionary biology  and the idea of interlopers in order to formulate  a  hypothesis  and  methodological  approach  in  exploring this.  328  Interlopers in Social Virtual Worlds  Within the field of evolutionary biology, a particu- lar phenomenon has been identified with respect  to  interlopers.  The  phenomenon  concerns  the  differences  among  attributions  of  sexual  inter- est among different perceivers: if the perceiver  is a person who is in a committed relationship  with the purported target of the sexual interest,  then the degree of sexual interest is perceived as  much greater than if the perceiver is outside of  the relationship. In commonplace terms, the per- ception of the threat is heightened for the party  which is actually facing the threat, as opposed to  a bystander.  In order to illustrate how the idea of interlop- ers can be adapted to describe employee avatars  in  virtual  worlds,  the  parallels  are  outlined  as  follows: In evolutionary biology, the “interloper  effect” refers to  1  the heightened awareness of   2  sexual advances by  3  couples in committed  relationships. The interloper is therefore perceived  as  4  threatening the ideals of the committed rela- tionship. Adapted to virtual worlds, the “interloper  effect” refers to the  1  heightened awareness of   2  social presence by  3  members of a virtual  community.  The  interloper  is  perceived  as   4   threatening the ideals of the virtual community. What makes the interloper effect so interesting  is that the actions of the one who has been labelled  “interloper” in evolutionary biology may actually  be completely benign in nature. One such false  positive is outlined in an article by Haselton and  Nettle  2006  in which they describe how social  interaction between one’s mate and an attractive  other  can  result  in  the  other  being  labelled  as  interloper – even if their actions are not sexu- ally or romantically charged. This is what really  gives the term mobility in the context of virtual  world professionals; the interloper effect is not  dependent on the actual intentions of the virtual  world professionals, just the perception of them  via the members of the community.   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  The interloper effect in virtual worlds, thus,  would be a phenomenon concerning a difference  between the perceptions of the world’s inhabitants  and the perceptions of those observing the world  from outside  McArthur & Baljko, 2009 . This  is an important hypothesis for study because the  individuals who are charged with the creation of  “appearance  code”  corporate  governance   e.g.,  those with HR affiliations  could very well be the  “outside observers” to the virtual worlds. If so, then  there very well could be a misalignment between  the goals of the “appearance code” and its actual  effect once deployed. While the appearance code  may have been created in order to ensure profes- sionalism in-world, the policy could potentially be  perceived as threatening the community’s ideals.  This is especially apparent when we consider the  cultural compartmentalization of specific islands  in Second Life, and how non-compliance within  those areas can be considered offensive.  When  one  considers  the  etymology  of  the  “interloper” – the term may seem unnecessarily  harsh. In the English language, the word inter- loper refers to persons or things who are not only  considered to be outsiders; their presence is not  only unwanted – it is also considered by some  definitions to be disruptive. Most likely, virtual  world professionals are not entering this sphere  in order to infiltrate and interfere in the affairs of  Second Life citizens, but how is their presence  perceived by others? Since our interactions are  mediated by our avatars in this space, we must  first look to employee avatars in order to explore  this idea of the interloper.  PROPOSED METHODS  FOR INVESTIGATING THE  INTERLOPER EFFECT  In order to determine whether or not an interloper  effect is elicited, two methods based on established  methodologies are proposed within this section.  Method 1: Ethnographic Study  Looking to some of the more prominent theories  of online ethnographic studies proposed by Correll   1995 , Hine  2000 , and Kozinets  1998, 2002,  2006 , a pilot study was designed to collect data  on virtual world professionals and the appearance  of their avatars. In our pilot study, we visited sev- eral corporate sites in Second Life and collected  data in the form of interviews, observations, and  screen  shots. To  extend  this  methodology  to  a  study of the interloper effect, researchers would  also collect the same data about the interactions  between employee avatars and members of the  virtual  world  community.  The  data  collected  would  include  observations  about  the  interac- tions  between  employee-identified  avatars  and  personal  avatars,  as  well  as  follow-up  survey  data. A follow-up survey might include a list of  questions intended to determine how the pilot of  the  personal  avatar  felt  about  their  interaction  with the employee-identified avatar.  Unfortunately, while the data we collected in  our pilot study was very informative, a we encoun- tered a few technical limitations, some of which  are specific to Second Life. Firstly, when leaving  an island in Second Life, it is not uncommon for  users to teleport to another location, rather than  walking or flying away. Additionally, users may  also excuse themselves from the social interac- tion in order to log out of Second Life. While it  would not be impossible to follow up with users  who have teleported or logged out, the likeliness  that such a participant declines an offer to follow  up with the researcher presents a major issue. In  addition to this, the popularity of Second Life for  use by real world companies appears to be on the  decline  possibly due to the more recent economic  crisis . With this in mind, acquiring enough data  with the aforementioned follow-up issues presents  a problem with regard to quantitative analysis.  329   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  Method 2: Survey  One possible alternative to the in-world ethno- graphic study is one that is based purely on online  surveys. Researchers who have opted to collect  data from virtual world users via surveys have had  a great deal of success in securing large numbers  of respondents  e.g., Ducheneaut, et al., 2009 . In  exploring the interloper effect, questions used in  this survey could be based on surveys designed by  Nowak & Rauh  2005  and McGloin et. al  2009 ,  which  investigated  the  influence  avatar  choice  has on users’ perceptions of credibility. In these  studies, users were presented with visual stimulus  representing different avatar configurations and  then asked a series of Likert scale questions to  determine  users’  perceptions  of  anthropomor- phism and credibility. The questions are based on  categories of credibility proposed by McCroskey  & Yong  1981 .  While we aren’t investigating credibility spe- cifically, many of the dimensions of credibility  are relevant to the interloper effect. For example,  elements  from  the  sociability  dimension   e.g.,  “friendly” and “trustworthy”  as well as the com- petence dimension  e.g., “informed” and “intel- ligent”  are some of the key components we wish  to  investigate.  Users’  perceptions  of  employee  avatars with regard to these dimensions can help  us  understand  how  different  configurations  of  employee avatars are perceived by members of  the virtual community.  A  similar  survey  could  be  administered  to  members of the virtual world community in or- der to determine if employee-identified avatars  do elicit an interloper effect. A series of images  representing various configurations of employee- identified avatars, would be presented to partici- pants. Multiple offerings of each of the variants  would be produced in order to include male and  female avatars, as well as varying degrees of cor- porate branding and alternative dress. The survey  would be designed to be within-subjects, where  all  participants  would  be  exposed  to  the  same   330  stimulus, but the order in which each participant  was  presented  with  each  of  the  images  would  be randomized. This counterbalancing measure  would be implemented to offset any exposure or  ordering effect.  Figure  3  illustrates  how  the  dimensions  of  credibility  McCroskey & Yong 1981  might be  applied to this survey. Participants would be ex- posed to each image, one at a time, and asked to  rate the avatar based on the dimensions presented. The image in the above figure only represents  one  of  the  many  configurations  for  employee  avatars that would be tested. The images shown  in  Figure  4  are  representative  of  some  of  the  other configurations that should be tested. While  the attire, skin, and hair of each of the avatars are  strikingly different, their pose and body language  is identical. All of the avatars in the table have  identified  themselves  as  representatives  of  a  company through the use of group tags. In Second  Life, the group tag is a textual affiliation marker  that floats above the avatar’s name. Based on our  observations in the aforementioned pilot study,  we have dressed these avatars in three different  styles of clothing: casual attire, business or busi- ness casual attire, and branded attire. In the con- text of this chapter, casual attire can include, but  is  not  limited  to  costumes,  period  clothing,  gothic or alternative attire. The term “casual” was  chosen to provide a category for all observed at- tire that did not fall under what we considered to  fall outside of the commonly accepted categories  of business attire.  The  appearances  of  variants  B,  and  C  are  closely aligned with “offline” configurations of  professional dress whereas variant A takes into  account the social climate of Second Life. Variant  B pushes the boundaries with regard to business- appropriate attire in real-life, but her attire does  not carry the same social stigma in Second Life.  Understanding the differences between the two  spheres  is  critical  when  creating  policies  like  avatar appearance codes.   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  Figure 3. Sample survey page for the Survey Method  Figure 4. Three possible configurations for employee-identified avatars in Second Life6  331   Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  By creating an online survey to investigate the  interloper effect, one would likely retain a higher  number of participants, but the results of the survey  would  have  low  external  validity  compared  to  the aforementioned in-world observation-based  experiment.  For  example,  while  participants’  initial  reactions  to  certain  images  representing  employee-identified avatars might indicate that  there is indeed an interloper effect, there’s no tell- ing how their opinion of the avatar would change  over time if they were to interact with it directly  in Second Life. Also, additional cues as provided  by the “pilot” of that avatar would probably con- tribute to the participant’s overall perception of the  employee-identified avatar. If the pilot was very  friendly and outgoing in-world, the participant  may rate them as being friendlier on McCroskey’s  scale than they would have otherwise.  Method 3: Hybrid  Both Method 1 and Method 2 have their strengths  and  weaknesses. While  Method  1  represents  a  more sound ethnographic study with high exter- nal validity, the aforementioned limitations are  problematic. Method 2 is a much more controlled  experiment as all participants would be exposed  to the same stimulus. The higher internal validity  of Method 2, combined with the ability to secure  more participants does make Method 2 seem ideal. However, the limitations of Method 2 alone  cannot be ignored. For example, the scripts a user  chooses to adopt to control their avatar’s body  language may impact how they are received in- world; and why not? Bailenson and Beall  2006   identified  how  Transformed  Social  Interaction  can affect our persuasiveness when interacting  with others in virtual environments.  TSI can be broken down into two categories:  transforming avatar appearance and transforma- tions  of  avatar  behaviour.  In  transformations  of  avatar  behaviour,  the  authors  note  how  the  chameleon effect can be easily transferred over  into the virtual world. The chameleon effect is   332  described as a component of social interaction in  which an interactant mimics nonverbal behaviour  of persons they are interacting with. The result  is that the other person is more easily influenced  by the person who mimics their body language  and mannerisms. Bailenson and Beall note that  algorithms which generate an avatar’s body lan- guage in a virtual world could be easily captured  and applied to other avatars.  So, while a static image of an employee ava- tar might elicit a response that either proves or  disproves the interloper effect, a brief encounter  with that same avatar in-world might generate  the opposite effect. Thus, with the strengths and  weaknesses  of  both  methods  in  mind,  a  third,  hybrid method is proposed. In this method, re- searchers would take advantage of both the rich  ethnographic data available in the virtual world  as well as the internal validity of the survey, like  the one utilized by Nowak and Rauh  2008 .  In order to investigate the affects of anthro- pomorphism  in  instant  messaging,  Nowak  and  Rauh conducted a study in two phases: survey  and  experiment.  The  survey  phase  was  very  similar to the methodology described in Method  2: participants were exposed to 30 images in a  static context and asked to rate them on various  dimensions of credibility. In the second phase, the  researchers conducted a between subjects experi- ment in which participants chatted in pairs using  instant  messaging  software.  Participants  were  represented by one of the avatars used in the first  phase of the experiment and were asked to rate  the avatar that represented their chat partner as  well as their chat partner’s credibility.  While  the  external  validity  of  an  in-house  chat program might be lower than a study that  involved more realistic variability, the fact that  this study was conducted in the medium it studied  is key. Similarly, a hybrid method that includes  the survey discussed in Method 2 and an experi- ment involving a controlled condition in a virtual  world  like Nowak and Rauh’s instant messaging  program  would likely result in more conclusive    Virtual World Professionals and the Interloper Effect in 3D Virtual Worlds  data. This could involve the construction of an in- house virtual environment, using something like  Open Wonderland, a Java open source toolkit for  creating collaborative 3D virtual worlds.  CONCLUSION  In 2007, John Brandon wrote an article for PC  Advisor ranking the top 8 real world businesses to  enter Second Life and set up shop. In this article,  Brandon describes how each company has ex- tended its operations into the virtual world. Visitors  to Pontiac’s site could test drive virtual models  of real Pontiac vehicles. Members of Best Buy’s  Geek Squad, a technical support team, clocked-in  to Second Life and offered their services to cus- tomers visiting the virtual location. At the time  of the article, IBM had over 12 islands  virtual  properties  in Second Life and used them for train- ing, meetings, and recruitment. IBM even offered  design solutions for other companies interested  in having a presence in Second Life.  A lot has changed since Brandon’s article. In  early 2010, IBM has a strong presence in Second  Life,  occupying  over  35  islands  in-world.  Sun  still has three islands as of January 2010, but two  of them are private and the third is empty. One  explanation for this might be that Sun employees  have  moved  into  MPK20,  Sun’s  virtual  office  building  Lynch, 2008 . While their reasons for  all but abandoning Second Life are not clear, they  do state that MPK20 gives their non-collocated  employees a feeling of shared space and is meant  to allow for the types of spontaneous interactions  and collaborative moments that happen in shared  physical spaces, where a co-worker stops by your  office to see what you’re doing. Interestingly, this  idea is very similar to the idea of shared space as  discussed in Churchill and Bly’s paper  1999 .  Dell and Cisco still have a handful of islands, but  there were no employee avatars present. The other  businesses described as “the top 8” in Brandon’s   article are no longer present. Their islands aren’t  just unpopulated, they no longer exist.  While only a couple of the top 8 still maintain  their presence in Second Life, companies continue  to  look  to  virtual  worlds  for  online  meetings,  events, training, and marketing. The Second Life  home page now has a section devoted to offering  such services online  Linden Research, 2010 . This  section of the website lists many of the companies,  academic institutions, and government organiza- tions utilizing Second Life for work. Organizations  such as Children’s Memorial Hospital Chicago  and  Northrop  Grumman  have  even  provided  case studies outlining their use of Second Life in  augmenting their practices.  The information presented in this chapter can  assist researchers with the ongoing study of avatar  interactions in 3D virtual worlds. This information  should also be beneficial to organizations that have  developed, or are considering developing policies  for employee avatar appearance. Familiarity with  the social climate of the virtual world in question,  as well as an understanding of the social signals  associated with avatar appearance, is necessary if  these policies are to facilitate interactions in the  virtual  world. These  policies  cannot  be  forged  by simply grafting the ideals of the offline world  directly onto the virtual world.

Rosas  Grégory Dhen  Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium  ABSTRACT This chapter provides a critical discourse analysis of French-speaking players’ personal and collective  identity construction in World of Warcraft. Based on sixteen semi-structured interviews conducted online,  we have analyzed how players introduce their avatars, the extent to which avatars correspond to or differ  from players’ real selves, and how players perceive and construct collective identity within their guilds.  The study revealed that most players make use of avatar introduction as a rhetorical pretext to fabri- cate narratives of personal experiences related to their game practice. In addition, players’ discourses  made it evident that avatars constituted either transparent  extensions  or translucent  enhancements   representations of their real selves. Finally, collective identity within guilds was mostly perceived and  experienced through shared values that transcend the technical format of the game including sense of  belonging, trust, respect, putting things into perspective, and modesty.  INTRODUCTION  It has become almost a cliché to say that Mas- sively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games   MMORPGs  are laboratories in which individuals  experiment with their identities. Like most cli- chés, it happens to be true. Since Sherry Turkle’s   DOI: 10.4018 978-1-60960-854-5.ch022   1995  seminal work on identity construction in  Multi User Dungeons  MUDs , there has been  a huge amount of research exploring and docu- menting a wide range of motivations, behaviors,  and consequences associated to players’ identity  construction and presentation in online games. To  be sure, different theoretical and methodological  approaches have been implemented, which testi- fies for the increasing interest of scholars from   Copyright   2012, IGI Global.

One Self to Rule Them All  avatars, and how they perceiv and or construct  collective identiety within guilds.  The structure of the chapter is as follows. We  will start by briefly summarizing recent research  focused on identity issues in WoW. After this brief  summary, we will introduce the theoretical and  methodological background for Critical Discourse  Analysis in WoW and present the study results.  Finally, we will provide some directions for future  research and highlight some conclusions drawn  from the present research.  BACKGROUND  Recent  research  on  identity  construction  and  presentation in WoW has showed that the ways  in which players digitally  re present themselves  via avatars or characters reveal core assumptions  about their actual and idealized self-conceptions.  In  order  to  understand  the  effects  of  these  as- sumptions  on  players’  avatar  construction  and  game-based socialization, some researchers have  examined how players create and negotiate their  personal and social identity online by focusing on  the role played by physical and personality traits   Ducheneaut, Yee, Nickell, & Moore, 2006; Bes- sière, Seay & Kiesler, 2007  as well as cultural  and organizational models  Bainbridge, 2010a . Research done by Ducheneaut, Yee, Nickell, &  Moore  2006  examined avatar personalization in  three online worlds: Mapple Story, Second Life,  and WoW by focusing on two issues  1  evaluating  current avatar creation and customization systems,  and  2  examining the link between avatar system’s  features, the eventual avatars created by users, and  users’ physical and psychological characteristics.  As far as identity-related issues in WoW are con- cerned, the study revealed that most players own  multiple  characters,  which  testifies  for  players  need for a flexible appearance. Most WoW players  granted relative importance to character features  such as hair style, facial characteristics, and hair  color but not to character skin color. Furthermore,   different quarters in understanding how personal  and social identity is created, assumed, and negoti- ated in online games. But all share the common  assumption  that  in-game  identity  construction  involves complex articulations of players’ per- sonal and social backgrounds with affordances  of embodiment and communication provided by  specific online game technologies.  Constructing one’s self-story through avatars or  characters in World of Warcraft  henceforth WoW   typically involves adopting the plot and mythology  provided by game designers but also adapting the  play and narrative culture within which one grows  up to WoW’s gameplay affordances, although this  may not be recognized as such by most players.  Through  this  double  process  of  adoption  and  adaptation, players juggle multiple roles, try on  different  hats,  different  lives,  forging  relevant  selves that can either be relatively permanent or  dissolved into new combinations when new game  challenges arise. In a persistent fantasy world that  demands flexibility in self-presentation and role- playing, identity construction may be conceived  as an adaptive process governed by a confederacy  of multiple self-conceptions. It is within this flex- ible and at the same time intricate context that we  want to examine how French-speaking players  construct their personal and collective identities  via their digital counterparts or avatars.  Our aim in this chapter is to put forward a view  identity construction in WoW as a socially embed- ded, situated personal narrative susceptible of be- ing analyzed via players’ discourses. We will argue  that examining players’ identity discourse provides  insight into how they concretize perceptions of  the ludic structure of the game, reconstruct their  biographies as players, impute group identities,  and align personal and collective identities. By  drawing on Van Dijk’s  2001  approach to Criti- cal Discourse Analysis, we will examine sixteen  online semi-structured interviews of WoW play- ers to understand how players’ self-presentation  is  narratively  managed  when  introducing  their  avatars, what are parts of them that live in their   338   One Self to Rule Them All  female players were most likely to create avatars  that are idealized versions of themselves than male  players, and the latter tend to favor avatars that  stand out more than female players. Analysis of  reproduction of personality traits showed that, on  average, participants rated their virtual character  as  being  more  conscientious,  extraverted,  and  less  neurotic  than  they  themselves  were.  The  authors conclude that while users do experiment  with different body features to somewhat enhance  their appearance, they do not tend to change their  personality “in-avatar” too much  for a comple- mentary  analysis  of  player avatar  identity  and  personality based on self-discrepancy theory see  Bessière, Seay & Kiesler, 2007 .  Williams,  Ducheneaut,  Xiong, Yee,  Nickell   2006  analyzed the social life of guilds in terms of  the meanings, social capital, and networks formed  by players inside WoW. Although they did not  explicitly address identity issues, their analysis of  guild typologies and practices  i.e., social, player  versus player, raid, and role-playing  is useful to  understand the extent to which guilds function  as virtual counterparts of real-life identification  spaces. The organic structure of guilds as collec- tives that share basic goals and play preferences  allows  players  to  simultaneously  draw  on  and  contribute to the in-game social capital accumu- lated by the guild-oriented networked action of  their members. It may be thus expected that the  supporting space so obtained functions as a rela- tively stable ground for developing trust among  fellows, reducing game-related uncertainty, and  promoting individual internalization of features  that constitute the identity of guilds.  From a theoretical perspective, Tronstad  2008   examined the relationship between character ap- pearance and character capacities in WoW and how  this relationship affects the possibility of identify- ing with the character during play. According to  the author, appearance does not reduce to physi- cal appearance; rather, it should be understood  as encompassing everything that is included in  players’ perception of the character. Based on the   idea of character capacities, the author highlights  two ways of identifying with one’s character in  WoW: empathic identity and sameness identity.  Sameness identity concerns a player’s entering  the state where he or she has an experience of  being the character  acting through the character’s  capacities . Empathic identity implies experienc- ing what the character experiences without the  feeling of being identical to it  the player directly  “experiences” the character’s capacities as if they  were her own . In role-playing settings a third kind  of  identity  emerges.  By  drawing  on  Ricoeur’s  concept of narrative identity, the author argues  that role-playing allows for players to narratively  identify with their characters’ in-game capacities  and actions. This kind of identity along with the  internalization of the controls, game mechanics,  and knowledge about the game world provide a  rewarding experience of flow by which players  can accomplish almost utter identification with  their characters.  Based on ethnographic and linguistic research,  Hagström   2008   analyzed  the  relationships  between avatar naming and player identity and  showed that avatars’ names reflect players’ indi- vidual preferences and cultural models associated  to linguistic background, literature, religion, art,  sports,  video  games,  popular  media,  etc.  Fur- thermore, the author argues that within the social  dynamics of WoW, the name is virtually both the  character being played and the player who com- municates with others via chat. Names are thus  identity markers for avatars and players that bridge  two game-related representational realms: being  a character and a players.  Brignall  2008  conducted participant observa- tion and informal interviews to study tribalistic  behaviors  in  hard-core  WoW  players.  Tribes  frequently form because of the desires of mem- bers to be among others with shared identities.  Seventy-four percent of his informants reported  preferring socializing in WoW to offline social- izing and the reasons for such behavior included  feelings of strong friendship, group unity, role-  339   One Self to Rule Them All  Williams  2010  argue, “Whether people change  their gender online or not, they still keep their of- fline gender roles in mind. In a sense, the virtual  game world is more an extension of the real one  than a separate place”  p. 171 .  Finally,  Bainbridge   2010b   combines  his  own experience as a WoW player with reflections  coming from fantasy literature describing physical  and mental attributes of different creatures. He  argues that races in WoW are as subject to in-game  stereotyping and prejudice as people are in real  life. Players’ perception of races and classes are  certainly molded by the diegetic structure of the  game  but  also  by  players’  beliefs  and  feelings  formed through their interaction with characters  having different racial origins. In terms of identity  construction and presentation, the problematic is- sue arises when an avatar’s qualities are attributed  to the player behind the character. In as much the  same way as in real life, intergroup processes in  WoW reflect complex dynamics of attribution,  stereotyping,  prejudice,  and  social  evaluation  which may have non-negligible impact on play- ers’ perception and construction of in-game social  identity.  All these studies, together with research done  on different online games  see Taylor, 2002, 2006   make it evident that players negotiate in somewhat  complex ways aspects of their inner selves when  engaging in individual and collective play inside  WoW. Their results have largely improved our  understanding of the different motivations, prefer- ences, and culture-based models that impinge upon  players’  online  ludic  experiences.  Researchers  have  used  different  language-based  techniques  to examine identity construction including ques- tionnaires,  online  surveys,  standardized  scales,  field notes, interviews, etc., which show the sig- nificance of getting linguistic access to players’  identity-related cognitive and social processes and  mechanisms implied in their online gaming. Con- sistent with this idea of finding a way to players’  in-game identity experiences through language,  we  want  to  analyze  WoW  players’  perception   playing with personal identity, hanging out with  people who share similar likes, social anonymity,  and  the  ability  to  ignore  disliked  people.  The  common reason reported to leave a guild was a  desire to associate with players who had shared  identities and playing styles. Based on previous  MMORPG experience, some hard-core players in  this study did not join guilds because they did not  want the responsibilities or problems that came  with  guild  membership.  The  author  concludes  that the structural environment of WoW fostered  some of the negative aspects of tribalism such as  quick  judgments,  stereotyping,  and  prejudicial  behavior among players.  Salazar’s  2009  research on Identity Liminal  Event  ILE  is one of the rare studies that explic- itly theorize social identity in WoW. By combin- ing speech act theory with intergroup processes  analysis,  he  defines  IEL  as  “either  an  elicited  or natural “happening” in a frame of time of a  group’s life”  p. 11 . The author claims that such  a happening is an ingroup speech event which  triggers in players spontaneous co-construction  of  social  identity  boundaries,  exclusion inclu- sion codes, and narrative and spatial codes. This  process of identity co-construction is meant to  develop over time which implies that issues in  social identity within WoW should be theoreti- cally and methodologically approached to from  a diachronic perspective.  Huh & Williams  2010  tested gender swap- ping in EverQuestII, focusing on swappers’ real  identity, their motivations, and what behaviors  they enact within the game world. Although the  study was not specifically conducted on WoW  players, their results present useful perspectives  to understand gender swapping in WoW. Contrary  to their initial expectation, the authors found that  females were not more likely to swap their gender  online than males. However, homosexual users  were more likely to change their online gender  than straight users. Male players argued that they  play a female avatar because it is a pleasing visual  object, not a source of identification. As Huh &   340   One Self to Rule Them All  of their real and digitally reproduced selves via  their self-crafted stories in order to understand  how their personal and collective selves are dis- cursively structured, how their linguistic choices  denote particular stances towards themselves and  their avatars, and how what they deem relevant  to tell conveys assumptions about their real and  possible selves.  FRAMING CRITICAL DISCOURSE  ANALYSIS OF IDENTITY IN  WORLD OF WARCRAFT  Theoretical Framework  Multidisciplinary research on discourse and iden- tity has showed that the ways in which individuals  narratively conceive of and communicate their  self-  and  other-conceptions  in  different  social  contexts  testify  for  a  non-essentialist  view  of  identity: personal and collective identity are not  fixed, monolithic entities; rather they constitute  unfinished  projects  which  can  be  narratively  reconstructed  and  deconstructed  depending  on  particular features of interaction contexts as well  as on individuals’ preferences, goals, values, and  communicative intentions  De Fina, Schiffrin, &  Bamberg, 2006; Gergen, 1994; Widdicombe &  Wooffitt, 1995 . This non-essentialist, multifac- eted view of the self does not imply, though, that  no degree of stability can be granted to identity  in narrative. Indeed, the self-concept can be con- ceived as having both narrative components that  are relatively consistent over time  e.g., personality  traits, past memories, values  and those that are  more malleable and contextually based  Nurius,  1991 .  On  the  basis  of  such  relatively  stable  components, self-relevant aspects can be added or  subtracted as individuals “update” their working  self-concept through sources such as social com- parisons, personal performance, intersubjective  feedback, adoption of new roles, etc.  Yet besides being constructions and descrip- tions  in  language,  self-identity  and  collective  identity  are  also  products  of  agents  whose  ac- tions are embedded in social practices. As Barker  &  Galasińki   2001   have  argued,  “Identities  as descriptions in language are achieved in the  everyday flow of language and stabilized as cat- egories through their embedding in the pragmatic  narratives of our day-to-day social conduct”  p.  44 .  These  pragmatic  narratives  are  useful  to  understand how people’s interactional, rhetoric,  and  stylistic  choices  index  their  belonging  to  those categories. As De Fina  2006  has pointed  out, “studies of narrative have shown that what  defines people as members of a group is not only  the content of their stories, but the way in which  they  use  socially  established  resources  to  tell  them”  p. 352 .  One useful way to analyze these imbrications  between narrative, identity, and social practices  is  provided  by  van  Dijk’s   2001   approach  to  Critical Discourse Analysis  henceforth CDA .  Van Dijk  2001  conceives of CDA not as a fixed  methodology but as a multidisciplinary orientation  to investigate a wide range of social and political  phenomena on the basis three interrelated axes:  discourse,  cognition,  and  society.  Discourse  concerns people’s engagement in communicative  actions by using several semiotic formats such  as verbal and non-verbal language, written text,  images,  typographical  layouts,  etc.  Cognition  is  to  be  understood  as  encompassing  people’s  beliefs,  goals,  social  representations,  memory  structures, affective appraisals, and mental models  involved  in  discourse  and  interaction.  Finally,  society is to be understood as an umbrella term  including intersubjective spaces provided by both  microstructures   groups,  communities,  circles   and  macrostructures   society,  culture   which  somewhat  determine  individual  and  collective  patterns of discourse and interaction. In order to  implement CDA as a useful heuristic to analyze  identity construction and presentation in WoW   341   One Self to Rule Them All  kind of information is selected and what narrative  stance is adopted by a player when assembling  and  displaying  who  he  or  she  is  in  interaction  with others.  The cognition axis implies that identities are  discursive-performative descriptions of personal  and social models with which people cognitively  and affectively identify. They can be best described  as constructed through discursive practices which  enact self- and other-conceptions by re-articulating  memory  structures,  shared  beliefs,  and  social  representations.  Cognition  implies  what  van  Dijk  1990  has elsewhere defined as “situation  models”,  that  is,  “cognitive  representations  of  personal experiences and interpretations, includ- ing personal knowledge and opinions … [that] are  located in episodic memory”  p. 166 . Memory  structures play a key role in feeding up self-related  narratives by providing both semantic or factual  information such as name, date and place of birth,  etc.  semantic memory  and episodic or biography- related information such as personal experiences,  situated affective appraisals, etc.  autobiographic  memory . Cognition is an important part of most  online gaming. Besides being the basis for players  to understand WoW’s gameplay affordances, it also  allows researcher to keep track of players’ in-game  categorizations, perception of gender stereotypes  and or prejudice, and memories concerning their  gamer careers.  Finally, society is meant to include the whole  range of social affordances provided by intersub- jective settings and interactions. Players engage  in discourse practices as past or current members  of several guilds. This implies that identity nar- ratives are produced and negotiated in specific  contexts which allow for building relevant and  situated meanings impregnated by specific kinds  of normativity  norms, conventions  and world- views   values .  Self-relevant  conceptions  and  meanings  can  thus  be  constructed,  negotiated,  and legitimated in microstructures such as guilds  and as well as in macrostructures composed of  multiple guilds on a given server.  some further specifications of the three aforemen- tioned axes are in order.  The discourse axis implies that self-identity  is  formed  by  the  ability  to  sustain  a  narrative  of the self that develops a consistent feeling of  biographical continuity over time. CDA may be  expected to show more explicitly the differences  and the functions of the perspectives involved in  the understanding, description, and presentation  of identity. It may, for instance, show how players  actually go about representing and communicat- ing their identities by disclosing themselves in  a  functional,  descriptive   facts   or  evaluative   mental state, episodic memory  way. Moreover,  insofar as identities are often expressed in personal  stories or accounts which are in line with their  goals or interests, players can build up, use, and  communicate identities strategically, depending  on  what  they  consider  relevant  to  convey  in  a  given interaction context. The notion of relevance   Sperber & Wilson, 1986  is helpful here to un- derstand the pragmatic background against which  players convey their identity narratives. Accord- ing  to  Sperber  & Wilson   1986 ,  the  principle  of  relevance  states  that  every  act  of  ostensive  communication conveys a presumption of its own  optimal relevance. In other words, when a speaker  communicates a message in a given interaction  context,  he  or  she  is  at  the  same  time  making  manifest  to  the  audience  a  cluster  of  context- relevant assumptions. Such assumptions can be  implicitly or explicitly communicated depending  on whether the speaker uses implicatures  speech  acts implying or suggesting one thing by saying  something else  or explicatures  speech acts which  explicitly  communicate  assumptions .  In  this  sense, a player can, for instance, convey either  explicit assumptions about his self-concept as a  good player by saying “I am a good player” or  implicit assumptions by stating “I have leveled my  character up to 80 in record time”. Furthermore,  the principle of relevance also makes evident the  speaker’s positioning when communicating with  the audience: relevance is helpful to disclose what   342   One Self to Rule Them All  Method  In order to examine how French-speaking players  discursively construct and convey their personal  and collective identities in WoW, we adopted an  online ethnographic approach  Hine, 2000  com- posed of participant observation, semi-structured  interviews, and critical discourse analysis. During  a few months of participant observation, one of  us   Dhen   developed  a  main  character  named  Oxxia  PvP PvE  and two “alts” named Jeano- lapin  PvP  and Pèrsifleur  RP  through which  we gained first-hand insight into the technical,  ludic, and social structure of the game. In order  to earn participants’ trust and thus provide them  with a space for dialogue and personal disclo- sure, we decided to make Oxxia’s identity as a  researcher explicit during the call for informants  posted  on  the  trade  chat  channel  integrated  in  the game communication interface. Criteria for  selecting  potential  participants  included  their  availability and willingness to participate in an  approximately 60 minute online interview as well  as their past and or current active participation  as guild members. 50 participants responded to  the query and 36 were dropped because they did  not meet selection criteria or were unavailable  after half the interview was conducted. The final  sample  is  composed  of  16  players  including 8  adolescents  1 female, 7 males, ages 14-17, M =  13,1  and 8 adults  3 females, 5 males, ages 20-36,  M = 27,8 . Participants were thus primarily male   12 men, 4 women . Interviews were conducted  in French on three severs, namely Krasus  PvP ,  Cho’Gall  PvP PvE , and Kirin Tor  RP  via two  channels: whisper chat and group chat. Most of  the interviews took place in relatively isolated  places around Stormwind City that players con- sidered quite enough to answer the interviewer- avatar questions. We decided to gather data from  interviews in a written form. This decision was  basically motivated by our aim to preserve the in  situ textual structure of players’ narratives. Even  though  we  were  aware  of  the  communication   possibilities  provided  by  TeamSpeak  or  other  third-party software, we did not use them because  VoIP channels require sharing a server address  and password which is guild-specific and thus not  available to outside players. Text was copy pasted  through the official Elephant chat log, translated  into English, and organized in separate rtf files.  All participants agreed on the recording of their  answers and were asked whether they wanted us  to keep their avatars’ and guild’s name preserved.  Three of them requested the researcher to keep  their guild’s name and character names anonymous   See Table 1 .  Semi-structured  interviews  were  articulated   around the following questions:  1.   Who  is  your  avatar?  This  question  was  explicitly  aimed  at  allowing  players  the  opportunity  to  introduce  their  avatars  in  whatever way they like. We wanted to check  for  identification  patterns  and  discursive  strategies players deem relevant to present  their avatars  and themselves  to the online  interviewer. This question also allowed us  to keep track of overlapping narrative layers  between avatars’ history and players’ game  experiences.  2.   What is the part of you that lives in your  avatar?  The  aim  of  this  question  was  to  check whether avatars are narratively con- structed  as  simple  extensions  of  players’  real selves, as game-based actualizations of  their possible, idealized selves, or still as an  amalgam of both. We wanted to identify the  elements in players’ self-narratives that point  to implicit or explicit relevant assumptions  about themselves as agents and their digital  representations as proxies. Furthermore, this  question was aimed at allowing players to  invoke physical attributes, mental models,  and personality traits as relevant source of  information. 2.1   For you, what is the difference between  playing  solo  and  playing  with  the   343   One Self to Rule Them All  Table 1.

This question  was aimed at extending question 2 by  identifying  players’  motivations  and  behaviors  related  to  both  individual  and collective in-game play. We ex- pected narrative indicators of motiva- tion,  behavior,  roles,  commitments,  and  responsibilities  to  shed  light  on  how  players  perceive  personal  and  social  values,  attitudes,  and  regula- tory structures which can in the end  be internalized as components of their  self-conception.  3.   Do you think you share a collective identity  with your guild mates? This question was  intended as a first probe into players’ per- ception of guilds as social settings fostering  collective  identity.  We  expected  different  empirical referents of guilds  name, tabard,  charter, etiquette, private website or forum,  etc.   and  social  values   etiquette,  mutual   344  respect, solidarity, reciprocity  to play a key  role in collective identity construction. 3.1   Could you specify that which you share  with the other members of your guild?  This question was intended to extend  question  3  by  deepening  potential  monosyllabic  answers  to  the  collec- tive  identity  question  or  insufficient  understanding of the term “collective  identity”. We wanted to explore play- ers’  sharing  of  play-related  beliefs,  attitudes towards winning failure, in- group  customized  lexicons,  ideal  of  guilds, etc. The question also allows  for  examining  the  extent  to  which  in-game and real-life mental models  overlap with each other and how guild  support for competence and relatedness  fosters in-game social integration and  collective identification.   One Self to Rule Them All  Study Results  We have articulated participants’ answers around  three  main  themes  according  to  the  topics  ad- dressed in the interviews:  1  introducing one’s  avatar,  2  from real selves to  digitally  possible  selves, and  3  guilds and collective identity.  Introducing One’s Avatar  Within the context of our online interviews, we  assumed that introducing one’s avatar is at the  same time a rhetorical way of introducing oneself.  An avatar indicates that there is a real person— the  avatar  owner player—present  and  actively  engaged with the high-fantasy world, a person  who has stories worth telling. In order to sort out  the different modes of avatar introduction used  by players, we have drawn on Van Leeuwen’s   2008  categories for representing social actors.  Avatars can be nominated, that is,  re presented  through their unique identity  i.e., name given by  the player  or categorized in terms of identities and  functions they share with others. This categoriza- tion can in turn be realized via functionalization  or identification. Functionalization occurs when  avatars are referred to in terms of what they do, that  is, their occupation or role  professions . Identifi- cation takes place when avatars are defined, not in  terms of what they do, but in terms of what they,  more or less permanently, are. Here identification  can be instantiated through  1  classification of  avatars in terms of the major categories provided  by game designers  faction, gender, race, class   and groups of players  guild’s name  or  2   re  presentation in terms of the relational identifica- tion they have with players by means of posses- sivation and affective attachment  “my shaman”,  “my creation”, “my pet”, “my babies” .  These linguistic patterns of avatar introduction  are to be considered here not as rigid categories  but as a heuristic to understand the different ways  players talk about their own avatars. As we will  see from the interviews, the boundaries between   these types of presentation are often blurred, which  implies that nomination and categorization are  frequently amalgamated at different levels in play- ers’ discursive  re presentation of their avatars.  Since players’ choice of words is constrained by  the interviewing context, and since words take on  special significance in particular contexts, paying  attention to the grammar of avatar introduction,  in particular indexicality or the connection of ut- terances and pronouns to extra-linguistic reality,  helped us track what players consider relevant to  introduce their avatars to the interviewer as well  as the relevant implicit or explicit assumptions  about themselves they convey via their digitally  represented counterparts.  Some  players  categorized  their  avatars  by  strictly alluding to their functions: “A level 80 night  elf hunter”  Chasar , “A level 80 dwarf hunter”   Smiri .  For  these  players,  avatar  introduction  consisted in condensing their characters’ level,  class, and race into a single phrase. They felt no  spontaneous need to fabricate a story about their  avatars’ name and or imagined origins, which is  consistent with the pragmatic and disengaged at- titude towards WoW conveyed throughout their  interviews. Yet for other players, avatar introduc- tion  contained  mixtures  of  categorization  and  nomination. Some of them used combinations of  name and function with additional information  about their game practice or affective attachment  to their avatars:1  Aldrak,  warlock  specialized  in  destruction  but  also in grief when needed…an old rogue who has  been knocking about on this server for 4 years  now and who nobody knows^^.2  Bluefaya, Draenei shaman, which I love:- …Wow  is a kind of game you fall in love with  very?   quickly…and you get too attached to your char- acter.3  Dõumdõum, shaman heal…already three weeks  played with it.4  345   One Self to Rule Them All  more you get it stuffed and leveled up over time,  the more you get attached to it…it’s like building  a house by yourself, you don’t want to sell it, you  want to live in…anyway, that’s my opinion.8  My name is Malonever. I’m a paladin and have  power to bring the dead back to life. I was born  in  the  Gold  Shire…when  I  was  a  child  people  called me noob and unstuffy. This made me seek  revenge but also recognition from other players.9  In terms of avatar player indexical identifica- tion and presentation, players’ use of pronouns  is revealing. Avatars are not only nominated but  also personified via first-  I, me  and third-person  pronouns  he, she  embedded in more or less cre- ative and biographic narratives. For some players,  patterns of avatar introduction show the ways in  which an avatar’ history is narratively intertwined  with the player’s relevant game experience. As  stated  above,  this  intertwining  of  avatars’  and  players’ narratives furnishes some key elements to  understand the extent to which telling an avatar’s   hi story from a first- or third-person perspective  becomes a rhetorical pretext to talk about some- thing else considered as relevant by the player,  namely his or her evolution of play performance,  his or her affective experiences within the game,  or the needs he or she wants to be fulfilled. For  instance, Malonever’s narrative shows the way he  mixes diegetic elements of WoW with items of his  own autobiographic memory as a newbie thereby  making evident that the hierarchical structure of  the game imposes constraints on first-time play- ers who are easily represented and categorized  as  poorly  skilled.  Malonever’s  words  not  only  imply the usual stages any first-time player has to  go through to improve his or her game practice,  but also the fact that in-game prejudice against  “newbies” via their avatars can bring about nega- tive affective appraisals of other players  feelings  of revenge  and the need for social recognition   Bainbridge, 2010a .  Eructite, level 80 Human Paladin…but I’ve got  9 level 80 characters and a bunch of others in  pexing or as bags.5  Avatar introduction in these cases provided  us with a first glimpse into players’ perception  of  themselves  as  gamers.  Besides  nominating  and categorizing their digital representations in  a somewhat standard way inside the game, play- ers spontaneously told the interviewer about time  invested in playing in WoW, how they feel about  their characters, and how many characters they  have created within the game. These additional  indications also reveal the extent to which ava- tar introduction functions as a pretext to present  aspects  of  the  self  and  game  practice  players  consider worth telling.  Other  combinations  of  nomination  and  cat- egorization in avatar introduction were framed  within first- and third-person narratives articu- lated around diegetic elements provided by the  game’s plot and personal experiences and feel- ings stemmed from players’ offline and online  practices:  Cystite, young female night elf so named by her  parents because it was her destiny to hurt. She  comes from a noble family; she is usually serious  and classy…she does not like vulgarity and has  a mission to accomplish here, she likes hunting  and above all her pet.6  Solanya, half-draenei  human father  death knight,  I’d say between twenty and thirty years old, no  brother or sister, parents dead long time ago.7  Aernei, level 80 druid who belongs to the guild  The Founders of Azeroth. They all are my friends  and I do my best to support them^^… Aernei  I   has lots of friends in order not to feel alone… My  relationship  with  my  avatar  has  certainly  changed but it’s true that I was already happy to  find an avatar that typifies me  ‘cause this is my  first online game so I was surprised , indeed the   346   One Self to Rule Them All  Unlike Malonever’s utter indexical identifica- tion with his avatar, Aernei’s avatar introduction  started with a third-person pronoun but then he  decided to put the pronoun “I” into brackets. This  identity explicature is introduced before disclos- ing personal information about loneliness which  probably conveys a mental model in which that  kind of feelings is usually ascribed to non-digital,  human beings. Furthermore, Aernei’s narrative is  marked by the importance of the guild for his game  experience. Besides providing the guild’s name  as a distinctive sign of belongingness, introduc- ing his avatar is the pretext to convey his need  for and commitment to friendship within WoW.  In addition, Aernei’s use of the house building  metaphor to describe avatar creation testifies for  his personal view of an avatar as a player-made,  time-consuming  product  which  once  finished  provides affective gratifications to his her owner.  Further  in  his  interview, Aernei  explained  that  creating his social network inside WoW was like  “building a second house”.  Finally, other players consciously chose their  avatars’ names on the basis of, for instance, gen- der,  in-game  class  coherence  or  past  personal  experiences:  I find that the letters or rather the sounds “o”  and  “a”  harmonize  nicely.  Moreover,  feminin- ity is externalized by putting a final letter “a”,  and “z” is a very little used letter, which I love  ^^… a strong identity while remaining feminine   Azeona .10  If you look in a dictionary of Latin, Sagitari relates  to archery etc... So it fits nice into the class I have  chosen  Sagitari .11  Muliang has a history; it is the Buddhist name that  I got from a Zen Master in Korea. Shangrilâ is an  imaginary place in Tibet. Both names refer to my  past, but also to a personal penchant. Muliang and  Shangrilâ are two healing characters associated  to “Buddhist” things, something that I mean on   purpose. That’s it. Shangrila, an imaginary place,  very much like this character  Shangrilâ .12  Azeona’s choice of name is consistent with cul- tural models of gender-name coherence typical of  some Romance languages like Italian, Portuguese,  and Spanish in which female names usually contain  a distinctive ending in “a”. But her choice not only  denotes her linguistic knowledge and preferences;  it also reflects her will to remain feminine in a  world where players can experiment with gender  at will. Sagitari looked for semantic coherence  between  his  avatar’s  class   dwarf  hunter   and  name and found it in Latin etymology. His choice  reflects the satisfaction obtained by aname that  faithfully denotes the technical capacities linked  to his avatar’s class. Shangrilâs’ narrative about  her avatars’ names combined two sources related  to a Buddhist worldview: her personal experience  in Korea and her penchant for fictional novels   indeed, Shangri-La is a fictional place described  by James Hilton in his 1933 novel Lost Horizon .  Her avatars represent relevant aspects of her life  that vivify and integrate her play experience and  make it more or less meaningful within the game.  In much the same way as Hagström’s  2008  re- search on avatar naming in WoW, these players  drawn on different cultural sources of inspiration  to give their avatars a distinctive and self-related  meaningful name.  As can be seen from their interviews, players  introduced their avatars either by simply catego- rizing them as in-game facts or by telling a story  in which initial diegetic elements of the game’s  plot  are  gradually  and  rhetorically  mixed  with  players’ real-life game practices. These narratives  of avatar introduction involved different ways of  telling and doing identity in which temporality is  either implicitly or explicitly alluded to. Finally,  the sense of identity that is perceived from, or  projected  through,  players’  language  behavior  when  introducing  their  avatars  can  be  seen  as  the consequence of moment-by-moment factor- driven decisions about what in-game and out-game   347   One Self to Rule Them All  Some  players  reported  that  most  of  their  real  selves came out through their avatars’ look and  ways of speaking and acting:  I’m not so different when I play WoW, it’s more like  another facet of my personality...our characters  are quite oddly like us, we do not make use of the  virtual environment to be different  Cystite .13  For me the avatar is a tool that allows me to have  fun and meet goals in the game, I do not behave  differently from real life when I use it to play with  other people  Sagitari .14  For these players, avatars constitute extensions  or “transparent representations” of what they are  and how they behave in real life. They did not  feel any need to be someone else online, to adopt  different behavioral patterns. Other players made  moderate claims about player avatar physical and  personality resemblance. For them, their avatars’  look and behavior reflected choices based on aes- thetic values, personal ideals, social persuasion,  or representing the two sides of the same coin:  Back to my avatar’s physical appearance…  let’s say…for me it has some importance but not  too much…as a druid I can change shapes so I  rarely see his real physical appearance…and his  white hair doesn’t mean he is old, it just makes me  think of snow^^…When I started playing, I wanted  a male character who looks classy and experienced  but young…that’s why he has a young face and  white hair…I chose that class because it concerns  nature and animals and balance…quite spiritual…  and at the same time it gave me the impression of  being a justice and natural rights protector…but  I’m not a green activist… Aernei .15  My character is my creation and he evolves through  me. He loves adventures like me but we do not  have the same physical traits… I first wanted an  orc, but my friends were playing in the alliance  so they told me to choose a human... I do not like  humans’ heads so I have it stuffed to mask his   self-related assumptions they deem relevant to  communicate to the interviewer.  From Real Selves to  Digitally   Possible Selves  Nurius  1991  has argued that identity has been  often  approached  to  in  the  literature  from  two  somewhat paradoxical conceptualizations of the  self-concept. On the one hand, the self-concept  can be understood in terms of its stable and unify- ing features  biographical self  and, on the other  hand, it can be framed in terms of its situated  and mutable features. According to the author,  one way to somewhat resolve this tension is to  put  forward  a  working  conception  of  the  self  understood in terms of actuality and potentiality,  that is, as a constantly shifting configuration of  self-conceptions between real and possible selves.  Possible selves are thus conceptualized as working  conceptions of the self concerning past-based and  future-oriented beliefs and feelings about what  people would like to be or are afraid of becoming   Markus & Nurius, 1986 .  Within the context of online games, self-related  actuality  and  potentiality  have  been  examined  in terms of the physical and personality traits as  well as the behavioral patterns players “transfer”  to their in-game digital representations. In this  sense, endowing one’s avatar with slightly modi- fied or radically changed physical features can  be understood as a way for players to cope with  some of their bodily features they consider self- discrepant or socially undesirable. At the same  time, the anonymity dimension encapsulated in  the in-game required pseudonymity, may allow  players to adopt behavioral patterns they do not  normally display in real settings. Aspects of one’s  personality can thus be subject to more or less  controlled  experimentation  within  a  context  in  which the risk of deception but also the benefits  from pretence are high.  Different patterns and levels of self-experimen- tation transpired in our informants’ discourses.   348   One Self to Rule Them All  head...My character has traits and clothes that I  never dare wear in real life  Lexiusxx .16  There is a certain part of me in my paladin... The  light protector, it fits nice with the vision I have  of myself... By contrast, my warlock is quite the  opposite of my personal mental image: ugly, little  and nasty  Eructite .17  For Aernei and Lexiusxx  both of them are  real-life  fourteen-year-old  males   the  physical  appearance of their avatars have different connota- tions. Aernei’s choice of a classy, experienced, and  young male character conveys the Western ideal  of an “interesting” male who is young enough to  correspond to his own age-related view yet mature  enough to be more eye-catching. In addition, by  explicitly stating that his avatar is young despite its  white hair, he wanted to make sure the interviewer  does not spontaneously associate white hair to old  age. For Aernei, vindicating his real age through  his avatar’s look  “he” is not old , even though it  can change shapes, was an indexical way to affirm  his identity as a male teenager. His choice of avatar  class reflects coherence between his role as a druid  and his own nature-friendly and spiritual values.  Positive feelings associated to seeing himself as  a justice and nature rights protector represent the  extent to which a digital version of his idealized  self fosters his self-esteem, even though his real  self has nothing to do with ecological activism.  On  the  other  hand,  Lexiusxx’s  story  conveys  different but equally interesting points. Although  his avatar represents things he loves doing and  clothes he never dare wear in real life, his choice  of a human avatar was determined by social in- fluence which reflects what social psychologists  have called “subjective norm”, that is, judgments  about and decisions made on the basis of what  others who are important to the person think he  or she should do  Fishbein, 1980 . Yet the costs  of “pleasing others” can bring about self-related  conflicting values: playing an avatar he did not  originally want to play and masking its physical   appearance because of aesthetic reasons. Eructite’s  answer somewhat exemplifies the Dr. Jekill Mr.  Hyde popular culture view of split personality  and  identity.  He  conveys  the  idea  that  avatars  allow for digitally embodying opposite facets of  one’s personality worth experimenting with in an  environment where the disclosure of one’s bad and  nasty selves may find an ideal place. This idea is  nicely represented by Bluefaya: “I am who I want  when I play, I can be normal, or piss off, or play  the lover, I don’t give it a damn because there is  not much risk  Bluefaya .18  Masks and facades were among the reasons  invoked by some players to account for their real  virtual self relationship:  [Oxxia]:  What  is  the  part  of  you  that  lives  in  your avatar?   [Azeona]: I remain myself. My avatar is a façade.  And when I play, I use programs like Mumble,  Teamspeak, so it is the “real” me who speaks... my character is a facade, not a hiding place. A  facade because it is necessary in this game, it  certainly expresses my tastes  hairstyle, etc.  but  not my personality.19  [Oxxia]: is your avatar a kind of loophole for you?  [Paos]: uhm…talking about me through an avatar,  something fake, a character…that’s weird…my  character = rather a mask, a bit like what I want  to be or would like to be and at the same time  hiding me because I do not normally talk about  myself through it.20  Players’  allusion  to  masks  and  facades  is  worth noting here. A mask is usually understood  as something that conceals, partially or totally,  one’s face. It implies that no matter the perspec- tive adopted there will always be some features  of the actor’s face that remain inaccessible to the  audience. In this sense, Paos’ metaphorical view  of her avatar reflects a dramaturgical construction   349   One Self to Rule Them All  identify with. Paos’ choice of female avatars is  consistent with her real life gender and her aes- thetic values. Although during the interview she  was playing a male gnome warlock, her answers  mostly  concerned  her  past  and  current  female  avatars.  For  another  player,  technical  changes  introduced by game designers had a significant  impact on his view or role-playing, gender, and  avatar distinctiveness:  [Oxxia]  do  you  give  your  characters  special  features?...  [Dõumdõum]: Arf... RP disappeared the day Bliz- zard decided to add a letter to its server “N Rp”,  normality quickly took over it so that giving your  avatar a particular phrasing or a gender makes  no longer any sense:    …  [Oxxia]: do you use your avatar to change some  of your features: gender, age, etc.. ?  [Dõumdõum]: Yuck, no, by the way I do not un- derstand a male’s need for playing a female avatar   have not met the opposite case .23  For Dõumdõum, role-playing in normal realms  is  no  longer  an  exciting  experience.  What  the  player alludes to by “normality” implies the idea  of technically standardizing players’ control over  their  gameplay  thereby  altering  the  feeling  of  immersion they can derive from their play experi- ences. If everyone’s gameplay gets standardized,  endowing one’s avatar with distinctive features  such as way of speaking and gender makes no  sense. Furthermore, gender swapping is something  he is not comfortable with. His pejorative expres- sion “Yuck” when speaking about males’ reasons  for playing female avatars probably conveys social  stereotyping concerning maleness as something  not to play with  even digitally .  of  virtual  identity  similar  to  that  advanced  by  Goffman  1959  in which the self enacts multiple  performances in order to negotiate context-related  identities. Unlike masks, façades are a matter of  available perspective  what can be seen from a  specific  point  of  view   and  do  not  necessarily  mean conscious hiding. Azeona’s conception of  her avatar as a façade can be understood as discard- ing any possible synecdochic sense of identity: an  avatar does not stand for the whole player’s self.  This is consistent with her view that tastes and  personality  are  two  different  things. Although,  this  point  is  largely  arguable  on  psychological  grounds, what is relevant in her answer is that  her avatar’s physical attributes do not denote her  entire personality. Interestingly, Azeona’s answer  implies distinguishing between two ways of being  in the game: as a character and as the real player  behind it. Awareness of these two perspectives  that tend to blend due to the feelings of presence  fostered by the game’s immersive interface, rep- resents a somewhat instrumental view of avatars  as  digital  artifacts,  that  is,  avatars  are  simply  ludic-oriented  prostheses  that  allow  players  to  engage with the game.  Most  players  showed  gender  consistency  between them and their avatars. Only two of our  informants played avatars of the opposite sex and  their reasons for doing so include:  This character is a female because I created the  story that way but I’m a man^^  Solanya .21  I’ll often build female characters because I’m a  girl ^^…I’d like to create human or dranei char- acters because they have an aesthetic side I like  much…I put some of my traits into my first two  characters and then I got fun playing “fashion  designer” with the others  Paos .22  For  Solanya   a  real  life  17-year-old  male  player , the reason for playing a female avatar  highlights  his  freedom  to  imagine  and  create  gender  possibilities  he  does  not  necessarily   350   One Self to Rule Them All  Finally, other players deliberately concealed as- pects of real selves via their avatars. Their reasons  to do so include socially undesirable consequences  inside the game but also personal coherence with  ways of behaving in real life:  Sometimes I don’t say I’m a girl lol because men  in WoW get quickly aroused and overzealous once  they know it  Paos .24  Usually, they [guild members] only accept adults  when carrying out a raid, so I pretend to be older  than my age  Tamor .25  [Malonever]: Given that I’m not a fervent fan of  heroic fantasy I chose a black character, which  as far as I know is something rarely alluded to  in this universe…   [Oxxia]: you’re not black in real life, are you?...  [Malonever]: no, but if you want more details,  I’ve always loved hiding my face and skin color… my character is a bit like me because I play him  …he’s rather obstinate.26  These  strategic  decisions  imply  carefully  choosing  what  aspects  of  the  self  can  be  dis- closed  in  a  given  context  and  being  coherent  with the strategically adopted role. As Paos ar- gues, “sometimes” it is better for her not to say  she is a woman, which implies that judging the  woman-friendly  dimension   or  the  absence  of  male “sexual pressure”  of the play environment  is crucial to communicate her real gender. In the  case of Tamor, pretending to be older than his  age—adopting an in-game second-order layer of  make believe—is the way to enjoy going out for  raids with his guild mates. Malonever’s choice of  a black avatar conveys his will to explore a fantasy  universe mostly composed of Nordic-like human  characters from a somewhat marginal perspective  which echoes research done on racial inequality  and ethnocultural stereotypes within WoW  Na-  kamura, 2008, Higgin, 2009 . For these players,  concealing or  enhancing some aspects of  their  selves is possible because of the communication  affordances of WoW. Yet unlike the abovemen- tioned players for whom avatars are extensions or  transparent representations of themselves, these  players’ avatars stand as translucent representa- tions or their real selves, filtering and diffracting  their physical and social identities.  Guilds and Collective Identity  Collective  identity  can  be  understood  as  the  perceived sense of “we-ness” and joint agency  anchored in real or imagined shared experiences  and  features  of  a  social  group   Snow,  2001 .  Consistent with this conception, our interviews  showed that for some players collective identity is  imagined, supposed, or hoped to exist rather than  experienced directly. When explicitly asked if they  share a collective identity with their guild mates  those players answered, for instance: “I hope so  otherwise there would be no reason for the guild  to exist!!!  Aldrak ”27 or “I wouldn’t go so far as  to say that”  Solanya .28 Even though they were  aware of their sharing distinctive symbols and  play aspirations with members of their respective  guilds,  it  seems  that  the  very  term  “collective  identity”  makes  little  or  no  sense  to  them.  By  contrast, when asked to specify what they share  with guild mates, they provided relevant compo- nents of collective identity such as sharing positive  and negative feelings depending on whether they  succeed or fail during raids, a friendly and trust- ful atmosphere, an ideal of serious and engaged  playing, good writing  no SMS language , etc. So,  even though the formal concept seems to make  little sense to those players, collective identity  was nevertheless talked into existence when asked  to reflect on what they actually share with other  guild members.  These answers are at odds with those of more  “skeptical”  players  for  whom  membership  in  a  guild  does  not  constitute  collective  identity   351   One Self to Rule Them All  solidarity, game performance, putting things into  perspective, etc.  For some players, the guild’s name and tab- ard were distinctive empirical referents of their  group identity. Moreover, since those referents are  easily recognizable by members of other guilds,  players are held accountable for any words and  deeds performed when acting on behalf of the  guild:  “when  we  speak  we’ve  got  the  guild’s  name beneath our characters’ so we do our best  to look after the guild’s profile”  Aernei 33, “you  ‘personify’ the guild: we have a tabard, the first  sign  of  belonging,  and  also  the  guild’s  name  under ours”  Shangrilâ 34. For still other players,  the tabard represented the guild’s shared sense of  self-derision: “the guild’s tabard is nice and also  the ambiance…but the tabard is really great:p pink  with a red heart on it… that’s too much funny”   Smiri .35 Verbal styles were also alluded to as a  specific  referent  of  collective  identity:  “Think  for example of Azura^^…they all share the same  passion, they’re always together. Their ‘distinctive  sign’ is that they imitate troll language  Eructite .36  Yet  overall,  verbal  style  was  not  a  significant  indicator of collective identity. Besides adopting  the game-based lexicon for pragmatic reasons,  the majority of our informants reported having  no secret codes or guild-specific verbal styles.  Finally, the basic function of guild charters can be  seen as providing normative criteria for judging  players’ behavior. Yet in most interviews, guild  charters were just considered as rules of etiquette  for  collective  play  but  not  as  strong  bases  for  building collective identity. Although all players  were aware of the normative implications of guild  charters, a number of them do not respect charters  all the time or find ad hoc ways to get it round.  On closer inspection, collective identity in most  of the interviews seems to be derived from and  reinforced by shared contents other than charter- based norms.  Players’ apparent non-compliance with guild  charters does not necessarily mean that guilds are  utterly anarchic groups. Unlike most empirical   “even if people must think the same way to have  affinities”  Bluefaya 29. Three of them provided  personal reasons to justify why they think there  is no collective identity within their guilds:  I’m not looking for virtual friendship here. I just  use the system, of course, less than other people  do, but I do use it  Dõumdõum .30  I don’t attach myself to others because this is just  a game  Chasar .31  If I leave the guild, some people will be disap- pointed but I don’t think they would hate me like  the slave who leaves her master… For me, the  guild is not a family, it’s just a hostel…A guild  is just having fun killing bosses with people one  likes  Azeona .32  Their synecdochic answers—each time col- lective identity is denoted by a potential single  component:  friendship,  attachment,  fraternal  bonds—clearly reflect that they conceive of and  engage  with  the  game’s  ludic  affordances  in  a  rather instrumental way: as an entertaining sys- tem designed to provide fun. Overall, skeptical  players often argued that belonging to a guild is  a necessary and convenient condition to attain  some goals and have fun playing the game but  it  does  not  create  bonds  strong  enough  to  be  perceived as establishing collective identity. In  other words, for these players membership in a  guild—the objective condition of belonging to the  guild—does not imply assimilating their selves  or attaching themselves to any supposed in-group  identity prototype.  Other players did consider that they share a  common identity with their guild mates. We have  identified two kinds of referents in their answers  around which collective identity appears to be  articulated:   1   empirical  referents  including  guilds’ names, tabards, verbal styles, and charters,  and  2  more abstract referents encompassing a  variety of shared values like trust, mutual respect,   352   One Self to Rule Them All  referents, shared values were alluded to as playing  a key role in structuring players’ perception of a  common identity within guilds. Values transpired  in most of the non-skeptical players’ interviews as  the basic elements for the expression of collective  identity insofar as they embody the playing ideals  that prototypically define their past and current  guilds.  We  have  identified  ten  values  players  highlighted  in  their  interviews  and  articulated  them  around  three  dimensions:   1   self-related  values,  2  guild-related values and  3  play-related  values  See Figure 1 .  This  scheme  reflects  three  dimensions  of  motivational goals and valuing attitudes underly- ing collective identity in our informants’ guilds.  The fact that we analytically differentiate them  does not mean that they belong to unrelated and  merely juxtaposed spheres of desired states and  outcomes. On the contrary, throughout our infor- mants’  interviews  there  seems  to  be  a  certain  consistency among self-related, guild-related, and  play-related values. The self-related dimension  encompasses shared motivational goals that set  the stage for personal achievement inside guilds.  The point here is that players value the opportuni- ties afforded by their guilds to satisfy their need  for in-game performance and self-image improve- ment. Being able to accomplish challenging tasks,  to use one’s best assets in the game, and to feel  that one is accepted as member of a guild are all  end-states pursued by most of our players. Yet  individual improvement is just one of the factors  worth being valued. These self-related values also  resonate  with  collective  expectations  and  ex- plicit demands for social accomplishment as a  group on the basis of guild-related values embody- ing socially shared sentiments and desired group  attributes. Being able to help others, to respect  them,  to  trust  them  and  to  be  modest  imply  a  dynamics  of  intersubjective  commitment  to  a  particular way of being which characterizes the  specificity of a guild in the eyes of players. Fi- nally, the play-related dimension lays the ground  for putting into practice self-related and guild-  related values as players look for the same kind  of game-based experiences and assume self-re- flecting  attitudes  towards  their  individual  and  collective behavior and accomplishments.  As suggested above, self-related values mostly  concern players’ in-game self-enhancement, that  is,  fostering  or  extending  their  capabilities  as  guild members. These values include the sense  of belonging  being accepted and needed by the  guild , self-fulfillment  fostering the best use of  one’s talents inside the game , and the sense of  accomplishment  being able to succeed at what  players, individually and collectively, want to do .  Among our informants, Aernei illustrates the sense  of belonging by building an analogy between his  attachment to his guild and a particular version  of patriotism:  It’s  a  bit  like  patriotism  but  not  so  strong,  we  shouldn’t  exaggerate…patriotism  is  just  that  you’ve this nationality and you’re permanently in  this country so you want to protect it, and although  you meet some bastards there, you know it’s your  country…whereas given that there are 70 of us in  the guild if someone pisses us off we can get rid  of him  Aernei 37  This analogy is, of course, limited but it nev- ertheless highlights some elements worth noting.  On Aernei’s  view,  belonging  to  a  guild  is  like  belonging to a country, having a nationality, and  claiming the right to inhabit its land. The idea  behind his discourse of “country” and “national- ity” is that of a space time situated condition in  which everyone is granted a shared identity that is  meant to be protected. But unlike discourse about  countries and nationalities which, in principle, al- lows equal and permanent belonging conditions  even  to  “bastards”, Aernei’s  view  is  particular  in that belonging to a guild is not a perpetually  granted condition. If someone does not “adapt”  to this shared value he or she can be ruthlessly  excluded. Individual failures to adapt to a guild’  way of functioning can thus trigger the guild’s   353   Figure 1. Dimensions of values addressed by players  One Self to Rule Them All  adoption of policies of member exclusion. For  Aernei, belonging to a guild is something contin- gent, something players have to earn constantly by  adapting themselves to and fostering the guild’s  expectations dynamics.  For another player, the sense of belonging is  something that comes along with entering a guild:  When  you  enter  a  guild  you  conclude  a  tacit  agreement…this passage gives you a feeling of  belonging inside the pixelated jungle…you can  count on the other guild members…for some, the  guild provides security  Shangrilâ 38  By alluding to a “tacit agreement”, Shangrilâ  conveys  the  implicature  that  collective  values   exert normative force on players’ behavior. On her  view, tacitly adopting the guild’s values implies  complying with the guild’s ethos as a condition for  players not only to be granted a membership but  especially to develop their “sense” of belonging,  their trust in other members, and their feeling of  being secured inside the pixelated jungle. This  capacity to adopt guild’s values also implies be- ing able to balance personal goals and collective  expectations, and to share the web of collective  meanings and aspirations characteristic of a given  guild.  Self-fulfillment was indirectly alluded to by  one  player  when  talking  about  what  he  shares  with other guild members:  354   One Self to Rule Them All  To show respect to other players: to optimize one’s  character in order not to slow other players down  and to share information to help them improve  their own characters  Eructite 39  On  the  one  hand,  this  link between respect  and self-fulfillment testifies for the relationship  between  self-related  and  guild-related  values  implied in collective identity discourse. On the  other  hand,  the  idea  behind  Eructite’s  view  of  respect is that of providing guild mates with op- portunities and assistance to enhance their levels  of performance and develop their talents inside the  game. The fostering of self-fulfillment via respect  entails here that respecting someone is not just  a passive state of not harming her but an active   to show, to express  engagement to recognize  her potential as a player as well as a fellow who  shares and engages with a particular way of play- ing. It follows from Eructite’s view that players’  self-fulfillment is contingent both upon improv- ing one’s character technical capacities and upon  players’ readiness to share improvement-related  information with each other.  As far as self-accomplishment is concerned,  two players alluded to it as a shared aim within  their guilds:  I’m looking for perfection…we all share the same  aim: perfecting our characters’ armor, gaining  power, and being recognized  Lexiusxx 40  [We all share] a common aim: “we want to move  forward, to progress” while respecting the fact that  we can’t oblige people to be present five times per  week from 8:00pm till 12:00pm  Aldrak 41  For these players, perfection, power, recog- nition and progress are the ways to make self- accomplishment real. Lexiusxx’ passage from “I”  to “We” in which both pronouns come together to  denote a shared goal of perfection is relevant for  him to justify that there is consistency between  what he is looking for within the game and the   valuing framework provided by his guild. The  “we” comes here to the fore as an intersubjective  valuing support for him to be able to succeed at  what he wants to do. Although Aldrak’s view is  to some extent similar to that of Lexiusxx’s, his  claim is more moderate in that real-life conditions  can put constraints on what they want to achieve  collectively. The idea behind this claim is that  game-related  self-accomplishment  cannot  be  pursued to the detriment of other values holding  for people’s real lives.  In addition to self-related values, players also  have addressed guild-related values which imply  self-transcendence in the sense of valuing con- cern for other members’ welfare and readiness to  provide them with assistance and advice. Among  these values are trust  being reliable and able to  rely on other members when needed , solidarity   caring  about  other  players,  distributing  loots  among players who need them the most , respect   giving and receiving recognition inside the guild ,  and modesty  not showing off or being arrogant  when accomplishing big raids and risky events . Trust appeared implicitly in one of our inter- views as a value which affects the guild’s way of  functioning:  An individual’s bad behavior may cause problems  to the guild…those behaviors generally include:  stealing,  lying,  letting  guild  members  down   Shangrilâ 42  The verbal labels used by Shangrilâ to refer to  “bad behaviors” convey the idea of betrayal, of  failing to live up to implicit or explicit commit- ments. The very fact that such behaviors are labeled  as “bad” reflects the normative force granted to  trust and trustworthy actions by the player. Even  in highly competitive environments like WoW,  in which selfish motives can impregnate some  players’  words  and  deeds,  trust  plays  the  role  of social glue that binds players together when  pursuing common goals.  355   One Self to Rule Them All  for others in any situation. I’ve never seen this  before in wow  Eructite 45  Eructite’s disappointment about his past experi- ences in guilds denotes the idea that instrumental  behaviors aimed at just leveling up characters by  whatever means are incompatible, in his view,  with respect for other people as a core value. His  claim about respect here is consistent with his  indirect way of speaking about self-fulfillment   see above  insofar as both values imply a sense  of “social responsibility” to other players’ techni- cal and relational improvement within the guild.  He is not objecting to leveling one’s character up  since this is part and parcel of the game. To his  mind, what is unacceptable is that players consider  game performance  level up  as a primary value  without taking into account that “players” also  are “people” that can be hurt.  Finally,  play-related  values  encompass  in- strumental  desired  outcome  such  as  reputation   building in-guild and out-guild individual and  collective prestige  and end-states like fun and  enjoyment  sharing the same hedonistic attitude  towards the game  or putting things into perspec- tive  being able to realize that WoW is just a place  where social gaming can take place .  Insofar as WoW is a competitive game, reputa- tion holds for individual and collective achieve- ment. One of our informants referred to guild’s  reputation in terms of appreciation and popularity:  Yeah,  [reputation]  it’s  very  important  because  the more people see you as strong the more your  popularity ranking rises  Lexiusxx 46  Reputation is one of the values typically ad- dressed by our youngest informants. Although for  some of them reputation constitutes an end-state  worth pursuing in itself, others take it from a more  instrumental perspective and see it as a subsidiary  outcome of playing “mature style”. For Lexiusxx,  reputation is a primary value in that it provides him  with intra- and inter-guild appreciation. Through-  Modesty was referred to as a value associated  to being classy and showing “high level perfor- mance” patterns of behavior:  I feel that killing bosses without showing off is  classy; so far, I find that the best guilds, at least  in the Alliance faction, do not show off!  Azeona 43  Although it might seem odd for a young player  to postulate modesty as a value, for Azeona mod- esty is a way to gain social recognition inside WoW.  Modesty conveys the background idea of playing  in a mature way and reacting soberly to big col- lective achievements. This also implies adopting  a specific outlook on the game: the more you are  modest when attaining some goal, the more you are  recognized as being classy, elegant. For some of  our young players modesty plays an instrumental  role in allowing them to reach an ideal end-state:  being socially recognized and admired.  Solidarity  was  addressed  by  one  player  as   forming the core of any true guild:  I’d say this is my first true guild, a guild where  people help each other, and if you need something  there’s someone who has it…that sort of things   Bluefaya 44  Bluefaya’s qualification of a “true”, genuine  guild  as  one  in  which  people  help  each  other  conveys his mental model of solidarity as altru- istic action. Although this player may be largely  unaware of the selfish motivations that can guide  some “altruistic” behaviors, his view about solidar- ity highlights the value of intra-guild cooperation  and fulfillment of others’ needs inside the game. Respect was evoked by one player as an es- sential yet not already found value within guilds:  I try to go my way without hurting others and  I’m  intolerant  against  those  players  who  only  care about leveling up to the detriment of other  people… by and large I dream of a RP guild in  which people value fair playing and show respect   356   One Self to Rule Them All  out his interview, he was concerned with a specific  idea of popularity as based on having his character  stuffed, accomplishing difficult challenges, being  wealthy, and posting short videos  also known as  machinimas  of his guild killing big bosses. On  his view, popularity and, by extension, reputation  reflects his self-perception as someone appreci- ated for being a strong player and belonging to a  strong, high level guild.  Fun  and  enjoyment  concerned  the  hedonic  dimension of the game, a dimension which, in  the eyes of some players, most hard gamers tend  easily to forget:  We only share playing time but in a good atmo- sphere  Cystite 47  The big difference is between “us” and the people  who take it too much seriously…it’s amazing to  see lots of haters in the battlefields, they don’t  really enjoy it which in the end is the game’s aim   Smiri 48  Unlike other guilds, which I won’t mention here,  that tear themselves apart, the most important  things for us is to play and have fun  Tamor 49  Fun  and  enjoyment  appear  here  as  evalua- tive criteria for distinguishing between identity  patterns referred to “us” and “others” who have  troubles in realizing that, as a game, WoW repre- sents a practice from which players can draw fun.  These different perspectives on the ludic hedonic  dimension of WoW are also what motivate some  players to quit their past guilds and to enter other  ones that fit with their fun-related expectations. Putting things into perspective was referred to  by players as characterizing their game practice:  The capacity to put things into perspective, if we  can’t kill a boss it’s not the end of the world, and  if we succeed at it it’s not a reason to showing  off  Eructite 50  Eructite’s claim underlies the capacity to see  oneself as a player, to take some distance from  the game without losing one’s attachment to both  the guild and the way of playing. Furthermore, it  also stands for a balanced perspective on the way  guilds manage to draw fun, success, and failure  from  collective  actions.  In  a  nutshell,  putting  things into perspective refers to a healthy, self- reflective attitude towards the self that permeates  all the three valuing dimensions and ensures the  persistence of the guild and the play over time.  As  we  can  see,  in  most  players’  interviews  values appear not just as optional extras about  individual  and  collective  behavior  but  also  as  standards for the self and the guild. They function  as an “identity capital” from which players draw  normative, symbolic, and emotional patterns of  sharing  which  justify  both  their  sense  of  joint  agency and their motivations to be part of and  work for the guild. It should be noted, though,  that the values forming the core of a guild stem  from  the  interplay  between  players’  personal  histories  desires, memories, and expectations   and the intersubjective affordances of the game.  This is consistent with Pearce and Artemesia’s   2009   claim  that  players  arrive  on  the  scene  “with a certain set of values and a predisposition  to socially emergent behaviors”  p. 73 . Yet this  does  not  imply  that  players’  preexisting  value  systems  and  behavioral  predispositions  are  so  rigid that neither adaptation to nor adoption of  in-game emergent values can take place inside  the platform. In fact, the process of building col- lective identity appears to be marked by players’  constant negotiation and monitoring of their value- based view of themselves, the guild, and the way  of playing as can be seen from their belonging  to  past  and  current  guilds.  Such  a  negotiation  is in line with Rettberg’s  2008  claim that “the  process of advancing in WoW is to some extent  modeled on the process of getting an education”   p. 25 . Players not only have to be “educated”  in terms of learning how to master the technical  and tactic intricacies of the game but also, and to   357   One Self to Rule Them All  values among guild mates. Yet given its synchronic  nature, this study constitutes a “snapshot” of how  French-speaking  WoW  players  construct  and  negotiate their personal and collective identities  within  the  game.  Since  identity  narratives  are  complex processes constructed and deconstructed  over time, deeper insight into identity construction  inside WoW can be gained by implementing criti- cal discourse analysis longitudinal research aimed  at examining, for instance, identity discourse at  different times in players’ and guilds’ game careers.  Furthermore, a more detailed view of players’ dis- cursive construction of identity could be attained  by gathering face-to-face data and thus keeping  track of how players verbally negotiate aspects of  their in-game and real-life practices. Since players  can also extend their game-based interactions to  include meetings in real life, it would be useful to  examine their patterns of interaction in out-game  settings and the impact of real life events on the  process of collective identity construction.  Finally, adopting a mixed methods approach  based on discourse analysis and quantitative data  mining can help researchers not only generalize  their results to wider parts of the gamer popula- tion but also examine cross-cultural patterns of  identity construction in WoW. Since narratives are  widespread practices of constructing objects, roles,  and collectivities grounded in cognitive models  available in most if not all cultures  Barker &  Galasińki, 2001, Sperber, 1996 , analyzing and  comparing intercultural patterns of in-game iden- tity construction and presentation can shed light  on the potential transcultural impact of WoW as  a globalizing social practice.  CONCLUSION  In this chapter we have provided a critical dis- course analysis of French-speaking WoW players’  personal  and  social  identity.  We  have  showed  that personal identity inside WoW is mostly  re  constructed as a narrative in which players merge   some extent more critically, they are educated in  what Klapp  1971, quoted in Klastrup, 2008 p.  163 , speaking of social typing, called “collec- tive values” and “socially necessary sentiments”.  These values and sentiments are triggered by the  game’s character narrative, which defines roles,  types, attitudes, and levels of responsibility, but  they still have to be felt and lived as character- izing  both  the  guild’s  aims  and  the  collective  way of playing. Such feeling and living of values  resonates with Gee’s  2003  view of “projective  identity” according to which players project their  own values and desires onto virtual characters, see  the latter as their “projects” in the making, and  engage with relevant others who share or at least  are able to negotiate on those values and desires.  Values appear thus as significant components of  collective identity as they encapsulate not only  players’ expectations about the game but also a  reflective  stance  both  towards  themselves  and  towards others with whom they engage in collec- tive playing. They define the specificity of a guild  as they guide the selection of the means and ends  of specific actions, and serve as criteria by which  objects, actions or events are evaluated. Finally,  unlike norms which are explicitly formulated in  guild charters, values are carried latently through  the social process of playing together and provide  the sense of collective identity players experience,  imagine, or dream of within guilds.  FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  The present study reveals that critical discourse  analysis is a helpful heuristic to understand lan- guage behavior patterns of identity construction  inside  WoW.  It  has  showed,  for  instance,  that  players’  narratives  about  their  avatars  convey  relevant cognitive and social representations of  their possible or imagined selves as well as self- related aspects of their game practices. Moreover,  collective identity inside guilds was showed to  be discursively enacted via evocation of shared   358   One Self to Rule Them All  their in-game perceptions via their avatars with  their  relevant  real-life  experiences  as  players.  Avatar introduction has been showed to constitute  a rhetorical mode of putting forward self-related  assumptions and aspects of one’ identity. These  rhetorical modes have also revealed that for some  players avatars function as extensions or trans- parent representations of themselves. For others,  the representational flexibility of avatars inside  WoW  allows  them  to  enhance  and or  conceal  some aspects of their real selves they deem self- discrepant or contextually undesirable. Finally,  collective identity within guilds was perceived  and constructed by players through some empiri- cal referents such as guild’s name, tabard, and  verbal style but the majority of our informants  reported shared values as denoting shared identity  inside guilds. Consistent with major trends in the  literature on online games, French-speaking WoW  players’ identity experiments are less a matter of  becoming someone else online than negotiating  and virtually representing self-discrepant aspects  of their real lives.
