So did many other people.  In fact, everyone I have talked to since I started creating my blogs told me  I wouldn't achieve any success.  They were wrong. But it wasn’t them or their words that helped me. It was me, my pain, my studies  and  my  hunger,  that  boosted  my  work...and  now  here  we  are,  me teaching you how to win using Search Engine Optimization for your website. Although  you  may  have  never  managed  a  website  before,  you  keep coming back to the idea of having one and there are 12 types of website you can have: 1. E- Commerce website  An  E-  Commerce  website  may  be  a  website  where  people  can  directly buy products from. You’ve probably used a variety of E- Commerce websites before, most big brands and many smaller ones have one. Any website that has  a  cart  with  information  on  how  to  supply  MasterCard  information  to make a sale, falls into this category.  If  you’re  trying  to  find  the  right  way  to  start  an  internet  site  for  your business and decide to sell your products online, then this is often the sort of website to create. There are some specific steps you've got to make certain to incorporate  when  building  an  E-  Commerce  website,  like  investing  in  E- Commerce  software  and  getting  your  SSL  certificate  to  make  sure  your customers can pay securely. And you should make sure your web design and replica are all crafted with the site’s main goal in mind: making sales.  E-  Commerce  websites  are  often  an  extension  of  a  business  you  have  already got, or become something you build a replacement business around. 2. Business website  A  business  website  is  any  website  that’s  dedicated  to  representing  a selected business. It should be branded just like the business  the same logo and positioning  and communicate the kinds of products and or services the business offers.   By  now,  every  business  out  there  should  have  an  internet  site.  It’s  a widespread  expectation.  Every  potential  customer  you  encounter  will  just assume  that  if  they  Google  your  business  trying  to  find  more  information, they’ll  find  an  internet  site.  And  if  they  don't,  the  company  will  look  less professional or legitimate.  E- Commerce are business websites, this doesn’t mean that if you have business  websites  it  must  sell  anything  directly,  for  example  you  can encourage  visitors  to  stay  tuned  for  more  information   a  lead  generation website  or show the store  when they become interested customers. 3. Entertainment website  If you think about your internet browsing habits, you'll probably consider a couple of websites that you simply visit purely for entertainment purposes. They could be humorous websites, like the Onion, webcomics, like xkcd, or simply websites with fun or interesting content like Buzzfeed.  Most of those websites aim to make money like business and e-commerce websites do, but usually through the advertisements that appear on the page instead of through selling specific products or services.  If you would like to start up an entertainment website, you’ve got tons of options  of  different  formats  to  take.  You  can  make  informative  and  funny videos, write fun blog posts, draw comics or make fun tests.  Since there are numerous entertainment websites out there, you ought to anticipate it taking a while and work to seek out an audience that connects with you  and even longer to start out making money, if that’s your ultimate goal ,  but  if  you’ve  got  ideas  for  content  to  make  that  you  simply  think people will find entertaining, an entertainment website is one of the simplest ways to get that content out there. 4. Portfolio website  Portfolio websites are sites dedicated to showing samples of past work. Service providers who want to point out to potential clients the standard of the work they supply can use a portfolio website to gather a number of the simplest samples of past work they’ve done. This type of website is easier to create than a business website and more focused on a specific task: collecting work samples.  This  type  of  website  is  most  common  for  creative  professionals  and   freelancers, demonstrating their skills, and may be a more efficient alternative to a business website that serves a similar focus. 5. Media website  Media  websites  collect  news  stories  or  reports.  Entertainment  sites overlap to some extent, but media sites more often contain claimed items in addition to, or instead of, entertainment content. This category includes sites like the Washington Post website, Slate, and Inc.  Media  websites  generally  make  money  either  through  advertisements which appear on the web page, subscription models, or a combination of the two.  Many media websites are the web branch of media properties that always exist  in  other  forms,  like  TV  channels  or  print  magazines  and  newspapers, but some are online only. 6. Brochure website  A brochure website is the easy-form of a business website. For businesses that know they have a web presence, but don’t want to get into it in a big way  maybe  you’re  confident  you’ll  still  get  most  of  your  business  from  other sources , an easy brochure site that has just a couple of pages that lay out the fundamentals  of  what  you  are  doing  and  supply  contact  information  could also be enough for you.  Brochure sites were more common in the earlier days of the web when businesses  knew  they  needed  an  internet  site,  but  also  expected  to  not  be hooked in to it for fulfillment. Now that the web is such an enormous part of how people research and find almost every product or repair they need, most businesses recognize that they have something more competitive.  If  you  have  a  business  and  know  you  don’t  need  your  website  to  be  a marketing  tool  that  brings  in  new  business,  you  just  need  something  more like an online business card and a website like this could be the right choice. 7. Nonprofit website  In the same way that companies need websites to be their online presence, nonprofits  also  do.  A  nonprofit  website  is  the  easiest  method  for  several potential donors to make donations and can be the primary place many of us look to find out more about a particular nonprofit and determine if they want to support it.   If  you've  got  or  are  considering  starting  a  nonprofit,  then  building  an internet  site  for  your  organization  may  be  a  crucial  step  in  proving  your legitimacy and reaching more people. You can use it to market the projects your  organization  tackles,  encourage  followers  to  require  action,  and  for accepting donations.  Note: to require donations through the web site, you’ll need to take the equivalent steps that the owners of E-Commerce sites do. In particular, get an SSL certificate to make sure all payments are secure and take out a merchant account in order to accept MasterCard payments. 8. Educational website  The  websites  of  educational  institutions  and  people  offering  online courses fall under the category of educational websites. These websites have the  main  goal  of  either  providing  educational  materials  to  visitors  or providing information on an academic institution to them.  In  some  cases,  educational  websites  get  paid  from  advertisements  like media  and  entertainment  websites  do.  They  can  also  offer  subscription models or educational products for purchase. And other functions in the web presence for an existing institution. 9. Infopreneur website  Infopreneur  websites  overlap  a  touch  with  business  and  E-Commerce websites, but they represent a singular sort of online business. Infopreneurs create  and  sell  information  products.  Which  could  be  courses,  tutorials, videos, or eBooks.  Whatever form it takes, infopreneurs need their website to try to build up a knowledge brand – convincing visitors that they know enough to make their educational products worth buying – and therefore the work of selling those products.  To sell information products securely, they’ll need the equivalent tools as an  E-Commerce  website,  including  an  SSL  certificate  and  a  merchant account. Those with tons of data products should also invest in E-Commerce software to make it easier for visitors to pick and buy those they’re interested in.  Infopreneurs  normally  create  a  mixture  of  valuable  free  content  and premium  content  they  charge  for.  The  infopreneur’s  website  is  the  central   location for both things – the free content which is a marketing tool to urge people  onto  the  page,  and  the  paid  products  that  account  for  their  profits. Building an honest website is therefore crucial for this sort of business model. 10. Personal website  Not all websites exist to make money. Many people find value in creating personal  websites  to  put  their  own  thoughts  out  into  the  universe.  This category includes personal blogs, vlogs, and photo diaries people share with the rest of the world.  Sometimes these websites can evolve into something that creates money if  they  become  popular  enough  and  therefore  what  started  them  off,  now wants to make that shift, but they primarily exist for sharing your feelings, insights, and art with any friends or strangers who may have an interest.  Building a private website is simpler than most of the opposite websites on  the  list  since  the  goal  has  lower  stakes.  You  just  make  it  as  you  like, instead of worrying about driving sales or making ad money. Some simple templates  or  an  easy-to-use  website  builder  should  be  all  it  takes  to  create something that satisfies your desire to share. 11. Web portal  Web  portals  are  usually  websites  made  for  purposes  inside  a  company, institution, or organization. They collect information in several formats from different sources into one place to form all relevant information accessible to the  people  that  get  to  see  it.  They  often  involve  a  login  and  personalized views  for  various  users  that  make  sure  the  information  that’s  accessible  is most useful to their particular needs.  Web portals will generally request harder programming and elegance than most of the opposite types described on this list, so start looking for skilled and experienced web programmers if you choose this type of website. 12. Wiki or community forum website  Most  people  are  conversant  in  wikis  through  the  famous  example  out there: Wikipedia. But wikis are often created on just about any subject you can  imagine.  A  wiki  is  any  website  where  various  users  are  ready  to collaborate on content and everyone makes his own tweaks and changes as they see fit. There are wikis of all topics and types, like business resources, fan  communities,  or  others  created  for  collecting  valuable  information   sources.  Starting a wiki is often fairly simple, especially if you choose to use an existing software or wiki site builder instead of trying to make the website from  scratch.  This  option  makes  more  sense  if  you  would  like  to  arrange available information and resources into a central space that you simply want others to have access to.  After all, you don’t know where to start, or how to structure your website, or if your website idea is good enough, or if you have enough to say, or if anyone will care once you launch it. And then there’s the worst fear of all, the one you don’t want to talk about but always lingers: What if you create a bad website?  You  might  have  even  started  thinking  about  the  website  at  some  point, but you stopped. You probably had some good momentum at first and found it really rewarding to get your ideas out of your head. You thought about how people  would  see  the  website,  maybe  pictured  the  eventual  praise  in  your future. But you hit an obstacle, and it stalled you. It brought up all your self- doubt and anxiety, and without a plan to get past that obstacle  or obstacles , you lost your momentum, and then you stopped.  It’s  probably  frustrating  that  you  aren’t  running  your  website.  You  see other people—some of whom don’t even know as much as you about your subject—who did launch their websites, who have credibility and authority in their  field,  who  are  getting  increased  visibility,  and  who  have  more  clients and  more  opportunities,  all  from  their  website.  Most  of  all,  you  see  the impact their websites have on people.  You know you could have that same impact—if you could just get your website done. Your book might not save the world, but it could change some people’s lives for the better…if only you could get it to them.  Does  this  sound  familiar?    Does  it  describe  you?  If  so,  then  this  is  the  perfect book for you.  It was written specifically for people just like you, as you embark on your journey to running and boosting with SEO strategies on your own website. If you follow the steps, it will get you there.

CHAPTER 1  WHAT GOOGLE IS AND HOW IT WORKS  Even  though  this  book  is  about  Google  SEO,  I  want  you  to  have  a  brief overview  of  what  Google  is,  its  importance  in  the  present  economy,  its strengths, and its weaknesses. Having a good overview on how this company works will help you understand in a better way who this giant company is and why Google instead of others.  Google is an American company based in California. It is mainly known  as a search engine.  Even  though  the  company  has  become  famous  as  a  search  engine,  and most of its revenue comes from advertising because of this, it has diversified into a number of areas such as cloud computing, software and hardware.  The company has recently created its first mobile hardware device, this  Google phone is called Pixel.  The  unit  of  the  company  based  on  cloud  is  called  Google  Cloud,  it includes  things  like  G-Suite,  the  company’s  productivity  apps  like  Google Drive and Gmail.  Google is the main subsidiary of Alphabet and protects its interests on the Internet. Following the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, and Larry Page became CEO of Alphabet.  Google's stated mission is to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." It is the top search engine in the world, a position  that  has  generated  concern  and  criticism  on  the  power  it  has  to influence the flow of information you can find online.  Google is so famous that the word "Google" can also be used as a verb, so that  when  someone  is  looking  for  something  on  Google,  they  can say they "Googled" for it.  At  this  point,  the  question  you’re  asking  isn’t  “what  is  Google?”  but “what does Google mean?” That’s why I want to talk about how Google got its  name.  You  know,  that  stupid  made-up  word  that  has  now  taken  its deserved space in the Oxford English Dictionary.   Back  sometime  in  the  late  ’90s,  Sergey  Brin  and  Larry  Page  were  two graduate  students  at  the  University  of  Stanford.  They  were  working  on  a search engine whose name would be BackRub, because their search engine searched through backlinks.  Fortunately,  they  realized  early  on  that  BackRub  would  be  one  of  the worst tech company names in the history of companies in general and tech companies, so they started to search for something a little more cool.  During  yet  another  name  brainstorming  session,  the  word  “googolplex”  was suggested by one of their friends, Sean, a fellow graduate student.  Yes,  when  you  ask  the  question,  “what  does  Google  mean?”  it  reveals  that Google is a misspelling of a real-life mathematical term, googol.  Googolplex is the official name used for the number: 10 to the power of googol. Googol is the name mathematicians use to reference 10 to the power of 100, or:  10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,-  000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  That’s 1 plus 100 zeros. The name googolplex and googol were originally coined by the nephew of Edward Kasner  an important American mathematician  Milton Sirotta. As Sirotta said, googolplex was shorthand for a number so large that you would have to write it as “one, followed by too many zeroes that will get you tired.” Of course, his uncle Edward found this definition to not be specific because after all it is true that “not all the people get tired at the same time and for example it would never have happened to the famous boxer Primo Carnera to be  a  better  mathematician  than  Dr.  Einstein,  because  he  simply  had  more endurance  and  could  write  for  longer!”  So  googolplex  has  recieved  the official definition of being 10 to the power of googol or, if you prefer, 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 100.  As  Sean  suggested  googolplex,  Larry  said  that  he  preferred  the  other word googol, and felt like the term in general was a great match for what they were  trying  to  create:  index  an  incredible  number  of  web  pages  on  the Internet.  Sean  didn't  realize  googol  was  spelled  with  an  “ol”  at  the  end,  so  he unknowingly  searched  on  the  Internet  to  see  if  the  domain  name “google.com” was available.   Larry  liked  the  new  term  Sean  had  accidentally  invented,  and  voila! Google was finally named. And now you can answer the next time you hear someone else wondering, “what does Google mean?”.  Alphabet Inc. business overview from the company’s financial report: “Alphabet is a collection of companies and Google, of course, is the main one. It also includes other businesses that are generally pretty far afield from our  main  Internet  products  such  as  CapitalG,  GV,  Calico,  Nest,  Access, Waymo, X, and Verily. Our Alphabet structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong independence and leaders.  Google's  core  products  such  as  Android,  Search,  Maps,  YouTube, Chrome,  Gmail,  and  Google  Play  each  have  over  one  billion  active  users every month. But most important, we strongly believe we are just beginning to  scratch  the  surface.  Our  future  vision  is  to  be  a  place  of  incredible innovation and creativity that uses our technical expertise to face up to big problems.  We  generate  our  revenues  primarily  by  delivering  both  performance  brand advertising and advertising.  Across  the  company,  artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning  are increasingly  driving  many  of  our  latest  innovations.  Considering  that  our investments in machine learning in Google over a decade have enabled us to build products that are more useful and smarter - it's what lets you use your voice to ask the Google Assistant to translate the web from one language to another, for information, to search for people and events in Google Photos, and to see YouTube recommendations.  We  face  formidable  competition  in  every  aspect  of  our  business, particularly  from  companies  looking  to  connect  people  with  information online and deliver relevant advertising to them. We face competition from:  General purpose  search engines  and information  services,  such as Microsoft's Bing, Seznam, Baidu, Yandex, Verizon's Yahoo, and Naver. Vertical search engines and E-Commerce websites, such as eBay and  Amazon   E-Commerce ,  WebMD   health  queries ,  Kayak  travel queries , and LinkedIn  job queries . Social  networks,  such  as  SnapChat,  Twitter,  and  Facebook.   Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service  referrals,  rather  than  seeking  information  through traditional search engines. Providers  of  digital  video  services,  such  as  Facebook,  Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. Providers  of  enterprise  cloud  services,  including  Amazon, Alibaba, and Microsoft. Digital  assistant  providers,  such  as  Microsoft,  Apple,  and Amazon.” Google’s strengths 1.  Dominance  in  web  search,  online  advertising,  video  content  sharing, browser usage, mobile OS, and many other markets  Alphabet’s Google is an Internet company that primarily competes in the web search and online advertising markets. However, the company’s product portfolio is very diverse and includes both related and unrelated software and hardware  services  and  products.  Google  dominates  most  of  the  markets  it operates within, including: Web search  Google Search is the most famous company’s search engine that people use to find information online. It’s the most used search engine in the world with a 92.6% share of the mobile segment and 73.63% desktop market share as of March 2018.  Google’s  search  engine  domination  is  especially  prominent  in  Europe with the company having more than 90% market share in both the mobile and desktop market segments. Online advertising  Google’s  main  source  of  revenue  is  its  advertising  business.  In  2017, Google earned US$95.375 billion from advertising or 87% of Google’s total revenue and 86% of the total Alphabets’ revenue.  According  to  the  market  research  company  eMarketer,  Google  earned more  than  43%  of  the  whole  United  States  digital  advertising  revenue  in 2017,  twice  as  much  as  Facebook,  their  next  largest  earner.  Worldwide, Google earned more than 33% of the digital advertising revenue in 2016.   The  company  dominates  the  digital  advertising  market  through  many different  channels,  including  its  own  AdWords  advertising  program, AdSense, the Android OS, and YouTube.  Being  the  first  in  the  online  advertising  market  Google  can  understand more than anyone current advertising trends, enhance their related services by improving  targeted  advertisements,  and  collect  an  incredible  amount  of information about online users’ shopping habits. Android mobile operating system  Google’s recent increase in its advertising and other revenue sources has  been fuelled by the huge adoption of its Android mobile OS.  Android OS is the number one mobile operating system in the world and it’s being used by some of the largest smartphone companies such as Xiaomi, Samsung, OPPO, Huawei, LG, Huawei and Lenovo. In 2018 April, Google’s Android  had  73.2%  of  the  worldwide  smartphone  operating  system  market share.  The  growing  market  share  of  Android  has  led  to  an  increase  in  the popularity  of  other  Google  products  such  as  the  Chrome  browser,  Google Search,  Google  Play  and  Google  Play  Music,  further  strengthening  the company's position in these markets.  The  question  now  is,  how  does  Google’s  leadership  status  in  these  markets help the company to gain a strong competitive advantage? Massive amount of information  Google receives an enormous amount of information about its users and their  habits  through  Google  Analytics,  Google  Search,  Chrome,  YouTube, Android  OS  and  its  other  products  and  services.  This  information  provides Google with an important competitive advantage.  Google can target advertisements or tailor its products to user needs better than  any  competitor  because  it  has  smarter  algorithms  and  a  lot  more information about its users. Increase brand awareness  Market  leadership  gives  Google  greater  attention,  visibility  and  greater  user engagement through brand awareness.  Power  over  customers,  competitors  and  suppliers.  To  some  extent, Google  can  use  its  dominant  market  share  as  a  source  of  power  over  its   customers, competitors and suppliers. 2. Excellent extraction capabilities  Since  2013,  Alphabet   Google  through  2015   has  taken  over  118 companies.  From  2013  to  2017,  the  company  made  an  average  of  1.6 purchases per month, one of the highest asset acquisition rates in the world.  Acquisitions  are  a  key  strategy  for  gaining  Alphabet's  competitive  advantage.  By  acquiring  other  companies,  Alphabet  acquires  new  knowledge, technologies,  patents  and  improves  its  products  and  services,  which  allows the company to grow faster with less effort. A company often buys finished products that grow into successful companies like YouTube.  Alphabet is like many other tech companies in the sense that without such acquisitions we would have to invest heavily in research and development to improve  our  products  or  create  new  ones.  Alphabet  has  demonstrated  its capabilities in the field of successful mergers, acquisitions and integration of companies into the company. 3. Wide market share  In  October  2019,  Google  ranked    1  among  the  most  visited  cross- platform web properties in the US with nearly 259 million unique US visitors and  62.5%  market  share  among  the  top  search  engine  providers  US.  The market capitalization of parent company Alphabet as of September 2019 is valued at $ 825 billion. 4. Invincibility  Until  now,  no  competitor  has  managed  to  challenge  their  position,  let alone  achieve  their  market  share  in  search  engines.  Yes,  we  all  know  that Google is dominant in the search field. But at the same time, the internet is also a very big place, and building a decent search algorithm couldn't be that hard, right?  This  week's  chart  is  a  little  confusing,  as  it  shows  that  Google  is  even more dominant than you might think. Of all the features of Google and its subsidiary search giant YouTube, over 90% of all internet searches are done through the company. 5. Largest traffic generator  Google generates more than 1.2 billion visits each month. It is the largest   traffic  generator  and  clearly  has  an  advantage  over  competitors  such  as Yahoo, Baidu and Bing.  According to the market analytics company, which licenses hundreds of millions  of  users  to  ClickStream  anonymous  data,  about  64.1%  of  all  web searches go through Google’s main feature.  But that’s just the beginning, as this number doesn’t include other Google features  like  image  search  or  Google  Maps,  or  features  like  YouTube. Together,  Google  has  an  impressive  90.8  percent  market  share  of  web, mobile, and app searches, though it should be noted that the said source does not yet contain extensive iPhone data. 6. High revenue  Google’s revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was $ 40.88 billion, down $  45.6 billion from the previous quarter.  In 2019, Google generated most of Alphabet's core revenue with just $ 112.25  billion  in  ad  revenue  on  Google  sites.  Most  of  Google's  revenue comes from advertising through Google's proprietary and curated properties such as Google Maps, Google Search and more.  Revenue  generated  by  sites  that  are  members  of  the  Google  Network includes  revenue  from  ads  served  through  advertising  programs  such  as AdSearch for AdSense. Other revenues include digital content products and applications sold through Google's digital content delivery platform, as well as  hardware,  including  smartphones  and  Chromecast  devices.  The  digital content  platform  Google  Play  is  increasingly  contributing  to  Google's expansion,  especially  with  the  increase  in  smartphone  sales  and  the  market share of Google Android. Geographically, most of Google's revenue comes from  individual  countries  in  the  United  States  and  32%  of  its  revenue  is generated in the EMEA region. 7. Flexibility  Google  has  successfully  adapted  mobile  and  Android  technologies, allowing them to compete directly with Apple's iPhone. Android has evolved over the years and has quickly become the dominant mobile platform around the world. According to Statista Android, it had owned more than 74% of the global mobile operating system market share since December 2019.  While most of us know exactly what Android is and how to use it, there are  still  a  lot  of  people  unfamiliar  with  Google’s  mobile  operating  system   who eventually drop or switch off that old-fashioned cell phone. iPhone or any  other  Android  competitor.  Are  you  among  the  latest  in  Android?  This article is just for you.  Android is not a phone or an app, but an operating system based on the Linux kernel. You have no idea what this is? In its simplest definition, Linux is the operating system most commonly found in servers and desktops. Due to many changes under the hood, Android is not just a version of Linux, but it is connected.  Android  is  an  operating  system  designed  with  mobile  devices  in  mind, where the features and applications of your phone are. Everything you see on the device screen is part of the operating system. When you receive a call, text message, or e-mail, the operating system processes this information and converts it into a readable format. Google’s weaknesses 1. Privacy Policy  Many  experts  have  accused  Google  of  relying  too  much  on  privacy, especially  by  hiding  information  about  algorithms.  The  company  has  since taken steps to address the allegations.  The term “invasion of privacy” distracts us from understanding important  issues.  Infringement  of  privacy  is  often  a  central  issue  where  consumers  need protection from technology companies. Apple has placed it as the basis for its marketing.  Companies  collect  information  about  you  when  you  use  their  services. You may be surprised how many information technology companies monitor, but this is nothing new - companies have been monitoring data about you for a long time.  You  may  be  surprised  to  learn  what  conclusions  companies  can  draw from what they know about you. Well, they accept conclusions so well that sometimes you find it scary, and much more terrifying.  As  long  as  a  large  company  like  Google  keeps  your  information  to themselves  and  shares  it  only  with  you,  it  is  not  an  invasion  of  privacy. Privacy  only  becomes  an  invasion  if  you  share  your  personal  information with others. Facebook has done this too many times. Google has been reliable   so far. 2. Excessive ads  Google's  over-reliance  on  ads  has  led  to  further  speculation  about  the company's future. The company generated 86% of its total revenue from its ad-related  projects.  Experts  believe  that  a  possible  change  in  sales  would significantly harm the company.  When Google changed the number of ad units per page in August 2016, the previous "three display units" limit was removed. Some publishers have chosen to interpret this as 'unlimited ads', but as we noted at the time, it's both about  requesting  a  higher  share  of  the  valuable  content  and  limiting  the number of ad units.  Google engineering seems to be busy and has developed a way to apply this change to scale rules. We've seen evidence of multiple 'low to zero value' and   or 'excessive advertising' warnings and enforcement, so we felt it was a good time to summarize what was expected and share what we have learned about it. and how these rules are implemented. 3. Boycott of Google and YouTube by major advertisers  Major brands boycotted Google and YouTube when they discovered that their  ads  were  running  alongside  extremist  content  full  of  hatred.  This negatively  affected  Google's  image.  Companies  that  boycotted  the  search engine and video platform included Johnson & Johnson, AT&T and Verizon in  the  US,  L’Oréal,  HSBC,  RBS,  BBC,  the  Guardian  newspaper,  British retailer Marks & Spencer, Lloyd’s of London in the UK. Audi, Havas, Tesco, Volkswagen, Sainsbury.  In  addition  to  these  stamps,  the  British  government  also  boycotted  it. Google was called before the British Cabinet in 2017 after the government found  that  its  ads  -  and  ads  for  other  taxpayer-funded  services  such  as  the Royal Navy and the BBC - were appearing on YouTube alongside extremist videos, which were discovered after an investigation by The Times.  A cabinet spokesman told Business Insider that the meeting was attended by senior Google executives and apologized to senior officials representing the government.  Google has also promised an overhaul of its advertising systems. A  government  spokesman  said:  "It  is  completely  unacceptable  for   taxpayer-funded ads to run alongside inappropriate Internet content and this message has been communicated very clearly to Google. The government has told Google it expects a plan and timetable for improving the work to prevent government  ads  from  repeating  themselves.  YouTube  ads  will  remain suspended as long as this work is in progress. "  The UK government has asked Google to return to the government next  week to discuss steps it has taken to strengthen its advertising policy.  At  the  time,  a  growing  number  of  advertisers  -  including  L'Oréal, McDonald's,  Audi,  Sainsbury's,  The  Guardian  and  Channel  4  -  stopped advertising  on  YouTube  and  called  Google  to  make  sure  their  ads  weren't showing with inappropriate content on a video site.   CHAPTER 2  BRIEF HISTORY OF GOOGLE  Search  engines  or  internet  portals  have  existed  since  the  early  days  of  the internet. But it was Google, a relatively late user, that later became the main target of finding anything on the World Wide Web. Search engine definition  A search engine is a program that searches the Internet and searches web pages based on the keywords entered. The search engine consists of several parts, including:  Algorithms that rank results by importance Search engine software, such as logical operators, search fields, and display format Database Spider or "crawling" software that reads web pages  Inspiration for the name  The  popular  Google  search  engine  was  invented  by  computer  scientists Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The site is named after Google - the name of number 1 followed by 100 zeros - in a book by James Newman and Edward Kasner Mathematics and Imagination. The name of the founders of the site represents an immeasurable amount of information that a search engine must search for.  PageRank, Delivering Search Results, and Backrub In 1995 Brin and Page met at Stanford University when they graduated in computer  science.  In  January  1996,  the  couple  began  collaborating  on  a search  engine  program  called  Backrub,  named  for  its  ability  to  analyze backlinks.  The  result  of  the  project  was  a  very  popular  research  article entitled 'The Anatomy of a Vast Hypertext Search Engine'.  This search engine was unique in that it used the technology developed by PageRank and determined the relevance of the site by taking into account the number of pages along with the importance of the pages that went back to   the original site. At that point, search engines ranked the results based on how often a search term appeared on a website.  Then, buoyed by Backrub's overwhelming criticism, Brin and Page began developing  Google.  It  was  a  very  powerful  project  at  the  time.  He  worked from  his  dormitories,  building  a  network  of  servers  with  cheap,  used,  and borrowed personal computers. Credit cards were even used to buy terabytes of records at discounted prices.  At  first,  they  tried  to  license  their  search  engine  technology,  but  in  the early  stages  of  development,  they  couldn’t  find  anyone  who  wanted  their product.  Brin  and  Page  then  decided  to  keep  Google  and  find  further resources, improve the product and present it to the public when they had the finished product. Initial funding  The  strategy  worked,  and  after  further  development,  Google’s  search engine  eventually  turned  into  a  hot  commodity.  Andy  Bechtolsheim,  co- founder of Sun Microsystems, was so excited that after a quick presentation on  Google,  he  told  the  couple,  "Why  don’t  I  write  you  a  check  instead  of discussing all the details?"  Bechtolsheim's  check  was  $  100,000  and  was  issued  to  Google  Inc., although Google did not yet exist as a legal entity. However, the next step did not take long: Page and Brin were formed on September 4, 1998. The check also allowed them to raise $ 900,000 more for their first round of funding. Among other investors was Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.  With  sufficient  resources,  Google  Inc.  opened  its  first  office  in  Menlo Park, California. Google.com was launched, a beta search engine  test status  that  responded  to  10,000  searches  daily.  On  September  21,  1999,  Google officially removed the beta from the title. Ascent to prominence  In  2001,  Google  applied  for  and  received  a  patent  for  its  PageRank technology, invented by Larry Page. At that point, the company moved to a larger space in nearby Palo Alto. After the company finally went public, it was feared that the rapid growth of the one-time start-up would change the culture of the company, which was based on the company's motto "Do No Evil".  The  pledge  reflected  the  commitment  of  the  founders  and  all employees  to  do  their  work  objectively  and  without  conflict  of  interest  or   bias. To ensure that the company remained true to its core values, the position of Director of Culture was created.  During the period of rapid growth, the company introduced a number of products,  including  Gmail,  Google  Docs,  Google  Drive,  Google  Voice  and the Chrome web browser. It also acquired YouTube and Blogger.com video streaming  platforms.  Recently,  there  have  been  hikes  to  various  sectors. Examples  include  a  smart  speaker   Google  Home ,  Android   mobile operating  system ,  Stadia   game ,  Pixel   portable  hardware ,  Nexus  smartphone ,  Chromebook   laptop ,  broadband  access   Google  Fi ,  self- driving autonomous and many other companies. However, search advertising revenue remains a major source of revenue.  In 2015, Google underwent a department and staff restructuring under the conglomerate  name  Alphabet.  Sergey  Brin  became  chairman  of  the  newly formed parent company Larry Page, CEO. Brin's place on Google was taken by  the  promotion  of  Sundar  Pichai.  Alphabet  and  its  subsidiaries  together rank among the 10 most valuable and influential companies in the world. 10 Fun facts about Google  Google's  iconic  'stick  figure'  logo  was  designed  after  the  Burning  Man festival logo. The founders used a stick to tell customers and users to close the store to attend the first Burning Man festival.  The check for $ 100,000 written by Sun's Bechtolsheim lay intact in his desk  drawer  for  weeks:  it  took  Bryn  and  Page  to  set  up  the  company  as Google Inc., as it said on the check.  In its early heyday, Google hired a chef named Ayers Charlie. His claim  to fame? Ayers was a chef often used by The Grateful Dead.  In 1998, Google hired its first employee, Silverstein Craig. Google now  has more than 89,000 employees.  Google  New  York  has  placed  a  Google  sales  associate  at  Starbucks  SBUX   in  New  York  City  -  Get  Report.  Today,  Google  employees  report that they are working on a 2.9 million square foot complex on Eighth Avenue in New York City.  Google is known for its unofficial April fool's jokes. A real joke was the launch of Gmail on April 1, 2004, which users considered a joke. Today it is one of the most popular email platforms in the world.   The big takeover of YouTube by Google did not happen at the offices of the tech giant. Instead, YouTube co-founder Steven Chen suggested a place no one would recognize them: Denny's in Palo Alto, California. The $ 1.65 acquisition was reportedly squeezed on mozzarella sticks and iced tea.  Hollywood has associated itself with cultural phenomena in the past, and Google was no different. On October 14, 2002, the term "Google" was used in the hit TV show "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".  One of Google’s first regular visitors was a dog named Yoshka, brought to work every day by his owner Urs Hoelzle, who had hired him in advance for Google. Today, the company is considered one of the friendliest jobs in the United States.  Google  is  also  known  in  another  area  related  to  animals.  The  company occasionally hires goats to “mow the grass” at a location in Mountain View. The goats, numbering a few hundred, chew grass blades for another week and leave a well-fertilized property until they return. Google 2021 and beyond  Today,  Google  continues  what  it  calls  “the  relentless  search  for  better  answers” as its core philosophy.  The company also continues to develop its range of all-star products and services,  transforming  its  corporate  structure  in  2015  with  parent  company Alphabet, which now runs Google, and its expanded presence with offices in 50 countries across the country. world. How wide is it? Alphabet posted sales of $ 110.9 billion and net profit of $ 12.6 billion in 2017.  Sergey Brin and Larry Page didn't fare badly either. Google's co-founders now  have  a  net  worth  of  $  55.4  billion  and  $  54  billion,  respectively.  Far from  a  dorm  room  at  Stanford,  it  remains  one  of  the  most  compelling business success stories, one that grows every day.   CHAPTER 3  MINDSET TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH  GOOGLE SEO  Don't you hate that it takes forever to get results when it comes to SEO?  Everyone says it takes anywhere from 6 months to a year and, in some  cases, years to see results.  I have bad and good news for you. Let's start with the bad news ... SEO is a long-term strategy. It's not about doing it for a few months and forgetting.  And  if  you  don't  focus  on  that  anymore,  your  competitors  will eventually overtake you. And now let's move on to the good news.  You can get short-term results. You may not get all the results you want right away and you may not rank your ideal keywords, but that doesn't mean you can't get results in 90, 60, and maybe even 30 days.  So how do you get results in a few months? First, let's try to figure out  how to think about SEO the right way. SEO isn't just about content and links What do you need to be number 1 on Google? Well,  the  data  shows  that  you  need  to  write  long  content.  Because  the  average website on Google has 1,880 words.  And of course, what is offline content? Because the main factors affecting  SEO rankings are domain-level links and page-level links.  But here’s the thing: SEO is no longer what it used to be. By 2010, you could add keywords to your meta tags and get rankings in a matter of months. Once the web was taken over, you could get results in the same way, but you also had to create some links. Between 2010 and 2013, it worked very well.  As  more  businesses  emerged,  they  all  began  to  focus  on  content marketing. It was hot. If you created tons of articles between 2013 and 2018, got  some  social  media  shares,  and  collected  some  natural  backlinks,  you could really dominate Google. But we now count more than a billion blogs if   we count WordPress.com, Medium, and Tumblr. This means that Google has a choice when it comes to determining which sites should be on top.  In  other  words,  just  because  you're  writing  lengthy  content  or  building backlinks doesn't mean you're ranking. Millions of other websites are doing the same. And even if you're early and your site is 10 years old, it's not that easy  to  dominate  the  web  anymore.  Look  at  places  like  Wisegeek.  They dominated the web because it is a site with thousands of informative articles. And now they fly!  According to Ubersuggest, Google receives approximately 49,121 visitors per  month  in  the  United  States.  It  may  seem  like  a  lot,  but  their  traffic  is steadily declining. When I met the founder years ago, there were millions ... but no more. It doesn't matter at all that the site has 8,716,524 backlinks with 74,174 referring domains.  Now  you  may  find  that  Wisegeek  doesn’t  have  the  best  content. However,  I  have  many  examples  of  great  content  sites  that  have  the  same problems. According to Ubersuggest, Google receives about 26,460 visitors from  the  U.S.  per  month  and  has  993,690  backlinks  from  5,768  reference domains. And it achieves some great expressions. Take a look at the first few pages where they rank with terms like “how to boost self-confidence”.  Allowing  Google  to  crawl  the  site  effectively  and  have  a  clean  user  experience are the two main topics every digital retailer should focus on.  However, a common SEO trap is to get too caught up in smaller objects  that don't necessarily press against the needle.  The SEO landscape is constantly evolving. For this reason, the best way to bring discipline to results is to focus on a “growth mindset”. This means not  only  increasing  your  site's  physical  presence  on  pages,  but  also experimenting  and  maintaining  flexibility  between  your  organic  marketing tactics to build authority, increase traffic, keep content up to date, and a lot more.  While there are many different strategies for "growing" a website, some  of the best are generally industry-specific.  We've identified a number of key tactics that can help anyone working in  the hospitality industry see success in website development. Know the objective   Before starting, it is important to identify the main goals of the growth strategy.  Without  a  predetermined  goal,  the  plan  will  quickly  split  into smaller strategies that are further away from the original focus. Here are some important metrics to consider when looking for growth:  Users Keyword positioning E-Commerce conversions and earnings Potential buyers and filling in forms  Look for organic opportunities  It's easy to measure performance based on a particular set of metrics, but the likelihood of growth is within search queries and landing pages, which don't get the same attention every day. There are a few ways to identify these gaps:  Search  Console  Landing  Page  Report:  This  report  shows  the performance of all organic keywords and landing pages on your site. The capability can be found in sorting pages by impressions and analyzing pages with high impressions, but with just a few clicks.  This gap highlights the potential for improved metadata and organic click-through rate. Improving this can increase the number of organic site visits.  Domain Map SEMRush:  SEMRush  allows  users  to  see  all  the organic  keywords  that  rank  on  a  particular  site.  Sorting  your keywords  by  search  volume  and  excluding  searches  that  drive traffic  to  your  site  is  a  great  way  to  find  out  what  users  are searching for that your site doesn’t catch.  This is a great opportunity to create new content and attract more organic  collaboration. Use paid data to help your strategy  It  might  make  sense  to  use  paid  metrics  when  considering  organic growth, but a combination of both practices can leave room for opportunity.   Google  no  longer  provides  keyword-level  conversion  statistics  for  organic search.  Adding  paid  data  can  highlight  keywords  that  should  be  central  to  the SEO space. Paid media teams have an in-depth understanding of the searches they convert and can pass this information along to the SEO team.  Coordinating organic targeting with paid advertising is a unique way to  increase organic revenue.  In general, the main goal of a growth strategy is to not spend too much time  on  what  is  already  working.  Keep  pushing  boundaries  and  look  for opportunities outside of the current ecosystem.  If we want to build on a solid foundation, the only way is to anticipate the  digital marketing curve. 5 mindset mistakes people make when it comes to SEO  Sometimes even the smartest SEOs are to blame for the loss of a forest due  to  trees.  Columnist  Tom  Demers  takes  a  closer  look  at  some  common attitudes and behaviors that can prevent your campaigns from reaching their full potential.  I’ve  been  reading  a  lot  lately  about  different  approaches  to  page  speed  optimization. Here are 5 mistakes to avoid: 1. Narcissism of the essential theme  Sharing knowledge about what you are an expert in is a great way to gain links  and  traffic.  Many  successful  blogs  are  born  without  the  author  even knowing  what  SEO  is,  and  end  up  attracting  a  huge  amount  of  traffic  to Google simply by sharing solutions to the problems they have had.  However, this is very different from the approach I see on many  frankly, probably  most   business  blogs.  “Scratching  the  itch”  and  sharing  useful information that interests you and that you are well versed is not the same as writing about what you and your company want to create content with.  Many business magazines are a mixture of business-oriented short-term posts   actually  press  releases ,  extremely  short  content  that  proclaims  the importance of something  usually a product or service that the company sells  without  actually  demonstrating  it  in  any  particular  way,  Final,  and  with  no added real value for the readers, and   or short lists of not particularly helpful   suggestions that the reader has found on many other sites.  There's certainly nothing wrong with including shorter content, product   business  updates,  or  more  explicitly  designed  posts  to  promote  leads  and sales - these are business blogs, after all. But if a blog post falls in the woods and no one is around to read it, that won't bring in potential customers, right? It's  a  concept  that  SEOs  and  content  strategists  have  talked  about endlessly,  but  I  still  see  tons  of  companies  looking  to  rip  off  self-referring sales collateral and have someone dust off "the SEO goblin dust" on content that no one would have reasonable incentive for. To share or link.  So what's the best approach? A  better  mindset  is  to  focus  on  delivering  useful  content  that  your audience  wants,  even  if  not  every  blog  post  and  page  on  your  site  is generating  immediate  sales.  In  concrete  terms,  you  can  come  up  with  a combination:  Problems  you  have  solved  for  yourself  or  your  customers  and about which you can share information. Research what your potential customers are looking for and post them  eg keyword research . Posts  that  lead  to  other  sources   which  is  useful  for  both potential and those you tag . Industry reports, surveys, and other types of content that are so valuable to potential customers that they are happy to share their contact information.  This  does  not  mean  that  you  will  no  longer  offer  case  studies, presentations, consultations, free trials, and more on your site, it just means that you have a better chance of people actually finding them on your site. 2. Nice over Google  A lot of the advice you get from Google that you need SEO - and SEO in general - is pretty good. Much of the focus is on making your site accessible, creating  content  for  readers,  and  avoiding  certain  things  that  violate  their guidelines  these are risky tactics .  However,  most  of  the  recommendations  that  Google  offers  are  in  the interest of Google users and   or Google businesses, so not everything that   Google recommends is in the interest of your business.  Just because Google is introducing a new algorithm update, SERP view, or product feature doesn’t necessarily mean you need to rearrange your to-do list right away to jump to the latest ad.  So what is the better approach? Understanding what Google says and what it emphasizes in search results is  helpful  and  important,  but  make  good  business  and  marketing  decisions. Don't  review  your  site  or  delay  important  activities  just  because  you're posting the latest news referenced   sneezed by Webmaster Central this week. 3. Glamorous blog syndrome  Also,  many  marketers  and  business  owners  have  some   tactical  ACCESSORIES when it comes to their approach to SEO.  I  like  a  good  case  study  of  SEO  as  well  as  the  next,  but  a  tactic  that worked for someone else may not work on your site. It may also work well for your site, but it’s less effective than other things you might spend your time on.  For  example,  clearing  out  very  specific  glitches  and  minor  page  speed improvements  can  have  huge  benefits  for  a  massive  site  with  high  traffic, quality content and links, but it probably won't help your five-page B2B SaaS site which has almost no links and has mostly organic brand traffic.  Likewise, a strategy or tactic that results in a 50 percent increase in traffic to a site that brings 10,000 unique visitors per month may not have the same impact on a site that already attracts hundreds of thousands of unique visitors and is pursuing growth. Stepping function.  So what's the best approach? Appreciating  the  case  studies  and  following  what  your  competitors  are doing is great, but take them with a grain of salt and try to contextualize the tactics you learn and observe. Your competitors may be implementing tactics that work great for them, but not for you, and this clever SEO case study may have worked well on another site, but it may not be worth throwing out your SEO strategy.  I like to spend a specific budget   time on experimentation and define the definition of success or failure before starting a project. If it works, you can integrate this brilliant new tactic more broadly into your SEO efforts, if you   don't, you're just wasting the time and budget you previously set.  This  ensures  that  trying  out  new  tactics  doesn't  take  the  wheel  of  an approach that works or would work if you follow it, allowing you to try new things. 4. SEO FOMO  The  fourth  and  related  mistake  I  see  companies  make  is  overcome  by SEO  FOMO   fear  of  loss .  It’s  a  constant  quest  for  the  “next  big  thing,” which  is  more  focused  on  finding  a  fast-moving  plan  that  brings  you  big returns  with  little  effort  than  on  implementing  a  long-term  sustainability strategy.  Competitors  may  or  may  not  beat  you,  but  they  probably  won’t  “win” with some secret and simple tricks you’ll be able to figure out if you watch long  enough.  Probably  most  companies  that  perform  better  than  you: implementing a tactic   strategy that you are already aware of but are doing better  than  you  are,  or  actually  using  a  shady,  easy-to-perform  trick  with extreme  risk   which  you  would  actually  rather  avoid  if  the  choice  was offered  .  And often the competitors that companies are most jealous of are actually  not doing as well as they think. So what's the best approach? Focus on the things you can control. Set your goals, evaluate the tactics at  your disposal and determine the best strategy for you.  It  certainly  plays  a  role  in  analyzing  what  successful  competitors  and companies are doing, but constantly changing strategies and getting the secret code  of  SEO  fraud  is  a  great  way  to  distract  yourself  from  your  work  to actually improve your site and your organic traffic. 5. Fear of involvement or "ticking the box"  Potentials are usually surprised when I tell them they probably shouldn't be  using  SEO.  Of  course   since  I  own  a  business   I  don't  tell  this  to  all potential clients, but the reality is that not all businesses should be spending on SEO.  What  if  you  were  a  small  business  with  limited  resources  and  a  very specific local addressable market? Spending a monthly amount on SEO just to "tick the box" can be a less effective spend than a channel that you know   offers  quality  options.  It  might  make  more  sense  to  work  with  smart  local SEOs for once and take advantage of occasional consultancy calls if you're on a tight budget.  Likewise, it's probably worse than not starting at all if you're too skeptical about  SEO  or  don't  support  the  process  with  enough  internal  resources   so you can make recommended technical changes, publish new content, promote that content, etc. .  So what is the better approach? Challenging assumptions and asking for clarification and communication is  great,  but  once  you  start  SEO,  you  have  to  work  hard,  give  your  full support  to  those  responsible   internal  or  external   and  set  specific  criteria, then assess the effectiveness of the work performed.  If  you’re  a  small  business  and  can’t  deal  with  these  things  right  now, focus  on  other  areas  of  your  business  and  review  SEO  again  later.  I  think SEO is a very effective and efficient channel for most companies, but not all companies  should  be  aggressively  committed  to  SEO  in  order  to  be successful. Last thoughts  Before you start working on your list of the latest SEO tactics and tricks, it’s important to make sure your overall strategy and approach doesn’t limit your earnings, so start avoiding these five misconceptions and make sure you make the most of your SEO efforts.   CHAPTER 4  SEO RULE IN BUSINESS WORLD  12 Reasons why your business absolutely needs SEO  SEO is important for more research and visibility, but it offers more real value than that. I want to show you the best 12 reasons why businesses need SEO to take their branding to the next level in 2021.  Many brands and companies know  or think they know  that they need SEO for their digital properties and the benefits they will get from this SEO work done on their behalf.  SEO will definitely improve a website's overall search and visibility, but  what value does it really provide? Why is SEO so important?  Regardless of industry or company size, these 12 reasons should provide some clarity as to why businesses need SEO to take their brand to the next level. 1. Organic search is often the main source of traffic to a website  A  typical  search  is  an  important  part  of  most  businesses'  website performance,  as  well  as  an  important  part  of  the  customer  funnel,  and ultimately entices users to complete a conversion or collaboration.  As  marketers  know,  Google  owns  a  significantly  higher  share  of  the search  market  than  competitors  such  as  Yahoo,  Bing,  Baidu,  Yandex, DuckDuckGo, and many, many others.  This is not to say that not all search engines contribute to brand awareness - they do - Google alone owns about 75% of the entire search market. It is an unambiguous leader, so it is important to follow its guidelines.  The remaining 25% of the market owned by other engines is clearly also  valuable to brands.  Google, the most visited website in the world  and especially in the US , is  also  the  most  popular  email  provider  in  the  world   with  over  a  billion users . Not to mention that YouTube is the second largest search engine.  We know that the vast majority of the world has access to the Internet and  visits Google at least once a day for information.   If  you  are  highly  recognized  by  Google  and  other  search  engines  as  a trusted  source,  you  will  always  work  for  the  benefit  of  the  brand.  Quality SEO and a quality website bring brands there. 2. SEO builds trust and credibility  The  goal  of  any  experienced  SEO  is  to  build  a  solid  foundation  for  a wonderful website with a clean and effective user experience that is easy to find while searching, thanks to the trust and credibility of the brand and its digital features.  Many elements play a role in building authority over search engines like Google. In addition to the factors listed above, authority is built over time due to elements such as:  Quality feedback profiles. Positive user behavior. Machine learning signals. Optimized elements and content on the page.  But setting up this body will do more for the brand than most, if not all, of  other  digital  optimizations.  The  problem  is  that  it  is  impossible to build trust  and  credibility  overnight,  just  like  in  real  life.  We  earn  and  build authority over time.  Establishing a brand as an authority requires patience, commitment and dedication,  and  it  also  depends  on  offering  a  valuable  quality  product  or service with which customers can trust the brand. 3. Good SEO also means a better user experience  Everyone  wants  better  organic  ranking  and  maximum  visibility.  Few  people know that a great user experience is an important part of the journey.  Google  has  learned  to  interpret  a  good  or  bad  user  experience,  and  a positive user experience has become an important element of a site's success. Customers know what they want. If they don't find it, there is a problem.  And the performance will suffer.  A clear example of how to build a strong user experience is how Google has increasingly become an answering machine that provides users with the data they are looking for directly on SERPs  search engine results pages .   The goal is to quickly and easily provide users with the information they  are looking for with fewer clicks.  SEO quality includes a positive user experience and takes advantage of it  to work for the benefit of the brand. 4. Local SEO means increased engagement, traffic & conversions  With the growing dominance of mobile traffic, local search has become a  key part of the success of small and medium-sized businesses.  Local  SEO  focuses  on  optimizing  digital  properties  for  a  specific environment so that people can find you quickly and easily by being one step closer  to  the  transaction.  Local  optimizations  target  specific  cities,  places, regions,  and  even  countries  to  create  a  profitable  medium  for  local  brand communication.  SEO experts do this by optimizing site and brand content, including local citations and backlinks, and local lists that match the location and industry to which the brand belongs.  To  encourage  collaboration  locally,  optimization  professionals  should optimize  the  brand  knowledge  pane,  Google  My  Business  list,  and  social media profiles.  There  should  also  be  a  strong  emphasis  on  user  reviews  on  Google,  as well  as  other  review  sites  such  as  Yelp,  Home  Advisor,  and  Angie’s  List  depending on the industry, among others . 5. SEO Impacts the buying cycle  Customers  do  their  research.  This  is  one  of  the  biggest  benefits  of  the  internet from a customer perspective.  Using  SEO  tactics  to  play  your  posts  for  bargains,  innovative  products and   or services, and the relevance and reliability of the offer to customers will change the game.  Undoubtedly,  it  will  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  buying  cycle  if  done correctly.  Brands  need  to  be  visible  where  people  need  them  to  make  a  valuable link.  Local  SEO  improves  this  visibility  and  allows  potential  customers  to find answers and companies that offer those answers. 6. SEO Best practices are always being updated   It's  great  when  we  implement  SEO  tactics  on  a  brand's  website  and  its digital  features,  but  when  it  comes  to  short-term  engagement   budget constraints, etc  and the site isn't constantly re-evaluated over time, it will be in which other barriers can no longer improve.  The  way  the  search  world  is  evolving,  essentially  at  the  discretion  of Google,  requires  constant  monitoring  of  changes  that  will  be  ahead  of  the competition and hopefully on page 1.  Pro  activity  and  monitoring  of  major  algorithm  changes  will  always  benefit brands.  We know that Google makes thousands of algorithm changes every year. You stay too long and it becomes extremely difficult to return. SEO experts will help ensure that you avoid this. 7. SEO is relatively cheap  Of course it costs. They do the best things, right? But  SEO  is  relatively  inexpensive  on  a  large  scale,  and  the  payoff  is  likely to be significant in terms of brand benefits and perks.  These are no marketing costs, it is a real business investment. Good SEO performance will hold up for years to come. Like most things in life, it will improve with more thought  and investment . 8. Understanding SEO helps you understand the environment of the web With  the  ever-changing  environment  that  is  the  World  Wide  Web,  it’s  hard to keep up with the changes that are happening.  But following SEO also means being aware of the major changes that are  happening in search.  Knowledge  of  the  online  environment,  including  tactics  used  by  other local  and  similar  businesses  and  competitors,  will  always  be  beneficial  to these brands. 9. SEO brings new opportunities to light  Quality  SEO  will  always  find  a  way  to  discover  and  take  advantage  of  new opportunities for brands to not only discover but also shine.  Offering quality SEO brands means that the SEO team is immersed in all that a brand is. This is the only way to truly market a brand with the passion and understanding that stakeholders have for it: become a stakeholder.   The  better  the  understanding  of  a  brand,  the  greater  the  chances  of  it  thriving. The same can be said of SEO. 10. It’s quantifiable  Although  SEO  does  not  offer  the  easiest  ROI  to  calculate  as  with  paid search, you can measure almost anything with proper tracking and analytics. The big problem is the connection of the dots on the back because there is no  definitive  way  to  understand  the  correlation  between  all  the  actions performed.  However,  it  is  worth  understanding  how  certain  actions  can  affect  and hopefully  performance  and  growth.  Any  good  SEO  will  focus  on  these improvements, so linking dots should not be a challenge.  Brands also want to know and understand where they have been, where they are and where they are going in terms of digital performance, especially for SEO, if they have a person   company paid to act on their behalf.  There is also no better way to show the success of SEO. We all know that  data never lies. 11. It’s a long-term strategy  SEO can  and hopefully  has a noticeable effect in the first year of action taken and many of these actions will have an effect that lasts for more than a few years.  As the market develops, it is best to monitor trends and changes closely. But  even  a  website  that  hasn't  had  a  lot  of  intensive  SEO  advice  will  be improved  by  the  basic  SEO  best  practices  used  on  an  honest  website  with decent user  experience. And  the more  time,  effort, and budget required for SEO, the better and longer the site is a worthy candidate in its market. 12. If you’re not on page 1, you’re not winning the click  In  the  world  of  SEO,  it's  no  secret  that  if  you're  not  on  page  1,  you  probably won't be killing an organic search game.  A  recent  survey  found  that  the  top  three  organic  search  positions represent nearly 40% of all clicks, while up to 30% of all results on pages 1 and 2 are non-clicks.  What does it mean? Two things: 1      If you're not on page 1, it’s not okay, you should be there.   2      There are still too many cases where a user enters a query and does  not find exactly what they are looking for.  Conclusion  Implementing  strong,  high-quality  SEO  on  a  brand  website  and  digital  features will always be beneficial to that brand and its marketing efforts.  It  is  considered  a  "new  age"  marketing  technique,  but  it  is  crucial  to  a brand's  online  presence  today,  especially  as  the  data  available  and competition continues to increase and grow. Do you need an SEO?  What is an SEO? SEO  can  mean  "search  engine  optimizer"  or  "search  engine optimization". Choosing to hire an SEO or not is a very important decision for  your  business,  it  can  improve  your  site  and  save  time,  but  it  can  also damage  your  site  and  reputation.  Be  sure  to  research  the  potential  benefits and harm that an irresponsible SEO can cause to your site. Many SEOs and other  consultants  and  agencies  provide  useful  services  to  website  owners, including:  Evaluating the content or structure of your site SEO training Search by keywords Content development Managing online business development campaigns Expertise in specific markets and regions Technical  tips  for  website  development:  e.g.  redirects,  use  of JavaScript error pages, Hosting.  Advertising with Google does not affect the presence of your site in our search results. Google never accepts money for inclusion or ranking of sites in our search results, nor does it cost anything if they appear in organic search results. Free resources like the Search Console, the official Webmaster Center blog, and our discussion forum can give you a lot of information on how to optimize your site for organic search. Choosing an SEO   If you are considering hiring an SEO, do it ASAP. This is a great time to rent if you are considering overhauling your website or planning to launch a new one. This way, you and your SEO can ensure that your site is designed from the bottom up to be search engine compatible. However, good SEO can also help improve an existing website. implement  the  recommended  changes. Make  an  appointment  to  Implementing SEO recommended changes takes time and effort, if you don't take the time to make these changes, it's not worth hiring an expert. Talk to your potential SEO. Some helpful SEO questions are:  Can  you  show  me  examples  of  your  previous  work  and  share some success stories? What  experience  do  you  have  in  developing  international websites? Do you follow Google's webmaster guidelines? What results do you expect and in what timeframe? How do you measure your success? What Are Your Main SEO Techniques? What are your experiences in my industry? What experience do you have in my city country? Do you provide online marketing services or tips to complement your business with organic search? How long have you been around? How can I expect to communicate with you? Would  you  like  to  share  the  changes  to  my  site  with  me  and provide  detailed  information  about  your  recommendations  and justification?  Make sure SEO is of interest to you and your business. If they’re not interested, find someone who is. An SEO should ask questions such as:  How does your business make money and how can search results help you?   Who are your customers? Who are your competitors? What other advertising channels do you use? What  makes  your  business  or  service  unique  and  valuable  to customers?  Check  your  SEO’s  credentials.  Ask  previous  clients  if  they  thought  their SEO provided a useful service, was easy to work with and it brought positive results. Request a technical and research audit of your site to determine what they think needs to be done, why, and what the expected outcome should be. You will probably have to pay for it. You will probably need to give them read- only access to your site in the Search Console.  Don’t give them access to writing at this stage.  Your future SEO should be able to give you realistic estimates of improvements and an assessment of the work involved. If they guarantee  that  their  changes  will  put  you  first  in  the  search  results,  find someone else.  Decide if you want to hire.  Precautions  While  SEOs  can  provide  valuable  services  to  clients,  some  unethical SEOs  have  black-eyed  the  industry  by  using  overly  aggressive  marketing efforts  and  looking  for  unfair  ways  to  manipulate  search  engine  results. Practices that violate our guidelines may result in a negative adjustment of your site's presence on Google or even removal from our index.  Once  your  SEO  has  developed  a  set  of  recommendations  for  your  site, ask them to validate them from a trusted source, such as a Search Console page, a webmaster blog post, or a Google-approved response to a web forum, guardians. Here are some things to keep in mind:  A common scam is creating "shadow" domains that direct users to a site with misleading conversions. These shadow domains are often owned by an SEO who claims to act on behalf of the client. However, if the relationship weakens,  SEO  can  direct  the  domain  to  another  website  or  even  to  the domain of a competitor. When this happens, the client is paid to develop a competitive website that is wholly owned by the SEO.   Another  illegal  practice  is  to  publish  a  “door”  page  with  keywords anywhere  on  a  customer’s  website.  SEO  promises  to  make  the  site  more relevant for more issues. This in itself is wrong, as individual pages are rarely relevant  to  a  wide  variety  of  keywords.  More  insidiously,  however,  these door  pages  often  also  contain  hidden  links  to  other  SEO  clients.  Such gateways  drain  the  popularity  of  links  to  the  site  and  direct  it  to  SEO  and other clients, which may include sites with controversial or illegal content.  Last but not least, avoid interfering with linking programs, such as buying links from other sites, to improve your ranking. This violates Google's quality guidelines  and  may  result  in  manual  action  against  part  or  all  of  the  site, adversely affecting its ranking.  If  you  feel  that  you  were  deceived  by  an  SEO  in  some  way,  you  may  want to report it.  In  the  United  States,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission   FTC   handles complaints  about  misleading  or  unfair  trade  practices.  To  file  a  complaint, please go to: http:  www.ftc.gov  and click "File a Complaint Online", call 1- 877-FTC-HELP  or  write  to:  Federal  Trade  Commission,  CRC-240, Washington, DC 20580. the  complaint   is  about  a  non-US  company,   it  at  file   If   http:  www.econsumer.gov . Useful guidelines:  suddenly send you emails  Beware  of  SEO  companies  and  online  consultants  or  agencies  that  Surprisingly, just Google also received the following emails: “Dear Google, Visiting  your  site  I  noticed  that  you  aren’t  in  most  of  the  major  search  engines and directories... "  Maintain the same skepticism about the unsolicited research emails you use  for  diet  pills  overnight  or  the  demands  to  remit  money  from  ousted dictators. No one can guarantee position no. 1 on Google  Beware of SEOs that claim to provide rankings, claim to have a “special relationship”  with  Google,  or  advertise  a  “statement  of  advantage”  on Google. There is no priority sending for Google. In fact, the only way to send   a site directly to Google is through our URL page or by submitting a Sitemap, and you can do it yourself for free. Be careful if the company is secretive or does not want to explain clearly what it is planning  If something is unclear, ask for clarification. If SEO creates misleading content  on  your  behalf,  such  as  port  pages  or  returnable  domains,  we  can completely  remove  your  site  from  Google's  index.  Ultimately,  you  are responsible for the actions of all the companies you hire, so it's best to make sure you know exactly how they want to "help" you. If the SEO can access the server via FTP, they should be willing to explain any changes they make to your site. You should never link to SEO  Try  to  avoid  SEOs  that  promote  the  power  of  "free  for  all"  links,  link  popularity schemes, or submit your site to thousands of search engines.  These  are  usually  useless  exercises  that  will  not  affect  your  ranking  in major  search  engine  results,  at  least  not  in  a  way  that  you  would  likely consider positive. Choose wisely  While  considering  opting  for  SEO,  you  may  want  to  research  on  the industry. Google is an option, of course. While Google doesn't comment on some  companies,  we've  come  across  companies  called  SEOs  who  follow practices that clearly go beyond accepted business conduct. Watch out. Make sure you understand where the money is going  While  Google  never  sells  better  rankings  in  search  results,  many  other search  engines  combine  pay-per-inclusion  or  pay-per-click  results  with regular web search results.  Some SEOs promise to rank you high in search engines, but instead of being among the search results, they put you in the ads section. Some SEOs will even change their bid prices on an ongoing basis to create the illusion of “checking” other search engines and entering the desired site. These scams will not work with Google, as their ads are clearly marked and separated from our search results, but be sure to ask any SEO you are considering what the costs are for permanent inclusion and which ones apply to temporary ads. What other things to look out for?   There  are  some  warning  signs  that  you  may  be  dealing  with  SEO scammers. It’s far from an exhaustive list, so trust your gut when in doubt. In any case, please leave your SEO if:  He owns shadow domains Post links to other customers on the door Offers selling keywords in the address bar It  does  not  differentiate  between  actual  search  results  and  ads displayed on search results pages Provides ranking, but only on long and fuzzy keywords Works with multiple nicknames or fake WHOIS information Collects  traffic  from  "fake"  search  engines,  spyware  or  virtual software Removed  domains  from  Google  index  or  not  listed  in  Google itself.   CHAPTER 5  KEYWORD RESEARCH, THE MAIN STEP  This is the best guide to keyword research in 2021. In this comprehensive guide, I'll cover:  Search keywords How to choose the right keywords How to use keyword research tools Advanced keyword research tips Much more  So if you want a higher rank on Google and more traffic, you'll love this  guide. Let's start. Basics of keyword research  What is keyword research? Keyword  research  is  the  process  of  finding  the  words  and  phrases  that people  use  in  search  engines,  especially  Google,  with  the  ultimate  goal  of optimizing the content around those terms and ranking them for those terms in search engines.  Why is keyword research important to SEO? Keyword research affects all SEO work you do, including content topic  search, on-page SEO, exposure and promotion.  Therefore,  keyword  research  is  usually  the  first  step  in  any  SEO campaign. In other words, keywords are like a compass to your SEO - they tell you where to go and how you are progressing.  As a bonus, keyword research helps you identify the thoughts, fears and desires of your target market. Keyword research gives you insight into what customers are looking for ... and the exact words and phrases they use.  In  other  words,  keyword  research  is  the  market  research  of  the  21st  century.   How to find keyword ideas  Now is the time to get to the heart of keyword research. Specifically, it’s time to create a keyword list. In this chapter, I will show you tried and tested strategies with which you can come up with a LOT of keyword ideas.  Let's dive straight in. Think of a list of topics  Here you will find topics that interest your target audience. Let’s say you run a digital marketing agency. Well, you may be wondering, "What topics are people looking for related to my business?" Some of the topics that come to mind could include things like:  Social media Email advertising Visit the site Content Marketing Blogging PPC  Note:  These  topics  are  not  keywords.  These  are  general  arguments  that  you will use later to determine your keywords. At this moment you are learning to work ...  Wikipedia index  Wikipedia is an overlooked keyword exploring the gold mine. Where else can you find articles curated by thousands of industry experts  ... all organized in neat little categories?  Here's how you could use Wikipedia to find keyword ideas. First, go to Wikipedia and enter a general keyword such as marketing. This will take you to a Wikipedia article on this broad topic. Then find the "content" section on the page. This section contains the subtopics on this page.  Some  of  the  subtopics  listed  here  are  exceptional  keywords  that  would otherwise be difficult to find. In this case, you will find words like "social media", "B2C marketing", "public relations" and so on.  You  can  also  click  some  internal  links  on  the  page  to  see  an  index  of   other closely related items.  For  example,  in  marketing,  we  send  a  link  to  "Integrated  Marketing Communications"  in  the  "Promotion  Blend"  section.  When  you  click  this link, you’ll see that the Integrated Marketing Communication page summary has even more keywords you can add to your list, and that’s very cool. Searches related to  Another  fun  way  to  search  for  keywords  is  to  check  the  "Related  Searches" section at the bottom of Google's search results.  Let’s say one of your topics was “online marketing”. Well, we'd like to find that keyword. And scroll to the bottom of the page. You will find a list of 7 keywords that are closely related to your search term.  As  with  Google's  proposal,  there  are  keywords  coming  directly  from Google. So you don’t have to guess whether they are popular or not. Google literally says, "Countless people are searching for these keywords."  Here I’ve a pro tip for you: click on one of the 'Search related' keywords. Then scroll to the bottom of THESE results. This will give you a new list  of related keywords. Rinse and repeat. Search keywords on Reddit  Your target audience is probably in a hangout with Reddit. That means  you can usually find a lot of keyword ideas on this platform.  Therefore: Let's say you have a website that sells organic cat food. We're  going  to  Reddit.  So  find  a  broad  topic  that  interests  your  target  audience ... and something related to what you're selling, such as pets.  So  choose  a  sub-credit  where  your  audience  is  likely  to  hang  out,  in  which case we'll pick the first one called "pets".  Finally, pay attention to the subjects that are frequently commented on, for  example  they  say:  "I  just  bought  my  first  pet,  I  wanted  to  say  that somewhere" with about 400 responses. In this case, we will add 'first pet' to the list of keyword suggestions.  Pro tip: "Keyworddit" It is a free SEO tool that searches Reddit for words and  phrases  that  people  are  using  ...  and  ranks  those  phrases  based  on monthly search volume. Use templates for Google and YouTube   Now that you have a list of topics, scan them all into Google and see what  terms Google suggests. These are great keywords you can add to your list.  Why? Because  when  Google  suggests  a  keyword,  YOU  KNOW  that  a  lot  of  people are looking for it.  However,  you  don’t  have  to  stop  with  Google  Suggest,  keyword  suggestions can also be found in Bing and YouTube Suggest. Find popular topics on forums  Forums are like active focus groups live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The easiest way to find forums where your target audience is together is  to use these Google search strings:  "Keyword Forum" "Keyword" + "forum" "Keyword" + "forum" "Keyword" + "character"  When you find a forum, pay attention to how the forum is divided into  sections - each of these sections is a potential keyword to add to your list.  If you want to go deeper, you can take a look at some of the topics on the forum  and  find  other  specific  topics  that  your  target  audience  is  struggling with, that’s great, right? Keyword research tools  Can you find keywords without the tool? Apparently. But the tool makes the whole process MUCH easier. Here are the keyword research tools that I personally use and recommend. Google's keyword planner  Google's  Keyword  Planner  is  the  most  trusted  source  of  keyword  information on the web.  This is because, unlike most other tools, the information obtained by the  Keyword Planner comes directly from Google.  The big downside to GKP is that it's designed to help people with their  Google campaigns ... not SEO.   However,  you  can  still  use  GKP  to  get  keyword  suggestion  lists  and  search for queries that allow for many queries. ExplodingTopics.com  This new tool is like Google Trends ... only better. Exploding topics surf the web in search of rising terms. And prepare these  conditions. You can even sort the list of topics by category. Keywords everywhere  Keywords everywhere could be my favorite keyword research tool. Why? Because  it  shows  you  keyword  ideas  from  various  places  on  the  web   including Bing, YouTube and Google Analytics .  All  you  need  to  do  is  install  the  Chrome  extension.  The  next  time  you visit one of the sites that integrate keywords everywhere, you'll see a list of keyword suggestions ... and information about each keyword. Ubersuggest  Ubersuggest was the first Google suggestion scraper I used. Last year, the  tool was heavily updated and refurbished.  Ubersuggest still generates keyword suggestions based on Google search suggestions. It also provides information about each keyword  such as search volume, CPC, keyword difficulty, and more . SEMrush  If  you  want  to  invest  in  a  paid  keyword  tool,  I  highly  recommend  SEMrush. This is because SEMrush saves time. Here is why…  Instead of throwing random keywords into the tool, SEMrush displays the  exact keywords for which the site is already ranked.  So if you have a site that you compete with on Google, put it in SEMrush  and steal all their keywords. Ahrefs  Most people think of Ahrefs as a tool for making links. But few people  know that Ahrefs also has a REALLY good keyword tool.  The  great  thing  about  Ahref’s  “Keyword  Researcher”  is  that  you  get  a  huge amount of useful information about each keyword.  This can help you decide if it is a useful keyword.   The only complaint about the Keyword Researcher is that it's not okay to come up with new keyword ideas. It usually generates keywords that are just simple versions of the keyword I typed.  However,  enlarging  a  single  term  cannot  do  much  better  than  the  functions of the Ahrefs keyword researcher. Keyword difficulty  How do you know if a keyword is too competitive to be ranked? A good question to ask. If you choose a highly competitive keyword, it  can be difficult to switch from a third party Google.  However, if you find a keyword without a lot of competition, you have a  good chance of beating the top 3.  This describes how to identify SEO issues for a keyword here.  Long queues are  usually  less competitive  If your site is brand new, or if you want to focus 100% on non-competing keywords. So you definitely want to target keywords with a long tail. I will explain ...  Most people in SEO  myself included  divide their keywords into three  main categories: head, body, and long tail. Here's an overview of each keyword type: 1  Head keywords  These  are  usually  one-word  keywords  with  high  search  volume  ...  and competition.  Examples  of  key  terms  are  keywords  like  “insurance”  or “vitamins”. Because a searcher’s intent is everywhere  someone looking for “insurance” might be looking for a car insurance quote, a list of life insurance companies, or a word definition  usually doesn’t translate key terms best. 2  Body keywords  Body keywords are 2-3 phrases that get a decent search volume  at least 2000  searches  per  month ,  but  are  more  specific  than  the  main  keywords. Keywords like “life insurance” or “ordering vitamins online” are examples of keywords for the body. These almost always have less competition than the main terms. 3  Keywords with a long tail   Long tail keywords are long sentences with more than 4 words that are usually  very  specific.  Phrases  like  “Affordable  Life  Insurance  for  the Elderly” and “Order Vitamin D Capsules Online” are examples of long-tailed keywords. These terms alone don’t get a lot of search  usually about 10-200 searches per month . But when you add them up, most web searches are a long  line.  And  because  they  don’t  get  a  lot  of  searches,  long-tailed  terms aren’t usually very competitive.  There is no best category of keywords to focus on. All three have their pros and cons. But when it comes to competition, long lines tend to be the least competitive. Authority of sites on Google’s first page  Here's  a  quick  way  to  estimate  a  keyword's  level  of  competition.  First, search for a keyword on Google. Then look at the places sorted on the first page.  If the first page consists of very high authority websites  like Wikipedia  you may want to remove that keyword from the list, but if you see a handful of smaller blogs on the first page, that's a sign that you've tried to also go to the first page. Keyword difficulties in keyword tools  The vast majority of keyword research tools have some sort of keyword  competition feature, including KWFinder, Ahrefs, Moz Pro, and SEMrush.  We  recently  tested  a  few.  We  have  found  that  all  keyword  problems increase  based  on  a  combination  of  page  authority  and  domain  authority. However,  they  all  tend  to  make  completely  different  keyword  difficulty estimates.  Briefly?  If  your  favorite  Keyword  Tool   the  keyword troubleshooting feature, keep doing it. Maybe it isn't perfect. But they usually give you a general idea of how competitive a ranking keyword is. CanIRank  includes   Believe it or not, there is even a tool for keyword problems: CanIRank. I  like  that  this  tool  doesn’t  just  spit  out  a  number  of  keyword  issues. Instead,  the  level  of  keyword  competition  is  assessed  by  your  site.  For example,  I  recently  posted  the  keyword  “SEO”  on  CanIRank  and  the  tool looked at the competition against the authority of my site on the first page of   Google. And that gave me “Ranking Odds” 90%, very useful. How to choose a keyword  Now  that  you  have  a  keyword  list,  how  do  you  know  which  one  to choose?  Unfortunately,  there  are  no  tools  to  tell  you,  "This  is  the  best keyword on your list." Instead, you need to adjust each keyword to a handful of different factors. Then choose the keyword that best suits your business.  As you might expect, I will show you exactly that in this chapter.  Search volume  It's  pretty  easy.  The  more  people  searching  for  keywords,  the  more  visitors they can generate. The question is: what is a "good" search volume?  Short answer: it depends. Long answer: the number of searches varies greatly in different sectors. For example, a keyword with a long tail in a fitness niche  for example: "best  abdominal  exercises"   will  receive  10,000  to  100,000  searches  per month, a keyword with a long tail in a B2B space, such as digital marketing   for example: "best SEO software"  gets 100-1,000 monthly searches.  So  you  want  to  figure  out  what  “big”  and  “small”  search  volume  is  in your  niche.  Then  choose  keywords  based  on  what  is  “normal”  for  your industry. Organic click-through-rate  It's  no  secret  that  the  number  of  Google  search  engines  clicking  on  an  unpaid search result has declined. And no wonder why.  With selected snippets, you don't have to click anything to get a response,  and Google now has search results with more ads than ever.  The purpose of the research only gives you part of the story. To get a full estimate of how many clicks you receive from Google's top page rank, you also need to estimate your organic click-through rate.  Here are two easy ways ... You can first view the SERPs  search results pages  for your keyword. If you see a lot of things on the first page  like the featured snippet and other Google ads  then you know you won't get many clicks ... even if you rank first.   Second,  you  can  use  the  tool,  both  Ahrefs  and  Moz  pro  estimate  the organic  CTR,  and  with  all  of  the  above,  I  wouldn't  avoid  a  keyword  just because it has a low CTR. If many people search for this term, it may still be worth it. Difficulty  If  your  site  is  new   or  doesn’t  have  many  links  yet ,  focus  on  low competitive conditions first. Once your site gains credibility, you can focus on  more  competitive  activities.  And  because  I  didn’t  have  a  lot  of  sites  to compete with, I was able to attract organic traffic in just a few weeks. This has helped me achieve SEO success from the very beginning. CPC  CPC  cost-per-click  is a measure that answers an important question: are people  searching  for  this  keyword  actually  spending  money?  So,  yeah,  the search  volume  is  fun  and  everything.  However,  if  this  keyword  has  no commercial purpose, it doesn't make sense to target that term.  In addition, you can sometimes get a return on investment with a keyword  that doesn’t get many searches ... if your CPC is high enough.  For example, one of my target keywords is “link building services,” and  according to Ahrefs, that keyword receives 400 queries per month.  So  if  I  were  to  just  look  at  the  search  volume,  I  would  say  “This  is  a terrible keyword”. Therefore, it is very important that you ALSO look at your CPC. The CPC for this keyword is $ 25.00.  This means that people spend $ 25 every time someone searching for that keyword clicks on an ad. So even if the search volume for this term isn't that large, CPC more than replaces it. Business fit  Here's  how  likely  someone  looking  for  a  keyword  is  to  become  a customer. Yes, the CPC will help you understand this. But it doesn't tell the whole  story.  For  example,  a  few  weeks  ago  I  came  across  the  keyword "backlinks checker". On the face of it, this is a great keyword.  It gets a decent search from 1k to 10,000 and has a CPC of $ 4.01. It's not that competitive either. So this keyword is winning, right? Well not really.   You  know,  Backlinko  is  an  SEO  company.  This  means  that  I  am  not selling  backlink  analysis  tools.  So  even  if  I  got  first  place  among  the "backlink  checkers"  it  would  be  of  no  use  to  me.  Compare  this  with  a keyword like "YouTube SEO". The CPC of this keyword is only $ 2.22. Keyword trends  Ultimately, we want to see if your keyword is growing fast ... or dying slowly. And the best way to do it? Google trends. For example, last year I thought of the keyword: "SEO with voice search".  But I decided to add this keyword to Google Trends before pulling the  trigger.  As you can see, interest in this keyword is growing rapidly.  Advanced tips and strategies  Now  that  you’ve  learned  the  basics  of  keyword  research,  it’s  time  to  discuss some interesting and advanced things.  Specifically, I’ll reveal some tactical tips for exploring keywords that you  can use right away. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into the tips. Barnacle SEO  Let’s say you found the keyword PERFECT. And you are among the top  3 for this term. You're almost done, aren't you?  Actually ... not really. It  turns  out  that  Barnacle  SEO  can  give  you  even  more  grip  on  this keyword.  Barnacle  SEO  is  the  practice  of  using  the  authority  of  other websites to evaluate on the first page.  Once you find a good keyword, we recommend that you include as much space as possible on the first page. First, create content on this topic on your site.  Then  post  keyword-optimized  content  to  authoritative  sites  like YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium, and more. Search Keyword GSC  The Google Search Console is the gold mine of keywords. Here's how it  works:  First, sign in to your GSC account and go to the "Performance Report", here you can see the terms that get the most clicks in Google Search. You can then  sort  your  list  by  "Impressions"  to  see  keywords  that  generate  many   impressions  ...  but  not  necessarily  clicks.  Finally,  create  optimized  content around the same keyword.  Why is this a strong strategy? These are the keywords you know people are looking for. You also know that Google sees your site as a good match in search results. For that particular keyword, you need to post super targeted content  or optimize existing content around that keyword  and that’s it. Optimize content around synonyms and related keywords  Yes,  you  want  to  optimize  your  page  around  your  main  keyword.  But don't  stop  there.  By  increasing  search  engine  traffic  to  your  site,  you  can optimize  synonyms  and  closely  related  terms.  I'll  show  you  how  it  works, using a real example.  Earlier this year I posted a message on my blog, my target keyword for this  page  was  "more  website  traffic".  But  I  also  made  sure  to  throw  in versions of this keyword, for example: "attract more visitors". In the end, I was  able  to  get  into  the  top  3  for  my  main  keyword  and  many  keyword variations. Ahrefs Content Gap  Content Gap has quickly become one of my favorite features in Ahrefs. This is how it works: as with SEMRush, you can use Ahrefs here to see the exact keywords another site is ranking for. And with Ahrefs Content Gap you can take this kind of competitive analysis to the next level.  Therefore: go to the empty space in the content of Ahrefs. And enter 2-3  competing sites.  ... but not all.  This shows you the keywords that at least two of your competitors rank in  And as more competitors fall under these terms, you know you also have  a lot of chances of finishing in the top 10. Analyze keywords based on Searcher Intent  In other words, ask yourself: what does anyone looking for this keyword want to see? Do they want to buy? For information? Or are they looking for a specific page  such as a login page ?  For example: I recently posted a post that is number 2 for the keyword  “BuzzStream”.   While  this  keyword  has  about  2,000  searches  per  month,  this  message gets only 194 monthly visitors. What's happening? "BuzzStream" turned out to be a navigation keyword. This means that most people searching for this keyword are looking for a site ... not information on BuzzStream.  So, yeah, that keyword looked great at first glance. However, since it is a navigation keyword, MUCH AS it clicks anything other than the first result. This is why this message gets so little traffic.  Therefore, I recommend that you consider the purpose of your keyword  search.  If your search purpose is "browsing," you may want to avoid this term ... even if it has a high CPC and monthly search volume.  As you just saw, this is a lesson I had to learn the hard way   However,  if  the  purpose  of  the  search  engine  is  "informative",  the  optimized content around this term may be BIG. Look for "shoulder keywords"  Most people ONLY optimize their site around keywords that are closely related  to  what  they  are  selling.  And  this  is  a  BIG  mistake  for  two  main reasons:  1      Product keywords are generally super competitive. 2          Your potential  customer searches  thousands of  keywords  without  looking for those keywords you are selling.  And if you can reach out to a customer with great content, chances are  they’ll buy it from you later.  For example, as I said, I run an SEO company. However,  I  do  not  optimize  every  page  on  my  website  according  to  commercial terms.  For example, "SEO training" and "SEO courses" .  Instead, I rank according to the keywords my clients search for when they are not looking for SEO training.  Keywords such as: "link building", "SEO on page" and "SEO tools" .  I call these keywords "shoulder keywords." These keywords are not directly related to what you are selling. But there are keywords that your customers are looking for. They are worth checking out.   What about another example? Let's  say  you  have  an  E-Commerce  site  that  sells  basketball  hoops. Obviously,  you  want  to  optimize  some  of  your  pages  by  using  terms  like "buy basketball hoop online".  But don't stop there.  After all, someone interested in buying a basketball hoop can also search for:  How to Take a Better Free Throw Highlights of the dunk How you are recruited by college scouts Nutrition for basketball players How to Improve a Vertical Jump  So you want to create content around these "shoulder keywords" as well.  Conclusion  I hope you enjoyed my new keyword research guide. And now I want to hear from you. Which tip from today's guide will you try first? Want to try shoulder keywords? Or maybe you want to optimize trending keywords.   CHAPTER 6  SEO  HOW TO SETUP A POWERFUL WEBSITE FOR  Launching a New Website: Your SEO Checklist  Do  you  point  to  the  big  red  start  button  on  your  new  website?  Wait  a second  or rather 660 of them . There may be SEO considerations that you haven't considered yet, from a keyword-to-URL summary looking for crawl errors  to  setting  up  proper  tracking.  In  this  chapter  I  will  cover  five  large boxes that you need to tick before putting that site into operation. 1. Keyword in the URL tab for your content.  So  let's  start  with  number  one  here.  What  I  suggest  you  do  is,  while checking  the  site  you  created,  do  a  keyword  search.  There  are  many whiteboard Fridays and blog posts I wrote here at Moz about great ways to do keyword research. But search for keywords and create a list of keywords that  essentially  map  all  the  keywords  you  initially  target  to  all  URLs,  the pages you have on your new site.  So  it  should  look  like  this.  It  has  the  URL,  then  RandsAnimals.com, which targets the keyword "fantastic beasts", here is the title of the page and here  is  the  meta  description.  Then  I  have  RandsAnimals.com lemurs,  my lemurs page, which focuses on "lemurs" and "lemur habits". That's the title.  We recommend that you go through them and make sure that if you have an  important  keyword  that  you  haven't  targeted  yet,  do  so,  and  also  if  you have a URL, a page on your website on which you have not yet intentionally targeted for a keyword. , make sure you do this too. This can be a great way to  start  browsing  a  small  site  and  make  sure  you  have  a  few  terms  and phrases that you target. This is also useful when positioning and optimizing the page later. 2. Accessibility, crawl, and UX  So what I want you to do here, is ask yourself: I. "Is the content of my website accessible to search engines?" There are some great ways to view them. You can use tools like Google   Search Console or Screaming Frog. You can use something like OnPage.org to crawl your site virtually and make sure that crawlers can reach all pages, that you don't have duplicate content, that you don't have skinny content, or that pages you think have no content, no broken links, no broken pages, all kinds of good stuff.  II. Is the content accessible to all audiences, devices and browsers? Then  we  don't  ask  about  search  engines  and  their  crawlers,  but  about audiences,  people  and  whether  your  content  is  accessible  to  all  audiences, devices and browsers possible. So, this can mean things like screen readers for  blind  users,  mobile  devices,  desktop  devices,  laptops,  browsers  of  all kinds. We recommend that you use a tool such as a verification browser to make sure that Chrome, Firefox and ... What's Internet Explorer called now? Oh God. They changed it. Microsoft Edge. Make sure it works in everything. I love that I think there is a gallery of peanuts they will call quitting. It's like  looking  at  lunch  and  thinking,  "Rand,  if  I  call  you  now,  it  won't  be answered." Know. Know.  III. "Are those pages loading fast everywhere?" So I could use a tool like Google Speed Test. I can also run some proxy checks to make sure I'm from all kinds of regions, especially if I'm targeting internationally or know I'm targeting rural areas where my pages load quickly everywhere.  IV. "Are the graphics, design, experience and UI convenient and pleasant  for all users?"  You  can  do  this  with  some  internal  usage  tests.  You  can  do  this informally with existing friends, family, and clients if you have one. Or you can use something like Five Second Test or UsabilityHub to run some more formal  online  tests.  Sometimes  this  can  reveal  things  in  your  browsing  or content that are preventing people from having the desired experience - it's very easy to fix. 3. Configure important services and monitoring So there are a lot of things you just have to set up around a website. These include:  Web Analytics:  Google Analytics is free and very popular. But you  could  also  use  something  like  Piwik  or,  if  you  are  older,   Omniture.  You  will  want  to  crawl.  OnPage  or  some  of  these others  will  verify  that  your  scans  are  actually  loaded  on  all  of your pages. Runtime  Tracking:  If  you  haven't  checked  them  out,  Pingdom has  some  very  cheap  plans  for  early  stage  sites.  So  as  you  get bigger they can get more expensive and sophisticated. Retargeting  and  Remarketing:    Even  if  you  don't  want  to  pay now  and  don't  want  to  use  any  of  the  services,  you  can  put  at least Facebook and Google retargeting pixels on your website on all  of  your  pages  so  that  your  audience  can  be  accessed  in  the future. Set up some branded alerts: the cheapest option is Google Alerts, which is free but not very good. If you use Moz Pro, there are Fresh  Web  Explorer  alerts,  which  is  great.  Mention.net  is  also good, Talkwalker, Trackur. There are a few options that are paid and a little better. Google  Search  Console:  If  you  haven't  already  set  this  up,  we recommend that you do so in addition to Bing Webmaster Tools. Both can reveal some mistakes. If you do SEO, you may want to set  up  some  kind  of  SEO  tool  to  monitor  and  access  your rankings  regularly,  show  your  competitive  opportunities  and wrong steps, you may want to show link building skills, all kinds of things. I urge you to take a look at one of these five. There are others.  But  these  five  are  quite  popular:  Ahrefs,  Moz,  Raven, Searchmetrics or SEMRush. These are certainly some of the best known around. Social  and  web  profiles:  Again,  it's  important  to  set  them  up before you start your new site so that no one jumps to the name of your Facebook page or your Pinterest page or your Instagram profile page, or of your YouTube page or your SlideShare page. I know you could say, "But Rand, I don't use SlideShare." No, not today, but in the future, you may want to and believe me to claim  Rand's  Animals  on  YouTube  and  SlideShare,  you  will need to claim regardless of the name of your website. I'll claim them later. But you have to wear them all because you don't want anyone  else  to  record  them  later.  I  urge  you  to  check  the   complete list of all social networking sites, all web profiles, to make sure your brand is protected.  4. Schema, rich snippets, OpenGraph, etc  Optimization in general, broader. So here I'm actually going to go to these URLs and make sure that "Hey, okay. I know I've targeted these keywords and I've already created a meta description for my page title. But let me see if there are any other possibilities."  Are there options for content or image research? Do I have rich snippet options?  Maybe  not,  but  I  may  have  stars  in  user  reviews  for  my  Rand's Animals site. I don't know if people especially like this LIF GIF over that LIF GIF. But they can be set up on your site and you can see a description of how to do this on Google and Bing. They both have the resources to do it. The same goes for Twitter and Facebook, which offer cards so you can introduce yourself  there.  If  you  are  using  OpenGraph  I  think  it  will  work  well  on LinkedIn and other similar services as well. So these are great options. 5. Start the link reinforcement and extension plan  So  one  of  the  things  we  know  about  SEO  is  that  you  need  backlinks, engagement and signals like that to rank well. We recommend that you have a  successful  launch  day  and  launch  week  and  even  a  launch  month.  This means, by asking the question beforehand:  I. "Who will help you improve your launch and why? Why will they do  it?"  If you can identify "These people, I know they want to help personally" or "They are friends and family. I have business relations with them. They are my clients. There are journalists who have promised this. They are bloggers. Who  cares  much  about  this  subject,  they  need  things  to  write  about. "Whatever it is, if you can identify those people, make a list and start with that  direct  contact,  it's  definitely  something  you  should  do.  I  would  plan ahead and warn people when you would do that. That way, when the launch day comes, you will have wonderful and interesting news to announce. Two weeks after you started saying "Hey, I launched a new site a few weeks ago", you are no longer new, so the chances of receiving coverage diminish quite quickly after the first few days.  II. "What existing relationships, profiles, and sites do I need to update to  create news  and accuracy ?"   I  would  also  like  to  ask  you  what  existing  relationships,  websites  and profiles you already have that you can and need to update to create buzz and more  precisely,  to  create  accuracy.  So,  these  are  things  like  anything  from your email signature to all your social media profiles that we've talked about, both the profiles that you've claimed and the ones that you have personally. You need to update your LinkedIn. You need to start updating your Twitter page.  You  need  to  update  Facebook.  You  may  want  to  update  all  of  these things. About.me if you have a profile there or if you are a designer, maybe your Dribbble profile, whatever you have.  * So you should also think, "I have content that I've contributed to over the years on the Internet, on all kinds of other websites, and if I were going to say," Hey, I have a new one. Could you refer to this new site instead of my old or new site that I’ve just launched, instead of my old employer that I left? "You can do that too, and it's certainly a good idea."  III. "What can media coverage, social coverage or communication with  influencers do?"  The  last  thing  I  would  like  to  ask  is  the  people  who  might  be  furthest from  you,  but  media  coverage,  social  coverage,  or  information  about influencers, similar to "Who will help empower you and why?" You should be  able  to  list  those  people,  find  those  outlets,  find  a  few  email  addresses, send a presentation if you have one, and start building those relationships.  Launch day is a great reason to get access. If you're throwing something new, it's a great time to do it and that can help you get a boost. OK. We hope that when you launch your new site, you follow this checklist, get into these details, and get a much more effective SEO experience.  If you've started a website and see things are missing from this list, check out  any  other  recommendations  you've  received,  please  leave  them  in  the comments. We would like to talk about it. 5 Best website builders for SEO  Imagine  that  you  and  a  friend  are  building  similar  websites,  but  your friend has chosen another website builder with better SEO tools.

SEO  features  are integrated  into  the  Wix  control  panel,  so  you  can  get  started easily.  Weaknesses:   Advanced SEO is difficult: Wix has more than covered basics, but  more  sophisticated  like  structured  data  aren't integrated into the platform  although you can add them  Limited  control:  Because  Wix  SEO  is  so  easy  to  use,  it  can't provide direct editing control on platforms like Squarespace.  things   People  who  complain  about  website  builders  sometimes  blame  the  fact that they build the site without optimizing. There was some truth in that, but no  more.  Wix  has  improved  its  SEO  game  in  recent  years  to  effectively become a market leader.  SEO is a long-term game and you need platforms to help you stay on top. Wix is one of the best SEO site builders for those who are still learning the basics.  SEO  Wiz  guides  users  step  by  step  through  essential  tips,  suggests improvements and even sets goals.  Wix encryption is not required. From meta titles to 301 redirects, SEO is built  directly  into  the  Wix  control  panel.  Each  page  has  dedicated  SEO settings, and each image you upload has an alternate text entry, so the images are interpreted by search engines.  Another  big  plus  is  the  power  of  its  integration  with  Google.  Web analytics  tools  are  essential  for  understanding  the  traffic  to  your  site,  and Google  is  the  gold  standard.  Linking  Google  Analytics  and  the  Google Search Console to Wix sites is just an example of entering a tracking code.  SEO  is  actually  much  simpler  than  it  sometimes  seems.  Wix  makes  it  easy to maintain the SEO of your site and notifies you when you fail.  Wix has introduced a number of SEO features over the last few years, and the Help Center is the most comprehensive you can find anywhere. Even if you don’t use Wix, it’s worth browsing its SEO guide.  Compensation  for  Wix’s  ease  of  use  and  internal  functionality  is diminished when it comes to more advanced SEO methods. Structured data  which provides search engines with additional, very important information about  your  site   is  becoming  increasingly  important  for  SEO.  To  add  it  to Wix, you have to do it manually - with a code.  It’s a bit of a pain, but it deserves an explanation. SEO students who have learned from it will find Wix clogged after a while. However, this is a game with website builders: the price of convenience is control.   However,  Wix  mostly  understands  that  its  users  are  not  technical.  An excellent  balance  of  functionality  and  control.  Its  SEO  builder  not  only simplifies, but learns the basics when you’re not sure what something means. If you want a comprehensive and supportive SEO experience, Wix is a great option. 2. Weebly: Contains dozens of useful and quality SEO applications  from $ 5.00   month  Advantages:  SEO  application:  Weebly  offers  SEO  monitoring  through integrated applications. Custom  URLs:  You  can  customize  the  URLs  of  each  page  on your site to make them more attractive to search engines.  Weaknesses:  Product image jokers can't be changed - you can add other tags to regular images, but photos of  E-Commerce products are out of luck.  Weebly prides itself on ease of use and SEO is an important part of that. Everything  from  meta  descriptions  to  web  analytics  is  included  in  the platform. Like Wix and Squarespace, Weebly keeps all the essentials in it.  Meta  titles  and  descriptions,  custom  URLs  and  alt  text  are  part  of  the page  editor.  The  integration  of  Google  Analytics  and  Search  Console  is  as easy  as  entering  a  tracking  code.  The  mobile  editor  ensures  that  your  site looks and works well on all devices, something that is increasingly important for SEO.  Weebly's  plugin  library  is  very  powerful.  There  are  dozens  of  SEO oriented plugins in the application center. For example, Site Booster  which displays  your  site  on  Google  Maps,  among  other  things   shows  that  it  is worth browsing. All in all, Weebly SEO is comprehensive and easy to use.  In a strange omission, Weebly doesn't currently allow customization of alt text on product images. Ordinary picture? You go crazy, but you are out of luck  trying  to  sell  things.  We'd  be  surprised  if  this  has  been  the  case  for  a long time, but it's a warning to remember if selling online is essential to your plans.   That  said,  Weebly  is  currently  all  about  E-Commerce.  It  is  already developing into a powerful hybrid between general purpose site builder and a dedicated retail platform. The same goes for SEO, which has a foothold in both  areas.  From  page  titles  to  custom  product  URLs,  Weebly  strikes  a particularly good balance of SEO for small business needs. 3. Squarespace: It’s the perfect choice for those more expert about SEO  starting at $12.00 month  Pros:  Lots  of  user  control:  you  can  choose  to  add  your  own  code, which opens up a whole new world of advanced techniques Clean  and  structured  interface:  if  you  don't  want  to  work  with code, Squarespace's basic SEO features are clearly formatted and easy to edit.  Cons:  It is not suitable for beginners: there are better platforms if you need more SEO guidance It is not a specific application for SEO - Squarespace lags behind Wix  and  Weebly  in  that  it  does  not  offer  SEO  features  in  a dedicated application.  Squarespace is the big, dark, and beautiful riddle of the world of website builders, or whatever they want to believe. The SEO features are advanced and well integrated, but don't expect to hold hands like you would with Wix and  Weebly.  If  you're  familiar  with  the  basics  of  SEO  and  want  more backend control, Squarespace may be the builder for you.  Squarespace has an extremely organized, almost CMS-like backend. This makes  it  easier  to  stay  in  the  best  SEO,  provided  you  are  already  familiar with the best practices. The dashboard still offers the odd hint or explanation, but  not  in  the  same  tour  mode  as  its  peers.  However,  if  you  need  help, Squarespace  has  put  together  an  SEO  checklist  and  guide  to  improve  your site's  visibility  in  the  search  engines.  All  in  all,  it's  a  more  casual  and manageable experience.  Meta  titles  and  alt  text  aren't  the  only  things  to  consider  for  SEO  although they are important . Your site needs links too! Squarespace's social   networking integration is the best in the market, and a vibrant multi-channel online presence can work wonders for SEO.  In conclusion, search engines prefer to trust sites that other sites trust. One downside to Squarespace is that it can be a bit tricky depending on the model you're using. Some show alt text on the site, which is not how it should work. You can find this out in the bush by browsing the Squarespace template guide, but it's a strange obstacle to have to jump.  And  again,  keep  in  mind  that  better  SEO  methods  require  "code injections,"  which  means  adding  personal  code.  If  the  last  few  years  have been an indicator, all the major builders will soon launch structured internal data solutions, but you know what I say about the hypothesis ...  However, in general, Squarespace is an excellent option for SEO. If you want a builder to teach you the basics of SEO, Wix and Weebly are better suited  than  Squarespace.  But  Squarespace  has  always  imagined  itself  as  a more advanced class of website builders. If that sounds like your vibe, try the free trial to see if that is the case. 4. GoDaddy: Great for those who want outside help with SEO  starting at $10.00 month  Pros:  SEO  Expert:  With  this  simple  tool  integrated  into  the  site  you receive  some  simple  questions  and  suggestions  on  the  best keywords for your targeted website SEO Service Team: If you sign up for this paid service, a team of  experts  will  research  your  target  markets  and  optimize  your site without lifting a finger.  Cons:  SEO features are limited to the cheapest plan: to get the most out of GoDaddy's SEO tools, upgrade from the basic plan Value  for  money:  GoDaddy's  SEO  services  are  useful,  but  not the  cheapest  on  the  market,  and  most  features  are  limited  to state-of-the-art plans.  Let's  face  it:  GoDaddy's  SEO  features  are  virtually  absent  from  its   cheapest plan  $ 10.00   month base . However, if you move to the next level  default  at  $  15.00     month   you  will  see  a  huge  surge  in  SEO  features, including targeted keyword suggestions from the GoDaddy team.  Then you can track your search rankings over time to see how GoDaddy's  or  your  SEO  genius   keyword  suggestions  have  improved  your  ranking  in the SERPs  Search Engine Results Pages . You can always view the progress of your website from the account dashboard.  The main feature of GoDaddy is the "SEO Wizard" tool that is included on  the  Premium  plan   $  20     month .  The  SEO  expert  will  ask  you  a  few questions about your website and then give you targeted keyword suggestions that you can use to optimize your pages.  If  you  want  to  take  your  optimization  efforts  even  further,  GoDaddy's SEO  Services  team  offers  free  telephone  consultations  asking  about  your business   blog goals and budget. GoDaddy's SEO Services option is $ 6.99   month and you essentially pay for the SEO team to do a website review and search for your target market. Once this information is obtained, the team will carry out SEO updates over time to improve your website in search results. The main benefit to this is that there is very little to do - the GoDaddy team is in full control of the reins.  Let's be honest: $ 6.99 a month isn't very cheap for the kind of work the GoDaddy  SEO  team  does.  However,  if  you  choose  to  use  this  service,  it comes with a lot of SEO benefits. After selecting a recommended plan and enabling on-site optimization, 80% of GoDaddy customers saw the results of the first page for the targeted keywords within six months. 5.  WordPress.com:  Great  for  those  who  want  a  hands-on  experience  starting at $4.00 month  Pros:  Optimized  Themes:  All  WordPress.com  website  themes  have been created with SEO rankings in mind Personalization:  WordPress.com  offers  numerous  options  for editing your meta descriptions and titles.  Cons:  Limited  access:  Although  the  basics  are  included  in  every   WordPress  plan,  you'll  need  to  upgrade  your  business  plan  to access most SEO tools Advanced  user  interface:  WordPress.com  is  not  as  intuitive  as other website builders when it comes to editing your website.  First of all I have great news for you: WordPress.com does 85-90% of the basic  SEO  mechanics  for  you.  WordPress  themes  are  designed  to  attract search engines right out of the box. In fact, much of the HTML is formatted with  the  display  of  search  engine  crawlers.  However,  if  you  want  to  dig deeper  into  your  website's  search  engine  optimization,  you  have  a  few options.  WordPress  offers  four  different  pricing  plans.  The  number  of  SEO features depends on the plan you choose. The free and personal plans for $ 0.00 and $ 4.00   mo, respectively, provide just the basics of SEO. This is sufficient for personal websites. However, if you want to scale, you need the Premium  plan   USD  8.00     month   or  the  Business  plan   USD  25.00    month .  You have Google Analytics built into your Premium plan, but advanced SEO tools don't come into play until you switch to your business plan. If you choose to upgrade, you will have access to your site:  First  page  meta  description:  edit  the  general  summary  of  your website that will be shown to viewers in Google results. Personalized  Post  Meta  Description:  Change  description of individual pages. Custom Title Formats: Customize how your site's content titles appear in the SERP. Social  Search  and  Preview:  See  how  your  website  is  doing  on search engines and social media before you publish it.  the  meta  If  you  know  your  SEO  and  want  to  be  very  involved  in  the  process, WordPress.com  is  a  great  choice.  Nevertheless,  you  have  to  forego  simple operations  to  make  it  easier  to  get  started.  WordPress  isn't  as  intuitive  as builders like Wix or Weebly. Final Thoughts  Search  engine  optimization  is  critical  to  the  success  of  your  website.   When  choosing  a  website  builder,  SEO  functionality  is  one  of  the  most important  things  to  consider.  For  the  best  website  builders,  SEO  is comprehensive and easy to use. In summary, the top five SEO website builders are:  Wix - Perfect for absolute SEO beginners. Weebly: Dozens of Useful, High Quality SEO Applications. Squarespace: An Excellent Choice for the Safer SEO. GoDaddy:  Great  for  those  who  need  outside  help  with  search engine optimization. WordPress.com: Really great for those looking for a very hands- on SEO experience.  They  are  feature  rich  and  easy  to  use.  Wix  and  Weebly  are  especially good at explaining features and setting goals by integrating their knowledge base  directly  into  the  manufacturer.  Which  of  the  two  is  best  for  you ultimately depends on your personal preferences. If you're not interested in learning  about  SEO  and  would  rather  have  your  builder  take  care  of  you, GoDaddy's "we'll see if anything goes" approach is even more enticing.  Squarespace and WordPress.com are great options for those less familiar with  SEO  best  practices.  These  builders  won't  hold  your  hand  during  the process, but then not everyone wants their hand held.  All  five  builders  tick  the  essential  SEO  boxes  and  their  development teams will make sure they keep up with the trends. Ultimately, it comes down to which builder best suits your site's needs.  Wix, Weebly, and WordPress.com have free plans so you can use them for  as  long  as  you  want  before  you  decide  if  they  are  right  for  you. Squarespace offers a 14-day free trial, while GoDaddy's free trial ends for a month. Both options should give you enough time to form an opinion about the platforms.  Choosing one of these five builders will help ensure that the sad picture I painted at the beginning of this article doesn't happen to you. Instead, get rid of the digital laundry and scale up SEO success!   CHAPTER 7  HOW TO BUILD WINNING LINKS  How important will SEO link building be in 2021?  Ah yes, link building. The only thing all digital marketing professionals love ... and sometimes hate. Creating SEO links in its simplest form means having authoritative websites link to your content as it is useful, relevant, and generally good. The old story is that link building is the first way you can improve your ranking on Google. This has been the case in the SEO world for some time, but will it still be a big ranking factor in 2021?  In  a  live  discussion  with  WebPromo,  the  Senior  Quality  Strategist  at Google Ireland, SEO expert Ammon Johns said in 2016 that content and links are  the  two  most  important  ranking  factors  that  point  to  your  website,  but again, what is with 2021?  Answer:  Google  has  confirmed  that  links  will  continue  to  be  a  major ranking factor for websites and eloquently: "Linking without links is really difficult."  What will change is that the quality of the links is more important than  the quantity.  Links connect pages on the Internet and show search engines how web pages are linked. A major player in the world of digital marketing, Moz, said that search engines can analyze the popularity of sites and pages based on the authority, experience and trust of the pages related to them.  If  your  website  has  a  lot  of  high  quality  links  from  websites  that  have experience, authority and trust, it will have a positive effect on your website ranking.  However,  if  you  have  a  lot  of  spam  links  from  sites  that  search engines don't trust, your web pages may not be rated or poorly rated. Google Penguin has forever changed the way we use backlinks in search engine optimization  Before April 2012, it was pretty easy to buy your ranking by adding more and more links. Some of these and some of those links, and you can manage your ranking on the first page of search engine results. Well, time has passed. The Google Penguin spam filter is now part of Google's basic algorithm and   works in real time.  Links can now be exposed to risk and you should be aware of this risk. Did  you  know  that  even  in  today's  world  or  in  search  engine  optimization, most people still only look at the source page, the referral page, and refer to it as a "backlink"? A link is a link from A to B.  A hyperlink is a connection from the referring page to the target page - this has always been the case. SEOs have long been obsessed with looking at pagerank, or whatever value, for the login page. As far as we know, LRT is the  only  software  that  takes  the  link  source  page  and  landing  page  into account when analyzing the value and risk of links or even potential links. Last minute link development  Today link building has become a professional practice. Why should you spend tons of resources on links that would break you along the way? Did you  know  it's  possible  to  simulate  the  impact  and  risk  of  a  backward relationship  before  you  start  building  it?  LRT  users  who  remove  the  good from  the  chaff,  happily  spend  3  times  the  resources  on  the  excellent  10% links they count instead of losing that way. What do you mean by backlink?  When we refer to a backlink, we refer to a reference from another website to our website. This is very different from "outbound" or "outbound" links on your page. Don't confuse the two. A backlink is also known as an inbound link  IBL . These links are very important in determining the popularity  or importance  of your website for search engines like Google.  Can a site without backlinks be rated? We are 100% sure that a website cannot be rated without incoming links.  Why is link building so important?  because links are the number. 1 from Google because the links are web because  the  links  point  to  excellent  content   it's  worth  ranking well  because ties hand over power   because the links are reliable because Google has confirmed that it would be unnatural to find a website without backlinks because Google discovers your website through links ...  The  list  goes  on  and  on  and  please  note   both  connection  strength  and connection trust are sometimes referred to as connection fairness, from a time when only a one-dimensional link measurement was available .  But  don't  believe  it  when  we  say  links  are  important,  get  them  straight from  Google.  In  April  2016,  Googler  Andrey  Lipattsev,  a  leading  search engine  researcher,  said  in  a  question  and  answer  among  some  smart  SEOs that the two most important ranking factors of Google are links and content: "I can tell you which one. It is this. It is Content. And there are links to your website. "  We have seen that Google has confirmed that links are a very important ranking  factor  and  that  linkless  ranking  is  almost  impossible  on  other occasions. Are all backlinks the same?  "The  more,  the  better"  does  not  apply  to  links.  At  least  not  as  long  as "more" indicates the links you buy without checking whether or not they are risky for your backlink profile. You'd be better targeting lower quality links than thousands of links that don't add value to your backlink profile.Weak or risky backlinks will not help you at all in the rankings. It can be even worse. These  links  can  lead  to  a  Google  penalty  and  severe   if  not  100%   loss  of organic traffic. The links are by no means the same. Understand the point:  How  many  pages  of  links,  subdomains,  domains  and  main domains? How many links per month? What  kind  of  links   Watch,  Not  Watch,  Redirect,  Javascript, Frames, .. ? What is the link between trust and power? What login keywords  "money" or "brand" ?   What link risk?  These factors can also be assessed differently in different cases. A link can also be good or bad, depending on the industry, country, language and keywords. Unfortunately, there is no general rule. For example, it does NOT matter if a domain is linked to 1,000 subpages or if 1,000 domains are linked to a subpage. For this reason, we always recommend that you use the site- level filter in LinkResearchTools. What are Google's rules for link building?  Since not all links are created equal, you need to be very careful when starting  a  link  building  campaign.  Create  links  for  your  business,  for  your customers,  make  them  relevant  and  associate  them  with  great  content.  By doing that your users will be happy so Google will keep you in the search results, and your business will grow.  Make sure that the links you create are natural and that Google does not  conclude that you are trying to manipulate the search algorithm.  We explain Google's Link Quality Scheme guidelines to give you a clear picture of how to create high quality links and how to avoid creating invalid links.  It's about quality, relevance and user orientation.  Summary of all quality guidelines for link diagrams Reciprocal connection:  Creating the wrong links: Excessive link exchange  "Link to me and I'll connect to you"  or purely networked partner sites have a negative effect on a website's ranking in search results. Building  good  links:  As  long  as  you  don't  overreact  and  those reciprocal  links  are  thematic  and  "significant  from  the  user's perspective", linking is not a bad thing.  Creating  Wrong  Links:  Links  with  optimized  anchor  text  in articles  or  press  releases  distributed  on  other  websites.  For example: the market is full of wedding rings. If you want to have a wedding, you have to choose the best ring. You also need to  Article marketing or guest posting:   Links to the web directory:  get a wedding dress and flowers. Good link building: It's great for people to write about you and link to your site, but as long as they link naturally. Completing the anchor text with commercial keywords is more than natural and will definitely get you in trouble. In this case, using branded keywords or navigation phrases is a good option.  Bad Linking: Adding your website to any web directory to get a backlink will negatively affect your website ranking. There are some  directories  that  offer  internet  users  no  real  value  and Google has excluded them from search results. They don't want your website to be there! Create  Good  Links:  The  best  directories  provide  useful information  for  potential  customers.  The  key  to  establishing links is RELEVANCE. Therefore, you will benefit from creating links in niche directories and directories that link to information pages relevant to your industry.  Forum comments and blog posts:  Create wrong links: Useless comments in the forum or blog with optimized  links  in  the  post  or  in  the  signature,  for  example: Thank  you,  this  is  great  information!  -  SEO  Agency  Services Paris. Good  Link  Building:  If  you  are  participating  in  an  active discussion on a forum or blog relevant to your business and your comment adds contextual value to the discussion, you don't need to worry about sharing a relevant link. But make sure you don't overdo it by using commercial keywords in your anchor text.  Incorrect  link  creation:  Google  clearly  states  that  buying backlinks  to  improve  your  ranking  is  against  the  rules.  They consider  links  as  votes,  and  paying  a  vote  is  unethical.  Poor quality paid links are not only a potential waste of money, but  Buying Links… or Not:   also an extremely high risk. The links purchased by those who openly declare  on their site or in social networks  that they sell links are very risky for a Google penalty! Good  link  building:  Instead  of  buying  links,  you  can  invest  in creating  quality  content  and  promoting  your  website  that  will attract natural backlinks. This approach will only cost you a lot of  bad  links  and  you  can  get  much  better  results.  It  just  takes more  patience.  If  you  want  a  risk-free  approach  to  SEO,  don't buy  links.  If  you  have  them,  let  them  go  now!  For  more information  about  old  backlinks  and  how  they  affect  your rankings, check out this blog post: What you didn't know about your old backlinks.  20 simple link building tips  While creating the right links isn't easy, there are still plenty of white hat SEO  techniques  you  can  start  using  today  without  significant  effort  or expense. 1. Request backlinks  This is a good place to start, especially if you are a beginner in the job. Think of friends, relatives, co-workers, partners, customers who have a blog or website. All you have to do is request a backlink. Request content links instead of sidebar or footer links.  But  be  careful  and  make  sure  the  backlink  is  from  a  website  that  is relevant to your niche, otherwise it won't have a huge impact and it can even be harmful. 2. Build relationships  To  build  a  good  link,  you  need  to  build  good  relationships.  There  are many ways to make new leads. You should start with niche communities - social groups, forums or blogs.  Take the first step and contribute interesting and relevant comments and  contributions that add contextual value to any discussion.  By  actively  participating  in  these  online  communities  focused  on  your niche, you not only get great backlinks, but you also always have access to the latest industry news and can connect with some interesting people who share your passions.   3. Start a blog  Don't create a blog with a post and a backlink to your website. If so, not only  have  you  wasted  your  time,  but  you've  probably  just  created  another risky link for yourself. If you want to have your own blog, you need to keep it alive.  Post regularly. Focus on your industry and the needs of your customers! It will most likely gain authority over time. Make sure your content is useful, well-structured and relevant.  This is the only way to make sure the world always wants to connect with  it. Here's how to get great backlinks. You deserve it! 4. Give a testimonial  Building  links  with  testimonials  is  a  win-win  scenario  for  everyone. Many  companies  give  you  the  opportunity  to  say  a  few  words  about  your experience with their products.  On  the  one  hand,  this  is  a  perfect  way  to  build  customer  trust.  On  the other hand, this is a great opportunity for you to get a backlink and potential traffic from this website, and the approval rate is usually much higher than your standard link request emails.  Businesses get another testimonial on their site as you get a new backlink.  5. Write a good guest post  There are many sites and blogs that accept the publication of your article.  Before writing an article anywhere, make sure that:  the blog or site is relevant to your topic the article is NOT about how good you are   about your company focus on quality  interesting, professional and well written  Keep in mind that a weak article can lead to a bad reputation.  It's  important  to  create  links  to  help  your  site,  not  links  that  could  negatively affect your site's ranking in search results.  LinkResearchTools  helps  you  quickly  assess  the  strength  and  trust  of  a domain.  You  can  use  the  Link  SEO  toolbar  to  test  the  LRT  Power  * reliability of a page or domain, or you can use the LinkResearchTools Toolkit to evaluate multiple linking options at the same time.   6. List your site in trustworthy directories  There are many online directories that in no way provide value to online users, so Google has chosen to exclude them from search results. You don't want your website listed on those pages.  But not all online guides are bad. A directory that you want to list will not only  give  you  the  option  of  posting  a  link  to  your  website,  but  also  useful information for your potential customers.  Niche  listings  and  listings  associated  with  news  sites  for  a  particular industry are a great choice. Having the business listed in such directories will make it easier to index it in the major search engines and help people find you online. 7. Discover the common backlinks of your competitors  If  you  search  for  your  competitors,  you  will  likely  find  that  they  have some backlinks in common that you don't already have. If they managed to get hold of these links, why couldn’t you?  All you  need to  do is  analyze  these backlinks  and try  to get  them.  The  Common Backlinks Tool  CBLT  has been made a tool for this.  Enter up to 10 participants and start the report. CBLT not only helps you find commonly used backlinks, but also helps you discover your competitors' resources and techniques. 8. Repair dead backlinks  Sometimes you may find broken links to your website. This may be the case if your page position changes or another webmaster miswrites your link. However, these backlinks will return a 404 error.  Such  problems  can  often  occur  even  after  a  site  has  been  restarted  or migrated  to  a  different  domain.  Therefore,  you  need  to  redirect  these backlinks to another page.  The Link Juice Recovery Tool  LJR  helps you find the backlinks your site  has  to  a  page  that  doesn't  exist   HTTP  code  404 .  You  should  try  to restore that power and trust those links by recreating the page or redirecting the link to another existing page.  LJR not only detects HTTP 404 code errors, but also detects, for example, 504  expiration  errors  or  invalid  403  login  errors.  When  you  restart  the website, you want to examine all of these errors, find the root problem, and   fix it before encountering problems.  The Link Juice Recovery tool is very easy to use, enter the URL there and run the report. You will first get a list of all your broken backlinks, and once you  get  the  list,  the  LJR  tool  will  generate  an  .htaccess  code  that  you  can easily enter into the .htaccess file.  Have  you  ever  thought  about  using  dead  Wikipedia  links  as  a  link building source? Google considers Wikipedia to be a very reliable website. You can find dead or broken links there and redirect or replace them. A good free tool for doing this is Wikigrabber. There you can search for keywords and get pages that require a quote on Wikipedia or that have a dead link.  Even  if  Wikipedia  links  are  no-follow  links,  they  still  convey  a  lot  of trust.  Don't  think  that  Google  doesn't  consider  no-follow  links.  This  is because I saw them mention the "No Follow Up" links in the manual action criminal claims. 9. Start getting an indirect backlink from your competitor  It  is  quite  normal  for  some  of  your  competitors  to  connect  to  the  same sites. Link Juice Thief finds the places your competitors usually connect to. These sites are generally major authorities in your industry.  Link  Juice  Thief  has  a  similar  result  matrix  to  the  Common  Backlink Tool. In many cases, you will find that the pages your competitors link to are licensed sites in your niche.  A link from such a site would be very helpful in terms of the strong link juice your website would receive. But there's one more thing: if you manage to get the backlink here, your competitors will indirectly link to you.  The  Link  Juice  Thief  tool  helps  you  get  backlinks  from  high  authority  pages in your niche.  What  are  you  waiting  for?  Go  and  create  those  connections!  It’s  so important you make sure these websites are low risk for your backlink profile and relevant to your niche. 10. Turn your mentions into backlinks  This is probably one of the easiest ways to get new backlinks. Someone has  already  written  something  about  you.  They  mentioned  your  brand  or product but didn't link to your website. In these cases, it is usually sufficient to contact the webmaster and ask him to convert this card into a backlink.   But how do you find these comments? It's easy with LinkResearchTools. All  you  need  to  do  is  run  a  Backlink  Profiler   BLP   report  and  filter  the results based on Connection Status> MENTION.  The Backlink Profiler  BLP  is a great tool for finding mentions that look like  links.  However,  to  find  mentions  of  brands  that  don't  look  like  URLs, you'll need to do a little more research.  Another way to find and track mentions is to use the SERP Search Tool  with a good combination of advanced search operators.  To find the most mentions, select all the results from any period or last year. It is best to use the local search engine and the language used by the target  audience.  In  the  "Values"  section,  you  can  select  the  desired  values. However, you should take a look at the details about LRT TrustPower.  After  completing  the  SERP  report,  you'll  need  to  select  "NO"  in  the  "Connected" column to view URLs that aren't connected to your website.  To find the most effective pages that mention your brand, you can still sort the results by LRT Power * Trust. If someone mentioned your brand to you before, why wouldn't they want to connect with you?  A simple email like this is usually enough: "Hey [NAME], This is [YOUR NAME], [LOCATION] on [WEBSITE]. I see you mentioned my [SITE] on [your page] about [the subject]. Thank  you for allowing others to appreciate it.  However, I was wondering if you would mind adding a hyperlink so that  people can learn more about [Topic].  I think it would be very useful for your visitors. I can't wait to hear your thoughts on this. Thank you very much. I wish you all the best. [Your name]" The SERP may not receive as many mentions as a pure Google search. However,  you  will  find  the  most  relevant  results,  so  you  should  not  waste time looking for links that may be weak or irrelevant.   11. Look for the best link building opportunities  There  are  many  ways  to  create  links  on  the  internet.  There  are  many forums, blogs, or websites to post your backlink on, but it's usually not that easy to find. Whether you want to find a strong and relevant website or blog to post a guest article or a thematic forum with follow links, the SERP search tool will help. The SERP is designed to help you find the most relevant and performing results.  Once you get the results, you can sort them by strength, subject, or any other  value  you  want.  The  best  thing  about  SERPs  is  that  you  know  these links are relevant and important in your industry.  Here is an example of using the SERP tool to find great customer posting  opportunities for the bodybuilding and fitness industries. Search operators:  inurl: written for us + training routine inurl: deposit aids + muscle building Training + guest post + health contributes + fat loss  Sorting your SERP results by LRT Power * Trust can help you find some  great publishing opportunities. 12. Find the strongest, healthiest backlink competitors  Since Google released the Penguin update in 2012, strong links haven't been the only problem for webmasters. If you don't want to be punished, the links need to be safe too. How do you find those strong but risky links that are relevant to your niche?  With Competitive Link Detox  CDTOX  you can compare your website to 10 of your competitors. Once you have the report results, you can easily sort the links for LRT Power * Trust and for very low DTOXRISK. 13. Stay tuned for new links to competitors  Very  often,  a  quick  response  can  mean  the  difference  between  success and failure. It's pretty similar on the internet. It is extremely important to be aware of your competitors' activities.  Link Alerts  LA  is a tool that will notify you of new backlinks. However,   you can also use it to monitor your competitors.  Not  only  will  this  help  you  find  new  backlink  opportunities,  but  it  will also  allow  you  to  discover  new  sources  and  techniques  that  you  may  find yourself using in the future.  The best thing about Link Alerts is that you can configure it to send you email notifications of new backlinks. It's like Google Alert, but for links. This way  you  can  spot  negative  SEO  attacks  immediately.  You  can  react immediately  to  new  unwanted  links  and  thus  protect  your  website  from  a Google  penalty.  Read  all  the  risks  and  techniques  of  negative  SEO  attacks here and find out how you can protect your website. 14. Research reports and case studies  Your personal opinion can be interesting and valuable, especially if you have  worked  in  a  certain  area  for  a  long  time.  However,  if  you  want  to become an authority and get a lot of backlinks, you need to view facts and statistics. Therefore, the following content can be distributed:  Case studies Comparisons Reviews Research papers  Try to be the first to write about a specific topic. Fresh content is essential in  any  industry,  especially  if  your  niche  is  changing  rapidly.  Include  all relevant data, test results and graphics in your search and always link your sources. 15. List  You know what? Lists are cool. It's  psychological,  our  brain  loves  lists.  If  you  make  a  cool  list,  people  will likely click on it and hand it out later. Just compare these two titles:  1      "Green Tea Is Good For Your Health" 2      "7 Amazing Reasons You Should Drink Green Tea"  16. Infographics   No matter how well you write, some people find it easier to understand  information visually.  Different  people  interpret  information  differently,  and  your  business message needs to be available in every form to attract the attention of a wider audience.  Lots of people use infographics to attract links. And it works. Sometimes someone can use your infographic without actually connecting to you. In this case  you  can  start  a  "Google  Reverse  Image  Search".  If  you  find  that  a webmaster has "forgotten" to sign up, you can simply notify them. 17. Start a "Scholarship" competition or gift campaign  The .gov and .edu links are very reliable, but also very difficult to come  by. Here's a great example of how HOTH does it.  They  started  the  "HOTH  SEO  Scholarship  Program"  by  giving  a scholarship  to  students  in  the  US  who  are  writing  a  blog  post  about  "How Companies  Can  Benefit  From  Digital  Marketing".  The  requirements  are simple:  Write a 1000-word essay on "How Businesses Can Benefit from Digital Marketing". Publish the article on your blog - it can be a student blog on the university website or on your website. Include  at  least  3  links  quoting  authoritative  digital  marketing sources, including a link to www.thehoth.com. Fill out the form below to complete your application.  Students have access to university blogs and magazines. I bet HOTH will get a lot of highly regarded links from this campaign. After a quick look at your  backlink  profile,  I  see  that  you  have  already  earned  many  .edu  links from the "Exchange" campaign. A very smart idea to build connections if you can  afford  it.  Link  building  is  one  thing,  but  you  can  also  get  links  if  you offer great content.  The main goal of Google, like any other business, is to make money. And Google can't do anything if it doesn't provide a good user experience. And the good user experience in turn brings with it valid and relevant search results. If they don't show relevant results, users can switch to another search engine.   What does great content mean for Google?  The excellent content is:  desirable findable helpful accessible believable precious  Google  checks  the  technical  characteristics  of  your  website,  e.g.  B. Website loading speed, navigation, design, keyword density, complexity and more. They also measure user experience based on click-through rate  CTR , bounce rate, or time spent on the website.  But there is something else. A very simple fact: good content will bring you lots of natural backlinks! ... and Google also looks at links. In fact, links are the single most important ranking factor. 1 for Google.  However, if no one sees your great content, there are no links growing. Here  is  the  access  to  the  link.  "How  to  Write  a  Quality  Article"  would  be another interesting topic, but now let's focus on how to get more backlinks from your content. 18. Additional material  You can also try to get the most out of the content you create by reusing  your content in different formats:  Video Research Podcasts Infographics Webinar Recordings Transcripts Guides  There is a lot of room for creativity in marketing. Using  multiple  content  formats  will  generate  and  transfer  more  leads.   You also show competence and increase your authority. 19. Newsletter subscriptions  Usually  companies  don't  understand  the  importance  of  a  newsletter. When used correctly, the benefits can be great. Publishing a newsletter will increase  the  attention  and  awareness  of  your  readers  or  customers.  With interesting and high quality content you increase the chances of sharing it, the traffic and the number of backlinks.  Try  adding  some  effective  call  buttons  to  your  newsletter,  such  as offering them to sign up for a webinar, download whiter paper, or download an ebook. 20. Learn from others  Nothing  is  as  sad  as  people  who  spend  days  and  weeks  writing  about something and then ... nothing. All the passion and knowledge for free. Good, but unnoticed items happen to everyone every day.  The problems can be varied. Usually people make a mistake in choosing the topic. It doesn't matter how good your article is if no one wants to read it. The opposite can also happen, strong argument, but little content!  You can read hundreds of articles and watch dozens of videos with good  content, but there's always one safe way to go: learn from others.  For  example,  do  you  want  to  write  about  health  but  don't  know  which topics  are  the  most  popular?  Let's  start  a  simple  report  using  the  Most Powerful Subpage Tool. Link building is not enough  We  recommend  that  you  begin  to  build  more  links.  Before  you  do, double-check the links, clear up any spam links you've purchased in the past, and use Link Detox Boost to make Google crawl the links in the file faster. You refused Reject all high-risk links. I hope you don't want Google Penguin to find them, right?  Remember that Google Penguin is now part of Google's core algorithm  and therefore works in real time. You may be fined for each new scan.  If you want your website to rank well and work without any downside, it is not enough to just create new links. You need to take care of your backlink profile and remove all spam links.   In  October  2018,  Google's  John  Muller  confirmed  that  a  proactive  disapproval is a good idea if you want to avoid a Google penalty.  Especially when someone posts links on a website that has spam in it, or when a previous search engine optimization company created a script to place links and a number of forums and for some reason you can't clean it up. You have a manual action but you want to make sure it doesn't even reach that point.  So  the  disclaimer  is  a  great  way  to  say  I  know  these  issues  first, dismiss them, and get them out of the equation.  Where do all the spam links come from? You may have spam links from the past. Maybe you bought a few or your  SEO didn't care too much about the quality of the links they created for you. The truth is, you can have bad connections any day. Let's be clear, your competitors don't want your website to rank well in any way. You can plan a negative SEO attack by sending lots of spam links to your website.  This is a great reason to check your backlink profile regularly with Link  Detox. Monitor your backlink profile and proactive rejections  If  you  want  to  stay  competitive  over  time,  you  need  to  protect  your website  better  for  the  future.  Put  SEO  on  your  long-term  agenda  and regularly monitor your backlink profile.  We  know  it  doesn't  feel  like  a  walk  in  the  park,  but  luckily  there  are automated  tools  like  Link  Alerts  that  can  help  you  stay  on  track.  This  tool will notify you when new backlinks appear. This way you can react quickly to unwanted new backlinks and avoid common SEO techniques like negative SEO attacks.   CHAPTER 8  NOT ONLY GOOGLE, HOW TO RANK USING  SOCIAL MEDIA & SEO  Social Media SEO  The research industry is always interested in how social media can affect SEO. Social Network SEO refers to how social network activity can increase your website's organic traffic through search engines. It's a topic that never gets  old.  The  reason  is  simple:  social  media  is  important  to  SEO  in  many ways. Not only does it make your SEO efforts effective, it is also profitable. Yes, social networks and SEO may seem different, but there is no doubt that they help each other.  Contrary  to  popular  belief,  social  media  does  not  directly  contribute  to SEO.  In  other  words,  social  cues  don't  directly  help  you  score  better.  The links you share on Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest can help raise awareness of your brand, but Google doesn't see them as a ranking signal.  Now, here's the thing: while social media isn't a superficial ranking factor, it makes sense if you look deeper. It indirectly has a positive effect on the ranking of a page. So yes, there is a clear correlation between a site's ranking in the SERP and the number of social cues it has.  If you study the websites that rank high in Google, you will find many  with strong social signals.  So investing in social media marketing essentially improves your chances  of good search engine performance. Why Google Ignores Social Signals  Does Google crawl and index social media profiles   pages on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn? Yes, of course. Do you see the content and the links posted  on  it  differently?  No,  it  treats  it  like  a  normal  HTML  page  on  a website.  In terms of social signals, Google does not consider the number of shares or  followers  of  social  networks  when  ranking  a  web  property.  Because  it would be too easy for anyone to cheat the system and rate an undeserved site   higher than it deserves.  It's  also  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  social  media  sharing  happens around the clock. And it's happening faster than Google can catch up. This makes it difficult for the search engine giant to crawl and follow them.  We  don't  know  how  much  data  Google  "needs  to  sign  in"  from  major social  networking  sites,  and  we're  not  sure  if  they  are  using  it  for classification  purposes.  What  we  do  know  is  that  social  media  plays  an indirect role in helping people find your brand in search engine results. And right now that's all that matters. 3 reasons to improve your work on social media  Search  engine  optimization  aims  to  get  more  exposure  and  get  more people to visit your website organically. Social media marketing, on the other hand, means maximizing the use of social networks and finding them by the right people. Both may look different, but have overlapping goals. Basically, they work together. For this reason, search engines are becoming more and more social and social networks are becoming valuable search engines.  An effective social media strategy needs to have a solid SEO plan as the two go hand in hand. Let's look at three compelling reasons why you should focus on social media if you want to improve your SEO results. Reason n.1: Social media content is indexed  Having the right kind of social media content posted on a regular basis can make a huge difference in your overall content marketing campaign. And if you find that your social media posts can be crawled and indexed by search engine spiders, things get better.  That  doesn't  mean  every  tweet  or  post  you  create  will  reach  Google's extensive  index.  It  needs  to  be  relevant  enough  that  people  searching  for similar  content  can  find  it.  For  example,  if  you  do  a  search  for  Oprah Winfrey, you will find that most of the top performers are her social media profiles   pages, because it is relevant to the search query.  What's even better is that social media can help you index your website content faster as search engines handle social media content. If the blog post gets  a  lot  of  attention  on  Facebook  or  Twitter,  it  will  be  indexed  faster. Search  engine  spiders  can  find  such  content  easily  because  of  the  social factor. When your post goes viral on social media, the ripples can be felt on   the search engine results pages. Reason n.2: Social media helps build authority  Search engines place a high value on a website's authority, which makes it a critical SEO factor to focus on. If your page or domain has high value in the  eyes  of  search  engines,  it  has  high  authority.  And  a  better  chance  of ranking over sites with less authority.  The authority of a web page or website increases over time. As you keep posting great content and getting more relevant backlinks, your authority will keep growing. The content you post gives your audience what they're looking for when it's valuable, which in turn earns backlinks by getting a number of positive votes.  When  there  weren't  any  social  networks,  the  world  of  connecting  was different. From now on, you can no longer ignore social media when building backlinks. Why? Because a lot of the content on the web is shared through social  media.  It's  the  largest  content  delivery  engine.  This  means  that  your influence or authority on social networking sites has a direct impact on your authority.  By  focusing  on  building  a  social  media  follower  network,  your  content will have more relevant places to live. And the more relevant the places you live, the more authority you acquire. For example, if you create yoga content and get backlinks from blogs that write specifically about yoga, you will get more brownie points from Google and other search engines. They know that you are posting content that will reach a relevant audience. Reason n.3: Social media engages real people  While SEO has a technical side, it's not the only thing to focus on. Most unethical  blackhat  or  SEO  practices  are  technical  in  nature  and  yet  do  not produce long-term results because they take "the user" out of the equation. These  methods  don't  apply  to  people  when  search  engines  are  specifically looking for a human touch.  Search engines have always tried to find a better way to serve users and go beyond technical matters. If you want to rank a web property in 2019, you can't depend solely on technical factors, such as keyword optimization. Your SEO must have a human element to achieve real results. Or it is beaten by someone who has taken the time to create valuable content.  With  the  rapid  growth  of  social  networks,  it  is  becoming  an  inevitable   part  of  SEO,  especially  as  it  consists  of  real  people.  Based  on  the  content, social media  can be  seen as  an  integral factor  in research.  It allows  you  to separate your audience and choose whoever you want. In fact, social media is one of the fastest ways to get to know your audience. Whether it's a group, customer  service  channel,  or  promotion  page,  regardless  of  your  business purpose,  it's  easy  to  get  feedback.  It  gives  you  a  bird's  eye  view  of everything. You know where your content is, who is consuming and sharing it, and what impact it has, which, if you ask us, is huge in terms of SEO. How Social Media Helps SEO  Now that it has been established that social media is not a direct ranking  factor on Google, here are five ways social media can help you rank better. Get more quality links  Backlinks have always been an important factor when it comes to ranking a website in search engines. Both the quality and quantity of backlinks have a strong effect on the ranking of your site.  When  you  focus  on  better  social  media  marketing,  the  more  likely  you will find the right kind of backlink opportunity. If your content shares more social media, it will be noticed. Not just from high performing influencers   users, but also from many relevant webmasters   bloggers who may want to reach out to you.  According  to  a  study  by  Dan  Zarrella  of  Hubspot,  there  is  a  clear  and positive  correlation  between  the  number  of  social  media  shares  of  your content and the number of backlinks.  Gone  are  the  days  when  social  networks  were  just  actions.  Today  it’s about  leverage.  It's  about  making  your  content  attractive  so  that  it  can  be shared and seen not only by anyone, but also by the right people. Since you are posting and sharing quality content on social media, your content should be able to generate more engagement and backlinks. Create a strong audience or watch  Obviously,  creating  a  great  product  is  the  first  step  in  achieving  great marketing  goals.  However,  in  order  to  really  name  the  success  of  your product or service, it is important that you let your target audience, especially early  adopters,  know  about  it.  Remember,  if  your  audience  doesn't  know what you're offering, it's as good as not having it.   Today's market is extremely competitive, where companies are willing to make a real investment to get their share of the pie. That is why you need to put  extra  effort  into  actively  reaching  your  target  audience.  The  more proactive you are, the better the results.  Social networks make it easier for you to set up a web presence. You can connect  with  an  audience  that  is  not  only  ready  to  listen  to  you,  but  also wants to do business with you.  Nowadays, most of the online users are present on social networks. It's all about finding your target audience's social network. And then you work on producing social content that you can use to connect with them emotionally. Increase the number of trademark searches  Growing your audience and building a strong brand are an important part of  any  online  marketing  campaign.  Social  media  marketing  is  no  different. Your social media profiles and pages will help you build a relationship with your  chosen  audience.  They  recognize  your  brand  through  your  constant updates  on  social  media  and  the  regular  provision  of  quality  information. They know who you are and what kind of content you are creating, and begin to see yourself as a reliable source.  When  done  right,  social  media  marketing  will  help  you  increase  your brand awareness. As more people learn more about your product or service, they  will  find  more  by  clicking  on  your  content  on  search  engine  results pages. Since Google and other search engines attach great importance to click rates, this can significantly influence the ranking and increase visibility.  Also, keep in mind that these clicks are more valuable to Google because they  statistically  have  a  lower  bounce  rate.  Why?  Because  these  people already know your brand, fewer of them will click the back button once they visit  your  page.  Since  the  rejection  rate  is  related  to  a  website's  ranking, reducing it gives you an advantage over other competing websites.  By increasing brand awareness on social media, you will also have more people  searching  for  your  brand  specifically  and  this  will  also  continue  to increase  organic  search  traffic  on  your  website.  Your  social  media  pages    profiles. Find out what your audience wants  While the importance of keywords in search engine optimization remains the same, the way in which they are researched has evolved over the years.   Finding  and  selecting  understanding of "user intent".  the  right  keywords   today  requires  a  strong  Without understanding the researcher's intent, your chosen keywords may not  produce  the  results  you  want.  When  you  search  for  "landscape photography",  Google  wants  to  know  why  you  did  this  to  get  the  most relevant  results.  Would  you  like  to  learn  how  to  photograph  different landscapes? Or do you just want to find out more?  There  are  many  ways  to  find  out  what  your  audience  wants,  such  as: Email  surveys.  However,  you  can  also  do  this  with  social  listening.  By tracking and researching the different types of conversations the public has on  social  networks,  you  can  get  information  about  their  needs  and  wants. That way, you can create content that suits their needs by giving Google and other search engines what they are looking for. Tap Local Search  If you're a small or medium-sized business with a physical address, then you  can't  and  shouldn't  ignore  local  search  capabilities.  Google  knows  the importance of geography and its relevance in order to provide users with a better user experience. As the vast majority of Internet users search for local businesses on their mobile devices, local search will increase.  So make sure you keep each profile up to date with your current address, phone  number,  company  name,  etc.  You  have  the  same  information  in  all profiles, which in turn should match the information on your website. Or you could be ranked lower and losing potential customers. Social media SEO best practices  Every step you take to improve your social media marketing efforts needs to be aligned with your SEO strategy. Why? Because you don't want to lose traffic  on  both  sides.  Here  are  some  of  the  best  social  networking  SEO practices that you shouldn't ignore if you want to be successful. Publish quality content  SEO  is  no  longer  what  it  used  to  be.  It's  much  more  mature  and accessible.

But  there  is  another  area  where  they  play  a  key role  and  that  is  search  engine  optimization.  That's  right:  if  you  ignored  the images  in  favor  of  the  text,  you  made  a  mistake.  The  thing  is,  images  can have  a  huge  impact  on  driving  organic  traffic  to  your  website  if  you  can optimize it well.  First, tweak your search images by using the keyword in the file name,   adding the appropriate alternative text, and using the appropriate surrounding text.  At  the  same  time,  you  need  to  optimize  them  for  social  sharing  and make  sure  they  are  in  the  right  format  and  published  on  all  the  social platforms  where  your  brand  is  featured.

The 15 best ways for using Google Analytics to track your SEO efforts  Did you know that 67% of all clicks on a search engine result in the top  five organic results?  SEO is more important than ever. Advertising makes a lot of money on marketing expenses, but people shy away from paying search engine ads for organic results.  So how do you get to page  1 and have the ability to drive even more visitors to your website? It is unlikely that you will do this on your own or that a single strategy will work. You need to constantly measure your SEO performance, changing what isn't working and moving on with what is.  There's  probably  a  free  tool  right  now  that  you  can  use  to  track  your  values in the field: Google Analytics. This leaves you in doubt:  Does Google Analytics help with search engine optimization? The short answer? Yup. Google  Analytics  contains  valuable  data  that  your  business  can  use  to track   and  improve   SEO  performance,  from  keywords  to  organic  page views. Here are 15 use cases that show how you can use Google Analytics for SEO:  Sync your Search Console account Create SEO Goals Use the organic visitor segment Compare non-ecological visitors with ecological ones Find high performing content Check out the top performing landing pages   Use the content detail report Add annotations to track content updates Use the multi-channel report Track your keywords in Google Analytics Look for reference pages Manage your PPC spending Check how Google sees your website Create custom dashboards Set warnings  Before going into the details, find out about your account details with our Google Analytics SEO Dashboard. You can display the most popular values  on your site page. 1. Synchronize your Search Console account  "The  best  advice  I  want  to  give  you  to  measure  SEO  using  Google Analytics  is  to  connect  the  analytics  to  Google  Search  Console",  said  Kim Doughty from Leadhub.  "In  fact,  if  you  use  Google  Analytics  without  GSC,  you  will  never  be shown the full picture. When the GA and GSC are connected, you can use queries to identify areas for improvement based on the selected keywords and pages for which you want to rank."  Nabil Freij from SCORE adds: "In the Google Search Console you can find  out  which  keywords  users  use  to  find  your  content,  what  content  they find and where they rank on Google."  "You  can  analyze  the  information  and  find  ways  to  improve  the optimization of your pages so you have a better chance of ranking on the first page of Google," says Freji.  Omar  Fonesca,  Medicare  Plan  Finder,  explains:  “Another  valuable section is the "Search Console" which gives you more detailed information on  landing  pages  and  search  queries   keyword  terms   based  on  clicks. Impressions,% CTR and so on "  "From the analysis you can also see with which devices you can be found  and from which countries your data traffic comes!"   NameBounce's  Axel  DeAngelis  explains  how  you  can  use  this  synced data: "For example, if you use GSC data for A   B test title tags and meta descriptions, you can get a higher click-through rate for searches over time." . "By  doing  this  you  can  promote  Google's  RankBrain  algorithm  and  improve your rankings in a more controlled way," says DeAngelis. 2. Create SEO goals  Chris Sheehy states that Sidewalk Branding Co. "always starts any SEO campaign  by  setting  Google  Analytics  first,  including  goals,  and  creating appropriate  conversion  pages,  not  just  to  keep  track  of  when  someone converts  a  page."  Element  on  it   e.g.  "Being"   a  Contact  us  or  request information forms , but report if such a form has been successfully completed and sent. "  "These  conversion  pages  are  sometimes  called  confirmation  pages  and they  simply  notify  the  sender  that  the  form  has  been  received,"  Sheehy continues.  "In  this  case  this  page  should  have  its  own  URL  and  contain  the NOINDEX meta tag so that it is not displayed organically. This reduces false positives and gives the customer the assurance that the reports are correct."  Additionally,  Jonathan  Aufray,  Growth  Hackers  says,  "When  you measure SEO with Google Analytics, you not only want to track your organic traffic. You also want to measure the quality of your organic visitors."  "How? By setting goals, such as the leads generated by organic SEO. We check how much organic traffic a page is receiving and, more importantly, how  many  leads  we  have  received  from  those  visitors.  The  higher  the conversion, the better. "  WealthTurbo's  John  Tabbernor  sums  it  up,  "This  is  a  great  way  to compare  SEO  efforts  to  other  marketing  campaigns  like  PPC  or  social media." 3. Use the organic visitor segment  If you are using Google Analytics for SEO, Vic Spall of Browser Media recommends  "making  sure  that  you  use  segments  and  filters  to  eliminate spam traffic for proper reporting. There are two main types of spam traffic that will destroy your reports: Crawlers and fake referrals. " and ghost spam. "Using filters has to exclude traffic from referral traffic. This is relatively   easy  as  you  just  need  to  exclude  the  domain.  You  can  also  use  regex  to capture multiple iterations of known spam domains that use different TLDs. E.g.  This solves the problem with the first type of spam traffic. "  Spall adds: "Unfortunately, you may also get direct spam traffic, and you wouldn't  like  that.  In  this  case,  you  need  to  exclude  traffic  that  does  not match the host name. See you later, Ghost Spam! ""  "Filters should be placed in a new view in Google Analytics so you don't worry about raw data, they prevent spam from showing up in your reports the day you post it. But what about deleting the traffic afterwards?" misery? "  "This is where segments come in. Segments are your friends," adds Spall. "The simplest step in using Google Analytics to control organic traffic is to  set  up  a  custom  dashboard  for  organic  traffic  only  and  show  every important  value  to  a  person's  specific  activity,"  says  Erez  Kanaan  from Kanaan & Co..  In  fact,  total  organic  traffic  is  the  most  monitored  Google  Analytics  metric by SEO experts around the world. 4. Compare organic and inorganic visitors  You have broken down the Google Analytics data by organic visitors. However, Joe Man Fortunato of Company Man Studios says we should "focus  on  certain  pages  and  monitor  organic  traffic  values,  then  exclude organic traffic and measure those values as well."  "Successful  SEO  efforts  lead  to  organic  values  and  improved  traffic. However, if you exclude organic traffic, you can see poor user experience or design that can be improved, which gives an extra boost to SEO efforts." 5. Find  and update  high performing content  When I asked Shotkit for the best SEO advice on using Google Analytics, Rachel Kaiser said, "Regularly down the ratio of your high performing pages and see what you can do to optimize them."  "This is probably updating them with new content and calling for action more strongly ... whatever you need to do to really get the most return from the pages on your site that are already well ranked in search."  HubSpot's Alex Brikett explains: "For example, are there sites that have significantly  decreased  their  organic  traffic?  Probably  some  promotion  and   update potential for those sites."  "What about sites that have a lot of traffic but their commercial value is  minimal?”CRO potential there,” adds Brikett.  Alice  Stevens  from  Best  Company,  says,  “It's  also  a  great  tool  for monitoring  the  effectiveness  of  certain  sites.  You  can  track  pageviews  and downtime,  and  see  which  internal  links  are  getting  the  most  clicks.  These steps  will  help  you  understand  how  effective  your  content  is,  find  difficult spots, and make changes to improve your content. "  In summary, Daniel Whittaker of dreamfree says, "Find out what the best  post is on your blog and continue posting in the same area." 6. Check out the high performing landing pages  “One  of  the  most  underrated  SEO  tricks  is  tracking  the  best  landing pages. This data can help you increase page views, lower rejection rates, and identify  the  best  and  least-converted  pages,”  says  Ashley  Bhaskar  of BforBloggers. . Bhaskar  adds  that  they  are  “reviewing  top  landing  pages  per  month  and optimizing the top 10 for:  Readability and user intent  increase dwell time, decrease pogo stick  Conversion  helps me earn more  Google Fresh Algorithm  updated article ”  Kayla Hunter from Zivadream says: "This report shows which pages of your site are generating individually the most sessions and the source of the traffic for that page  Google search, social media, etc. . This is one of the best ways  to  evaluate  how  your  website  content  is  doing  and  to  edit  pages  that aren't performing well."  "This is a great way to rate the content on your website and edit poorly performing  pages.  It  also  lets  you  see  what  types  of  content  are  doing  the most, so you can tweak your strategy first."  Ben Johnson of the Sagefrog Marketing Group explains how to find this report: just scroll through the behavior and see the main landing pages and filter for organic, or go under the organic channels and create the secondary dimension landing page.   Additionally, Netpaths' Cayley Vos says, "This gives you an idea of the problems your customers are trying to solve and the questions they have. Use this data to optimize your pages and answer their questions." 7. Use the content detail report  Shaan  Patel  says,  "The  best  advice  I  can  give  you  for  measuring  SEO using Google Analytics is to eliminate unwanted page clicks and views using the content detail tool."  "We mostly use it to monitor blog content pages and see what trending  topics are in order to refine them with other guide magnets or FAQs." 8. Add annotations to track content updates  "For  a  full  cutting  and  optimizing  company  like  [G2]  to  track  and  document the results," writes Hannah Tow.  "Using the annotation feature on a specific date is the easiest way to do this  in  Google  Analytics.  Using  annotations  in  Google  Analytics,  we  can compare the performance of an article after optimization."  Brooke Logan of Sagefrog Marketing Group added, "This can help you with future measurements to determine if these changes have helped improve SEO."  Brian Jensen of Congruent Digital sums it up: “Most SEO changes take days,  weeks,  and  sometimes  months  to  pay  off,  which  can  make  impact assessments difficult.  "Use  the  annotations  and  write  down  any  SEO  optimization  you  do  in Google Analytics. You have a clear benchmark to measure the improvement in your optimization efforts." 9. Use the multi-channel channel report  Before  that,  we  covered  how  you  can  split  organic  visitors  into  the organic  traffic  segment.  However,  ScienceSoft's  Liubou  Zubarevich  warns, "Your  bio  users  may  not  be  that  biological.  The  GA  source  cannot  be overwritten."  "If a user previously came to the site via an organic search and returned to it later, Google Analytics remembers the first search and leaves the source as organic. So remember that the traffic source refers to a session not to a user.” Ana  Kravitz  of  Mixed  Analytics  offers  an  interesting  solution:  "By   default, GA assigns conversions to the latest traffic source. Direct traffic is excluded from this algorithm, in which case it searches for a known traffic source."  To  better  measure  the  full  impact  of  SEO,  you  have  to  select  "Indirect Conversions"  from  the  "Multi-Channel  Funnels  report".  This  shows  you when SEO played a role in generating conversions, even if it wasn't the last click." 10. How do you track keywords in Google Analytics?  "The  biggest  problem  when  you  want  to  use  Google  Analytics  to  track SEO  is  that  most  of  the  keyword  field  is  'not  provided'.  This  complicates matching  keywords  that  people  are  using  with  behavior  on  your  site”  says Bryan Howard from My Web Needs.  "While this is certainly not the perfect solution, I recommend integrating GA with the search console and checking ‘Landing Pages’  you can do that by going to Capture -> Search Console -> Landing Pages .  "If  you  have  the  right  SEO  strategy  and  URLs  per  page,  you  can  see which landing pages people will access if they come from Google and have an idea of the keywords they will use to find you."  Julia  Coquet  also  suggests  considering  a  premium  solution  for  more useful SEO performance data like Keyword Hero  one of the best SEO tools used by experts together with Google Analytics ".  ... But Christy Kravetz from CanIRank says: "Don't stop here!" “You  should  total  all  the  traffic  that  comes  from  long-tail  or  related phrases containing the optimized phrase. We refer to this as “ halo traffic. ” It's important to get a full picture of what you publish over an optimized time period  rather  than  looking  only  at  the  traffic  with  that  specific  phrase.  The value is higher than you think! "  In fact, Christian Smith from MonsterInsights is one of 36% of experts who suggests that "You should check Google's top search terms if your goal is to have accurate measures of your SEO efforts". Smith adds, "By targeting a particular keyword you can see where it currently stands and how high that keyword is.  Christoff continues, "By targeting a particular keyword you can see how high  that  keyword  is  and  where  it  currently  stands.  By  reviewing  this   information daily, you can make incremental and effective changes to your SEO strategy." 11. Find reference pages  "If you are committed to active off-page SEO strategies, knowing if you are linking and how it is affecting performance is important," writes Kerry Sherin of North Star Inbound.  Sherin believes it is possible "to use Google Analytics benchmarks to find links not listed in other tools and find relevant reporters or bloggers to post based on people already signed up" to your website " 12. Manage your PPC spending  Kim Hawkins, for Events Wholesale, says, "Tracking Google Analytics was key to making sure we were making money from all of our promotions, [because] analytics shows us exactly which keywords are selling and which are not."  "By carefully monitoring our keywords and conversions, we make sure  we don't waste a lot of money on bad keyword conversions."  "By carefully monitoring our conversions and keywords, we make sure we don't waste a lot of time and money on bad keywords." Hawkins adds, “We  also  advertise  through  Facebook  and  Bing,  Pinterest,  YouTube  and Yahoo, but most of our revenue comes from Google.” 13. Check how Google sees your industry  The category of your website is important to Google. You want sites on Page  1 that are licensed, which is why sites with a niche theme tend to rank better.  LinkBuildingHQ's  Haseeb  Nathan  explains  how  you  can  use  Google Analytics to do this: "You can control the interest categories of your website visitors.  This  can  help  you  note  your  E.A.T.  position  and  customize  the content."  "Go  to  Audience>  Interests>  Google  Analytics  Overview.  Affinity  categories, market segments, and other categories are displayed."  Nathan continues: "As a publisher, you can use this data to first identify the  primary  interest  of  your  site  visitors,  then  plan  your  content  marketing based on what you've achieved."   "Google will show you the most appropriate categories for your site. You  can  triangulate  these  three  types  of  categories  to  find  some commonly used categories   categories of interest. This should be your main category for your website to be an authority on establish." 14. Create custom dashboards  "The best advice for measuring SEO using Google Analytics is to create  your own custom reports," says Alice Gerwat, Magic Freebies.  "Now  you  should  save  custom  reports  based  on  a  single  page  of  your website to choose specific values such as the number of entries per page by date or the average time spent on the page."  Gerwat continues: "This is useful, for example, to determine which blog posts are the most popular on your website and to measure how much organic traffic your blog is getting you." RJ Redmond shares the custom dashboards that advidemedia.com creates for their customers:  The SEO Overview Dashboard is used to give you an overview of our SEO campaigns. The Content performance dashboard. The  Topic-specific  dashboard:  it  shows  us  the  most  viewed pages  related  to  a  product,  service  or  topic,  and  the  most important keywords in a particular topic. The Geographic Regions: This is especially helpful for our local SEO clients.  Robbie Richards explains how these reports can also help you understand your funnel: “For many of our customers, we create custom reports that show more traffic and conversions from every landing page to blogging solutions, features and subfolders. , which can be seen in the middle and at the bottom of the funnel. "  ESM  Digital's  Joseph  Colarusso  adds,  "You  can  segment  by  channel, URL, location, etc. This gives you the opportunity to really focus on some of your website traffic so you can draw conclusions."  *  Editor's  Note:  Do  you  want  to  create  custom  reports  in  Google Analytics?  They  can  be  crafty.  Instead,  browse  our  selection  of  pre-made   Google  Analytics  templates.  They  already  contain  the  most  important  SEO values and synchronize the data from your Google Analytics account. 15. Configure custom alerts  "The  personalized  alerts   that  Google  Analytics  offers  are  often  overlooked in the search area," says Nicholas Smith of Ridgeway.  All  you  need  to  do  is  set  the  triggers  for  the  chosen  parameter   for example, when organic traffic increases by 5% or the rejection rate decreases by  2%   and  Google  will  send  an  email  alert,  making  it  easier  to  update important metrics. ". The 7 most important SEO metrics to monitor in Google Analytics  When  we  asked  for  'candidegardening.com'‘s  best  tip,  Luke  Coppard advised  us  to  “make  sure  you’re  measuring  the  right  metrics  for  Google Analytics. You could be a traffic generating machine with a million organic users a day, but if none of them convert, who cares?" Our  experts  recommend  monitoring  these  SEO  metrics  on  the  Google Analytics dashboard:  Bounce rate Dwell time Time on hand Website speed Mobile traffic Return on investment Bio conversion rate  1. Bounce rate  First Union's Madison Ruos says, "Regardless of your goals, considering bounce  rate  and  user  behavior  will  give  you  an  idea  of  how  users  interact with your website."  "With this information, you can better optimize your website. You want visitors to stay on your website for as long as possible," adds Ruos. One of them is the bounce rate, which is the percentage of people who come to your website and "bounce" after viewing just one page.   So what does a good bounce rate look like? Robert Taylor of Advantix  Digital explains: A "bad" bounce rate can be too high or too low.  For  example,  if  your  bounce  rate  is  0%,  it  could  mean  that  the  Google Analytics tracking code is triggered twice, so no bounce rate can be logged. On  the  other  hand,  too  high  a  bounce  rate  of  over  70%.  Indicate  user experience issues or poor site design.  Melanie Hartmann of Creo Home Solutions says it is possible to analyze the bounced traffic behavior flow report: "We do this to see where site traffic ends and where   when they choose to leave. This enables us to customize and test our website to increase engagement and conversions. "  Valuechain's  Alex  Knight  agrees  and  recommends  "filtering  the  best  landing pages and seeing bounce rate and session duration."  "If  your  content  is  of  value  to  page  visitors,  Google  will  not  only recognize  it  but  will  increase  the  page  rank  of  your  content,  which  will  be found by more people. However, it is the value that your content provides to the user and this is best measured by the based on behavioral statistics. " 2. Residence time  "In my opinion, the bounce rate can be manipulated and therefore should  not be considered a ranking factor", writes Yorick Hibbert of "isitwp.com".  So if you use Google Tag Manager to track dwell time, all you can say is that  Google  users  have  less  dwell  time  as  a  traffic  source.  So  you  should optimize your page for meta titles.  "Using  this  advanced  technique  you  have  to  play  with  GTM  and  make your reports available by entering them in the behavioral section of Google Analytics," continues Hibbert. 3. Time available  Life's Julius Shepherd SEO likes the All Pages report because "it shows not only the top performing pages after page views to guide future content creation and optimization, but" Time at your fingertips. "This is one of the most important metrics for understanding the level of visitor engagement on a site."  "Potentially, you want to see an average time on a page of a few minutes. This is a strong signal to Google that people liked what they found on your site," Shepherd added.   Ben Cook of RC Social Media adds, "If a page lasts less than 2 minutes on  average,  it  will  typically  be  enlarged,  expanded,  and  valuable  to introductory readers." 4. Website speed  Keiran  Hughes  of  Kids  Dental  Brands  believes  that  “you  should  make sure you are watching your page load speed as slow pages affect conversion and  SEO.  Oftentimes  people  are  just  looking  at  the  overall  speed  of  the website and overlooking individual pages. ""  You can find this under Behavior-> Site Speed-> Page Time. "With  this  information,  you'll  know  where  to  compress  certain  images, minimize CSS and Javascript, or use the browser cache," adds Carl Westley of T3.  Matt Seifert of Seifert Media sums it up: "If you can see which pages are lagging behind in loading time, you can prioritize SEO activities to improve the overall performance of your website. Website speed is also important to Google's  Ranking  Factor  makes  this  SEO  tactic  of  Google  Analytics indispensable. " 5. Mobile device traffic  Early in 2018, Google introduced mobile-first indexing. For  this  reason  Howie  Emerson  of  No  Bounds  Digital  recommends  "keeping an eye on mobile traffic".  "In  the  age  of  mobile  traffic,  tracking  mobile  user  engagement  is important  because  it  enables  us  to  identify  and  respond  to  anomalies  that could affect search engine rankings," added Emerson. 6. Return on Investment  ROI   Market Republic's Earnest Norris says you're getting "traffic, bounce rate, average  page  session,  and  other  metrics  that  don't  show  how  much  money you're making".  "You  need  to  pay  attention  to  these  aspects,  but  focus  on  pursuing  the goals  that  show  ROI.  You  can  view  your  customers'  reports  on  keyword positions  and  traffic.  However,  if  they  don't  see  the  results  in  their  bank account, it doesn't matter. " Norris added.  Bank  Bounds’  Messiah  Jepson  adds,  "How  much  is  SEO  worth  if  it   doesn't  generate  qualified  leads?"  Focus  on  conversion  actions  specifically from organic traffic and indirect conversions from organic traffic using multi- channel funnels. "  Superior  Honda‘s  Travers  Cantrell  adds,  "This  report  allows  you  to  measure conversions associated with organic searches."  "If  your  conversion  rate  is  low,  think  carefully  about  what  the  user specifically  wants  when  using  keywords  that  lead  to  your  website.  Make conversions as easy as possible on the pages with the most traffic." 7. Organic conversion rate  “My  favorite  way  to  use  Google  Analytics  for  SEO  is  to  observe  conversions and traffic,” writes Raleigh Ayers of Hosting Canada.  "I  compare  the  traffic  I  receive  for  each  individual  page  with  each conversion  for  each  individual  page.  This  allows  me  to  create  a  traffic conversion  rate  that  I  can  use  to  determine  the  time  it  takes  to  implement conversion strategies on specific pages."  Ayers continues, "It's easy to get excited when you look at a website and see how many hits you get. All that traffic isn't worth much if it doesn't help you make money."  "Using Google Analytics to track customer conversions is one of the best ways to increase website sales. It can also point out negative trends that you might otherwise not have noticed. The month should increase."  *  Editor's  Note:  Did  You  Find  Your  Best  SEO  Metrics?  Instead  of searching your Google Analytics account to find it in various reports, enter your data into our SEO summary dashboard. You can manually select your SEO KPIs and view them all in one place. How you can use these statistics to improve your SEO  Regardless of the user experience metrics you choose, Ozzy Peak says, "Event and goal tracking in Google Analytics can help you understand how people are interacting with your site after they click a result. Research."  “The  better  the  way  people  interact,  the  higher  your  SEO  performance  will be.”  Peak continues: By keeping tabs on these engagement metrics, you can also  see  if  you're  ranking  for  the  right  keywords  in  your  niche.  You  can definitely  get  in  the  top  spot  and  get  a  lot  of  traffic  for  a  given  term,  but   because people who post that term Search term, are not engaged. Should your content really score points for this term? " Final thoughts  Are you ready to take advantage of the SEO power of Google Analytics? "Throughout the SEO analysis, don't forget to dive into the mind of your ideal  customer.  A  deep  understanding  of  your  customer  creates  truly meaningful  insights  from  your  data,"  summarizes  ProfitReach's  Jayson Carlyle.  "The more you look at the data, the better you are familiar with the people  who use your website. However, it is more important to take action."  “Google Analytics is not worth analyzing if you do not regularly make  changes and improvements to the website and search engine optimization. "   CHAPTER 10  HOW TO FIX THE 8 MOST COMMON  PROBLEMS WITH SEO  You work months or even years evaluating relevant search terms on search engines. And that job is done with the knowledge that there is no guarantee that your rankings will rise or even hold.  Even  more  terrifying,  you  could  lose  years  of  consistent,  hard  work  in seconds. How? You can lose everything by not solving SEO problems in a timely manner.  They may look small at first. Who cares about referral traffic with spam? You probably think that every website is affected, especially those with better search results. That's right. But  how  do  you  know  that  if  you  don't  address  it  now,  your  Google Analytics data can grow this far? However, you try to fix the problem only to find that most of the corrections cannot be applied to historical data. Ugh !!  You may not care about the speed of your website today. It may be fine with the current data. So you don't mind adding large 150KB image files. But what happens after so much cargo has been added for a few months?  It could be that a site is too bloated to load in just 5 seconds. This web  design is not suitable for a positive user experience.  It's  easy  to  ignore  problems  and  let  them  grow  as  your  website  grows. You have a lot to do. But all of a sudden these seem trivial when you see your  site  traffic  dropping  all  the  way  down  and  your  bounce  rate skyrocketing.  Now that you're already concerned about all the things that don't add up to your SEO, I'll show you how to fix 8 of the most common web design and hosting issues you may be facing right now. 1. Spam traffic  referral SPAM   Have you ever noticed that a website which has nothing to do with you and yet still sends a lot of traffic your way? It seemed good. No matter how   smart Google gets, references to spam traffic won't be found on our Google Analytics reports yet.  If  you  look  to  obscure  irrelevant  sources,  showing  several  irrelevant traffic  sources  sending  “visitors”  to  a  site,  you’ll  see,  the  recommended visitors  don't  stay  on  the  site  for  a  second  and  start  manufacturing  them immediately.  All traffic is referral spam traffic. If you happen to notice that a website with a high authority  which has no backlinks to your website  is sending you traffic, it is almost always referral spam. Any URL can be used as a Referral Source.  How do you know if a site is sending spam traffic: if you come across a website  that  sends  you  traffic  without  linking  to  you,  it's  a  spam recommendation.  The problem with spam traffic is that these are not the visitors you want to bring to your website. In most cases, they are not real visitors at all. These are spam webmaster utility bots that land on your website and bounce back.  If spambots spoof traffic on your website and are reported in your Google Analytics data, your data will become inaccurate. You will also find that the average  bounce  rate  of  your  website  gets  very  high  due  to  this  traffic generated by the bot.  What makes such a discrepancy possible? Google Analytics has a bug that allows spam referrers to send fake traffic  to your website and show the traffic data in your analytics reports.  There are two ways to fix the spam forward traffic problem: Before you begin troubleshooting spam forwarding traffic, I have some good news and some bad news. The only thing you can do is to prevent spam redirect traffic from showing up in your future Google Analytics data. There is no way to clean up historical data.  Work  is  also  being  done  to  block  traffic  accidents.  Anytime  you  see  a ghost reference, block it so it doesn't show up in your data and doesn't affect your search results. Method 1: Block known bots  Google  recognizes  the  problem  with  spam  traffic  and  provides  a   webmaster tool option in Google Analytics that allows you to block hits from known traffic bots.  To find this feature you need to click on the "Admin" tab after logging into  your  Google  Analytics  account.  If  your  Google  Analytics  account  has multiple properties  websites , select the website you want to fix and click on the Show settings option.  On the next page you should see the option "Exclude all hits from known  bots and spiders". Activate the option and save your new settings.  This  option  would  be  the  best  solution  to  the  spam  traffic  problem  if Google  could  keep  up  with  the  new  and  latest  search  robots.  While  this option  is  not  100%  effective,  using  this  option  will  protect  much  of  your Google Analytics data from the effects of spoofed traffic. Method 2: block domains referring spam one by one  This method requires you to select and block one spam redirect at a time. To block a spam transfer, first select it by going to the Referrals option on the Collection tab.  Another  way  to  fix  the  referral  problem  with  spam  traffic  is  to  create filters to exclude the referrals from the spam traffic. The problem with filters is  that  you  can  irreparably  damage  your  data  if  you  don't  set  the  filter configuration correctly.  So I suggest that you use the Recommendations Exclusion List option to  resolve this issue. 2. Duplicate the content  Have you heard of "Google's Duplicate Penalty"? I am sure you have. But  there  is  no  such  thing.  In  fact,  Google  understands  that  duplicate content  is  always  everywhere  on  the  web.  While  Google  doesn't  penalize websites  for  posting  duplicate  content,  it  does  penalize  those  who  do  for manipulating search engine rankings.  You  still  need  to  troubleshoot  any  duplicate  content  issues  on  your  website to keep search engine results from increasing. Why?  Because  if  Google  crawlers  go  to  different  URLs  on  your  website  and find identical information, you will lose valuable crawl cycles. As a result, the  crawlers  do  not  have  enough  resources  to  crawl  your  newly  published content.   The  most  common  cause  of  duplicate  content  issues  is  that  multiple versions  of  the  same  URL  deliver  the  same  content  to  search  engine  bots. While there are several methods you can use to diagnose duplicate content problems,  the  Screaming  Frog  tool  works  best  when  it  comes  to  detecting problems caused by multiple URLs in your web design.  Screaming Frog searches your website like a search engine bot and shows you your website exactly as the search engine bots see it. Download a copy of the Screaming Frog Webmaster Tool to find duplicate content issues. After installation enter the url of your site and run the program. When crawling is complete, click the URL tab and select the Duplicate filter.  Screaming  Frog  pulls  all  the  different  versions  of  the  same  URL  from  your site.  www .  To solve the problem with duplicate content: Method 1: Always mark your preferred URL  Set your preferred URL version in Google Webmasters  www v   s non-  If Google finds a website that is linked to a non-WWW version of your website  and  you  have  set  your  preferred  version  as  the  WWW  version, Google will treat the link URL as the WWW version.  So choose the WWW or the non-WWW version of your website and set it  in your Google Webmaster Tools.  To do this, log into your Webmaster Tools and click the "Gear" settings icon in the top right. Now select the Site Settings option. Then choose your preferred URL format. You can also set up 301 redirects to let Google and users know your preferences. Method 2: Use the canonical Rel = tag  If you have the same content on different URLs, or if you're concerned that  tracking  parameters,  backlinked  websites,  and  common  link  sharing inconsistencies  could  lead  to  duplicate  content  issues,  consider  using  the canonical tag.  When a search bot goes to a page and sees the canonical tag, it gets the link to the original source. All links to the double page are counted as links to the original page. So you don't lose SEO value through these links. Method 3: use the noindex tag   Using  the  NoIndex  tag  is  another  effective  way  to  combat  duplicate content issues. When Google bots come across a page with the Noindex tag, they won't index that page.  If you use the following tag in addition to the NoIndex tag, you can also ensure  that  not  only  is  the  page  NOT  indexed,  but  that  Google  is  not degrading the value of the links to or from this page.  To add the NoIndex or Follow tags to a page, you can copy and paste the following  line  of  code  into  your  page's  head  tag:  <Meta  Name  =  "Robots" Content = "noindex, follow">  The  title  tag  and  the  alt  tag  are  not  affected  by  this  webmaster  tool  in  order to better optimize the crawling results. 3. Wrong schedule  With schema markers, Google can provide extensive snippets. However,  due  to  schema  marker  spam,  many  SERPs  only  show  large  snippets and no organic results are shown.  SearchEngineLand's Barry Schwartz discussed this issue when citing the quality of search results when searching for the keyword "Hotels in Madrid". You can search for yourself to realize how misuse  rather than overuse  of schema markup results in poor search results. Try searching. If you did, answer this question: Do you see the problem?  As  Google  and  Schwartz  discovered,  several  hotels  have  misused  Google's markup support for extensive snippets to rate their hotels.  Google does not name "Hotels in Madrid" a specific article and therefore the scheme cannot be applied to it. Google is right. It's a simple search term and people don't necessarily search for a specific Madrid hotel for which they want to see reviews and ratings.  Applying a schedule to try to score your landing page is an SEO practice  Google clarifies this in its post about comprehensive snippets for ratings  for on-page spam.  and reviews:  Review and rating tags should be used to provide rating and   or rating information  about  a  specific  item,  not  a  category  or  list  of  items.  For example,  'Hotels  in  Madrid',  'Summer  dresses'  or  'Cake  recipes'  are  not   specific items ...  If  you've  implemented  a  scheme  in  your  web  design  and  find  that  a simple  search  doesn't  get  Google  to  return  the  large  snippets  from  your website, then Google has probably penalized your website for spam schemes. Keep  in  mind  that  on-page  SEO  is  important,  but  padding  and  inappropriate use are usually captured by Google algorithms.  If it is indeed a Google penalty, you should see the message in the Google  Search Console.  How to fix the wrong schedule problem:  A.  To  implement  a  schema  on  your  website,  you  must  first  refer  to  Google's Structured Data Implementation Guidelines.  As  you  can  see,  Google  is  very  specific  about  where  the  schedule formatting can be applied. If you look at the example above, you can see that Google only supports Schema if it applies to a specific element and not generic key phrases.  B.  Run your code from the Google Structured Data Testing Tool.  After you have implemented a scheme on your website, the next step is to test it with the Google Structured Data Testing Tool. To test  your code,  you can  enter  the URL  of the  page you  applied  the scheme to, or you can copy and paste the code directly. The Structured Data Testing Tool flags any errors in your code.  C.  Check for problems in the Google Search Console.  If  there  is  something  wrong  with  your  structured  data,  you  should  see warning messages on your webmaster account. You can even test your site's schema directly  in Google's Structured Data Testing Tool  by clicking an item on the Structured Data page in Webmasters and clicking the Test Live Data button.  This will take you directly to the Google Structured Data Validation Tool.  4. Sudden interruptions in traffic  Traffic drops don't necessarily have to be a problem.   Sometimes it's just a seasonal or weekday effect. You may have noticed  that your traffic is a bit slow on weekends or in the summer.  The burglaries in which flags have to be raised are the steep ones. You should  be  able  to  spot  such  dramatic  lows  by  looking  at  your  Google Analytics traffic report.  To  confirm  that  this  isn't  some  unknown  slump  that  I  just  discussed, compare  your  data  to  data  from  the  same  period  over  the  past  few  weeks, months, or years. When you see a pattern, instead of worrying, investigate the possible ones.  If you've been following my traffic on my personal blog, you'll notice that  I reported a drop in traffic during the holiday season. But that was expected.  If it's not a seasonal drop and your traffic has actually decreased, it means you  made  a  mistake  with  your  analytics  tracking  code.  You  may  have installed  additional  analytics  software  that  is  not  working  properly  with Google Analytics.  A slump like this can also happen if you change your CMS theme or web design  template  and  forget  to  add  the  Google  Analytics  script  to  your  new setup.  The low traffic could also be due to Google penalizing your website. Note that if you discover the discrepancy in your data, you don't need to seek an algorithm update. Google is constantly introducing updates. How to review sudden, low traffic instances 1      First things first: check if your website has been penalized by Google.  To  do  this,  look  for  an  email  from  Google.  Penalty  warning  messages should also appear in the Google Search Console. You can find them by clicking  the  Search  Traffic  item  and  selecting  the  option  for  manual actions. Once you've confirmed you've been hit by a Google penalty, it's time to quickly resolve the issue and resubmit your website to the Google team.  2      If you've redesigned your website or changed your theme or web design template, check if you forgot to copy the Google Analytics script to the new theme or template.  3      Also check if you have changed your default URL structure. Failure to  set 301s or set it incorrectly can lead to a lot of traffic loss.   4      Check if your site has been hacked. 5           If  none  of  the  above  causes  the  root  cause,  your  website  may  be  the  victim of negative search engine optimization. The following are the hallmarks of a negative SEO attack:  Linked by spam anchor texts from multiple spam sites Having  your  reputation  sabotaged  on  social  media   often  via fake profiles  Removing valuable backlinks  The best protection against negative SEO is to stay vigilant. Select this option  to  receive  notifications  from  Google  Webmasters.  Keep  an  eye  on your social media mentions and keep an eye out for quality backlinks. 5. Outdated sitemaps  You  already  know  that  search  engines  love  sitemaps.  Sitemaps  help search engines understand the structure of your site and identify the links to crawl.  However,  as  a  website  ages,  a  lot  of  changes  are  made.  A  site  can undergo a complete restructuring, including a URL restructuring. Or maybe some parts of the site will be permanently removed.  If a sitemap is not updated, it will not show all important site updates. As a  result,  search  engines  may  come  across  broken  links  or  crawl  irrelevant parts of your website.  To avoid this, you must create an updated sitemap and resubmit it through the Google Search Console. You can also use a dynamic sitemap generator  which is constantly updated as you make changes to your site .  Google  has  recommended  a  list  of  tools  you  can  use  to  create  XML sitemaps. There are several free and paid options. You can choose one and create  an  updated  sitemap  then  resubmit  it  to  Google's  search  engine algorithms. 6. Incorrect use of UTM parameters  Do  you  use  UTM  parameters  such  as  campaign  source,  name  and  medium to measure your marketing ROI?  I'm sure you do.   But  do  you  know  that  these  UTM  parameters  are  not  intended  to  track  internal links?  I've seen so many people use UTM parameters to track the performance of marketing items on the page, such as promo bars, sidebars, and banners that link to different parts of their websites.  For example, let's say someone lands on your blog using Google search. He  or  she  then  navigates  to  the  shopping  area  of  your  website  via  the  menu item "Shop" in the top navigation of your website.  When  Google  Analytics  reports  the  source  of  this  visitor,  it  reports  "Home" rather than "Google Search of Organic".  If you use UTM parameters for internal link tracking, you overwrite the real data. As in the case above, you registered this visitor incorrectly when accessing  the  homepage.  Over  time,  improper  use  of  UTM  parameters  can ruin your raw data. Instead of using UTM parameters to track internal links  clicks , you can use events triggered by specific user actions.  How events work: To define an event, you need to add a little code to each action using the  onclick attribute.  Sitepoint explains it this way: "The onclick event handler records a click event  with  the  user's  mouse  button  on  the  element  to  which  the  onclick attribute is applied."  Simply put, the onclick feature lets you create an event for all clickable  elements on your page.  Having  a  simple  HTML  site  makes  it  easy  to  keep  track  of  how  users interact with your site because you can easily find the relevant links in your code and make the changes.  However, when using a CMS, tracking clicks can be challenging. I tried to find a plug and play solution for you but couldn't find one that I trusted. You need the help of a developer to configure it correctly.  The same goes for click tracking on other elements. This is where heat map tools like CrazyEgg can be very helpful. Along with all the other things these tools can do, they show you the different items on your website that are clicked.   If  you  don't  stop  tracking  internal  clicks  with  UTM  parameters,  your  Google Analytics data will be deleted. 7. Speed issues  In 2010, Google officially considered speed - the loading time of a page - as  a  ranking  factor.  Search  engines  penalize  slow-loading  pages  and  web designs.  In its official blog post on increasing page speed to a rank factor, Google said  that  speed  not  only  improves  user  experience,  but  studies  have  shown that having a fast website also lowers a website's running costs.  No matter how much you tweak your website, there are always ways to  improve it.  Before I show you how to increase the speed of your website, I want to share  with  you  a  few  tools  that  you  can  try  to  analyze  your  website's performance in terms of speed.  Once you know the current status of your website, you can try following the speed tips one by one and see how each of them improves your website speed. Tools for testing the speed of a site:  Page Speed: This is the Google tool that website owners can use to measure the performance of their websites. In addition to the speed statistics, Page Speed also provides insights that website owners  can  use  to  improve  the  loading  times  of  their  websites and give them a positive search engine performance. Pingdom Website Speed Test: As with page speed, the Pingdom Website Speed Test can measure your website's performance and get actionable tips on how to optimize it. YSlow:  Yslow  is  another  page  performance  testing  tool  that shows your website's performance against various performance criteria  defined  by  Yahoo!  To  test  your  site  with  YSlow,  you need to install the add-on in your web browser. After you get the add-on, go to your site and launch the add-on. WebPageTest:  The  WebPageTest  tool  also  measures  the  speed performance of your website.   In  addition  to  the  important  speed  metrics,  the  WebPageTest  tool  also creates  an  optimization  checklist  that  lists  all  correctly  configured  and missing items. Fixing these issues can speed up your website.  Before you start optimizing your website, search engines say you should know where to start. So, run your site through some of these tools and see how your sites behave in them before making any changes.  Tips to improve the speed of your website: Tip  1  -  Optimize  Images:  Nothing  slows  down  a  website  more  than  heavy images. Keep images under 100KB so they don't bloat your website.  Use  the  JPEG  format  too.  Use  the  PNG  format  only  if  you  absolutely  need a transparent background.  I've already shown you how Screaming Frog works  see point 2 . In the previous point, we looked at duplicate content issues. This time, we'll apply the filter to images and search for images larger than 100KB.  Now that you have a list of all the images you need to compress, you can  safely use one of the many image compression tools available online.  If you run a WordPress site you can use a plugin like WPSmush that can  be used to optimize any image you upload to your media library.  Tip 2 - Remove Unused Plugins: Another method you can use to keep your  website  running  fast  is  to  remove  all  unused  products  from  your  web design. This includes unused themes as well as plugins.  Quite  often,  website  owners  only  switch  off  the  things  they  don't  need. Deactivated  products  do  not  load  resources,  but  are  obsolete.  Outdated products can pose security risks and potential performance issues.  Tip  3  -  Avoid  Redirects:  Redirects  generate  more  HTTP  requests  and slow down a site. Redirects are often used to resolve duplicate content issues. However, staying consistent with your URL structure from the start will  create fewer duplicate URLs and require fewer redirects.  Tip  4  -  Optimize  your  area  above  the  fold  first:  If  you've  been following the trend, you may have noticed that more and more websites are using large images in their fold areas. These images often take a long time to load and result in a poor user experience.  Before you start optimizing the rest of your website, it's a good idea to   take a look at how to make your crease area load faster in search engines.  Other issues that cause the folding area to load slowly include third-party widgets,  services,  style  sheets,  and  more.  To  fix  all  these  issues,  load  your main content before loading other items like the sidebar.  Also use inline formatting with small CSS files. Try to create an external style  sheet  only.  To  create  multiple  style  sheets,  a  web  browser  must download all of them before data can be viewed.  Tip  5  -  Enable  compression:  Using  gzip  compression  can  reduce  the size of the transmitted response by up to 90%. To enable gzip compression on your web server, you need to contact your web host. In most cases, you can  find  help  by  doing  a  simple  search  like  [hosting  provider]  +  gzip compression.  If you're using managed WordPress hosting, your web host may already  have GZIP compression enabled by default.  Tip  6  -  Shrink  Resources:  If  you  manage  your  site  using  any  of  the performance measurement tools mentioned above, you will find that one of the most common suggestions is to shrink resources.  To  shrink  resources,  you  need  to  compress  your  HTML,  CSS,  and  JS  code.  If you don't have technical knowledge, you may need some help using the various compressors and services that compress and optimize your code for faster performance.  To shrink HTML, you can use a tool such as HTML Compressor. For the HTML compressor, you need to enter your site's source code. A  downloadable HTML file is then generated with the compressed code.  To  minimize  CSS,  you  can  use  CSS  Compressor.  After  you've  copied your original CSS code and done the compression, CSS Compressor will give you a compressed version of your code. CSS Compressor also shows you the number of bytes the compressed code has stored.  JSCompress  is  a  good  tool  for  minimizing  JavaScript.  To  get  your optimized JS code, you need to copy your original JS code and send it to the program.  Like  CSS  Compressor,  JSCompress  displays  the  amount  of  data that the compression has stored.  If  you  use  a  standard  theme  or  template,  your  design  can  consist  of   multiple files. So I recommend that you contact a developer for optimization. If  you  don't  do  this  carefully,  you  can  damage  your  theme  and  website.  A good way to do this is to contact the topic store and ask them to show you exactly how to minimize the resources in their topic. 8. Thin content  Flat pages or pages with thin content are usually considered by Google as  poor quality content.  People often confuse thin content with websites or pages with little text. But  that's  how  Google  sees  it  now.  With  thin  content,  Google  refers  to  all websites that offer little or no original value and little to no on-page SEO.  If you scratch content or only publish aggregated posts and often just re process  what's  already  available,  Google  may  assume  you're  posting  poor quality content on your website.  If  Google  finds  that  your  website  offers  thin  content,  Google  may  take action against certain pages with poor content quality, or take action against the entire website.  Google specifically lists the following types of thin content:  A  Automatically generated content  As you can see, auto-generated content is content created by a program. If you are not writing an entirely new post, but simply copying it and rotating it with a program, your content will be considered spam.  Google can recognize examples of content generated by the program. In the example above, you are actually creating spun content. However, instances  of  thin  content  aren't  always  executed  maliciously,  but  they  will negatively  impact  your  search  results.  For  example,  if  you  have  a  website with  content  in  English  and  later  want  to  offer  a  Spanish  version  of  your website,  you  could  simply  paste  your  content  into  a  tool  like  Google Translator to produce the Spanish version of your content.  This content is also considered auto-generated content and Google may  Bottom line: Any content that has not been human-created, reviewed, or  consider it spam content.  revised is considered thin content. B  Contents of the heating plate   Almost  every  blog  these  days  participates  in  affiliate  programs.  There's  nothing wrong with that.  However, when many websites review the same product, they eventually publish  the  product  description.  You  can't  really  avoid  using  the  product description when describing a product because users may want to know more about its specifications.  However,  this  problem  becomes  severe  when  Google  finds  the  same content across the connected network. The product description behaves like standard text that offers no added value for the user. Simply put, they become examples of duplicate content.  I am assuming that you also participate in some affiliate programs. So I recommend adding your personality and unique perspective every time you promote an affiliate product.  As  Google  Webmasters  puts  it:  "Good  partners  create  added  value  by offering,  for  example,  original  product  reviews,  ratings  and  product comparisons." C  Scrapped content  Google doesn't appreciate content removal. If you do not post original content on your website and simply publish content from other websites or slightly modified content from other websites  spun content , Google may take action against you.  If you need to republish excerpts or quotes from your favorite pages, you can.  However,  your  website  may  contain  ONLY  PUBLISHED  CONTENT without original knowledge. D  Door opening sides  Doorway  pages  are  pages  made  to  rank  for  specific  questions.  These pages attempt to manipulate search engine rankings by ranking on certain key phrases and driving traffic to the intended page.  To see if a page on your website looks like a Google landing page, it's a  good idea to see if the page offers real value. If so, you're fine.  If you notice that the page is only driving organic traffic to another page of your site, or that users need to take some action  like subscribe to your list  to get the value from that page, your page could be considered a door page.   Conclusion  Whether you have a few SEO issues or dozens, you should try to address them  one  by  one.  Of  course  you  cannot  reach  everyone  immediately. However, ignoring them will only cause more problems in the long run.  I know I used to have issues with Quick Sprout's page speed and ended up doing nothing about it. But when that was resolved, I saw search traffic increase by 30%. That is a great victory. But technically I should have had this extra traffic for years ... I just ignore my load time stats.  I  hope  you  are  now  ready  to  fix  some  of  the  most  common   and  frustrating  SEO issues on your website.   BONUS  FREE GOOGLE ADS WORKBOOK 2021: THE  ULTIMATE GUIDE TO MASTER ADVERTISING AND  MARKETING ON GOOGLE   BONUS CHAPTER 1  TOP 4 REASONS TO ADVERTISE ON  GOOGLE ADS  Unlike many popular marketing tactics in the digital world, advertising isn't free:  You  can  post  on  social  media,  build  your  brand,  and  connect with influencers even without spending a dime. You  can  write  new  content  and  increase  organic  search  traffic without ever removing your credit card or paying huge bills. You can create new YouTube videos for free and build a highly engaged audience.  But  with  advertising  it  is  always  worth  playing  a  landscape  in  which  money can be lost in days or weeks.  Google Ads may have time and money risks, but it's worth it. Here are the top three reasons why you should advertise on Google. Reason 1: Google is the most popular search network and has a high average ROI  Google dominates almost every aspect of the online world. Even  offline  in  everyday  life,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  spend  a  day  without saying  or hearing someone say : "Just googling".  When it comes to other search engines, they simply cannot be compared  in terms of user base and loved one success.  According to MarketShare, Google dominates the search engine market  with more than 73% of users worldwide.  It  is  by  far  the  most  widely  used  search  engine  out  there,  dominating  competitors like Yahoo and Bing!  And when it comes to advertising, you need a platform that reaches even the  most  segmented  and  specific  audiences,  unless  you're  a  large  company selling products that appeal to everyone.   Nothing compares to Google when it comes down to it. Not only is Google a great way to reach your target audience and a wide range of demographics, but it's also great for getting a high return on your investment.  According  to  Google  surveys  and  their  Economic  Impact  Report, advertisers on the platform generate an average of $ 2 for every US dollar spent. That's an average of double your investment.  With  the  help  of  this  guide,  you  can  implement  tactics  to  improve  that  ROI even further! Reason 2: Google Ads offers different ad options for every business model and purpose  Google Ads is far from a one-trick show pony. Any business in any industry can thrive if it offers a variety of features. Do you want to stay only text-based ads in Google search results? No problem. You can start showing search ads in seconds. Do you want to see your local business on Google Maps? You can do that easily too. Good at making videos that showcase your business? Advertise on YouTube with Google TrueView.  The options are almost endless, you can run campaigns using:  Gmail YouTube Google search results Maps Partner websites Mobile app downloads Phone call only and more.  Remarketing helps you bring back people who didn't buy from you the  first time.  For example, if they click your ads but don't buy or fill out a form, it's   easy to start a new campaign for those specific users.  In short, Google Ads can be successful for any type of business.  Reason 3: Google Ads makes quick sales with less work  For  social  media,  you  have  to  start  from  scratch.  No  followers,  shares,  likes or re tweets.  It  is  extremely  difficult  to  keep  track  of  your  social  media  and  build  active and consistent engagement.  Unless  you  already  have  followers  or  an  extremely  popular  website,  it  will take months, if not years, to generate social engagement.  Likewise, SEO isn't an overnight hack or an accidental growth tip. It's a  marketing tactic that takes months to thrive.  You need to find keywords, create content, optimize your entire website,  and whatever else you want to do.  Even then, you are competing with thousands of other companies for the same keyword. Your content should be top notch, have tons of approvals and backlinks, and be updated regularly.  And only after you've done this can you expect noticeable results in six  months to a year.  Bottom  line:  Most  digital  marketing  tactics  don't  deliver  overnight success.  There  is  one  big  exception  however:  pay-per-click  marketing  with Google Ads.  You can start a Google Ads campaign and start generating real sales in  minutes.  And that's no bad luck with snake oil. No one is paid to run Google Ads. With Google Ads, you can sell immediately at the start of a campaign. How? Intention.  What is the purpose of Google Ads?  In essence, intent can be inferred by examining keywords. For example, if someone is looking for a “TV Buying Guide,” they probably aren't ready to buy anything, right? Law.  This keyword is an indication that they want to compare products and do  not want to buy yet.   However, "60-inch flat screen smart TV" is a higher intention keyword that  indicates  that  a  potential  customer  is  about  to  make  a  purchase.  This keyword indicates that the user has done his research. You know what you want.  And  according  to  the  latest  research,  high-intent  keywords  are  almost always  driven  by  ad  clicks,  not  organic  searches!  If  you  focus  your  SEO strategy on keywords near the purchase, it won't do anything.  For this you need Google Ads. By  bidding  keywords  in  Google  Ads,  you  know  which  keywords  are  driving near direct sales.  Search  engine  optimization  requires  you  to  create  a  funnel  that  fits  the buyer's journey. You need to plan content, keywords and main magnets to get them in the funnel and heat them up for conversion.  However, with Google Ads, you can take advantage of searches that are  already in the funnel. For example: plumbers in my area.  Rest assured that someone looking for a plumber will need one as soon as possible. By ranking your  1 ad, you can be sure to get their attention first and chances are you will make a sale without looking at them first.  This is the power and purpose of Google Ads. All you need is a high quality ad and landing page to increase sales. It's  a  lot  less  work  than  producing  content  and  planning  your  SEO  strategy.  You don’t believe me? Fair enough. Now I want to give you one more  great reason to use Google Ads! Reason 4: let's look at some data  According  to  Brian  Dean,  Backlinko's  SEO  expert,  content  marketing posts that contain organic traffic must have at least 1,890 words to rank first. Media shows that it takes an average of more than three hours to write an  average blog post with just 1000 words.  This means that it will take six hours to write your standard 2,000 word  blog post, which is required for the first page rating.  And just because you write content doesn't mean you come first.   Everyone writes content. Millions of posts are published daily. You'll also need social shares, backlinks, and domain permissions. All of this is painfully hard to come by.  Conclusion:  PPC  in  Google  Ads  can  generate  sales  much  faster  than  SEO. While both are great strategies, SEO takes longer.  Do you want a quick sale? It's time to start using Google Ads. Read  on  to  learn  more  about  how  Google  Ads  works  and  how  to  get  started today!   BONUS CHAPTER 2  HOW DOES GOOGLE ADS WORK?  You have undoubtedly heard of Google Ads before. That's why you're here. However, you still can't figure out how Google Ads is generating customers for your business.  Google Ads is difficult to explain. Some make it too simple, others make  it too hard.  from advertising in Google Ads.  your ads against competitors.  This section explains exactly how Google Ads works and what to expect  We  will  break  down  the  different  ad  networks,  options  and  ranking  of  Here's everything you need to know about how Google Ads really works. Google networks: let’s see what they are and what they really mean  If you are not familiar with Google Ads, it is currently divided into two different  Google  networks,  each  with  different  advertising  options  to  suit your goals:  Search network Display network  The Search Network contains ad pages such as the actual search results on  Google,  other  Google  properties  such  as  Google  Maps  and  Google Shopping, and partner sites on Google that display text ads.  Likewise, direct products can show up in a specific Google search, such as:  this  particular  4k  LED  TV  search.  This  is  Google  Shopping,  another entity of the Search Network. If you search for local businesses on Google or even directly on Google Maps, you may also see ads.  On  the  other  hand,  the  display  network  focuses  on  non-text  based platforms  and  advertising  methods,  such  as  the  search  network.  We  mean platforms such as YouTube, Gmail and thousands of partner sites on Google. If  you  ever  browse  YouTube  and  see  ads,  this  is  the  Display  Network.  If   you're browsing Gmail and see ads in your inbox, it's the Display Network. Have  you  ever  noticed  image  ads  in  the  sidebar  or  headers  of  a  website you've  crawled?  These  are  ads  on  Google  Partner  sites  in  the  Display Network! To give you an example of how Google Ads works, contact Google directly for a simple search.  I am looking for a new camping tent for the summer. When I search for it, I find Google Shopping ads promoting websites that sell tents. When I scroll down  it  also  shows  a  map  of  other  places  that  tents  are  sold.  Since  I'm interested, I'll click on the ad that catches my eye to see what it has to offer. After the click, the advertiser pays a few dollars for my click in the hopes that I will convert. On their landing page  see above  I explore the products and buy one.  That's  Google  Ads  in  a  nutshell.  It's  all  about  serving  ads  based  on keywords or audiences and then using compelling ads and landing pages to get someone to buy from you.  What  if  someone  doesn't  buy  anything  from  you?  You  are  using  remarketing! What is Google Ads Retargeting?  Remarketing   also  known  as  retargeting   is  sending  another  marketing message,  in  this  case  ads,  to  users  who  have  already  interacted  with  your previous ads but haven't converted them.  You bring them back for a second chance to increase sales. Fortunately, Google has great remarketing software and custom audience  options for that.  For the display network, advertisers can target audiences or keywords by  showing their ads on websites that are visited by potential customers.  From there, it works just like the Search Network: click the ad and buy. Now that you have the network under control, it's time to learn how your  ads are served and how you rank on the paid network. How do you rank in Google Ads?  If you search on Google, you will likely find that ads appear in the correct  order, just like organic search results.  Depending on your position, this can have a significant impact on traffic.   Obviously, it is better to be in the top four positions than the bottom of  the page.  Ad  Rank,  a  value  created  by  Google,  determines  the  position  in  which your  ads  appear.  But  how  do  you  do  that?  What  factors  play  a  role  in  ad position? The most important factors in ad position are:  Bid amount: A higher bid means higher placements. However, it is not enough to just place high bids. Quality  of  the  Ads  during  the  Auction:  Quality  Score   more below  Search context: location, device, time, etc. related to your ads. Is your ad the best choice, based on the target audience and your current offer? Consequences  for  Ad  Extensions:  How  Much  Are  Your  Ad Extensions Improving? More = better. Higher click-through rates create more impact.  Google says, "Even if your competition has higher bids than yours, highly  relevant keywords and ads can get you higher for a lower price."  Bidding  is  not  essentially  everything.  Sure,  higher  bids  will  put  you higher than most. However, if you want to get first or second place, you have to consider all of the above factors.  Your  ads  should  have  high-quality  results,  consistent  contextual  information, and above-average click-through rates. What exactly is the Google Ads Quality Score?  Quality  Score  is  a  rank  from  1  to  10   with  ten  being  the  best   for  the performance of each ad or keyword. It's an overall score to give you an idea of how good you are. Currently the quality factor consists of three different parts:  Expected CTR: What is the average CTR for your space? If you are  above  average,  you  can  expect  a  better  Quality  Score  than most. Ad relevance: How specific are your ads? Do the offer and the   call to action make sense for your advertising? If your ads say "Visit Now" but you only sell products online, your ad relevance is low. Landing  Page  Experience:  Does  your  landing  page  convey  the same information as your ads? Same offer? The same keyword? If not, your Quality Score is likely low.  These three factors are all crucial to get a higher Quality Score and, in  turn, to convert more users. Why is the quality factor important?  Combined  in  the  ad  position,  your  Quality  Score  is  a  function  of  your position.  You  can't  just  bid  high.  They  also  need  to  have  a  good  Quality Score.  Quality factors are simple, straightforward measures that tell you whether you  are  doing  the  right  thing  or  the  wrong  thing  in  optimizing  your campaigns.  The  higher  your  Quality  Score,  the  cheaper  your  clicks  and  the  final  acquisition cost.   BONUS CHAPTER 3  HOW TO SETUP YOUR GOOGLE ADS  ACCOUNT  You now know how Google Ads works. And you know the top three reasons why advertising on Google Ads is worth your time, money, and effort.  Now is the time to start making money and creating your free Google Ads  account to get started as soon as possible.  In this section, we'll walk you through the installation process, help you choose  between  Google  Ads  and  Smart  Campaigns,  and  show  you  the  key factors that most users miss during the installation process that are affecting their progress and ad potential.  So without further ado, set up your account for success.  Google Ads or Smart Campaigns?  If you try to sign up for a new Google Ads account, you will find that you can  switch  to  Expert  Mode   Google  Ads   or  continue  creating  your  Smart Campaigns account  formerly AdWords Express .  What is it? How is it different from Google Ads? That's what this section is  about.  In  short,  Smart  Campaigns  is  a  simplified,  automated  version  of Google  Ads,  where  Google  does  most  of  the  work.  It  is  only  available  to local  businesses  with  retail  stores  or  an  online  E-Commerce  store.  If  you don't have a stationary or online shop, you can't use intelligent campaigns.  It can get complicated quickly with Google Ads. If  you  look  at  a  standard  dashboard  you  will  understand  that  it  is complex, with dozens of sections with different statistics, reports, and more. It can take a long time each week. Smart Campaigns is best for users who:  Are brand new in PPC advertising Are time or resources limited Own a business and want to generate extra income without much   work  But be careful: Smart Campaigns is very simplified. After a while, you will likely find that at some point your sales stall and there is little room for improvement in performance.  Google  Ads  has  so  many  features  to  improve  your  account  that  Smart  Campaigns don't.  If you're new to paid search or are short on time, Smart Campaigns is a great way to get started. Sooner or later, you'll likely find yourself needing to switch to the full Google Ads experience.  In fact, most PPC marketers who have used both claim that Google Ads is  much more effective than smart campaigns  Smart campaigns are great for very small edits. If you run a small store with  few   or  even  zero   employees  next  to  you,  Smart  Campaigns  is  a lifesaver!  Since Google does most of the work, you can generate great sales without  sacrificing your "free time". Create your free Google Ads account in just five minutes  If  you  don't  want  to  create  a  free  Google  Ads  account  just  yet,  go  to https:  ads.google.com home   and  sign  in  with  your  email  address  and website URL.  Next,  you'll  likely  notice  a  whole  host  of  overwhelming  set-up  factors  that you're not even sure about  For example budgets, targeting, bidding and already writing a text ad. Let us guide you through the most important factors here. Start small for your budget first. You can raise it anytime from here and  the initial stages will always be random.  Set  a  comfortable  budget  that  will  allow  you  to  get  traffic  and  conversions without breaking the bank  Start choosing your target audience by choosing the destinations. Do you only sell products to the US? Choose that. Are your products sold  worldwide?  Select "All Countries and Territories".  When choosing networks, as mentioned earlier, choose the networks that   you want to focus on the most.  I recommend that you choose both as you can easily change this later and you  will  likely  want  to  use  Display  Network  for  remarketing  in  the  near future.  Finally, for keywords, type in some that you want to focus on related to  your business or specific products that you want to sell.  Let  Google  Ads  automatically  set  your  initial  keyword  bids  for  which bids  bidding options and detailed bidding instructions can be found in a later chapter .  Your  daily  budget  stays  the  same,  and  Google  Ads  never  spends  more  than you set. So don't worry!  Then write a simple text ad and click Next. After  you've  entered  your  payment  and  clicked  Next,  your  Google  Ads  account is active and ready to use.  Voila! That's it. Remember:  you  can  edit  all  of  this  later!  We'll  walk  you  through  campaign setup including ads, keywords, and more.  However,  before  you  start  a  campaign,  there  are  a  few  more  critical  factors that are most overlooked when setting up an account. Critical factor 1: Linking Google Analytics  This is an important way to generate better reports and data that will help  you make better marketing decisions.  Without  them,  you  can't  compare  the  success  of  paid  search  results  to  organic or social traffic.  In  addition,  Analytics  has  better  call  tracking  data  than  Google  Ads,  making it a great addition to call-based campaigns.  To  link  Google  Analytics,  navigate  to  your  "Linked  Accounts"  in  the Toolbox. Here select the Google Analytic option and follow the instructions you see to link your accounts.  Now  that  you  have  linked  Analytics,  it's  time  for  one  final  step:  UTM  codes. Critical Factor 2: Use UTM Codes   UTM codes, also known as Urchin Tracking Module, are a link format  used by Google to track certain details within a normal link.  For example, you can use UTM codes to track data such as keywords that  triggered the click, campaigns, ad groups, and more.  Using this specific data, you can better analyze your traffic and its origin. In combination with Google Analytics links, you have a powerhouse of  Without UTM codes, your analysis would simply say "Paid Search". And  data.  that doesn't help anyone.  Sounds good, right? Absolutely, but they often come with a problem: Installation  and  use  is  a  hassle,  especially  if  you  are  creating  multiple landing  pages.  UTM  codes  can  be  created  with  Google's  UTM  tool. However, creating more than a few new links takes a lot of time.  Re-entering  all  your  data,  such  as  source,  medium,  name,  terms  and content, can be a frustrating experience. And Google Ads is complex enough. But luckily there is a semi-secret hack as soon as you apply UTM codes. How?  By  applying  them  directly  in  Google  Ads  at  the  campaign  level  instead of the final URL of each individual ad.  To do this, go to the "Campaign Settings" section of your dashboard in  your account, select all your campaigns and click "Edit".  The  editing  menu  will  open.  Select  "Change  Tracking  Templates"  to  continue.  You should now see a box that says "Set Tracking Template". Here  you  can  paste  the  following  code  in  this  field:  “?match  type= {match  type}  &  network=  {network}  &  device=  {device}  &  adpositio  = {adposition} & keyword= {keyword}”  This  code  can  track  your  match  types,  keywords,  device,  network,  and  your ad position.  UTM process again.  in just two minutes.  If you set up new campaigns now, you will never have to worry about the  You can sit back, relax and watch analytics fill with priceless data set up   Next up: conversion tracking.  Set up conversion tracking  and why you need it   After you've linked Google Analytics and you've finished setting up your  account, it's time for one final setup element: conversion tracking.  Conversion tracking is relatively simple: Set up scripts on your website so Google Ads can track how many people  are shopping from you.  While this process seems simple by nature, most people don't understand how it works, how to set it up properly, or why they need it in the first place. A survey of more than 2,000 Google Ads accounts found that only 29%  of accounts had conversion tracking in place.  72% of accounts had no conversion tracking or were set up incorrectly,  resulting in erroneous and unreliable data and reports.  This is not good. Without  proper  conversion  tracking,  you  will  essentially  go  blind.  You  put money into something without knowing how it worked.  Let's go over a scenario with you.  Titolo  You have just created your account. You can be running new campaigns in no time and spending $ 500 a day on Google Ads. Until you look at your reports and data and determine that you haven't generated any conversions.  How? No conversion tracking. Of course there have been real conversions and sales. But how many were from Google Ads? How high are your acquisition costs? You have no idea if you are even profitable.  Conversion  tracking  is  one  of  the  most  important   if  not  the  most  important  factors for a successful Google Ads account.  How do you set it up? It's easy. Go to the conversion section of your dashboard. Choose the blue "+" button to make a new conversion. From here you can choose from four types of conversions:   Website: Track conversions on your website, store, etc. App: Keep track of how many people download your app Phone: Record the number of phone calls your ads are making Import: Import your own conversions  not recommended unless you already have great third-party conversion tracking software  The most commonly used conversion tracking elements are most likely  website codes and phone call tracking.  It's a smart choice to give your conversion tracking element a name that  you recognize easily in relation to your campaign.  Then select the category of your conversion. Is it a buy or a direct sale? A form registration? A generalized lead? Here's  your  chance  to  pinpoint  exactly  what  a  conversion  is  for  each  campaign you run.  Regarding the value, you can choose not to choose a value, choose the  same value, or use a specific value for each conversion  If  you  use  specific     different  values  for  each  sale   most  common  for online stores and ecommerce  you can follow Google's settings to adjust your tracking tags accordingly. Click here to continue. You have three different options for installing your new codes:  Self-installation  install the tag yourself  Email the tag to a webmaster Use the tag manager  To install it yourself, you need to install the Google Ads global site tag  first.  This  is  a  great  way  to  create  remarketing  lists  that  can  help  you  bring  back users who have treated you in previous marketing campaigns.  You must install this tag on every page of your website. Next, you want to install the "Event Snippet" that you just created when  you selected the value and type.  This  is  a  great  way  to  create  remarketing  lists  that  can  help  you  bring   back users who have treated you in previous marketing campaigns.  You have to install this tag on every page of your website. Next, you'll want to install the "Event Snippet" you just created when you  selected the Value and Type. Install your event snippet  method.  The  easiest  way  to  install  your  event  snippet  is  to  use  the  "load  page"  What is it? Essentially, you want to place this tag on a final destination, or just on the thank you page, not every page on your website like you did with the global tag.  This code applies to a page that customers land on after completing their  conversion campaign.  For  example,  if  someone  buys  a  product  from  your  online  store,  they should be directed to a thank you page after the purchase that only instructs buyers. This is where you place the event snippet.  This is a great way to ensure that the page loads and records only when  someone is buying from you!  This seemingly simple idea is easy to complicate or incorrectly install.  Let's recap to make sure you get the hang of it:  Global  Site  Tag:  Your  global  Google  Ads  tracking  script  that will be placed on every page of your website. Event  snippet:  Individual  conversion  tracking  scripts  that  you create for each campaign. These only go on thank you pages.  Congratulation!  You  just  installed  the  right  conversion  tracking  scripts.  Ready to search for keywords for your first campaign?   BONUS CHAPTER 4  HOW TO DO KEYWORD RESEARCH TO  START YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN  Keyword research is vital for the Google Ads search network.  In  order  for  your  ads  to  show,  you  need  to  target  and  bid  on  specific keywords  in  your  industry.  For  example,  if  you're  selling  handbags,  you might want to focus on general searches that real people do when they want to buy handbags.  However, often it is almost impossible to find the right keywords to bid  on without cutting your budget.  Especially when competitors dominate the top ads with higher bids than  In  this  section,  you  will  learn  about  the  pros  and  cons  of  keyword  you.  research  to get your campaign started right.  Start with the Google Keyword Planner  The best place to start keyword research for your campaigns is Google's  own keyword tool you can find in Google Ads itself.  Why?  Because  you  can  get  clear  suggestions  on  basic  topics  without  knowing much about keyword research at all.  For  example,  if  you've  never  searched  for  keywords  before,  it  can  be  difficult to know where to start.  When you start the Keyword Planner, you can enter subjects and phrases or even URLs from your own website  or others . Google will then take care of creating ideas for you.  First, enter a 1 to 3 word summary of your company, e.g. "Flower Shop" and  then  "Getting  Started".  There  you  will  find  a  full  list  of  the  curated keyword ideas.  This  new  list  contains  thousands  of  potential  keywords  for  your campaign.  But  it's  also  complex  when  it  comes  to  bid  information.  On  the   right side of your columns, focus on the following metrics:  Top of page bid  low  Bid for the top of the page  high   The  top  of  the  page  features  low  and  high.  These  are  the  amounts  you need to bid  per click  to get each keyword to be at the top of the first page or the bottom of the first page.  This will give you an idea of what to expect from keywords. Do you want to come first? You pay for something close by "Bid at the  top of the page  high ."  keywords that interest you.  Next,  see  the  average  monthly  search  and  competition  level  for  the  You want a combination of high and low volume keywords. In  general,  on  higher  average  monthly  searches,  most  keywords  have more competition. But they will also be general in nature and result in fewer sales.  Having a combination of both will give you specificity and a ton of traffic to play. The keyword  pun intended  is the analysis of the meaning behind the search.  Remarketing is less necessary when using keywords closer to the end of  the funnel, as you can expect more direct conversions.  More general terms like "TV reviews" clearly don't want to buy from you  just yet.  When choosing new keywords for your campaign, align them with your  goals. Before choosing a keyword, ask yourself the following questions:  Should this campaign generate new sales? Should it bring in new traffic and turn it into brand-aware leads that can later be converted into sales?  Always analyze the intent behind a keyword before running it. Assign keywords directly to your campaign goals. To sell more shoes in this campaign, target keywords listed in the funnel.   If you want to let people know about your shoe brand, try to find funnels.  Now that you've got a large list of potential keywords using the Keyword Tool, there are a few more tools that you can use to deepen potential ideas by researching your competition. How to use third-party tools to spy on your competition's keywords  The Keyword Planner is a good place to start for generating basic ideas  and getting a feel for keyword research.  But nothing beats spying on competitors and seeing which keywords they  are targeting and which are successful.  If you're not sure who your competitor is, do a simple Google search for a  keyword that you found using the Keyword Planner.  You  should  be  able  to  find  several  companies  that  are  bidding  on  the terms you are looking for. These are your competitors, and they likely have a ton of experience that you can steal with a few handy tools. Brand Search Terms: What are they and why you should bid on them?  Branded  search  terms  are  a  confusing  aspect  of  Google  Ads  that  will  likely return multiple answers depending on who you ask.  Brand terms are simply search terms   keywords with your brand name. The  general  dilemma  that  arises  when  discussing  branding  terms  is  usually how to pay for terms that click on your organic listings anyway.  Who wants to pay money for the clicks that are most likely to hit your bio  listing?  Nobody. But most of the time this is not the case. Not when competitors almost always bid on their own brand terms. If  you  search  for  almost  any  brand,  you  will  find  that  competitors  are exhausting  their  branding  terms  in  hopes  of  stealing  clicks  from  their business.  If  you're  not  bidding  on  your  own  branding  terms,  you're  opening  the  door to your competition to potentially target your leads and sales easily.  The positive side of branding terms is that they are dirt cheap. Due  to  the  naturally  higher  quality  values,  they  are  often  even  cheaper   than the keyword tools.  Since your website is all about branding, your Quality Score will be 8-10  with no extra work, reducing your costs while your competitors pay more.  Still not convinced? Check out this search if you're looking for the budget  car rental brand term.  Budget  comes  first  which  is  excellent.  But  their  competitor  offers  an  insane deal: 80% off compared to Budget's 35% offer.  Imagine that Budget does not run ads. It's likely that this other competitor  will steal tons of sales because of a better deal and no competition.  The fact is, brand terms are cheap and help you fend off the competition. Most of your brand clicks will go to organic lists anyway, which means you barely pay for them.  However, it is better to pay a few dollars for clicks than to lose potential  customers.   BONUS CHAPTER 5  HOW TO SETUP YOUR FIRST AD GROUP  AND WRITE NEW ADS  Unfortunately,  setting  up  your  account  in  Google  Ads  is  not  an easy process.  Creating and setting up your campaigns and ad groups are some of the most  important  factors  in  improving  your  CTR,  Quality  Score,  and  overall performance.  Using  the  wrong  configuration  will  make  it  difficult  to  manage  your account and campaigns. Additionally, writing high-quality ads in Google Ads can be tiring due to the limited drawing area.  If you are new to ad writing, this can quickly become frustrating. In this section, we'll help you set up your first ad group and how to write top Google ads. For step-by-step installation instructions and loads of formulas for writing  the best quality custom ads if you read on!  Set up an ad group: Individual keyword ad groups  SKAGs  When you start your first ad group in Google Ads, Google gives advice that  new  PPC  advertisers  can  easily  misinterpret:  "Start  with  10-20 keywords".  Did you see it? "Start with 10-20 keywords." Start with?? That's a lot of  keywords for an ad group. Way too many. Why? If  you  add  too  many  keywords  to  one  ad  group,  you  run  the  risk  of  showing ads that may not affect all of your keywords. Ad group success comes down to one key factor: specificity  If  your  ad  groups  contain  dozens  of  similar  keywords,  like  the  image  above, it still isn't specific enough.  If they are looking for size 6 dresses, they don't want to see an ad with   text  about  a  sleeveless  dress.  Although  these  keywords  are  contextually similar, they are still separated from each other.  Even simple changes between keywords will cost you potential sales. People want what they were looking for. Just what they were looking for. That's  why  Ad  Relevance  is  an  important  factor  in  calculating  your  Quality Score.  If you don't give searchers relevant ads, they'll click elsewhere. The best way to make sure that every ad you place will spark interest is to make your ad groups much easier. This creates separate keyword ad groups, also known as SKAGs.  If  you  use  one  keyword,  you  can  use  that  keyword  with  three  different  types of matches, like in the example above.  Broad match modifier: + keyword Search by phrase: "keyword" Exact keyword: [keyword]  Or you can get even more specific by using just one type of match. The choice  is  yours  and  many  PPC  experts  have  their  own  preferred  method. Personally,  I  have  had  a  lot  of  success  with  these  three  competition  types. They  work  well  together  to  combine  reach  and  relevance  while  delivering high quality results. And I'm not alone. ConversionXL improved a customer's Quality  Score  from  5  to  8  and  the  click-through  rate  increased  by  28.1% using SKAGs. Here's how to set up your ad group with a single keyword  All you need to do is drag and drop keywords from the list you set up earlier  in  this  guide  during  the  Keyword  Research  section  to  your  new  ad groups.  To do this, go to the Ad Groups section of your dashboard and create a new ad group. Give your ad group the name of the keyword you are using for that ad group for a clean, accessible account organization.  Next, you should see two more options: Keywords and Bidding. In the Keywords section, enter your keyword from the three match types described  earlier.  For  information  on  bids,  see  the  Google  Ads  Keyword   Planner  we  used  earlier.  Do  you  remember  the  specific  "Top  of  the  Page" metric?  Make this your default bid, also known as the maximum CPC for this ad  group.  This is the maximum cost that you will pay and that will put you in the running for the top spots on the first page results. Click "Save and Continue" and continue with the following steps! How to write 3-5 scale ads per ad group  Writing  ads  in  Google  Ads  is  a  strenuous  process.  You  have  character restrictions,  and  anything  that  is  convincing  in  a  brief  limitation  can  seem next to impossible.  That's why most people write an ad and move on. You just need a great ad, right? As Google suggests, you should always create specific ad groups with at  least three ads.  relevant.

Because  your  ad  groups  will  automatically rotate ads and show those that are performing the best.  It is essentially based on split tests that can help you optimize your ads,  value proposition, and call to action over time.  For example, while your first ad has a CTR of 2%, writing a new ad that is better and more engaging can increase the CTR up to 5%. Then you can use ad extensions in your next ad to get that CTR even higher.  This process will help you get the most out of your ads. But of course it  takes a bit more work.  the structure of a Google ad:  As you write your ads, you will discover a number of different factors in  Final URL: The destination that searchers go to when they click on your ads. Also called the landing page. Head 1: first head Header 2: Second header area   Display Path: 15 characters to customize how your URL looks to searchers Description: 80 characters to describe your offer The trick here is knowing what to include.  One of the best templates for writing dozens of Google ads in minutes is  simplification. Focus on the benefits, keywords, and a great call to action  Using your ad group keyword in your ad will help you learn more about  ad specificity and relevance.  Benefits are a great way to get users read and clicked. And your call to action is a great way to remind the seeker exactly what  to expect from them.  This simple but effective ad can be easily created for any keyword. From  here,  you  can  subtly  customize  the  ads  by  tweaking  your  call  to action and benefits to see which offers are most appealing to seekers in your field.  Try  different  discounts  or  offers  and  different  contact  methods,  e.g.  After creating your ads, you can use ad extensions to increase your click  Telephone calls.  through rate.  Step  3  of  the  Google  Ads  creation  process  allows  you  to  set  up  your  SKAG and then click the Create Ad button.  Now  you  can  quickly  test  any  part  of  your  ad  that  you  need.  In  this  example we are testing two different advantages over two different URLs.  Instead of having to create 1 ad three times, we now have all the ads we  need for our first test. Use ad extensions in Google Ads  Ad extensions are useful additional features in Google Ads that you can use  to  provide  additional  information  that  would  normally  not  fit  in  the limited drawing area of a Google ad.  For example things like additional links to your website. These related links can help you increase click-through rates by providing   potential searchers with alternative POIs.  If  they  don't  like  your  original  ad  text,  they  may  find  a  link  interesting  enough to click.  And according to Google, ad extensions can increase your click-through  rate by an average of 10 to 20%!  Ad extensions offer a variety of options to suit a dozen different purposes. For example, if you sell an online product, you can use review extensions  to display reviews and user reviews. Currently, Google Ads offers the following ad expansion options:  Location  extensions:  used  to  display  your  business  address, which can be great for promoting local retail sales and pedestrian traffic. Partner  Location:  If  you're  selling  products  with  third-party suppliers, you can check out local stores near a finder who sells your products. For example, if your goods are at the local Best Buy, this location will be displayed. Captions:  Add  extra  text  to  your  ads.  Ideal  for  coupons, discounts and calls to action. Calls: View your work phone number to make calls Message: Allow searchers to text your business about the ad Site-links: Add more site-links to relevant pages Price: Show the price of your product on the ad itself Apps: link to your application to download  After you write your first ad, you can apply ad extensions directly below  it.  Just select the ad extension you want to use and start building. Depending  on  the  extensions  you  use,  you  will  need  to  enter  business  information or link to direct URLs on your website.  Once done, click Save and you are ready to publish your ads live.   BONUS CHAPTER 6  HOW TO SETUP A LANDING PAGE THAT  CONVERTS  Landing pages are the pages that people land on when they click your Google ads. Landing pages are an integral part of the Google Ads puzzle.  Good landing pages help you get conversions and purchases from users on your website. Bad copies increase your sales and cost you thousands of dollars in clicks without showing any sales for them.  In this chapter we show you great examples of landing pages and best practices you can follow to increase conversions. Remember, if you are setting your audience, ads, and keywords, but not  your landing pages, you have a problem! What are landing pages? The best examples of top companies  Landing pages are simple in practice: These are individual pages on your website that are specifically designed  to entice a user to buy from you or to take action.  These  are  usually  not  existing  pages  on  your  website,  e.g.  Your  Landing pages have been stripped of most of the navigation elements and  mainly focus on what you are presenting to a particular user.  The typical navigation menus you see on a home page are not on landing  homepage.  pages.  Why? It helps to draw attention to the offer and not give users external  routes to leave the page.  The site's sole purpose is to encourage action. Most Google Ads advertisers make the mistake of using their homepage as  a  landing  page  because  it  contains  similar  content,  such  as  detailed information about products or services offered and important call-to-action. But  that's  a  mistake,  a  big  one.  There  are  too  many  other  elements  on  the   home page distracting users from conversions, and the content isn't specific enough for each audience of your ad groups.  In  a  perfect  world,  every  ad  group  you  create  should  have  its  own  keyword and content landing page.  One of the best examples of this is Zoho, a live chat software company. When  I  searched  for  'live  chat  software'  I  clicked  on  the  ad  and  was directed to a specific landing page with the exact keyword I was looking for in the headline with a unique CTA in the middle.  This is what you want to see on a Google Ads landing page. Another good example comes from Falcon.io, where navigation elements are removed and the body of the searched keyword is highlighted in text in a different color for emphasis.  With CTAs in the header and body, users can convert from anywhere.  1: Message match  Message Match is the idea of delivering the same message and offer as  your ad and keyword. It's easy, but it's often overlooked.  It goes back to the trunk of the search: keywords. Keywords have different intentions, so users expect certain things when  searching.  For example, searchers who type for "SEO Guide" clearly want a guide to help them with search engine optimization, not an agency to hire, right? Turn right.  It is imperative that you put yourself in the searcher's shoes to understand  what they are likely to expect from the search.  You then transfer this information to your ad to reassure the searcher that  your content meets the requirements.  Finally, your landing page should have a suitable offer that doesn't exceed  or miss expectations.  For  example,  when  you  return  to  the  SEO  guide,  your  landing  page  should display an SEO guide in exchange for an email.  You can't trick people into clicking on an SEO guide and demanding that  they pay or hire your agency.   In  most  cases,  advertisers  do  not  repeat  their  bid  on  a  landing  page,  leading to a confusing experience for users.  Even small moments of hesitation can be devastating to your conversion  dynamics. I will give you an example.  I was recently looking for a social media marketing tool. I found this ad from a company and the 90 day trial was very exciting. 90 days! That's big. So of course I clicked through to their landing page. Rather than signing up for  my  90-day  risk-free  trial,  the  call  to  action  was,  "Use  the  world's  first visual campaign builder with built-in marketing performance reporting tools." What happened to the 90-day trial? This CTA is unclear and leaves me guessing if the 90-day deal is still there. I don't know what to expect when I see  a  "Get  started  today"  button  or  hyperlink.  When  the  call-to-action  says "Start your 90-day free trial now," rest assured that I'll hit the "click" button.  Now let me show you a great example of a successful post match. I was looking for another social resource and saw another trial offer: “Free 15-day trial, risk-free, no credit card required. Sign up today! Clicking on the landing page got me exactly what I expected. They repeated the offer for a 15 day free  trial  in  the  above  content  alone.  They  also  used  the  same  language  as their ad, including terms like no obligation, simple, and easy.  That's a perfect message match. 2: Value proposition  Value propositions are short statements intended to explain the value of your product to a potential customer for their needs and wants. If you surf the web alone, you have seen thousands if not millions of value propositions. On almost any website, you can see a value proposition in the first few sections of the content.  I  found  an  interesting  one  that  says  "use  smart  chatbots  to  improve customer  loyalty".  The  value  of  this  product  helps  companies  improve customer loyalty.  Your value proposition must be accurate and explain the ultimate benefits  customers can expect, not the features.  For example, nobody really cares about chatbots. Hell, I probably don't even  know  what  they  are.  But  people  absolutely  appreciate  improving customer loyalty.   Focus on benefits, not features. Keep your value proposition short  1-2 short sentences  and display it in  the middle of your landing page heading under your headline  keyword . 3: Make sure your site is cell phone friendly  While  the  above  two  tips  play  a  huge  role  in  an  up-converting  landing page,  this  guide  would  be  incomplete  without  adding  one  glaring  problem: website speed.  How  important  is  it  really?  In  just  3  seconds,  you  can  go  from  a  good  conversion rate of 2% to less than half a percent.  Depending  on  your  traffic,  this  means  thousands  of  potential  leads  are  dripping out of your lead funnel like a hole in a boat.  This  problem  affects  not  only  your  landing  page  conversions,  but  ultimately your Google Ads ranking as well.  One  of  the  biggest  factors  in  your  Google  Ads  Quality  Score  is  your website's  speed  rating.  While  this  has  always  been  a  factor  since  2009, Google  made  that  factor  an  even  bigger  part  of  its  overall  Quality  Score metrics in 2018. It's also important to make sure that your Google Ads page is easy to navigate from a mobile device  and that the load time is fast .   BONUS CHAPTER 7  WHAT BIDDING METHOD IS BEST?  Google Ads offers several options for keyword bidding. Good bid strategies can  help  you  improve  your  ad  position  and  even  cut  costs  to  get  cheaper conversions  and  clicks.  However,  bidding  can  be  tricky  for  a  new  Google Ads user. Which strategy is the best? When should you increase or decrease your bids?  The different bid options for Google Ads  and what to choose based on  your campaign goals   There  are  currently  a  number  of  different  bid  options  in  Google  Ads  based on different goals, such as: more clicks, impressions or conversions.  Depending  on  your  goal,  you  can  bid  in  different  ways.  The  most common bid options focus on CPC  cost per click  and so getting more clicks on your ads. These two methods are known as:  1      Automated bidding 2      Manual bidding  Automated bidding  With automatic bidding, you do as little work as possible. With a maximum daily budget, Google takes care of the rest by letting Google  Ads  automatically  adjust  your  CPC  bids  based  on  market fluctuations. When advertisers drop out and costs drop, your bid will adjust accordingly to get more clicks. If you have a large Google Ads account, this is a great time-saving tool. Bidding manually  With manual bidding, you take control of your own bidding strategy. You can adjust ad group level or even keyword level bids to target your biggest winners  and  reduce  your  spend  on  underachievers.  This  can  be  useful  for increasing bids for specific keywords and match types, as well as decreasing bids  for  broad  keywords,  which  tend  to  attract  fewer  conversions.  Manual bidding  is  good  to  prepare  you  for  advanced  bidding  techniques,  but  it becomes  more  and  more  difficult  to  manage  as  your  campaigns  and  ad   Ultimately,  you  have  to  choose  and  either  can  be  good  for  you  as  a  accounts grow.  beginner. Advanced bidding strategies Other advanced bidding techniques include:  vCPM: Instead of paying for clicks  like manual and automatic bidding ,  you  can  focus  on  impressions.  vCPM  stays  for “Viewable Cost per Thousand Impressions”, and that means you pay for each set of 1000 impressions. This option is best used for brand awareness purposes. CPA: The cost per acquisition or conversion is how much you pay to acquire a customer.  Here you tell Google your maximum CPA. This is a great tool for cautious new advertisers who don't want to spend  Refer  to  your  keywords'  average  CPC  when  setting  bids  for  your  more than necessary.  campaign.  Keep track of your bids and your position. For example, if you're currently in second place and paying the average  CPC, increase your bids by 10% and see what happens.  Bidding is a guessing game. Use  small  bid  increases  and  decreases  to  measure  their  impact  on  your  position and impressions.  Make slow, small adjustments to your bids to avoid massive performance  changes or overpaying for clicks.  And now it's time to focus on your clients.   BONUS CHAPTER 8  HOW TO CREATE CUSTOM AUDIENCES  From remarketing to lookalikes to custom intent, Google Ads has some great custom audience capabilities that rival platforms like Facebook and Twitter.  You  can  recover  lost  conversions,  build  audiences  based  on  your  best  customers, and find new ones just before they buy. Create remarketing audiences in Google Ads  Remarketing is one of the best ways to drive sales to a target audience  Even with Google Ads and using the highest intent keywords, not all of  targeting your brand.  them will convert.  Usually people need multiple taps to convert. But that doesn't mean you  should stop there or keep going. You should never skip a potential sale.  If  you  haven't  yet  collected  your  emails  or  received  your  contact  information, remarketing is your best bet.  If you're paying a fraction of the cost of getting their attention the first  time, you can send another marketing ad to hopefully seal the deal.  To  get  started  with  custom  remarketing  audiences,  visit  Audience  Manager on your Google Ads dashboard. There are several options for remarketing in Google Ads:  Website visitors App user Customer lists YouTube users Add your own frame  The most common remarketing tactic is to create a new audience based  on the website visitors.  For  example,  if  you've  just  run  a  campaign,  you  can  create  a  new remarketing  list  based  on  the  website  visitors  to  that  campaign  and  the   experience they encountered. You can use a specific selection to customize which users are targeted to your target audience:  Page  Visitors:  This  remarketing  list  adds  any  user  to  your  list who landed on a particular page that you tag. Visitors  to  a  page  who  also  visited  another  page:  This remarketing list adds users who visit both of the specified pages. Page Visitors Who Have Not Visited Another Page: This list is great for people who clicked your page but weren't converted or redirected to a thank you page. Visitors  to  a  page  on  specific  dates:  Only  add  users  who  have visited your page on specific dates. This list is great for seasonal remarketing or limited-time campaigns. Visitors  to  a  page  with  certain  tags:  users  who  visit  a  page  on which a conversion tracking tag is installed. This can be great for reselling  to  customers  who  have  recently  made  a  purchase  so that they will keep coming back for more.  Using custom audiences with intent and affinity in Google Ads  For  custom  audiences  with  no  remarketing,  Google  Ads  has  two  great  options:  1      Custom intent 2      Custom affinity  Custom  audiences  lets  you  reach  new  customers  who  are  looking  for  products and services like yours.  For  example,  by  entering  keywords  and  URLs,  Google  creates  a  target  group of users who browse and search similar websites on similar websites.  This is a great way to find new potential sales without putting in a lot of work.  Just  enter  a  few  keywords  and  Google  will  show  your  ads  to  active buyers.  Custom  Affinity  Groups  allow  advertisers  to  "create  audiences  more  closely aligned with their brands."   Custom Affinity helps advertisers go deeper than standard industries or general segments. Rather than targeting sports fans, you can target something more specific like 5km marathon runners.  These audiences are currently only available in YouTube campaigns. If your video marketing business is great, you can easily use this custom  audience type to get great sales.   BONUS CHAPTER 9  HOW TO MONITOR YOUR CONVERSIONS  Conversion tracking should be your bread and butter. It's an important part of your campaign.  However, if you've ever run a calling campaign or planning phone calls, you know that tracking calls with Google Ads is painful. This section shows you  how  to  track  phone  calls  in  Google  Ads  and  how  to  use  third-party software to get the most out of your data. Set up call conversion tracking on your Google Ads account  The  first  step  is  to  set  up  a  configuration  for  Google  Ads  conversion tracking at the simplest level to ensure that your calls are accurately tracked and recorded.  To do this, go to the "Conversions" section of your toolbox. Create a new script  to  track  the  phone  conversion.  This  is  where  most  people  are  wrong and miss tons of conversions due to improper installation. You have three different options here:  Calls through call extension ads or ads only Call a phone number on your website Click your number on your mobile website  The main problem lies in the fact that you can only choose one at a time,  although most people want to keep track of all of these elements.  You see the problem? Most of the ads that try to generate phone calls have a phone number on their  website,  on  their  mobile  website,  and  in  an  ad  extension.  Still,  most people  just  follow  the  number  on  their  website  and  miss  tons  of  reported calls.  The key here is to create at least three separate conversion scripts for every occurrence. When you create your three scripts, you need to adjust two more items in   the tracking tag: call duration and conversion report inclusion. Always make sure Include in conversions is set to Yes.  This tells Google Ads to include phone calls in the 'Conversions' column  in your campaign report.  Call duration is a great way to ensure that not every call is marked as a  conversion.  minutes? Ten?  conversion.  For example, how long is the average conversation leading to a sale? Five  Set a low range   high range as a metric for the call duration. If  calls  take  that  long  or  longer,  Google  Ads  will  mark  them  as  a  While this is a good start, it is not that easy. Just because a conversation  lasts five minutes instead of two doesn't mean you've made a sale.  And this is where Google Ads lacks call tracking. They really don't know  whether it's a conversion or not.  And when it comes to real money You need to know what works and what doesn't. While it may seem exciting to receive a lot of phone calls, it's worthless if none of them buy anything from you. And since it is an offline activity, it is almost always not followed by companies that have not experienced it. Implement third-party tracking software  Since Google Ads data is so limited that it can be used for call tracking,  external sources are required if you plan on making frequent calls.  If phone calls are an important way to connect leads to your business, you  need third-party tools.  some great features, such as:  There are tons of different call tracking services you can use. Many have  Track  calls  to  your  keywords:  Individual  calls  can  be  matched with specific keyword searches so you have a clear idea of what the caller wants and where they come from. Browser session: Keeping track of the pages a visitor has visited on your website before calling   Call  recording:  record  your  calls  to  listen  to  and  improve performance or see if they have been converted Location: where the user is calling from, his number and name.  This data is invaluable for accurately tracking campaign callbacks. Without this feature, you can't know which calls are coming from Google Ads,  or  just  searching  organically.  It  is  impossible  to  distinguish  without asking each caller where they found you.  Some great call tracking platforms include CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, and Capterra. All of these can help you turn offline conversions into online data.  And now it's time to share a secret with you: Focusing on vanity numbers can lead to bad business decisions. If you focus on the right metrics, you can make profit for years to come.   BONUS CHAPTER 10  WHAT METRICS AND REPORTS TO FOCUS  ON  When  you're  analyzing  data  in  Google  Ads,  it's  easy  to  get  overwhelmed. There are dozens of reporting features and tons of metrics to review.  What  should  you  focus  on  when  it  comes  to  impressions,  from  impressions to clicks to click rates and conversions?  Which metrics are really important and which are just a waste of time? Focusing on wrong metrics like vanity numbers can lead to bad business  decisions that won't affect your bottom line.  If you focus on the right metrics, you can make years of profit for your  business.  statistics  In  this  section  you  will  learn  more  about  the  most  important  PPC  in  Google  Ads  and  how  to  use  the  reporting  features  to  keep  track  of  them. Acquisition and Lifetime Value: Two metrics to follow  When you run campaigns in Google Ads, your dashboard has some great  performance metrics.  Things like click rate. Impressions. Calls. And while it may be surprising to see these numbers rise, it is deceptive. Most of the statistics in Google Ads are vanity statistics. They look great  on the surface but have no real value to your strategy.  It's  cool  to  see  1,000,000  impressions,  isn't  it?  However,  that  means  nothing if you don't run a campaign based on brand awareness.  Having  a  million  impressions  is  worthless  if  you  don't  convert  them. Clicks are worthless if you don't convert them. The CTR doesn't matter if you don't convert it. In many cases, conversions don't really mean conversions.  Unless  you're  selling  direct  products  through  an  online  store,  your   conversions are really just leads. They are consultations, interested seekers  who want to know more and give you contact details. It's important to understand that there are only two metrics you need to  focus on: cost per acquisition cost per conversion and lifetime value, stop. What does Google Ads cost per acquisition?  The cost per acquisition or conversion is simply the amount you had to spend to acquire that customer. For example, if it took you 15 clicks at $ 1.00 per click, that's $ 15 to buy. This statistic tells you whether you are profitable or not. If your customers only paid you $ 10 for your product, but you spent $ 15 on the purchase, you won't benefit. If they spend $ 50 on your website, you will benefit from a $ 15 acquisition. What is the Lifetime Value of Google Ads?  Lifetime  Value  is  the  total  amount  that  a  customer  spends  on  their relationship with your business. How much do customers spend after having attracted a customer or having them buy it? How often do they come back and buy again? If a customer buys from you twice a year on average and each order costs $ 100, that equates to an annual lifetime value of $ 200.  Why on earth is this statistic so important? It determines what you can afford to get new customers. At  first  glance,  $  50  seems  like  a  lot  of  money  to  get  a  customer. However, if they spend $ 200 a year, that's a significant profit. Even if your initial purchase is only $ 50, you can expect to spend four times that amount in the next year, eliminating the $ 50 purchase cost under the big program.  Track the cost-per-conversion on your Google Ads reports to get an idea of the cost of purchase. When the lifetime value is low, there is not much you can spend on the acquisition.  If it's high you can. Top reports for measuring the success of Google Ads Google Ads has some great reports that you can use to monitor, analyze,  and improve your PPC performance.  With the new updates to the Google Ads interface, reports have changed,  removed, and updated so that they are difficult to find.  One  of  the  best  reports  from  the  old  Google  Ads  interface  was  called   "Top  Movers".  This  report  essentially  identified  segments  of  your  account that have shifted the most in a given time period.  By  taking  into  account  metrics  like  impressions,  cost,  conversions,  and click-through rate, you can identify good and bad changes that are having a significant  impact  on  performance,  so  you  can  search  the  noise  of  Google Ads and focus on items with large tickets.  Fortunately,  this  report  still  has  a  different  name  in  Google  Ads:  the Biggest  Changes  report.  You  can  find  it  in  the  overview  area  of  your dashboard. In this report, you can analyze data sorted by metrics like CTR, conversions,  cost,  CPC,  and  more.  This  report  is  a  great  way  to  find  big winners and run campaigns that keep you energized.  Sort your data by conversions to get an insight into successful campaigns. If  so,  double  up  by  donating  more  money  to  this  campaign.  If  campaigns have been negative in the last seven days, pause them or cut your budget in favor  of  other  campaigns.  The  Biggest  Changes  report  should  be  the  first report you review on Google Ads on a daily or weekly basis. Instead of going through  your  entire  account  to  find  out  what's  going  on,  you  can  use  the Biggest Changes report to get a good picture. Then you can dive deep into each campaign.  Another  great  report  in  Google  Ads  is  at  the  campaign,  ad  group,  and keyword  level,  depending  on  where  you  want  to  focus  your  efforts.  It  is known as the Auction Insights report. From here you can see a detailed table of your performance against your competition.  The  table  allows  you  to  compare  ad  positions  and  metrics,  such  as Position Over Rate, that shows how often your competition outperforms you. These metrics are great for knowing when to increase bids or quality values  and outperforming your competitors on the leader board. Outreach Rate is the number  of  times  your  ad  was  shown  higher  than  the  ad.  If  it's  low,  you probably  aren't  bidding  enough  or  your  quality  scores  are  worse  than  your competition.  Use this report every week to see fluctuations and see if your efforts to increase  bids  or  improve  ad  relevance  are  successful.  The  statistics  in  the Auction Insights report give you a good idea of how well you are performing against the competition.  Finally,  the  final  report,  which  you  should  always  use,  includes  all  of   your  keywords  and  important  metrics  about  their  performance,  so  you  can make budget and bidding decisions for your campaigns. Yes, we are talking about:  the  keyword  report.  To  access  the  keyword  report,  go  to  your dashboard  and  click  on  the  reporting  tool.  Navigate  to  Predefined  Reports and click Basic. Then choose 'Keyword' from the drop-down menu. Here you can  analyze  any  keyword  you're  currently  bidding  on  with  your  existing campaigns and ad groups.  First, look at the most important statistics such as conversions, cost per conversion  and  conversion  rates.  Do  certain  keywords  convert  better  than others? Do keywords convert well, but too expensive? Lower the budget and put  your  budget  on  keywords  that  convert  cheaply  but  don't  get  that  many conversions.  The  Keyword  Report  is  a  great  tool  to  help  you  decide  where  to  make  your bid and budget adjustments to improve performance.   BONUS CHAPTER 11  HOW TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE  PERFORMANCE OVER TIME  Google Ads is a tricky platform with a lot of changes, features, and updates.  In 2019 alone, dozens of new updates were released every month. From new reporting software to new stats, columns, and changes to the bidding system, it's getting harder and harder to put your account on cruise control. To just enjoy the good times and watch the money keep flowing.  Unfortunately,  regular  account  management  is  mandatory  with  Google  Ads. But it doesn't have to be painful. Let’s start with Google's recommendations  If  you  are  completely  new  to  this  process,  sometimes  it  is  safest  to  get  help and advice from the professionals.  This is exactly what Google's recommendation display can be used for. Google's  recommendations  contain  tailored  suggestions  to  improve  the  performance of your campaigns without the need to be a lead advertiser.  To do this, Google checks your account history, your settings and even  internal Google trends and turns it into a real-time strategy tip for you. There are several main categories of recommendations you can see, such as:  Ads and extensions Budget and bid Automated campaigns Keywords and targeting Repair Advertising suggestions  There  are  many  ads  and  extensions.  Within  this  category,  there  are several tips that Google can show you based on your campaign settings and performance. Each of the above categories contains different advice, as we   saw above. To find the recommendations for your account, simply go to your Google  Ads  account  and  click  on  the  'Recommendations'  label  under  the 'Summary' button.  To  add  one  of  these  suggestions  to  your  campaign,  you  have  to  click "View" on the recommendation you want to apply and then "Apply". Keep in mind that new keywords may need to be reviewed and approved before they can trigger your ad.  Following  these  recommendations  and  applying  the  fixes  will  help  you  debug your Google Ads campaigns before continuing with the next steps. Reduce your wasted ad spending with negative keyword lists  Do you think you're wasting your money on Google Ads? Think again. Are  campaigns  going  well?  Is  the  click  rate  high?  Does  the  conversion  look good? Impressions through the roof?  Even reducing all of these metrics to a "T" is no guarantee that you will maximize your potential. It is not a guarantee that you will not be wasting a lot of money.  A  recent  survey  of  2,000  verified  Google  Ads  business  accounts  found that an average of 61% of advertising spending is wasted. And that wasted ad spending can destroy your budget.  As the percentage of your wasted spending increases, so does your cost  per conversion.  This means that any lead or sale you bring in is way more expensive than  it should be. You are paying more money than necessary.  Why is this happening? What is the biggest culprit   reason? The wrong  search terms. Otherwise, it says: Ignore your negative keyword lists.  The average account in this study was spending 77% of its daily budget  on search terms that had not converted at all.  This  simple  and  efficient  solution  is  often  overlooked  for  a  number  of  important reasons:  People normally don't know what the search terms report is so they don't  even know how to use it for negative keywords  People don't know what negative keywords are Negative keyword lists are tedious and ongoing, making them difficult to   Let's take a look at the basics of reducing wasted ad spend with negative  stick to.  keywords. What are negative keywords?  As  Google  defines,  negative  keywords  are  a  type  of  keyword  that prevents your ad from being triggered by a specific word or phrase. Your ads will not be shown to anyone who searches for this phrase.  For example, let's say you run a business and you want advice about your Google  Ads,  but  it's  not  free.  Consultations  cost  $  50.  Entering  the  word "free" as a negative keyword ensures that your ads won't appear before the keyword "free".  Why? Because you don't sell free consultations and with Google Ads you pay for every click. You can't waste your budget on keyword searches that never convert. Someone looking for free advice is not going to convert your $ 50 advice.  Negative keywords are used to remove search terms that have not been  converted and will never be converted.  With Google Ads, you pay for search terms, not keywords. While  you  may  be  bidding  directly  on  a  keyword,  depending  on  the match type, you'll pay for tons of related searches and open the door to terms you might not want.  To start with negative keywords, go to your Google Ads dashboard and find  the  search  terms  report.  Once  you  are  here,  you  can  choose  different search terms from your list and add them as a negative keyword.  You can adjust this at the campaign or even ad group and account level. At the account level, add negative keywords that apply to any campaign  you run.  This audit-style account management step should be performed weekly.  Filter the results by the past seven days when viewing your report.  This  way,  you  can  ensure  that  you  don't  duplicate  work  and  minimize  your time on this task while still achieving budget-saving results. Search the keyword report for campaign inspiration   This next step can be done in the same way as adding negative keywords. Fortunately, both are summarized in the same report. Thanks Google! As mentioned before, search terms are what you really pay for in Google  Ads.  Confused? Let me break it down for you: In order to bid on the search network, you need to select keywords. For  example 'SEO Agency'.  You can bid on this term to get traffic for your search. However, if you use a broad match type, you will see tons of different keywords related to or calling out to an SEO agency.  There are a few important match types in Google Ads. Depending  on  which  match  types  you  are  using   as  explained  in  the  SKAG section , they will appear for different terms.  In most cases, accounts are dominated by broad match types. This means  that your Keyword Report will have both good and bad keywords.  Because  a  broad  match  will  drive  your  ad  for  relevant  searches  and variation, you really are paying for all of those search terms per click, not just the keyword you are bidding on.  This  opens  the  door  to  great  opportunities  after  filtering  out  the  clutter  with negative keyword lists.  For example, you can scroll through the search terms report and look for  new specific keywords that will be converted.  Sort the data by metrics like CTR conversions. Search your ad groups for keywords that you are not currently bidding on. If you find new search terms that are not yet your own campaign, you can  Use those successful search terms and turn them into new ad groups with  use this now.  just one keyword!  Doing so will increase your chances of converting these terms and open  the door to more search terms that can be generated in the coming weeks.  Repeating  this  process  weekly  with  your  list  of  negative  keywords  will   only take a couple of minutes.  trick:  And if you're as lazy as I am, you can speed up the process with a simple  When  Google  emails  you  a  weekly  list  of  search  terms  instead  of  launching Google Ads to view them.  That means you can analyze the data from your email at a glance instead  of loading the Google Ads interface.  To do this, go to your search term report and click the download button on  your  toolbar.  From  here,  click  on  "Schedule"  to  set  up  recurring  email from Google.  You  can  then  choose  who  you  want  to  share  the  report  with  and  how  often you want to receive the report by email.  These reports can save you hours of work every week. But don't stop there. Do you want to save even more time? Do you want  to make sure you are spending your time on the right keywords?  Let's  face  it:  tons  of  the  search  terms  report  are  junk.  But  there  are diamonds  in  the  rough  that  you  can  discover  and  focus  with  a  few  simple adjustments.  Before scheduling your recurring email reports, click the filter button in your search term report. You can use filters to sort search term report data by performance,  conversions,  characteristics,  and  more.  For  example,  you  can set the minimum CTR to the average CTR of your campaign.  This will filter out all search terms with a lower click-through rate than  your average. E.g. Terms not worth your time and effort.  Repeat  this  filtering  process  for  important  metrics  such  as  conversions and acquisition costs. You can produce smaller, more accurate reports using only your best potential keywords for new campaigns.  Hit "Schedule" again and you're off to a good start with search terms. Maintain your Google Ads account Step 4: Use automated rules to reduce  your Google Ads time and improve performance  Everyone loves making money and seeing results. There  are  few  better  things  in  marketing  than  getting  a  high  ROI  and  making tons of quick sales with Google Ads.   It's one of the best places to do it. Very few people really enjoy their time on Google Ads. You know the  part that takes time, effort, and dedication.  It's annoying. It's time consuming like nothing you've ever used before. There are hundreds of reports, statistics, and tactics to investigate. They are constantly changing and changing with new updates.  And,  unless  you  haven't  invested  thousands  of  hours,  it  can  feel  like  a full-time  job  doing  all  of  your  daily  chores  to  keep  your  account  running smoothly.  Fortunately,  Google  Ads  includes  some  great  automation  tools  that  any  advertiser can use to work smarter, not harder.  One of my favorite methods is using rule actions. This  is  a  simple  "if-then"  style  automation.  For  example,  if  the  CPC  is  greater than X, reduce budgets by Y.  Useful? Essentially, one particular action will trigger your auto-reply. In your Dashboard, navigate to the Rules section in the Toolbox. In the rule action, you can set up automated sequences based on specific metrics or actions. Say your daily budget is $ 50. It's not too high, and your average cost per click is $ 5.  Your product will retail for $ 15, so $ 5 per click isn't bad. But what if the average CPC for your keywords drops? An advertiser might withdraw or stop their campaign.  And  now  your  CPC  is  dirt  cheap.  Wouldn’t  you  want  to  increase  your  daily budget and even increase your bids?  Of course you would. But the odds of this happening while on your account are next to nothing.  That would take incredible luck.  With automated rules you can make this dream situation a reality. By  creating  new  rules,  you  can  adjust  budgets,  pause  campaigns  and  make account changes related to conversions, CPC, costs, etc.  When average CPCs drop, increase your daily budget to ensure you get  more conversions at a low cost. It's that simple.   You can repeat the same line of thought by increasing your daily budget  when the cost per conversion is low.  This  will  help  you  get  more  conversions  for  a  low  price.  Once  the conversion costs go up, you can set up another automated rule to lower your budget.  Automated rules save the life of Google Ads. Stop spending hours a day on the platform. Take the time to create new rules that can limit your time while improving your sales.
