Wheeler  C++  feels  like a new  language.  That is,  I  can  express  my  ideas  more  clearly, more  simply, and more  directly  in  C++11  than  I  could  in  C++98. Furthermore,  the  resulting  programs  are  better checked by the compiler and run faster.  In  this  book,  I  aim  for completeness. I describe  every  language  feature  and  standard-library  component that a professional programmer is likely to need. For each, I provide:   cid:129  Rationale: What kinds of problems is it designed to help solve?  What principles underlie   cid:129   the design? What are the fundamental limitations? Speciﬁcation: What is its deﬁnition? The level of detail is chosen for the expert program- mer; the aspiring language lawyer can follow the many references to the ISO standard.   cid:129  Examples: How can it be used well by itself and in combination with other features? What are the key techniques and idioms? What are the implications for maintainability and per- formance?  The use of C++ has changed dramatically over the years and so has the language itself. From the point  of  view of a programmer, most  of  the  changes  have  been  improvements.  The current  ISO standard C++  ISO IEC 14882-2011, usually called C++11  is simply a far better tool for writing quality software than were previous versions.  How is it a better tool? What kinds of programming styles and techniques does modern C++ support? What language and standard-library features sup- port  those  techniques? What  are  the  basic  building  blocks  of  elegant,  correct,  maintainable,  and efﬁcient C++ code? Those are the key questions answered by this book. Many answers are not the same as you would ﬁnd with 1985, 1995, or 2005 vintage C++: progress happens.  C++ is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing the design and use of type-rich, It  is  particularly  suited  for  resource-constrained  applications,  such  as lightweight  abstractions. those found in software infrastructures. C++ rewards the programmer who takes the time to master   vi   Preface  techniques for writing quality code. C++ is a language for someone who takes the task of program- ming seriously. Our civilization depends critically on software; it had better be quality software.  There  are  billions  of  lines  of  C++  deployed.  This puts  a  premium  on  stability, so 1985  and 1995 C++ code still works and will continue to work for decades. However,  for all applications, you can do better with modern C++; if you stick to older styles, you will be writing lower-quality and  worse-performing  code. The  emphasis  on  stability  also  implies  that  standards-conforming code you write today will still work a couple of decades from now.  All code in this book conforms to the 2011 ISO C++ standard.  This book is aimed at three audiences:  cid:129  C++ programmers who want to know what the latest ISO C++ standard has to offer,  cid:129  C programmers who wonder what C++ provides beyond C, and  cid:129  People  with  a  background  in  application  languages,  such  as  Java, C,  Python,  and  Ruby, looking for something ‘‘closer to the machine’’ – something more ﬂexible, something offer- ing better compile-time checking, or something offering better performance.  Naturally, these three groups are not disjoint – a professional software developer masters more than just one programming language.  This  book  assumes  that  its  readers  are  programmers.  If  you  ask,  ‘‘What’s a for-loop?’’ or ‘‘What’s a compiler?’’ then this book is not  yet  for you; instead, I recommend my Programming: Principles  and  Practice  Using  C++ to  get  started  with  programming  and  C++. Furthermore,  I assume that readers have some maturity as software developers.  If you ask ‘‘Why bother testing?’’ or say, ‘‘All languages are basically the same; just show me the syntax’’ or are conﬁdent that there is a single language that is ideal for every task, this is not the book for you.  What features does C++11 offer over and above C++98?  A machine model suitable for modern computers  with  lots  of  concurrency.  Language  and  standard-library  facilities  for  doing  systems- level concurrent  programming   e.g.,  using  multicores . Regular  expression  handling,  resource management  pointers,  random  numbers,  improved containers   including,  hash  tables ,  and  more. General and uniform initialization, a simpler for-statement, move semantics, basic Unicode support, lambdas, general constant expressions, control over class defaults, variadic templates, user-deﬁned literals, and more. Please remember that those libraries and language features exist to support pro- gramming techniques for developing quality software.  They are meant to be used in combination – as bricks in a building set – rather than to be used individually in relative isolation to solve a spe- ciﬁc problem. A computer is a universal machine, and C++ serves it in that capacity. In particular, C++’s design aims to be sufﬁciently ﬂexible and general to cope with future problems undreamed of by its designers.   vii  Acknowledgments In  addition  to  the  people  mentioned  in  the  acknowledgment  sections  of  the  previous  editions,  I would like to thank Pete Becker, Hans-J. Boehm, Marshall Clow,  Jonathan Coe, Lawrence Crowl, Walter  Daugherty, J. Daniel  Garcia,  Robert  Harle,  Greg Hickman,  Howard  Hinnant,  Brian Kernighan, Daniel Krügler, Nevin Liber, Michel Michaud, Gary Powell, Jan Christiaan van Winkel, and Leor Zolman. Without their help this book would have been much poorer.  Thanks to Howard Hinnant for answering many questions about the standard library. Andrew Sutton is the author of the Origin library, which was the testbed for much of the discus- sion of emulating concepts in the template chapters, and of the matrix library that is the topic of Chapter 29. The Origin library is open source and can be found by searching the Web for ‘‘Origin’’ and ‘‘Andrew Sutton.’’  Thanks to my graduate design class for ﬁnding more problems with the ‘‘tour chapters’’ than  anyone else.  Had I been able to follow every piece of advice of my reviewers, the book would undoubtedly have  been  much  improved,  but  it  would  also  have  been  hundreds  of  pages  longer. Every  expert reviewer  suggested  adding  technical  details,  advanced  examples,  and  many useful  development conventions; every novice reviewer  or educator  suggested adding examples; and most reviewers observed  correctly  that the book may be too long.  Thanks  to  Princeton  University’s Computer  Science  Department,  and  especially  Prof.  Brian  Kernighan, for hosting me for part of the sabbatical that gav e me time to write this book.  Thanks to Cambridge University’s Computer Lab, and especially Prof. Andy Hopper, for host-  ing me for part of the sabbatical that gav e me time to write this book.

College Station, Texas   Bjarne Stroustrup   This page intentionally left blank    Preface to the Third Edition  Programming is understanding. – Kristen Nygaard  I ﬁnd  using  C++  more  enjoyable  than  ever.  C++’s support  for  design  and  programming  has improved dramatically over the years, and lots of new helpful techniques have been developed for its use. However,  C++ is not just fun.  Ordinary practical programmers have achieved signiﬁcant improvements in productivity, maintainability, ﬂexibility, and quality in projects of just about any kind and scale. By now,  C++ has fulﬁlled most of the hopes I originally had for it, and also suc- ceeded at tasks I hadn’t even dreamt of.  This book introduces standard C++† and the key programming and design techniques supported by C++. Standard C++ is a far more powerful and polished language than the version of C++ intro- duced  by  the  ﬁrst  edition  of  this  book. New language  features  such  as  namespaces,  exceptions, templates, and run-time type identiﬁcation allow many techniques to be applied more directly than was possible before, and the standard library allows the programmer to start from a much higher level than the bare language.  About a third of the information in the second edition of this book came from the ﬁrst. This third edition is the result of a rewrite of even larger magnitude. It offers something to even the most experienced C++ programmer; at the same time, this book is easier for the novice to approach than its predecessors were. The explosion of C++ use and the massive amount of experience accumu- lated as a result makes this possible.  The deﬁnition of an extensive standard library makes a difference to the way C++ concepts can be presented. As before, this book presents C++ independently of any particular implementation, and  as  before,  the  tutorial  chapters  present  language  constructs  and  concepts  in  a  ‘‘bottom  up’’ order so that a construct is used only after it has been deﬁned. However, it is much easier to use a well-designed library than it is to understand the details of its implementation. Therefore, the stan- dard library can be used to provide realistic and interesting examples well before a reader can be assumed to understand its inner workings.  The standard library itself is also a fertile source of pro- gramming examples and design techniques.  This book presents every major C++ language feature and the standard library. It is org anized around language and library facilities.  However, features are presented in the context of their use.  † ISO IEC 14882, Standard for the C++ Programming Language.   x  Preface to the Third Edition  That is, the focus is on the language as the tool for design and programming rather than on the lan- guage in itself. This book demonstrates key  techniques that make C++ effective  and teaches the fundamental concepts necessary for mastery. Except where illustrating technicalities, examples are taken from the domain of systems software.  A companion, The Annotated C++ Language Stan- dard, presents the complete language deﬁnition together with annotations to make it more compre- hensible.  The primary aim of this book is to help the reader understand how the facilities offered by C++ support key programming techniques. The aim is to take the reader far beyond the point where he or she gets code running primarily by copying examples and emulating programming styles from other  languages. Only  a  good  understanding  of  the  ideas  behind  the  language  facilities  leads  to mastery. Supplemented  by  implementation  documentation,  the  information  provided  is  sufﬁcient for completing signiﬁcant real-world projects. The hope is that this book will help the reader gain new insights and become a better programmer and designer.  Acknowledgments In addition to the people mentioned in the acknowledgement sections of the ﬁrst and second edi- tions,  I  would  like to thank  Matt  Austern,  Hans  Boehm,  Don  Caldwell,  Lawrence  Crowl,  Alan Feuer, Andrew Forrest, David Gay, Tim Grifﬁn, Peter Juhl, Brian Kernighan, Andrew Koenig, Mike Mowbray, Rob  Murray, Lee  Nackman,  Joseph  Newcomer, Alex Stepanov,  David  Vandevoorde, Peter Weinberger, and Chris Van Wyk for commenting on draft chapters of this third edition. With- out  their  help  and  suggestions,  this  book  would  have  been  harder  to  understand,  contained  more errors, been slightly less complete, and probably been a little bit shorter.  I would also like to thank the volunteers on the C++ standards committees who did an immense amount of constructive work to make C++ what it is today. It is slightly unfair to single out indi- viduals, but it would be even more unfair not to mention anyone, so I’d like to especially mention Mike Ball,  Dag  Br¨uck,  Sean  Corﬁeld,  Ted  Goldstein,  Kim  Knuttila,  Andrew Koenig,  Dmitry Lenkov, Nathan  Myers,  Martin  O’Riordan,  Tom  Plum,  Jonathan  Shopiro,  John  Spicer, Jerry Schwarz,  Alex Stepanov,  and  Mike Vilot,  as  people  who  each  directly  cooperated  with  me  over some part of C++ and its standard library.  After the initial printing of this book, many dozens of people have mailed me corrections and suggestions for improvements.  I have been able to accommodate many of their suggestions within the framework of the book so that later printings beneﬁtted signiﬁcantly. Translators of this book into many languages have also provided many clariﬁcations.  In response to requests from readers, I have added appendices D and E. Let me take this opportunity to thank a few of those who helped: Dave Abrahams, Matt Austern, Jan Bielawski, Janina Mincer Daszkiewicz, Andrew Koenig, Diet- mar  K¨uhl,  Nicolai  Josuttis,  Nathan  Myers,  Paul  E.

Murray Hill, New Jersey  Bjarne Stroustrup   Preface to the Second Edition  The road goes ever on and on. – Bilbo Baggins  As promised in the ﬁrst edition of this book, C++ has been evolving to meet the needs of its users. This evolution has been guided by the experience of users of widely varying backgrounds working in a great range of application areas. The C++ user-community has grown a hundredfold during the six years since the ﬁrst edition of this book; many lessons have been learned, and many techniques have been discovered and or validated by experience.  Some of these experiences are reﬂected here. The primary aim of the language extensions made in the last six years has been to enhance C++ as a language for data abstraction and object-oriented programming in general and to enhance it as a tool  for  writing  high-quality  libraries  of  user-deﬁned  types  in  particular. A ‘‘high-quality library,’’ is a library that provides a concept to a user in the form of one or more classes that are convenient, safe, and efﬁcient to use. In this context, safe means that a class provides a speciﬁc type-safe interface between the users of the library and its providers; efﬁcient means that use of the class does not impose signiﬁcant overheads in run-time or space on the user compared with hand- written C code.  This book presents the complete C++ language. Chapters 1 through 10 give a tutorial introduc- tion; Chapters 11 through 13 provide a discussion of design and software development issues; and, ﬁnally, the complete C++ reference manual is included. Naturally, the features added and resolu- tions  made  since  the  original  edition  are  integral  parts  of  the  presentation. They include  reﬁned overloading resolution, memory management facilities, and access control mechanisms, type-safe linkage, const and static member  functions,  abstract  classes,  multiple  inheritance,  templates,  and exception handling.  C++ is a general-purpose programming language; its core application domain is systems pro- gramming in the broadest sense. In addition, C++ is successfully used in many application areas that are not covered by this label. Implementations of C++ exist from some of the most modest microcomputers to the largest supercomputers and for almost all operating systems. Consequently, this book describes the C++ language itself without trying to explain a particular implementation, programming environment, or library.  This  book  presents  many examples  of  classes  that,  though  useful,  should  be  classiﬁed  as ‘‘toys.’’  This style of exposition allows general principles and useful techniques to stand out more clearly than they would in a fully elaborated program, where they would be buried in details. Most   xii   Preface to the Second Edition  of the useful classes presented here, such as linked lists, arrays, character strings, matrices, graphics classes, associative arrays, etc., are available in ‘‘bulletproof ’’ and or ‘‘goldplated’’ versions from a wide  variety  of  commercial  and  non-commercial  sources. Many of these  ‘‘industrial  strength’’ classes and libraries are actually direct and indirect descendants of the toy versions found here.  This  edition  provides  a  greater  emphasis  on  tutorial  aspects  than  did  the  ﬁrst  edition  of  this book.  However, the presentation is still aimed squarely at experienced programmers and endeavors not  to  insult  their  intelligence  or  experience.  The discussion  of  design  issues  has  been  greatly expanded  to  reﬂect  the  demand  for  information  beyond  the  description  of  language  features  and their immediate use. Technical detail and precision have also been increased. The reference man- ual, in particular, represents many years of work in this direction. The intent has been to provide a book with a depth sufﬁcient to make more than one reading rewarding to most programmers. In other  words,  this  book  presents  the  C++  language,  its  fundamental  principles,  and  the  key  tech- niques needed to apply it. Enjoy!  Acknowledgments In addition to the people mentioned in the acknowledgements section in the preface to the ﬁrst edi- tion, I would like to thank Al Aho, Steve Buroff, Jim Coplien, Ted Goldstein, Tony Hansen, Lor- raine Juhl, Peter Juhl, Brian Kernighan, Andrew Koenig, Bill Leggett, Warren Montgomery, Mike Mowbray, Rob  Murray, Jonathan  Shopiro,  Mike Vilot,  and  Peter  Weinberger  for  commenting  on draft chapters of this second edition. Many people inﬂuenced the development of C++ from 1985 to 1991. I can mention only a few: Andrew Koenig, Brian Kernighan, Doug McIlroy, and Jonathan Shopiro.  Also thanks to the many participants of the ‘‘external reviews’’ of the reference manual drafts and to the people who suffered through the ﬁrst year of X3J16. Murray Hill, New Jersey  Bjarne Stroustrup   Preface to the First Edition  Language shapes the way we think, and determines what we can think about. – B.L.Whorf  C++ is a general purpose programming language designed to make programming more enjoyable for the serious programmer. Except for minor details, C++ is a superset of the C programming lan- guage.  In addition to the facilities provided by C, C++ provides ﬂexible and efﬁcient facilities for deﬁning new types.  A programmer can partition an application into manageable pieces by deﬁning new types that closely match the concepts of the application. This technique for program construc- tion is often called data abstraction. Objects of some user-deﬁned types contain type information. Such objects can be used conveniently and safely in contexts in which their type cannot be deter- mined at compile time. Programs using objects of such types are often called object based. When used well, these techniques result in shorter, easier to understand, and easier to maintain programs. The key concept in C++ is class. A class is a user-deﬁned type. Classes provide data hiding, guaranteed initialization of data, implicit type conversion for user-deﬁned types, dynamic typing, user-controlled  memory  management,  and  mechanisms  for  overloading  operators. C++  provides much better facilities for type checking and for expressing modularity than C does. It also contains improvements that are not directly related to classes, including symbolic constants, inline substitu- tion of functions, default function arguments, overloaded function names, free store management operators,  and  a  reference  type. C++  retains  C’s ability  to  deal  efﬁciently  with  the  fundamental objects of the hardware  bits, bytes, words, addresses, etc. . This allows the user-deﬁned types to be implemented with a pleasing degree of efﬁciency.  C++ and its standard libraries are designed for portability. The current implementation will run on most systems that support C. C libraries can be used from a C++ program, and most tools that support programming in C can be used with C++.  This book is primarily intended to help serious programmers learn the language and use it for nontrivial projects. It provides a complete description of C++, many complete examples, and many more program fragments.   xiv  Preface to the First Edition  Acknowledgments C++ could never hav e matured without the constant use, suggestions, and constructive criticism of many friends and colleagues. In particular, Tom Cargill, Jim Coplien, Stu Feldman, Sandy Fraser, Steve Johnson, Brian Kernighan, Bart Locanthi, Doug McIlroy, Dennis Ritchie, Larry Rosler, Jerry Schwarz, and Jon Shopiro provided important ideas for development of the language. Dave  Pre- sotto wrote the current implementation of the stream I O library.  In  addition,  hundreds  of  people  contributed  to  the  development  of  C++  and  its  compiler  by sending  me  suggestions  for  improvements,  descriptions  of  problems  they had  encountered,  and compiler  errors. I can  mention  only  a  few:  Gary  Bishop,  Andrew Hume,  Tom  Karzes,  Victor Milenkovic, Rob Murray, Leonie Rose, Brian Schmult, and Gary Walker.  Many people  have  also  helped  with  the  production  of  this  book,  in  particular, Jon  Bentley, Laura Eaves, Brian Kernighan, Ted Kow alski, Steve Mahaney,  Jon Shopiro, and the participants in the C++ course held at Bell Labs, Columbus, Ohio, June 26-27, 1985. Murray Hill, New Jersey  Bjarne Stroustrup   Part I  Introduction  This introduction gives an overview of the major concepts and features of the C++ pro- gramming language and its standard library. It also provides an overview of this book and explains the approach taken to the description of the language facilities and their use.

Conversely, a pure reference manual can be accessed starting at any point; it describes each topic succinctly with references  forward and backward  to related topics.  A pure tutorial can in principle be read without prerequisites – it carefully describes all. A pure reference can be used only by someone familiar with all fundamental concepts and techniques. This book combines aspects of both. If you know most concepts and techniques, you can access it on a per-chapter or even on a per-section basis. If not, you can start at the beginning, but try not to get bogged down in details. Use the index and the cross-references.   4  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  Making parts of the book relatively self-contained implies some repetition, but repetition also serves as review for people reading the book linearly. The book is heavily cross-referenced both to itself  and  to  the  ISO  C++  standard. Experienced  programmers  can  read  the   relatively   quick ‘‘tour’’ of C++ to gain the overview needed to use the book as a reference. This book consists of four parts: Part I  Introduction: Chapter 1  this chapter  is a guide to this book and provides a bit of C++ background. Chapters 2-5 give  a  quick introduction to the C++ language and its standard library. Basic Facilities: Chapters 6-15 describe C++’s built-in types and the basic facili- ties for constructing programs out of them. Abstraction  Mechanisms: Chapters  16-29  describe  C++’s abstraction  mecha- nisms and their use for object-oriented and generic programming. Chapters 30-44 provide an overview of the standard library and a discussion of compatibility issues.  Part II  Part III  Part IV  1.1.1  Introduction This  chapter, Chapter  1,  provides  an  overview of this  book,  some  hints  about  how to use  it,  and some background information about C++ and its use. You are encouraged to skim through it, read what appears interesting, and return to it after reading other parts of the book. Please do not feel obliged to read it all carefully before proceeding.  The following chapters provide an overview of the major concepts and features of the C++ pro-  gramming language and its standard library:  Chapter 2  Chapter 3  Chapter 4  Chapter 5  A Tour of C++: The Basics describes C++’s model of memory, computation, and error handling. A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms presents the language features support- ing data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming. A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms introduces strings, simple I O, con- tainers, and algorithms as provided by the standard library. A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities outlines the standard-library utilities related to resource management, concurrency,  mathematical computation, regu- lar expressions, and more.  This whirlwind tour of C++’s facilities aims to give the reader a taste of what C++ offers.  In partic- ular, it should convince readers that C++ has come a long way since the ﬁrst, second, and third edi- tions of this book.  1.1.2  Basic Facilities Part II focuses on the subset of C++ that supports the styles of programming traditionally done in C and similar languages. It introduces the notions of type, object, scope, and storage. It presents the fundamentals  of  computation:  expressions,  statements,  and  functions. Modularity  –  as  supported by namespaces, source ﬁles, and exception handling – is also discussed:  Chapter 6  Types and Declarations: Fundamental types, naming, scopes, initialization, sim- ple type deduction, object lifetimes, and type aliases   Section 1.1.2  Basic Facilities   5  Chapter 7 Chapter 8 Chapter 9  Chapter 10  Chapter 11  Chapter 12  Chapter 13  Chapter 14  Chapter 15  Pointers, Arrays, and References Structures, Unions, and Enumerations Statements: Declarations as statements, selection statements  if and switch , itera- tion statements  for, while, and do , goto, and comments Expressions: A desk  calculator  example,  survey  of operators,  constant  expres- sions, and implicit type conversion. Select Operations: Logical operators, the conditional expression, increment and decrement, free store  new and delete , {}-lists, lambda expressions, and explicit type conversion  static_cast and const_cast  Functions: Function  declarations  and  deﬁnitions, inline functions, constexpr functions,  argument  passing,  overloaded  functions,  pre-  and  postconditions, pointers to functions, and macros Exception  Handling: Styles  of  error  handling,  exception  guarantees,  resource management, enforcing invariants, throw and catch, a vector implementation Namespaces: namespace, modularization and interface, composition using name- spaces Source  Files  and  Programs: Separate  compilation,  linkage,  using  header  ﬁles, and program start and termination  I assume that you are familiar with most of the programming concepts used in Part I. For example, I explain  the  C++  facilities  for  expressing  recursion  and  iteration,  but  I  do  not  go  into  technical details or spend much time explaining how these concepts are useful.  The exception to this rule is exceptions.  Many programmers lack experience with exceptions or got their experience from languages  such as Java  where resource management and exception han- dling are not integrated.  Consequently, the chapter on exception handling  Chapter 13  presents the basic philosophy of C++ exception handling and resource management. It goes into some detail about strategy with a focus on the ‘‘Resource Acquisition Is Initialization’’ technique  RAII .  1.1.3  Abstraction Mechanisms Part III describes the C++ facilities supporting various forms of abstraction, including object-ori- ented and generic programming. The chapters fall into three rough categories: classes, class hierar- chies, and templates.  The ﬁrst four chapters concentrate of the classes themselves: Chapter 16  Chapter 17  Chapter 18  Chapter 19  Classes: The notion of a user-deﬁned type, a class, is the foundation of all C++ abstraction mechanisms. Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move shows how a programmer can deﬁne the meaning of creation and initialization of objects of a class. Further, the meaning of copy, move, and destruction can be speciﬁed. Operator  Overloading presents  the  rules  for  giving  meaning  to  operators  for user-deﬁned types with an emphasis on conventional arithmetic and logical oper- ators, such as +, ∗, and &. Special Operators discusses the use of user-deﬁned operator for non-arithmetic purposes,  such  as [] for  subscripting,    for  function  objects,  and −> for  ‘‘smart pointers.’’   6  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  Classes can be organized into hierarchies:  Chapter 20  Chapter 21  Chapter 22  Chapter 23  Chapter 24  Chapter 25  Chapter 26 Chapter 27  Chapter 29  Many of the most ﬂexible, efﬁcient, and useful abstractions involve the parameterization of types  classes  and algorithms  functions  with other types and algorithms:  Derived Classes presents the basic language facilities for building hierarchies out of classes and the fundamental ways of using them. We  can provide complete separation  between  an  interface   an  abstract  class   and  its  implementations  derived classes ; the connection between them is provided by virtual functions. The C++ model for access control  public, protected, and private  is presented. Class  Hierarchies discusses  ways  of  using  class  hierarchies  effectively. It also presents the notion of multiple inheritance, that is, a class having more than one direct base class. Run-Time  Type  Information presents  ways  to  navigate  class  hierarchies  using data stored in objects. We  can use dynamic_cast to inquire whether an object of a base class was deﬁned as an object of a derived class and use the typeid to gain minimal information from an object  such as the name of its class .  Templates presents  the  basic  principles  behind  templates  and  their  use. Class templates, function templates, and template aliases are presented. Generic Programming introduces the basic techniques for designing generic pro- grams.  The technique of lifting an abstract algorithm from a number of concrete code examples is central, as is the notion of concepts specifying a generic algo- rithm’s requirements on its arguments. Specialization describes  how templates  are  used  to  generate  classes  and  func- tions, specializations, giv en a set of template arguments. Instantiation focuses on the rules for name binding. Templates and Hierarchies explains how templates and class hierarchies can be used in combination.  Chapter 28 Metaprogramming explores  how templates  can  be  used  to  generate  programs.  Templates provide a Turing-complete mechanism for generating code. A Matrix Design gives a longish example to show how language features can be used  in  combination  to  solve a complex design  problem:  the  design  of  an  N- dimensional matrix with near-arbitrary element types.  The language features supporting abstraction techniques are described in the context of those tech- niques.  The presentation technique in Part III differs from that of Part II in that I don’t assume that the reader knows the techniques described.  1.1.4  The Standard Library The library chapters are less tutorial than the language chapters. In particular, they are meant to be read in any order and can be used as a user-level manual for the library components:  Chapter 30  Chapter 31  Standard-Library  Overview gives an overview of the  standard  library, lists  the standard-library headers, and presents language support and diagnostics support, such as exception and system_error. STL Containers presents the containers from the iterators, containers, and algo- rithms framework  called the STL , including vector, map, and unordered_set.   Section 1.1.4  The Standard Library  7  Chapter 32  Chapter 33  STL  Algorithms presents  the  algorithms  from  the  STL,  including ﬁnd  , sort  , and merge  . STL  Iterators presents  iterators  and  other  utilities  from  the  STL,  including reverse_iterator, move_iterator, and function.  Chapter 37  Chapter 38  Chapter 35  Chapter 36  Chapter 34 Memory  and  Resources presents  utility  components  related  to  memory  and resource  management,  such  as array, bitset, pair, tuple, unique_ptr, shared_ptr, allocators, and the garbage collector interface. Utilities presents minor utility components, such as time utilities, type traits, and various type functions. Strings documents  the string library, including  the  character  traits  that  are  the basis for the use of different character sets. Regular  Expressions describes  the  regular  expression  syntax  and  the  various ways  of  using  it  for  string  matching,  including regex_match   for  matching  a complete  string, regex_search   for  ﬁnding  a  pattern  in  a  string, regex_replace   for  simple  replacement,  and regex_iterator for  general  traversal  of  a  stream  of characters. I O Streams documents the stream I O library. It describes formatted and unfor- matted input and output, error handling, and buffering. Locales describes class locale and its various facets that provide support for the handling of cultural differences in character sets, formatting of numeric values, formatting of date and time, and more. Numerics describes  facilities  for  numerical  computation   such  as complex, valarray, random numbers, and generalized numerical algorithms . Concurrency presents the C++ basic memory model and the facilities offered for concurrent programming without locks. Threads and Tasks presents the classes providing threads-and-locks-style concur- rent  programming   such  as thread, timed_mutex, lock_guard, and try_lock    and the support for task-based concurrency  such as future and async   . The C Standard Library documents the C standard library  including printf   and clock    as incorporated into the C++ standard library. Compatibility discusses the relation between C and C++ and between Standard C++  also called ISO C++  and the versions of C++ that preceded it.  Chapter 40  Chapter 39  Chapter 44  Chapter 41  Chapter 42  Chapter 43  1.1.5  Examples and References This book emphasizes program organization rather than the design of algorithms. Consequently, I avoid  clever or harder-to-understand  algorithms. A trivial  algorithm  is  typically  better  suited  to illustrate an aspect of the language deﬁnition or a point about program structure. For example, I use a Shell sort where, in real code, a quicksort would be better. Often, reimplementation with a more suitable algorithm is an exercise.  In real code, a call of a library function is typically more appropriate than the code used here to illustrate language features.  Te xtbook examples necessarily give a warped view of software development.  By clarifying and simplifying the examples, the complexities that arise from scale disappear. I see no substitute for writing  realistically  sized  programs  in  order  to  get  an  impression  of  what  programming  and  a   8  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  programming  language  are  really  like.  This book  concentrates  on  the  language  features  and  the standard-library facilities.  These are the basic techniques from which every program is composed. The rules and techniques for such composition are emphasized.  The selection of examples reﬂects my background in compilers, foundation libraries, and simu- lations.  The emphasis reﬂects my interest in systems programming. Examples are simpliﬁed ver- sions of what is found in real code. The simpliﬁcation is necessary to keep programming language and design points from getting lost in details. My ideal is the shortest and clearest example that illustrates a design principle, a programming technique, a language construct, or a library feature. There  are  no  ‘‘cute’’ examples  without  counterparts  in  real  code. For purely  language-technical examples, I use variables named x and y, types called A and B, and functions called f   and g  .  Where possible, the C++ language and library features are presented in the context of their use rather than in the dry manner of a manual. The language features presented and the detail in which they are described roughly reﬂect my view of what is needed for effective use of C++. The purpose is to give you an idea of how a feature can be used, often in combination with other features. An understanding of every language-technical detail of a language feature or library component is nei- ther necessary nor sufﬁcient for writing good programs. In fact, an obsession with understanding ev ery  little  detail  is  a  prescription  for  awful  –  overelaborate  and  overly  clever – code.  What is needed is an understanding of design and programming techniques together with an appreciation of application domains.  I assume that you have access to online information sources. The ﬁnal arbiter of language and  standard-library rules is the ISO C++ standard [C++,2011].  References to parts of this book are of the form §2.3.4  Chapter 2, section 3, subsection 4  and §iso.5.3.1  ISO C++ standard, §5.3.1 . Italics are used sparingly for emphasis  e.g., ‘‘a string literal is not acceptable’’ , for ﬁrst occurrences of important concepts  e.g., polymorphism , and for com- ments in code examples.  To sav e a few trees and to simplify additions, the hundreds of exercises for this book have been  moved to the Web. Look for them at www.stroustrup.com.  The  language  and  library  used  in  this  book  are  ‘‘pure  C++’’ as deﬁned  by  the  C++  standard [C++,2011].  Therefore, the  examples  should  run  on  every  up-to-date  C++  implementation. The major  program  fragments  in  this  book  were  tried  using  several  C++  implementations. Examples using features only recently adopted into C++ didn’t compile on every implementation. However, I see no point in mentioning which implementations failed to compile which examples.  Such infor- mation  would  soon  be  out  of  date  because  implementers  are  working  hard  to  ensure  that  their implementations  correctly  accept  every  C++  feature. See  Chapter  44  for  suggestions  on  how to cope with older C++ compilers and with code written for C compilers.  I use  C++11  features  freely  wherever I  ﬁnd  them  most  appropriate. For example,  I  prefer {}-style initializers and using for type aliases. In places, that usage may startle ‘‘old timers.’’  How- ev er, being startled is often a good way to start reviewing material. On the other hand, I don’t use new features just because they are new; my ideal is the most elegant expression of the fundamental ideas – and that may very well be using something that has been in C++ or even in C for ages.  Obviously, if you have to use a pre-C++11 compiler  say, because some of your customers have not yet upgraded to the current standard , you have to refrain from using novel features.  However, please don’t assume that ‘‘the old ways’’ are better or simpler just because they are old and familiar. §44.2 summarizes the differences between C++98 and C++11.   Section 1.2  The Design of C++  9  1.2  The Design of C++ The purpose of a programming language is to help express ideas in code. In that, a programming language performs two related tasks: it provides a vehicle for the programmer to specify actions to be  executed  by  the  machine,  and  it  provides  a  set  of  concepts  for  the  programmer  to  use  when thinking about what can be done. The ﬁrst purpose ideally requires a language that is ‘‘close to the machine’’ so that all important aspects of a machine are handled simply and efﬁciently in a way that is reasonably obvious to the programmer. The C language was primarily designed with this in mind.  The second purpose ideally requires a language that is ‘‘close to the problem to be solved’’ so that the concepts of a solution can be expressed directly and concisely. The facilities added to C to  create  C++,  such  as  function  argument  checking, const, classes,  constructors  and  destructors, exceptions, and templates, were primarily designed with this in mind. Thus, C++ is based on the idea of providing both   cid:129    cid:129   direct  mappings  of  built-in  operations  and  types  to  hardware to  provide  efﬁcient  memory use and efﬁcient low-level operations, and affordable and ﬂexible abstraction mechanisms to provide user-deﬁned types with the same notational support, range of uses, and performance as built-in types.  This was initially achieved by applying ideas from Simula to C. Over the years, further application of  these  simple  ideals  resulted  in  a  far  more  general,  efﬁcient,  and  ﬂexible  set  of  facilities.  The result supports a synthesis of programming styles that can be simultaneously efﬁcient and elegant.  The design of C++ has focused on programming techniques dealing with fundamental notions such as memory, mutability, abstraction, resource management, expression of algorithms, error han- dling, and modularity. Those are the most important concerns of a systems programmer and more generally of programmers of resource-constrained and high-performance systems.  By deﬁning libraries of classes, class hierarchies, and templates, you can write C++ programs at a much higher level than the one presented in this book. For example, C++ is widely used in ﬁnan- cial systems, for game development, and for scientiﬁc computation  §1.4.5 . For high-level appli- cations  programming  to  be  effective  and  convenient,  we  need  libraries. Using  just  the  bare  lan- guage features makes almost all programming quite painful. That’s true for every general-purpose language.  Conversely, giv en suitable libraries just about any programming task can be pleasant.  My standard introduction of C++ used to start:  cid:129  C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias toward systems programming. This  is  still  true. What  has  changed  over the  years  is  an  increase  in  the  importance,  power, and ﬂexibility of C++’s abstraction mechanisms:   cid:129  C++ is a general-purpose programming language pro viding a direct and efﬁcient model of  hardware combined with facilities for deﬁning lightweight abstractions.  Or terser:   cid:129  C++ is a language for developing and using elegant and efﬁcient abstractions.  By general-purpose programming language I mean a language designed to support a wide variety of uses. C++ has indeed been used for an incredible variety of uses  from microcontrollers to huge distributed commercial applications , but the key  point is that C++ is not deliberately specialized for any giv en application area. No language is ideal for every application and every programmer, but the ideal for C++ is to support the widest possible range of application areas well.   10  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  By systems programming I mean writing code that directly uses hardware resources, has serious resource constraints, or closely interacts with code that does. In particular, the implementation of software  infrastructure   e.g.,  device  drivers,  communications  stacks,  virtual  machines,  operating systems, operations systems, programming environments, and foundation libraries  is mostly sys- tems  programming. The  importance  of  the  ‘‘bias  toward  systems  programming’’ qualiﬁcation  in my long-standing characterization of C++ is that C++ has not been simpliﬁed  compromised  by ejecting the facilities aimed at the expert-level use of hardware and systems resources in the hope of making it more suitable for other application areas.  Of course, you can also program in ways that completely hide hardware, use expensive abstrac- tions  e.g., every object on the free store and every operation a virtual function , use inelegant styles  e.g.,  overabstraction ,  or  use  essentially  no  abstractions   ‘‘gloriﬁed  assembly  code’’ .  However, many languages can do that, so those are not distinguishing characteristics of C++.  The Design and Evolution of C++ book [Stroustrup,1994]  known as D&E  outlines the ideas  and design aims of C++ in greater detail, but two principles should be noted:   cid:129  Leave  no  room  for  a  lower-level  language below  C++  except  for  assembly  code  in  rare cases .  If you  can  write  more  efﬁcient  code  in  a  lower-level language  then  that  language will most likely become the systems programming language of choice.   cid:129  What you don’t use you don’t pay for. If programmers can hand-write reasonable code to simulate  a  language  feature  or  a  fundamental  abstraction  and  provide  even slightly  better performance, someone will do so, and many will imitate. Therefore, a language feature and a fundamental abstraction must be designed not to waste a single byte or a single processor cycle compared to equivalent alternatives.  This is known as the zero-overhead principle.  These are Draconian principles, but essential in some  but obviously not all  contexts.  In particular, the zero-overhead principle repeatedly led C++ to simpler, more elegant, and more powerful facili- ties than were ﬁrst envisioned.  The STL is an example  §4.1.1, §4.4, §4.5, Chapter 31, Chapter 32, Chapter 33 . These principles have been essential in the effort to raise the level of programming.  1.2.1  Programming Style Languages features exist to provide support for programming styles. Please don’t look at an indi- vidual language feature as a solution, but as one building brick from a varied set which can be com- bined to express solutions.  The general ideals for design and programming can be expressed simply:  cid:129  Express ideas directly in code.  cid:129  Express independent ideas independently in code.  cid:129  Represent relationships among ideas directly in code.  cid:129  Combine ideas expressed in code freely – where and only where combinations make sense.  cid:129  Express simple ideas simply.  These are ideals shared by many people, but languages designed to support them can differ dramat- ically. A fundamental  reason  for  that  is  that  a  language  embodies  a  set  of  engineering  tradeoffs reﬂecting  differing  needs,  tastes,  and  histories  of  various  individuals  and  communities. C++’s answers to the general design challenges were shaped by its origins in systems programming  going back  to  C  and  BCPL  [Richards,1980] ,  its  aim  to  address  issues  of  program  complexity  through abstraction  going back to Simula , and its history.   Section 1.2.1  Programming Style  11  The C++ language features most directly support four programming styles:  cid:129  Procedural programming  cid:129  Data abstraction  cid:129  Object-oriented programming  cid:129  Generic programming  However, the emphasis is on the support of effective combinations of those. The best  most main- tainable, most readable, smallest, fastest, etc.  solution to most nontrivial problems tends to be one that combines aspects of these styles.  As is usual with important terms in the computing world, a wide variety of deﬁnitions of these terms are popular in various parts of the computing industry and academia. For example, what I refer to as a ‘‘programming style,’’ others call a ‘‘programming technique’’ or a ‘‘paradigm.’’  I pre- fer  to  use  ‘‘programming  technique’’ for  something  more  limited  and  language-speciﬁc. I feel uncomfortable with the word ‘‘paradigm’’ as pretentious and  from Kuhn’s original deﬁnition  hav- ing implied claims of exclusivity.  My ideal is language facilities that can be used elegantly in combination to support a continuum  of programming styles and a wide variety of programming techniques.   cid:129  Procedural  programming: This  is  programming  focused  on  processing  and  the  design  of suitable data structures. It is what C was designed to support  and Algol, and Fortran, as well as many other languages . C++’s support comes in the form of the built-in types, oper- ators,  statements,  functions, structs, unions,  etc. With  minor  exceptions,  C  is  a  subset  of C++.  Compared to  C,  C++  provides  further  support  for  procedural  programming  in  the form of many additional language constructs and a stricter, more ﬂexible, and more support- iv e type system.   cid:129  Data abstraction: This is programming focused on the design of interfaces, hiding imple- mentation  details  in  general  and  representations  in  particular. C++  supports  concrete  and abstract classes. The facilities for deﬁning classes with private implementation details, con- structors and destructors, and associated operations directly support this. The notion of an abstract class provides direct support for complete data hiding.   cid:129  Object-oriented programming: This is programming focused on the design, implementation, and use of class hierarchies. In addition to allowing the deﬁnition lattices of classes, C++ provides a variety of features for navigating class lattices and for simplifying the deﬁnition of a class out of existing ones. Class hierarchies provide run-time polymorphism  §20.3.2, §21.2  and encapsulation  §20.4, §20.5 .   cid:129  Generic programming: This is programming focused on the design, implementation, and use of general algorithms. Here, ‘‘general’’ means that an algorithm can be designed to accept a wide variety of types as long as they meet the algorithm’s requirements on its arguments. The template is C++’s main support for generic programming. Templates provide  compile- time  parametric polymorphism.  Just about anything that increases the ﬂexibility or efﬁciency of classes improves the support of all of those styles. Thus, C++ could be  and has been  called class oriented.  Each of these styles of design and programming has contributed to the synthesis that is C++. Focusing exclusively on one of these styles is a mistake: except for toy examples, doing so leads to wasted development effort and suboptimal  inﬂexible, verbose, poorly performing, unmaintainable, etc.  code.   12  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  I wince when someone characterizes C++ exclusively through one of these styles  e.g., ‘‘C++ is an object-oriented language’’  or uses a term  e.g., ‘‘hybrid’’ or ‘‘mixed paradigm’’  to imply that a more restrictive language would be preferable. The former misses the fact that all the styles men- tioned have contributed something signiﬁcant to the synthesis; the latter denies the validity of the synthesis.  The styles mentioned are not distinct alternatives: each contributes techniques to a more expressive and effective style of programming, and C++ provides direct language support for their use in combination.  From its inception, the design of C++ aimed at a synthesis of programming and design styles. Even the earliest published account of C++ [Stroustrup,1982] presents examples that use these dif- ferent styles in combination and presents language features aimed at supporting such combinations:  cid:129  Classes support all of the mentioned styles; all rely on the user representing ideas as user-  deﬁned types or objects of user-deﬁned types.   cid:129  Public private access control supports data abstraction and object-oriented programming by  making a clear distinction between interface and implementation.   cid:129  Member  functions,  constructors,  destructors,  and  user-deﬁned  assignment provide  a  clean functional  interface  to  objects  as  needed  by  data  abstraction  and  object-oriented  program- ming.  They also  provide  a  uniform  notation  as  needed  for  generic  programming. More general overloading had to wait until 1984 and uniform initialization until 2010.   cid:129  Function declarations provide speciﬁc statically checked interfaces to member functions as well as freestanding functions, so they support all of the mentioned styles. They are neces- sary for overloading.  At the time, C lacked ‘‘function prototypes’’ but Simula had function declarations as well as member functions.   cid:129  Generic  functions  and  parameterized  types  generated  from  functions  and  classes  using  macros  support generic programming. Templates had to wait until 1988.   cid:129  Base and derived classes provide the foundation for object-oriented programming and some   cid:129   forms of data abstraction. Virtual functions had to wait until 1983. Inlining made the use of these facilities affordable in systems programming and for building run-time and space efﬁcient libraries.  These early features are general abstraction mechanisms, rather than support for disjoint program- ming  styles. Today’s C++  provides  much  better  support  for  design  and  programming  based  on lightweight abstraction, but the aim of elegant and efﬁcient code was there from the very beginning. The  developments  since  1981  provide  much  better  support  for  the  synthesis  of  the  programming styles  ‘‘paradigms’’  originally considered and signiﬁcantly improve their integration.  The fundamental object in C++ has identity; that is, it is located in a speciﬁc location in mem- ory  and  can  be  distinguished  from  other  objects  with   potentially   the  same  value  by  comparing addresses.  Expressions denoting  such  objects  are  called lvalues  §6.4 .  However,  even from  the earliest  days  of  C++’s ancestors  [Barron,1963]  there  have  also  been  objects  without  identity  objects for which an address cannot be safely stored for later use . In C++11, this notion of rvalue has  been  developed  into  a  notion  of  a  value  that  can  be  moved around  cheaply   §3.3.2,  §6.4.1, §7.7.2 .  Such objects  are  the  basis  of  techniques  that  resemble  what  is  found  in  functional  pro- gramming  where the notion of objects with identity is viewed with horror . This nicely comple- ments  the  techniques  and  language  features   e.g.,  lambda  expressions   developed  primarily  for generic  programming. It  also  solves  classical  problems  related  to  ‘‘simple  abstract  data  types,’’ such as how to elegantly and efﬁciently return a large matrix from an operation  e.g., a matrix + .   Section 1.2.1  Programming Style  13  From the very earliest days, C++ programs and the design of C++ itself have been concerned  about resource management. The ideal was  and is  for resource management to be   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   simple  for implementers and especially for users , general  a resource is anything that has to be acquired from somewhere and later released , efﬁcient  obey the zero-overhead principle; §1.2 , perfect  no leaks are acceptable , and statically type-safe.  Many important C++ classes, such as the standard library’s vector, string, thread, mutex, unique_ptr, fstream, and regex, are resource handles. Foundation and application libraries beyond the standard provided  many more  examples,  such  as  Matrix  and  Widget.  The initial  step  in  supporting  the notion of resource handles was taken with the provision of constructors and destructors in the very ﬁrst  ‘‘C  with  Classes’’ draft.  This was soon  backed  with  the  ability  to  control  copy by deﬁning assignment as well as copy constructors.  The introduction of move constructors and move assign- ments  §3.3  in C++11 completes this line of thinking by allowing cheap movement of potentially large  objects  from  scope  to  scope   §3.3.2   and  to  simply  control  the  lifetime  of  polymorphic  or shared objects  §5.2.1 .  The  facilities  supporting  resource  management  also  beneﬁt  abstractions  that  are  not  resource  handles.  Any class that establishes and maintains an invariant relies on a subset of those features.  1.2.2  Type Checking The connection between the language in which we think program and the problems and solutions we can imagine is very close. For this reason, restricting language features with the intent of elimi- nating programmer errors is, at best, dangerous. A language provides a programmer with a set of conceptual  tools;  if  these  are  inadequate  for  a  task,  they will  be  ignored. Good  design  and  the absence of errors cannot be guaranteed merely by the presence or absence of speciﬁc language fea- tures.  However, the language features and the type system are provided for the programmer to pre- cisely and concisely represent a design in code.  The  notion  of  static  types  and  compile-time  type  checking  is  central  to  effective  use  of  C++. The use of static types is key to expressiveness, maintainability, and performance. Following Sim- ula, the design of user-deﬁned types with interfaces that are checked at compile time is key to the expressiveness of C++. The C++ type system is extensible in nontrivial ways  Chapter 3, Chapter 16, Chapter 18, Chapter 19, Chapter 21, Chapter 23, Chapter 28, Chapter 29 , aiming for equal sup- port for built-in types and user-deﬁned types.  C++ type-checking and data-hiding features rely on compile-time analysis of programs to pre- vent accidental corruption of data. They do not provide secrecy or protection against someone who is deliberately breaking the rules: C++ protects against accident, not against fraud. They can, how- ev er, be used freely without incurring run-time or space overheads.  The idea is that to be useful, a language feature must not only be elegant, it must also be affordable in the context of a real-world program.  C++’s static type system is ﬂexible, and the use of simple user-deﬁned types implies little, if any overhead.  The aim is to support a style of programming that represents distinct ideas as dis- tinct  types,  rather  than  just  using  generalizations,  such  as  integer, ﬂoating-point  number, string, ‘‘raw memory,’’ and  ‘‘object,’’  everywhere.  A type-rich  style  of  programming  makes  code  more   14  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  readable, maintainable, and analyzable. A trivial type system allows only trivial analysis, whereas a type-rich style of programming opens opportunities for nontrivial error detection and optimiza- tion.  C++ compilers and development tools support such type-based analysis [Stroustrup,2012].  Maintaining most of C as a subset and preserving the direct mapping to hardware needed for the most demanding low-level systems programming tasks implies the ability to break the static type system.  However, my ideal is  and always was  complete type safety. In this, I agree with Dennis Ritchie, who said, ‘‘C is a strongly typed, weakly checked language.’’  Note that Simula was both type-safe and ﬂexible.  In fact, my ideal when I started on C++ was ‘‘Algol68 with Classes’’ rather than  ‘‘C  with  Classes.’’  Howev er,  the  list  of  solid  reasons  against  basing  my  work  on  type-safe Algol68 [Woodward,1974] was long and painful. So, perfect type safety is an ideal that C++ as a language  can  only  approximate. But  it  is  an  ideal  that  C++  programmers   especially  library builders  can strive for. Over the years, the set of language features, standard-library components, and techniques supporting that ideal has grown.  Outside of low-level sections of code  hopefully isolated  by  type-safe  interfaces ,  code  that  interfaces  to  code  obeying  different  language  conven- tions  e.g., an operating system call interface , and the implementations of fundamental abstractions  e.g., string and vector , there is now little need for type-unsafe code.  1.2.3  C Compatibility C++  was  developed  from  the  C  programming  language  and,  with  few exceptions,  retains  C  as  a subset.  The main  reasons  for  relying  on  C  were  to  build  on  a  proven set  of  low-level language facilities  and  to  be  part  of  a  technical  community. Great  importance  was  attached  to  retaining  a high degree of compatibility with C [Koenig,1989] [Stroustrup,1994]  Chapter 44 ; this  unfortu- nately  precluded cleaning up the C syntax. The continuing, more or less parallel evolution of C and C++ has been a constant source of concern and requires constant attention [Stroustrup,2002]. Having two committees devoted to keeping two widely used languages ‘‘as compatible as possible’’ is not a particularly good way of organizing work.  In particular, there are differences in opinion as to  the  value  of  compatibility, differences  in  opinion  on  what  constitutes  good  programming,  and differences in opinion on what support is needed for good programming. Just keeping up commu- nication between the committees is a large amount of work.  One hundred percent C C++ compatibility was never a goal for C++ because that would com- promise  type  safety  and  the  smooth  integration  of  user-deﬁned  and  built-in  types. However,  the deﬁnition of C++ has been repeatedly reviewed to remove gratuitous incompatibilities; C++ is now more compatible with C than it was originally. C++98 adopted many details from C89  §44.3.1 . When C then evolved from C89 [C,1990] to C99 [C,1999], C++ adopted almost all of the new fea- tures,  leaving  out  VLAs   variable-length  arrays   as  a  misfeature  and  designated  initializers  as redundant.  C’s facilities for low-level systems programming tasks are retained and enhanced; for example, see inlining  §3.2.1.1, §12.1.5, §16.2.8  and constexpr  §2.2.3, §10.4, §12.1.6 .  Conversely, modern  C  has  adopted   with  varying  degrees  of  faithfulness  and  effectiveness   many features from C++  e.g., const, function prototypes, and inlining; see [Stroustrup,2002] .  The deﬁnition of C++ has been revised to ensure that a construct that is both legal C and legal  C++ has the same meaning in both languages  §44.3 .  One of the original aims for C was to replace assembly coding for the most demanding systems programming tasks. When C++ was designed, care was taken not to compromise the gains in this   Section 1.2.3  C Compatibility   15  area.  The difference between C and C++ is primarily in the degree of emphasis on types and struc- ture.  C is expressive and permissive. Through extensive use of the type system, C++ is even more expressive without loss of performance.  Knowing C is not a prerequisite for learning C++. Programming in C encourages many tech- niques and tricks that are rendered unnecessary by C++ language features. For example, explicit type conversion  casting  is less frequently needed in C++ than it is in C  §1.3.3 . However, good C programs tend to be C++ programs. For example, every program in Kernighan and Ritchie, The C Pro gramming Language, Second Edition [Kernighan,1988], is a C++ program. Experience with any statically typed language will be a help when learning C++.  1.2.4  Language, Libraries, and Systems The C++ fundamental  built-in  types, operators, and statements are those that computer hardware deals with directly: numbers, characters, and addresses. C++ has no built-in high-level data types and no high-level primitive operations.  For example, the C++ language does not provide a matrix type with an inversion operator or a string type with a concatenation operator. If a user wants such a type, it can be deﬁned in the language itself. In fact, deﬁning a new general-purpose or applica- tion-speciﬁc  type  is  the  most  fundamental  programming  activity  in  C++. A well-designed  user- deﬁned type differs from a built-in type only in the way it is deﬁned, not in the way it is used. The C++ standard library  Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 30, Chapter 31, etc.  provides many examples of such types and their uses. From a user’s point of view, there is little difference between a built-in type and a type provided by the standard library. Except for a few unfortunate and unimportant his- torical accidents, the C++ standard library is written in C++. Writing the C++ standard library in C++ is a crucial test of the C++ type system and abstraction mechanisms: they must be  and are  sufﬁciently  powerful   expressive  and  efﬁcient   affordable   for  the  most  demanding  systems  pro- gramming tasks. This ensures that they can be used in large systems that typically consist of layer upon layer of abstraction.  Features that would incur run-time or memory overhead even when not used were avoided.  For example,  constructs  that  would  make it necessary  to  store  ‘‘housekeeping  information’’ in every object were rejected, so if a user declares a structure consisting of two 16-bit quantities, that struc- ture will ﬁt into a 32-bit register. Except for the new, delete, typeid, dynamic_cast, and throw opera- tors, and the try-block, individual C++ expressions and statements need no run-time support. This can be essential for embedded and high-performance applications. In particular, this implies that the C++ abstraction mechanisms are usable for embedded, high-performance, high-reliability, and real-time applications. So, programmers of such applications don’t hav e to work with a low-level  error-prone, impoverished, and unproductive  set of language features.  C++ was designed to be used in a traditional compilation and run-time environment: the C pro- gramming environment on the UNIX system [UNIX,1985]. Fortunately, C++ was never restricted to UNIX; it simply used UNIX and C as a model for the relationships among language, libraries, compilers, linkers, execution environments, etc. That minimal model helped C++ to be successful on essentially every computing platform. There are, however, good reasons for using C++ in envi- ronments  that  provide  signiﬁcantly  more  run-time  support. Facilities  such  as  dynamic  loading, incremental compilation, and a database of type deﬁnitions can be put to good use without affecting the language.   16  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  Not every piece of code can be well structured, hardware-independent, easy to read, etc. C++ possesses  features  that  are  intended  for  manipulating  hardware  facilities  in  a  direct  and  efﬁcient way without concerns for safety or ease of comprehension. It also possesses facilities for hiding such code behind elegant and safe interfaces.  Naturally, the use of C++ for larger programs leads to the use of C++ by groups of program- mers.  C++’s emphasis on modularity, strongly typed interfaces, and ﬂexibility pays off here.  How- ev er, as programs get larger, the problems associated with their development and maintenance shift from being language problems to being more global problems of tools and management.  This  book  emphasizes  techniques  for  providing  general-purpose  facilities,  generally  useful types, libraries, etc. These techniques will serve programmers of small programs as well as pro- grammers of large ones. Furthermore, because all nontrivial programs consist of many semi-inde- pendent parts, the techniques for writing such parts serve programmers of all applications.  I use the implementation and use of standard-library components, such as vector, as examples. This introduces library components and their underlying design concepts and implementation tech- niques.  Such examples show how  programmers might design and implement their own libraries. However, if the standard library provides a component that addresses a problem, it is almost always better to use that component than to build your own.  Even if the standard component is arguably slightly  inferior  to  a  home-built  component  for  a  particular  problem,  the  standard  component  is likely  to  be  more  widely  applicable,  more  widely  available,  and  more  widely  known.  Over  the longer term, the standard component  possibly accessed through a convenient custom interface  is likely to lower long-term maintenance, porting, tuning, and education costs.  You might  suspect  that  specifying  a  program  by  using  a  more  detailed  type  structure  would increase the size of the program source text  or even the size of the generated code . With C++, this is not so. A C++ program declaring function argument types, using classes, etc., is typically a bit shorter than the equivalent C program not using these facilities.  Where libraries are used, a C++ program will appear much shorter than its C equivalent, assuming, of course, that a functioning C equivalent could have been built.  C++ supports systems programming. This implies that C++ code is able to effectively interop- erate with software written in other languages on a system. The idea of writing all software in a single  language  is  a  fantasy. From  the  beginning,  C++  was  designed  to  interoperate  simply  and efﬁciently with C, assembler, and Fortran.  By that, I meant that a C++, C, assembler, or Fortran function could call functions in the other languages without extra overhead or conversion of data structures passed among them.  C++ was designed to operate within a single address space. The use of multiple processes and multiple  address  spaces  relied  on   extralinguistic   operating  system  support. In  particular, I assumed that a C++ programmer would have  the operating systems command language available for composing processes into a system. Initially, I relied on the UNIX Shell for that, but just about any ‘‘scripting language’’ will do. Thus, C++ provided no support for multiple address spaces and no support for multiple processes, but it was used for systems relying on those features from the earliest days. C++ was designed to be part of large, concurrent, multilanguage systems.   Section 1.3  Learning C++  17  1.3  Learning C++ No  programming  language  is  perfect. Fortunately, a programming  language  does  not  have  to be perfect to be a good tool for building great systems. In fact, a general-purpose programming lan- guage cannot be perfect for all of the many tasks to which it is put. What is perfect for one task is often seriously ﬂawed for another because perfection in one area implies specialization. Thus, C++ was designed to be a good tool for building a wide variety of systems and to allow a wide variety of ideas to be expressed directly.  Not everything can be expressed directly using the built-in features of a language. In fact, that isn’t even the ideal. Language features exist to support a variety of programming styles and tech- niques.  Consequently, the task of learning a language should focus on mastering the native and nat- ural styles for that language – not on understanding of every little detail of every language feature. Writing  programs  is  essential;  understanding  a  programming  language  is  not  just  an  intellectual exercise.  Practical application of ideas is necessary.  In practical programming, there is little advantage in knowing the most obscure language fea- tures or using the largest number of features. A single language feature in isolation is of little inter- est.  Only in  the  context  provided  by  techniques  and  by  other  features  does  the  feature  acquire meaning  and  interest. Thus,  when  reading  the  following  chapters,  please  remember  that  the  real purpose of examining the details of C++ is to be able to use language features and library facilities in concert to support good programming styles in the context of sound designs.  No  signiﬁcant  system  is  built  exclusively  in  terms  of  the  language  features  themselves.  We build and use libraries to simplify the task of programming and to increase the quality of our sys- tems.  We use  libraries  to  improve maintainability, portability, and  performance. Fundamental application concepts are represented as abstractions  e.g., classes, templates, and class hierarchies  in libraries. Many of the most fundamental programming concepts are represented in the standard library. Thus, learning the standard library is an integral part of learning C++. The standard library is the repository of much hard-earned knowledge of how to use C++ well.  C++ is widely used for teaching and research. This has surprised some who – correctly – point  out that C++ isn’t the smallest or cleanest language ever designed.  It is, however:   cid:129  Sufﬁciently clean for successfully teaching basic design and programming concepts  cid:129  Sufﬁciently comprehensive to be a vehicle for teaching advanced concepts and techniques  cid:129  Sufﬁciently realistic, efﬁcient, and ﬂexible for demanding projects  cid:129  Sufﬁciently commercial to be a vehicle for putting what is learned into nonacademic use  cid:129  Sufﬁciently  available  for  organizations  and  collaborations  relying  on  diverse  development  and execution environments  C++ is a language that you can grow with.  The most important thing to do when learning C++ is to focus on fundamental concepts  such as  type  safety, resource  management,  and  invariants   and  programming  techniques   such  as resource management using scoped objects and the use of iterators in algorithms  and not get lost in language-technical details. The purpose of learning a programming language is to become a better programmer, that is, to become more effective at designing and implementing new systems and at maintaining old ones. For this, an appreciation of programming and design techniques is far more important  than  understanding  all  the  details. The  understanding  of  technical  details  comes  with time and practice.   18  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  C++ programming is based on strong static type checking, and most techniques aim at achiev- ing a high level of abstraction and a direct representation of the programmer’s ideas.  This can usu- ally  be  done  without  compromising  run-time  and  space  efﬁciency compared  to  lower-level tech- niques.  To gain  the  beneﬁts  of  C++,  programmers  coming  to  it  from  a  different  language  must learn and internalize idiomatic C++ programming style and technique. The same applies to pro- grammers used to earlier and less expressive versions of C++.  Thoughtlessly applying techniques effective in one language to another typically leads to awk- ward, poorly performing, and hard-to-maintain code. Such code is also most frustrating to write because every line of code and every compiler error message reminds the programmer that the lan- guage used differs from ‘‘the old language.’’  You can write in the style of Fortran, C, Lisp, Java, etc., in any language, but doing so is neither pleasant nor economical in a language with a different philosophy.  Every  language  can  be  a  fertile  source  of  ideas  about  how to write  C++  programs. However,  ideas  must  be  transformed  into  something  that  ﬁts  with  the  general  structure  and  type system  of  C++  in  order  to  be  effective  in C++.  Over  the  basic  type  system  of  a  language,  only Pyrrhic victories are possible.  In the continuing debate on whether one needs to learn C before C++, I am ﬁrmly convinced that it is best to go directly to C++. C++ is safer and more expressive, and it reduces the need to focus on low-level techniques.  It is easier for you to learn the trickier parts of C that are needed to compensate for its lack of higher-level facilities after you have been exposed to the common subset of C and C++ and to some of the higher-level techniques supported directly in C++. Chapter 44 is a guide for programmers going from C++ to C, say, to deal with legacy code.  My opinion on how to teach C++ to novices is represented by [Stroustrup,2008].  There are several independently developed implementations of C++. They are supported by a wealth of tools, libraries, and software development environments.  To help master all of this you can ﬁnd textbooks, manuals, and a bewildering variety of online resources. If you plan to use C++ seriously, I strongly  suggest  that  you  obtain  access  to  several  such  sources. Each  has  its  own emphasis and bias, so use at least two.  1.3.1  Programming in C++ The question ‘‘How does one write good programs in C++?’’ is very similar to the question ‘‘How does one write good English prose?’’ There are two answers: ‘‘Know what you want to say’’ and ‘‘Practice.  Imitate good writing.’’  Both appear to be as appropriate for C++ as they are for English – and as hard to follow.  The main ideal for C++ programming – as for programming in most higher-level languages – is to express concepts  ideas, notions, etc.  from a design directly in code. We  try to ensure that the concepts we talk about, represent with boxes and arrows on our whiteboard, and ﬁnd in our  non- programming  textbooks have direct and obvious counterparts in our programs:  [1]  Represent ideas directly in code. [2]  Represent relationships among ideas directly in code  e.g., hierarchical, parametric, and  ownership relationships .  [3]  Represent independent ideas independently in code. [4]  Keep simple things simple  without making complex things impossible .   Section 1.3.1  More speciﬁcally:  Programming in C++  19  [5]  Prefer statically type-checked solutions  when applicable . [6]  Keep information local  e.g., avoid global variables, minimize the use of pointers . [7]  Don’t overabstract   i.e.,  don’t generalize,  introduce  class  hierarchies,  or  parameterize  beyond obvious needs and experience .  More speciﬁc suggestions are listed in §1.3.2.  1.3.2  Suggestions for C++ Programmers By now,  many people have been using C++ for a decade or two.  Many more are using C++ in a single environment and have  learned to live  with the restrictions imposed by early compilers and ﬁrst-generation libraries. Often, what an experienced C++ programmer has failed to notice over the years  is  not  the  introduction  of  new features  as  such,  but  rather  the  changes  in  relationships between  features  that  make fundamental  new programming  techniques  feasible. In  other  words, what  you  didn’t think  of  when  ﬁrst  learning  C++  or  found  impractical  just  might  be  a  superior approach today. You ﬁnd out only by reexamining the basics.  Read through the chapters in order. If you already know the contents of a chapter, you can be done  in  minutes. If  you  don’t already  know the  contents,  you’ll  have  learned  something  unex- pected.  I learned a fair bit writing this book, and I suspect that hardly any C++ programmer knows ev ery feature and technique presented. Furthermore, to use the language well, you need a perspec- tive that brings order to the set of features and techniques. Through its organization and examples, this book offers such a perspective.  Take  the  opportunity  offered  by  the  new C++11  facilities  to  modernize  your  design  and  pro-  gramming techniques:  [1]  Use constructors to establish invariants  §2.4.3.2, §13.4, §17.2.1 . [2]  Use constructor destructor pairs to simplify resource management  RAII; §5.2, §13.3 . [3]  Avoid ‘‘naked’’ new and delete  §3.2.1.2, §11.2.1 . [4]  Use containers  and  algorithms  rather  than  built-in  arrays  and  ad  hoc  code   §4.4,  §4.5,  §7.4, Chapter 32 .   §2.4.3, §13.1 .  [5]  Prefer standard-library facilities to locally developed code  §1.2.4 . [6]  Use exceptions,  rather  than  error  codes,  to  report  errors  that  cannot  be  handled  locally  [7]  Use move semantics to avoid copying large objects  §3.3.2, §17.5.2 . [8]  Use unique_ptr to reference objects of polymorphic type  §5.2.1 . [9]  Use shared_ptr to reference shared objects, that is, objects without a single owner that is  [10]  Use templates to maintain static type safety  eliminate casts  and avoid unnecessary use  responsible for their destruction  §5.2.1 .  of class hierarchies  §27.2 .  It might also be a good idea to review the advice for C and Java programmers  §1.3.3, §1.3.4 .  1.3.3  Suggestions for C Programmers The better one knows C, the harder it seems to be to avoid writing C++ in C style, thereby losing many of the potential beneﬁts of C++. Please take a look at Chapter 44, which describes the differ- ences between C and C++.   20  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  [1]  Don’t think of C++ as C with a few features added. C++ can be used that way, but only suboptimally. To get really major advantages from C++ as compared to C, you need to apply different design and implementation styles.  [2]  Don’t write C in C++; that is often seriously suboptimal for both maintenance and perfor-  mance.  [3]  Use the  C++  standard  library  as  a  teacher  of  new techniques  and  programming  styles. Note  the  difference  from  the  C  standard  library   e.g., = rather  than strcpy   for  copying and == rather than strcmp   for comparing .  [4]  Macro substitution is almost never necessary in C++. Use const  §7.5 , constexpr  §2.2.3, §10.4 , enum or enum  class  §8.4  to deﬁne manifest constants, inline  §12.1.5  to avoid function-calling  overhead, templates  §3.4,  Chapter  23   to  specify  families  of  functions and types, and namespaces  §2.4.2, §14.3.1  to avoid name clashes.  [5]  Don’t declare a variable before you need it, and initialize it immediately. A declaration can occur anywhere a statement can  §9.3 , in for-statement initializers  §9.5 , and in con- ditions  §9.4.3 .  [6]  Don’t use malloc  . The new operator   §11.2   does  the  same  job  better, and  instead  of realloc  , try a vector  §3.4.2 .  Don’t just replace malloc   and free   with ‘‘naked’’ new and delete  §3.2.1.2, §11.2.1 .  [7]  Avoid void∗, unions, and casts, except deep within the implementation of some function or class. Their use limits the support you can get from the type system and can harm per- formance.  In most  cases,  a  cast  is  an  indication  of  a  design  error. If you  must  use  an explicit type conversion, try using one of the named casts  e.g., static_cast; §11.5.2  for a more precise statement of what you are trying to do.  [8]  Minimize the use of arrays and C-style strings. C++ standard-library strings  §4.2 , arrays  §8.2.4 , and vectors  §4.4.1  can often be used to write simpler and more maintainable code compared to the traditional C style. In general, try not to build yourself what has already been provided by the standard library.  [9]  Avoid pointer arithmetic except in very specialized code  such as a memory manager  and  for simple array traversal  e.g., ++p .  [10]  Do not assume that something laboriously written in C style  avoiding C++ features such as  classes,  templates,  and  exceptions   is  more  efﬁcient  than  a  shorter  alternative   e.g., using standard-library facilities .  Often  but of course not always , the opposite is true.  To obey C linkage conventions, a C++ function must be declared to have C linkage  §15.2.5 .  1.3.4  Suggestions for Jav a Programmers C++ and Java are rather different languages with similar syntaxes.  Their aims are signiﬁcantly dif- ferent and so are many of their application domains. Java  is not a direct successor to C++ in the sense of a language that can do the same as its predecessor, but better and also more. To  use C++ well, you need to adopt programming and design techniques appropriate to C++, rather than trying to write Java in C++.  It is not just an issue of remembering to delete objects that you create with new because you can’t rely on the presence of a garbage collector:  [1]  Don’t simply mimic Java style in C++; that is often seriously suboptimal for both main-  tainability and performance.   Section 1.3.4  Suggestions for Jav a Programmers   21  [2]  Use the C++ abstraction mechanisms  e.g., classes and templates : don’t fall back to a C  style of programming out of a false feeling of familiarity.  [3]  Use the C++ standard library as a teacher of new techniques and programming styles. [4]  Don’t immediately invent a unique base for all of your classes  an Object class .  Typi-  cally, you can do better without it for many most classes.  [5]  Minimize the  use  of  reference  and  pointer  variables:  use  local  and  member  variables   §3.2.1.2, §5.2, §16.3.4, §17.1 .  [6]  Remember: a variable is never implicitly a reference. [7]  Think of pointers as C++’s equivalent to Java references  C++ references are more lim-  ited; there is no reseating of C++ references .  [8]  A function is not virtual by default.  Not ev ery class is meant for inheritance. [9]  Use abstract classes as interfaces to class hierarchies; avoid ‘‘brittle base classes,’’ that is,  [10]  Use scoped resource management  ‘‘Resource Acquisition Is Initialization’’; RAII  when-  base classes with data members.  ev er possible.  [11]  Use a constructor to establish a class invariant  and throw an exception if it can’t . [12]  If a cleanup action is needed when an object is deleted  e.g., goes out of scope , use a de- structor for that. Don’t imitate ﬁnally  doing so is more ad hoc and in the longer run far more work than relying on destructors .  [13]  Avoid ‘‘naked’’ new and delete; instead, use containers  e.g., vector, string, and map  and  handle classes  e.g., lock and unique_ptr .  [14]  Use freestanding  functions   nonmember  functions   to  minimize  coupling   e.g.,  see  the standard algorithms , and use namespaces  §2.4.2, Chapter 14  to limit the scope of free- standing functions.  [15]  Don’t use exception speciﬁcations  except noexcept; §13.5.1.1 . [16]  A C++ nested class does not have access to an object of the enclosing class. [17]  C++ offers only the most minimal run-time reﬂection: dynamic_cast and typeid  Chapter 22 .  Rely more on compile-time facilities  e.g., compile-time polymorphism; Chapter 27, Chapter 28 .  Most of this advice applies equally to C programmers.  1.4  History I inv ented C++, wrote its early deﬁnitions, and produced its ﬁrst implementation. I chose and for- mulated the design criteria for C++, designed its major language features, developed or helped to develop many of the early libraries, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee.  C++  was  designed  to  provide  Simula’s facilities  for  program  organization  [Dahl,1970] [Dahl,1972] together with C’s efﬁciency and ﬂexibility for systems programming [Kernighan,1978] [Kernighan,1988].  Simula is the initial source of C++’s abstraction mechanisms. The class con- cept   with  derived classes  and  virtual  functions   was  borrowed  from  it. However,  templates  and exceptions came to C++ later with different sources of inspiration.   22  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  The  evolution  of  C++  was  always  in  the  context  of  its  use. I spent  a  lot  of  time  listening  to users  and  seeking  out  the  opinions  of  experienced  programmers. In  particular, my colleagues  at AT&T Bell Laboratories were essential for the growth of C++ during its ﬁrst decade.  This section is a brief overview; it does not try to mention every language feature and library component.  Furthermore, it does not go into details. For more information, and in particular for more  names  of  people  who  contributed,  see  [Stroustrup,1993],  [Stroustrup,2007],  and  [Strous- trup,1994].  My two papers from the ACM History of Programming Languages conference and my Design and Evolution of C++ book  known as ‘‘D&E’’  describe the design and evolution of C++ in detail and document inﬂuences from other programming languages.  Most of the documents produced as part of the ISO C++ standards effort are available online [WG21].  In my FAQ, I try to maintain a connection between the standard facilities and the people who  proposed  and  reﬁned  those  facilities  [Stroustrup,2010]. C++  is  not  the  work  of  a  faceless, anonymous  committee  or  of  a  supposedly  omnipotent  ‘‘dictator  for  life’’;  it  is  the  work  of  many dedicated, experienced, hard-working individuals.  1.4.1  Timeline The work that led to C++ started in the fall of 1979 under the name ‘‘C with Classes.’’  Here is a simpliﬁed timeline:  1979 Work on ‘‘C with Classes’’ started.  The initial feature set included classes and derived classes, public private access control, constructors and destructors, and function declara- tions  with  argument  checking. The  ﬁrst  library  supported  non-preemptive  concurrent tasks and random number generators.  1984  ‘‘C  with  Classes’’ was  renamed  to  C++. By  then,  C++  had  acquired  virtual  functions, function and operator overloading, references, and the I O stream and complex number libraries.  1985 First commercial release of C++  October 14 . The library included I O streams, com-  plex numbers, and tasks  nonpreemptive scheduling .  1985  The C++ Programming Language  ‘‘TC++PL,’’ October 14  [Stroustrup,1986]. 1989  The Annotated C++ Reference Manual  ‘‘the ARM’’ . 1991  The C++ Programming Language, Second Edition [Stroustrup,1991], presenting generic programming  using  templates  and  error  handling  based  on  exceptions   including  the ‘‘Resource Acquisition Is Initialization’’ general resource management idiom .  1997  The C++ Programming Language, Third Edition [Stroustrup,1997] introduced ISO C++, including  namespaces, dynamic_cast, and  many reﬁnements  of  templates. The  standard library added the STL framework of generic containers and algorithms.  1998 ISO C++ standard. 2002 Work on a revised standard, colloquially named C++0x, started. 2003 A ‘‘bug  ﬁx’’ revision  of  the  ISO  C++  standard  was  issued. A C++  Technical  Report introduced new standard-library components, such as regular expressions, unordered con- tainers   hash  tables ,  and  resource  management  pointers,  which  later  became  part  of C++0x.  2006 An ISO C++ Technical Report on Performance was issued to answer questions of cost,  predictability, and techniques, mostly related to embedded systems programming.   Section 1.4.1  Timeline   23  2009 C++0x  was  feature  complete. It  provided  uniform  initialization,  move semantics,  vari- adic template arguments, lambda expressions, type aliases, a memory model suitable for concurrency,  and much more. The standard library added several components, including threads, locks, and most of the components from the 2003 Technical Report.  2011 ISO C++11 standard was formally approved. 2012 The ﬁrst complete C++11 implementations emerged. 2012 Work on future ISO C++ standards  referred to as C++14 and C++17  started. 2013  The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition introduced C++11.  During  development,  C++11  was  known  as  C++0x. As  is  not  uncommon  in  large  projects,  we were overly optimistic about the completion date.  1.4.2  The Early Years I originally designed and implemented the language because I wanted to distribute the services of a UNIX kernel across multiprocessors and local-area networks  what are now known as multicores and clusters . For that, I needed some event-driven simulations for which Simula would have been ideal, except for performance considerations. I also needed to deal directly with hardware and pro- vide high-performance concurrent programming mechanisms for which C would have been ideal, except for its weak support for modularity and type checking. The result of adding Simula-style classes to C, ‘‘C with Classes,’’  was used for major projects in which its facilities for writing pro- grams that use minimal time and space were severely tested. It lacked operator overloading, refer- ences, virtual functions, templates, exceptions, and many, many details [Stroustrup,1982]. The ﬁrst use of C++ outside a research organization started in July 1983.  The name C++  pronounced ‘‘see plus plus’’  was coined by Rick Mascitti in the summer of 1983 and chosen as the replacement for ‘‘C with Classes’’ by me.  The name signiﬁes the evolu- tionary nature of the changes from C; ‘‘++’’ is the C increment operator. The slightly shorter name ‘‘C+’’ is a syntax error; it had also been used as the name of an unrelated language. Connoisseurs of C semantics ﬁnd C++ inferior to ++C. The language was not called D, because it was an exten- sion of C, because it did not attempt to remedy problems by removing features, and because there already existed several would-be C successors named D. For yet another interpretation of the name C++, see the appendix of [Orwell,1949].  C++ was designed primarily so that my friends and I would not have to program in assembler, C, or various then-fashionable high-level languages.  Its main purpose was to make writing good programs easier and more pleasant for the individual programmer. In the early years, there was no C++ paper design; design, documentation, and implementation went on simultaneously. There was no ‘‘C++ project’’ either, or a ‘‘C++ design committee.’’  Throughout, C++ evolved to cope with problems  encountered  by  users  and  as  a  result  of  discussions  among  my  friends,  my  colleagues, and me.  1.4.2.1  Language Features and Library Facilities  The very ﬁrst design of C++  then called ‘‘C with Classes’’  included function declarations with argument type checking and implicit conversions, classes with the public private distinction between the  interface  and  the  implementation,  derived classes,  and  constructors  and  destructors. I used macros to provide primitive parameterization.  This was in use by mid-1980. Late that year, I was   24  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  able  to  present  a  set  of  language  facilities  supporting  a  coherent  set  of  programming  styles;  see §1.2.1.  In retrospect, I consider the introduction of constructors and destructors most signiﬁcant. In the terminology of the time, ‘‘a constructor creates the execution environment for the member functions and the destructor reverses that.’’  Here is the root of C++’s strategies for resource man- agement  causing a demand for exceptions  and the key to many techniques for making user code short and clear. If there were other languages at the time that supported multiple constructors capa- ble of executing general code, I didn’t  and don’t  know of them.  Destructors were new in C++.  C++  was  released  commercially  in  October  1985. By  then,  I  had  added  inlining   §12.1.5, §16.2.8 , consts  §2.2.3,  §7.5,  §16.2.9 ,  function  overloading   §12.3 ,  references   §7.7 ,  operator overloading   §3.2.1.1,  Chapter  18,  Chapter  19 ,  and  virtual  functions   §3.2.3,  §20.3.2 . Of  these features, support for run-time polymorphism in the form of virtual functions was by far the most controversial.  I knew its worth from Simula but found it impossible to convince most people in the systems programming world of its value.  Systems programmers tended to view indirect function calls  with  suspicion,  and  people  acquainted  with  other  languages  supporting  object-oriented  pro- gramming had a hard time believing that virtual functions could be fast enough to be useful in sys- tems code. Conversely, many programmers with an object-oriented background had  and many still have  a hard time getting used to the idea that you use virtual function calls only to express a choice that must be made at run time. The resistance to virtual functions may be related to a resistance to the idea that you can get better systems through more regular structure of code supported by a pro- gramming language. Many C programmers seem convinced that what really matters is complete ﬂexibility and careful individual crafting of every detail of a program. My view was  and is  that we need every bit of help we can get from languages and tools: the inherent complexity of the sys- tems we are trying to build is always at the edge of what we can express.  Much of the design of C++ was done on the blackboards of my colleagues. In the early years, the feedback from Stu Feldman, Alexander Fraser, Steve Johnson, Brian Kernighan, Doug McIlroy, and Dennis Ritchie was invaluable.  In the second half of the 1980s, I continued to add language features in response to user com- ments.  The most  important  of  those  were  templates  [Stroustrup,1988]  and  exception  handling [Koenig,1990], which were considered experimental at the time the standards effort started. In the design of templates, I was forced to decide among ﬂexibility, efﬁciency,  and early type checking. At the time, nobody knew how  to simultaneously get all three, and to compete with C-style code for demanding systems applications, I felt that I had to choose the ﬁrst two properties.  In retro- spect, I think the choice was the correct one, and the search for better type checking of templates continues  [Gregor,2006]  [Sutton,2011]  [Stroustrup,2012a]. The  design  of  exceptions  focused  on multilevel propagation of exceptions, the passing of arbitrary information to an error handler, and the integrations between exceptions and resource management by using local objects with destruc- tors  to  represent  and  release  resources   what  I  clumsily  called  ‘‘Resource  Acquisition  Is  Initial- ization’’; §13.3 .  I generalized  C++’s inheritance  mechanisms  to  support  multiple  base  classes  [Strous- trup,1987a].  This was called multiple inheritance and was considered difﬁcult and controversial.  I considered  it  far  less  important  than  templates  or  exceptions.  Multiple inheritance  of  abstract classes  often called interfaces  is now universal in languages supporting static type checking and object-oriented programming.   Section 1.4.2.1  Language Features and Library Facilities   25  The C++ language evolved hand in hand with some of the key library facilities presented in this book.  For  example,  I  designed  the  complex [Stroustrup,1984],  vector, stack,  and   I O   stream [Stroustrup,1985] classes together with the operator overloading mechanisms. The ﬁrst string and list  classes  were  developed  by  Jonathan  Shopiro  and  me  as  part  of  the  same  effort.  Jonathan’s string and list classes were the ﬁrst to see extensive use as part of a library. The string class from the standard C++ library has its roots in these early efforts.  The task library described in [Strous- trup,1987b] was part of the ﬁrst ‘‘C with Classes’’ program ever written in 1980. I wrote it and its associated  classes  to  support  Simula-style  simulations. Unfortunately, we had  to  wait  until  2011  30 years!  to get concurrency support standardized and universally available  §1.4.4.2, §5.3, Chap- ter 41 . The development of the template facility was inﬂuenced by a variety of vector, map, list, and sort templates devised by Andrew Koenig, Alex Stepanov, me, and others.  C++ grew up in an environment with a multitude of established and experimental programming languages  e.g., Ada [Ichbiah,1979], Algol 68 [Woodward,1974], and ML [Paulson,1996] .  At the time,  I  was  comfortable  in  about  25  languages,  and  their  inﬂuences  on  C++  are  documented  in [Stroustrup,1994] and [Stroustrup,2007]. However,  the determining inﬂuences always came from the  applications  I  encountered. That  was  a  deliberate  policy to hav e the  development  of  C++ ‘‘problem driven’’ rather than imitative.  1.4.3  The 1998 Standard The explosive growth of C++ use caused some changes. Sometime during 1987, it became clear that formal standardization of C++ was inevitable and that we needed to start preparing the ground for a standardization effort [Stroustrup,1994]. The result was a conscious effort to maintain contact between implementers of C++ compilers and major users. This was done through paper and elec- tronic mail and through face-to-face meetings at C++ conferences and elsewhere.  AT&T Bell Labs made a major contribution to C++ and its wider community by allowing me to share  drafts  of  revised  versions  of  the  C++  reference  manual  with  implementers  and  users. Because many of those people worked for companies that could be seen as competing with AT&T, the  signiﬁcance  of  this  contribution  should  not  be  underestimated. A less  enlightened  company could have caused major problems of language fragmentation simply by doing nothing. As it hap- pened,  about  a  hundred  individuals  from  dozens  of  organizations  read  and  commented  on  what became the generally accepted reference manual and the base document for the ANSI C++ stan- dardization  effort.  Their names  can  be  found  in The  Annotated  C++  Reference  Manual  ‘‘the ARM’’  [Ellis,1989]. The X3J16 committee of ANSI was convened in December 1989 at the ini- tiative  of Hewlett-Packard.  In June 1991, this ANSI  American national  standardization of C++ became  part  of  an  ISO   international   standardization  effort  for  C++  and  named  WG21. From 1990, these joint C++ standards committees have been the main forum for the evolution of C++ and the  reﬁnement  of  its  deﬁnition. In  particular, as the chairman  of  the  working  group  for  extensions   later  called  the  evolution  group ,  I  was  directly responsible for handling proposals for major changes to C++ and the addition of new language fea- tures.  An initial draft standard for public review was produced in April 1995. The ﬁrst ISO C++ standard  ISO IEC 14882-1998  [C++,1998] was ratiﬁed by a 22-0 national vote in 1998. A ‘‘bug ﬁx release’’ of this standard was issued in 2003, so you sometimes hear people refer to C++03, but that is essentially the same language as C++98.  I served  on  these  committees  throughout.   26  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  1.4.3.1  Language Features  By the time the ANSI and ISO standards efforts started, most major language features were in place and documented in the ARM [Ellis,1989]. Consequently, most of the work involved reﬁnement of features  and  their  speciﬁcation. The  template  mechanisms,  in  particular, beneﬁted  from  much detailed work.  Namespaces were introduced to cope with the increased size of C++ programs and the increased number of libraries. At the initiative of Dmitry Lenkov from Hewett-Packard, mini- mal facilities to use run-time type information  RTTI; Chapter 22  were introduced. I had left such facilities out of C++ because I had found them seriously overused in Simula. I tried to get a facility for  optional  conservative  garbage  collection  accepted,  but  failed.  We had  to  wait  until  the  2011 standard for that.  Clearly, the 1998 language was far superior in features and in particular in the detail of speciﬁ- cation  to  the  1989  language. However,  not  all  changes  were  improvements.  In addition  to  the inevitable minor mistakes, two major features were added that in retrospect should not have been:   cid:129    cid:129  Exception  speciﬁcations  provide  run-time  enforcement  of  which  exceptions  a  function  is allowed to throw.  They were added at the energetic initiative of people from Sun Microsys- tems.  Exception speciﬁcations turned out to be worse than useless for improving readabil- ity, reliability, and performance. They are deprecated  scheduled for future removal  in the 2011 standard. The 2011 standard introduced noexcept  §13.5.1.1  as a simpler solution to many of the problems that exception speciﬁcations were supposed to address. It was always obvious that separate compilation of templates and their uses would be ideal [Stroustrup,1994].  How to achieve that under the constraints from real-world uses of tem- plates  was  not  at  all  obvious.  After a long  debate  in  the  committee,  a  compromise  was reached and something called expor t templates were speciﬁed as part of the 1998 standard. It was not an elegant solution to the problem, only one vendor implemented expor t  the Edi- son Design Group , and the feature was removed from the 2011 standard. We are still look- ing for a solution. My opinion is that the fundamental problem is not separate compilation in itself, but that the distinction between interface and implementation of a template is not well speciﬁed. Thus, expor t solved the wrong problem. In the future, language support for ‘‘concepts’’  §24.3  may help by providing precise speciﬁcation of template requirements. This is an area of active research and design [Sutton,2011] [Stroustrup,2012a].  1.4.3.2  The Standard Library  The greatest and most important innovation in the 1998 standard was the inclusion of the STL, a framework  of  algorithms  and  containers,  in  the  standard  library   §4.4,  §4.5,  Chapter  31,  Chapter 32, Chapter 33 . It was the work of Alex Stepanov  with Dave Musser, Meng Le, and others  based on more than a decade’s work on generic programming. Andrew Koenig, Beman Dawes, and I did much  to  help  get  the  STL  accepted  [Stroustrup,2007]. The  STL  has  been  massively  inﬂuential within the C++ community and beyond.  Except for the STL, the standard library was a bit of a hodgepodge of components, rather than a uniﬁed design. I had failed to ship a sufﬁciently large foundation library with Release 1.0 of C++ [Stroustrup,1993],  and  an  unhelpful   non-research   AT&T  manager  had  prevented  my  colleagues and  me  from  rectifying  that  mistake for  Release  2.0. That  meant  that  every  major  organization  such as Borland, IBM, Microsoft, and Texas Instruments  had its own foundation library by the   Section 1.4.3.2  The Standard Library  27  time the standards work started. Thus, the committee was limited to a patchwork of components based on what had always been available  e.g., the complex library , what could be added without interfering  with  the  major  vendor’s libraries,  and  what  was  needed  to  ensure  cooperation  among different nonstandard libraries.  The standard-library string  §4.2, Chapter 36  had its origins in early work by Jonathan Shopiro and me at Bell Labs but was revised and extended by several different individuals and groups dur- ing standardization. The valarray library for numerical computation  §40.5  is primarily the work of Kent Budge. Jerry Schwarz transformed my streams library  §1.4.2.1  into the iostreams library  §4.3, Chapter 38  using Andrew Koenig’s manipulator technique  §38.4.5.2  and other ideas. The iostreams library was further reﬁned during standardization, where the bulk of the work was done by Jerry Schwarz, Nathan Myers, and Norihiro Kumagai.  By commercial standards the C++98 standard library is tiny.  For example, there is no standard GUI, database access library, or Web application library. Such libraries are widely available but are not part of the ISO standard. The reasons for that are practical and commercial, rather than techni- cal.  However, the C standard library was  and is  many inﬂuential people’s measure of a standard library, and compared to that, the C++ standard library is huge.  1.4.4  The 2011 Standard The current C++, C++11, known for years as C++0x, is the work of the members of WG21. The committee worked under increasingly onerous self-imposed processes and procedures. These pro- cesses probably led to a better  and more rigorous  speciﬁcation, but they also limited innovation [Stroustrup,2007].  An initial draft standard for public review was produced in 2009. The second ISO  C++  standard   ISO IEC  14882-2011   [C++,2011]  was  ratiﬁed  by  a  21-0  national  vote  in August 2011.  One reason for the long gap between the two standards is that most members of the committee  including me  were under the mistaken impression that the ISO rules required a ‘‘waiting period’’ after a standard was issued before starting work on new features.  Consequently, serious work on new language features did not start until 2002. Other reasons included the increased size of modern languages and their foundation libraries. In terms of pages of standards text, the language grew by about 30% and the standard library by about 100%. Much of the increase was due to more detailed speciﬁcation, rather than new functionality. Also, the work on a new C++ standard obviously had to take great care not to compromise older code through incompatible changes. There are billions of lines of C++ code in use that the committee must not break.  The overall aims for the C++11 effort were:  cid:129  Make C++ a better language for systems programming and library building.  cid:129  Make C++ easier to teach and learn.  The aims are documented and detailed in [Stroustrup,2007].  A major  effort  was  made  to  make concurrent  systems  programming  type-safe  and  portable. This involved a memory model  §41.2  and a set of facilities for lock-free programming  §41.3 , which  is  primarily  the  work  of  Hans  Boehm,  Brian  McKnight,  and  others. On  top  of  that,  we added the threads library. Pete Becker, Peter Dimov,  How ard Hinnant, William Kempf, Anthony Williams, and others did massive amounts of work on that. To  provide an example of what can be achieved on top  of  the  basic  concurrency facilities,  I  proposed  work  on  ‘‘a  way  to  exchange   28  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  information  between  tasks  without  explicit  use  of  a  lock,’’  which  became futures and async    §5.3.5 ; Lawrence Crowl and Detlef Vollmann did most of the work on that. Concurrency is an area  where  a  complete  and  detailed  listing  of  who  did  what  and  why would  require  a  very  long paper. Here, I can’t even try.  1.4.4.1  Language Features  The list of language features and standard-library facilities added to C++98 to get C++11 is pre- sented in §44.2. With the exception of concurrency support, every addition to the language could be deemed ‘‘minor,’’ but doing so would miss the point: language features are meant to be used in combination to write better programs. By ‘‘better’’ I mean easier to read, easier to write, more ele- gant, less error-prone, more maintainable, faster-running, consuming fewer resources, etc.  Here are what I consider the most widely useful new ‘‘building bricks’’ affecting the style of  C++11 code with references to the text and their primary authors:   cid:129  Control  of  defaults: =delete and =default: §3.3.4,  §17.6.1,  §17.6.4;  Lawrence  Crowl  and  Bjarne Stroustrup.   cid:129  Deducing the type of an object from its initializer, auto: §2.2.2, §6.3.6.1; Bjarne Stroustrup. I ﬁrst designed and implemented auto in 1983 but had to remove it because of C compatibil- ity problems.   cid:129  Generalized  constant  expression  evaluation   including  literal  types , constexpr: §2.2.3,  §10.4, §12.1.6; Gabriel Dos Reis and Bjarne Stroustrup [DosReis,2010]. In-class member initializers: §17.4.4; Michael Spertus and Bill Seymour. Inheriting constructors: §20.3.5.1; Bjarne Stroustrup, Michael Wong, and Michel Michaud.   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129  Lambda expressions, a way of implicitly deﬁning function objects at the point of their use in  an expression: §3.4.3, §11.4; Jaakko Jarvi.   cid:129  Move  semantics,  a  way  of  transmitting  information  without  copying:  §3.3.2,  §17.5.2;  Howard Hinnant.   cid:129  A way of stating that a function may not throw exceptions noexcept: §13.5.1.1; David Abra-  hams, Rani Sharoni, and Doug Gregor.   cid:129  A proper name for the null pointer, §7.2.2; Herb Sutter and Bjarne Stroustrup.  cid:129  The range-for statement: §2.2.5, §9.5.1; Thorsten Ottosen and Bjarne Stroustrup.  cid:129  Override controls: ﬁnal and override: §20.3.4.  Alisdair Meredith, Chris Uzdavinis, and Ville  Voutilainen.   cid:129  Type aliases, a mechanism for providing an alias for a type or a template. In particular, a way of deﬁning a template by binding some arguments of another template: §3.4.5, §23.6; Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis.   cid:129  Typed  and  scoped  enumerations: enum  class: §8.4.1;  David  E.  Miller, Herb  Sutter, and  Bjarne Stroustrup.   cid:129  Universal  and  uniform  initialization   including  arbitrary-length  initializer  lists  and  protec- tion  against  narrowing :  §2.2.2,  §3.2.1.3,  §6.3.5,  §17.3.1,  §17.3.4;  Bjarne  Stroustrup  and Gabriel Dos Reis.   cid:129  Variadic templates, a mechanism for passing an arbitrary number of arguments of arbitrary  types to a template: §3.4.4, §28.6; Doug Gregor and Jaakko Jarvi.   Section 1.4.4.1  Language Features   29  Many more people than can be listed here deserve to be mentioned.  The technical reports to the committee [WG21] and my C++11 FAQ [Stroustrup,2010a] give many of the names. The minutes of the committee’s working groups mention more still. The reason my name appears so often is  I hope  not vanity, but simply that I chose to work on what I consider important. These are features that will be pervasive in good code. Their major role is to ﬂesh out the C++ feature set to better support programming styles  §1.2.1 . They are the foundation of the synthesis that is C++11.  Much work went into a proposal that did not make it into the standard. ‘‘Concepts’’ was a facil- ity for specifying and checking requirements for template arguments [Gregor,2006] based on previ- ous research  e.g., [Stroustrup,1994] [Siek,2000] [DosReis,2006]  and extensive work in the com- mittee.  It was designed, speciﬁed, implemented, and tested, but by a large majority the committee decided that the proposal was not yet ready. Had we been able to reﬁne ‘‘concepts,’’ it would have been the most important single feature in C++11  its only competitor for that title is concurrency support .  However, the committee decided against ‘‘concepts’’ on the grounds of complexity, difﬁ- culty of use, and compile-time performance [Stroustrup,2010b]. I think we  the committee  did the right thing with ‘‘concepts’’ for C++11, but this feature really was ‘‘the one that got away.’’  This is currently a ﬁeld of active research and design [Sutton,2011] [Stroustrup,2012a].  1.4.4.2  Standard Library  The work on what became the C++11 standard library started with a standards committee technical report   ‘‘TR1’’ .  Initially, Matt  Austern  was  the  head  of  the  Library  Working  Group,  and  later Howard Hinnant took over until we shipped the ﬁnal draft standard in 2011.  As for language features, I’ll only list a few standard-library components with references to the text and the names of the individuals most closely associated with them. For a more detailed list, see §44.2.2. Some components, such as unordered_map  hash tables , were ones we simply didn’t manage  to  ﬁnish  in  time  for  the  C++98  standard. Many others,  such  as unique_ptr and function were part of a technical report  TR1  based on Boost libraries. Boost is a volunteer organization created to provide useful library components based on the STL [Boost].   cid:129  Hashed containers, such as unordered_map: §31.4.3; Matt Austern.  cid:129  The basic concurrency library components, such as thread, mutex, and lock: §5.3, §42.2; Pete  Becker, Peter Dimov, How ard Hinnant, William Kempf, Anthony Williams, and more.   cid:129  Launching  asynchronous  computation  and  returning  results, future, promise, and async  :  §5.3.5, §42.4.6; Detlef Vollmann, Lawrence Crowl, Bjarne Stroustrup, and Herb Sutter.   cid:129  The garbage collection interface: §34.5; Michael Spertus and Hans Boehm.  cid:129  A regular expression library, regexp: §5.5, Chapter 37; John Maddock.  cid:129  A random number library: §5.6.3, §40.7; Jens Maurer and Walter Brown.  It was about time.  I shipped the ﬁrst random number library with ‘‘C with Classes’’ in 1980.  Several utility components were tried out in Boost:   cid:129  A pointer for simply and efﬁciently passing resources, unique_ptr: §5.2.1, §34.3.1; Howard E. Hinnant. This was originally called move_ptr and is what auto_ptr should have been had we known how to do so for C++98.   cid:129  A pointer  for  representing  shared  ownership, shared_ptr: §5.2.1,  §34.3.2;  Peter  Dimov.

By now  2013 , C++ is used just about everywhere: it is in your computer, your phone, your car, probably even in your camera. You don’t usually see it. C++ is a systems programming language, and its most pervasive uses are deep in the infrastructure where we, as users, never look.  C++  is  used  by  millions  of  programmers  in  essentially  every  application  domain. Billions  thousands of millions  of lines of C++ are currently deployed.  This massive use is supported by half a dozen independent implementations, many thousands of libraries, hundreds of textbooks, and dozens of websites. Training and education at a variety of levels are widely available.  Early applications tended to have a strong systems programming ﬂavor.  For example, several early  operating  systems  have  been  written  in  C++:  [Campbell,1987]   academic ,  [Rozier,1988]  real  time ,  [Berg,1995]   high-throughput  I O . Many current  ones   e.g.,  Windows,  Apple’s OS, Linux,  and  most  portable-device  OSs   have  key  parts  done  in  C++. Your  cellphone  and  Internet routers are most likely written in C++. I consider uncompromising low-level efﬁciency essential for C++. This allows us to use C++ to write device drivers and other software that rely on direct manipulation of hardware under real-time constraints. In such code, predictability of performance is at least as important as raw speed.  Often, so is the compactness of the resulting system. C++ was designed  so  that  every  language  feature  is  usable  in  code  under  severe  time  and  space  con- straints  §1.2.4  [Stroustrup,1994,§4.5].  Some of today’s most visible and widely used systems have their critical parts written in C++. Examples are Amadeus  airline ticketing , Amazon  Web commerce , Bloomberg  ﬁnancial infor- mation , Google  Web search , and Facebook  social media . Many other programming languages and  technologies  depend  critically  on  C++’s performance  and  reliability  in  their  implementation. Examples include the most widely used Java Virtual Machines  e.g., Oracle’s HotSpot , JavaScript interpreters   e.g.,  Google’s V8 ,  browsers   e.g.,  Microsoft’s Internet  Explorer, Mozilla’s Firefox, Apple’s Safari,  and  Google’s Chrome ,  and  application  frameworks   e.g.,  Microsoft’s .NET  Web services framework .  I consider C++ to have unique strengths in the area of infrastructure software [Stroustrup,2012a].  Most applications have sections of code that are critical for acceptable performance. However, the largest amount of code is not in such sections. For most code, maintainability, ease of exten- sion, and ease of testing are key. C++’s support for these concerns has led to its widespread use in areas where reliability is a must and where requirements change signiﬁcantly over time.  Examples are ﬁnancial systems, telecommunications, device control, and military applications. For decades, the central control of the U.S. long-distance telephone system has relied on C++, and every 800 call  i.e., a call paid for by the called party  has been routed by a C++ program [Kamath,1993]. Many such applications are large and long-lived.  As a result, stability, compatibility, and scalability have been constant concerns in the development of C++. Multimillion-line C++ programs are common.   Section 1.4.5  What is C++ used for?   31  Games is another area where a multiplicity of languages and tools need to coexist with a lan- guage providing uncompromising efﬁciency  often on ‘‘unusual’’ hardware .  Thus, games has been another major applications area for C++.  What used to be called systems programming is widely found in embedded systems, so it is not surprising  to  ﬁnd  massive  use  of  C++  in  demanding  embedded  systems  projects,  including  com- puter tomography  CAT scanners , ﬂight control software  e.g., Lockheed-Martin , rocket control, ship’s engines  e.g., the control of the world’s largest marine diesel engines from MAN , automo- bile software  e.g., BMW , and wind turbine control  e.g., Vesta .  C++ wasn’t speciﬁcally designed with numerical computation in mind. However, much numer- ical, scientiﬁc, and engineering computation is done in C++. A major reason for this is that tradi- tional  numerical  work  must  often  be  combined  with  graphics  and  with  computations  relying  on data structures that don’t ﬁt into the traditional Fortran mold  e.g., [Root,1995] . I am particularly pleased  to  see  C++  used  in  major  scientiﬁc  endeavors,  such  as  the  Human  Genome  Project, NASA’s Mars Rovers, CERN’s search for the fundamentals of the universe, and many others.  C++’s ability to be used effectively for applications that require work in a variety of application areas is an important strength. Applications that involve local- and wide-area networking, numer- ics,  graphics,  user  interaction,  and  database  access  are  common. Traditionally, such  application areas were considered distinct and were served by distinct technical communities using a variety of programming  languages. However,  C++  is  widely  used  in  all  of  those  areas,  and  more. It  is designed so that C++ code can coexist with code written in other languages. Here, again, C++’s stability over decades is important. Furthermore, no really major system is written 100% in a sin- gle language. Thus, C++’s original design aim of interoperability becomes signiﬁcant.  Major applications are not written in just the raw language.  C++ is supported by a variety of libraries  beyond the ISO C++ standard library  and tool sets, such as Boost [Boost]  portable foun- dation  libraries ,  POCO   Web  development ,  QT   cross-platform  application  development , wxWidgets   a  cross-platform  GUI  library ,  WebKit   a  layout  engine  library  for  Web  browsers , CGAL  computational geometry , QuickFix  Financial Information eXchange , OpenCV  real-time image  processing ,  and  Root  [Root,1995]   High-Energy  Physics .  There are  many thousands  of C++ libraries, so keeping up with them all is impossible.  1.5  Advice Each chapter contains an ‘‘Advice’’ section with a set of concrete recommendations related to its contents.  Such advice  consists  of  rough  rules  of  thumb,  not  immutable  laws.  A piece  of  advice should be applied only where reasonable. There is no substitute for intelligence, experience, com- mon sense, and good taste.  I ﬁnd  rules  of  the  form  ‘‘never do this’’ unhelpful.  Consequently, most  advice  is  phrased  as suggestions for what to do. Negative  suggestions tend not to be phrased as absolute prohibitions and I try to suggest alternatives.  I know of no major feature of C++ that I have not seen put to good use.  The ‘‘Advice’’ sections do not contain explanations.  Instead, each piece of advice is accompa- nied by a reference to an appropriate section of the book.  For starters,  here  are  a  few high-level recommendations  derived from  the  sections  on  design,  learning, and history of C++:   32  Notes to the Reader  Chapter 1  [1]  Represent ideas  concepts  directly in code, for example, as a function, a class, or an enu-  [2]  Aim for your code to be both elegant and efﬁcient; §1.2.

[5]  Represent relationships among ideas directly in code, for example, through parameteriza-  [6]  Represent independent ideas separately in code, for example, avoid mutual dependencies  tion or a class hierarchy; §1.2.1.  among classes; §1.2.1.  [7]  C++ is not just object-oriented; §1.2.1. [8]  C++ is not just for generic programming; §1.2.1. [9]  Prefer solutions that can be statically checked; §1.2.1. [10]  Make resources explicit  represent them as class objects ; §1.2.1, §1.4.2.1. [11]  Express simple ideas simply; §1.2.1. [12]  Use libraries, especially the standard library, rather than trying to build everything from  scratch; §1.2.1.  [13]  Use a type-rich style of programming; §1.2.2. [14]  Low-level code is not necessarily efﬁcient; don’t avoid classes, templates, and standard-  library components out of fear of performance problems; §1.2.4, §1.3.3.  [15]  If data has an invariant, encapsulate it; §1.3.2. [16]  C++ is not just C with a few extensions; §1.3.3.  In general: To write a good program takes intelligence, taste, and patience. You are not going to get it right the ﬁrst time.

This chapter informally presents the notation of C++, C++’s model of memory and computation,  and  the  basic  mechanisms  for  organizing  code  into  a  program. These  are  the  lan- guage facilities supporting the styles most often seen in C and sometimes called procedural pro- gramming. Chapter  3  follows  up  by  presenting  C++’s abstraction  mechanisms. Chapter  4  and Chapter 5 give examples of standard-library facilities.  The  assumption  is  that  you  have  programmed  before. If  not,  please  consider  reading  a  text- book, such as Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ [Stroustrup,2009], before contin- uing  here. Even  if  you  have  programmed  before,  the  language  you  used  or  the  applications  you wrote may be very different from the style of C++ presented here. If you ﬁnd this ‘‘lightning tour’’ confusing, skip to the more systematic presentation starting in Chapter 6.   38  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  This tour of C++ saves us from a strictly bottom-up presentation of language and library facili- ties by enabling the use of a rich set of facilities even in early chapters. For example, loops are not discussed in detail until Chapter 10, but they will be used in obvious ways long before that. Simi- larly, the  detailed  description  of  classes,  templates,  free-store  use,  and  the  standard  library  are spread  over many chapters,  but  standard-library  types,  such  as vector, string, complex, map, unique_ptr, and ostream, are used freely where needed to improve code examples.  As an analogy, think of a short sightseeing tour of a city, such as Copenhagen or New York.  In just a few hours, you are given a quick peek at the major attractions, told a few background stories, and usually given some suggestions about what to see next.  You do not know the city after such a tour. You do not understand all you have seen and heard. To really know a city, you have to liv e in it, often for years. However, with a bit of luck, you will have gained a bit of an overview, a notion of what is special about the city, and ideas of what might be of interest to you. After the tour, the real exploration can begin.  This  tour  presents  C++  as  an  integrated  whole,  rather  than  as  a  layer  cake.  Consequently, it does not identify language features as present in C, part of C++98, or new in C++11.  Such histori- cal information can be found in §1.4 and Chapter 44.  2.2  The Basics C++ is a compiled language. For a program to run, its source text has to be processed by a com- piler, producing object ﬁles, which are combined by a linker yielding an executable program. A C++ program typically consists of many source code ﬁles  usually simply called source ﬁles .  source ﬁle 1  source ﬁle 2  compile  compile  object ﬁle 1  object ﬁle 2  link  executable ﬁle  An  executable  program  is  created  for  a  speciﬁc  hardware system  combination;  it  is  not  portable, say, from a Mac to a Windows PC. When we talk about portability of C++ programs, we usually mean portability of source code; that is, the source code can be successfully compiled and run on a variety of systems.  The ISO C++ standard deﬁnes two kinds of entities:  cid:129  Core language features, such as built-in types  e.g., char and int  and loops  e.g., for-state-   cid:129   ments and while-statements  Standard-library components, such as containers  e.g., vector and map  and I O operations  e.g., << and getline     The standard-library components are perfectly ordinary C++ code provided by every C++ imple- mentation.  That is, the C++ standard library can be implemented in C++ itself  and is with very minor uses of machine code for things such as thread context switching . This implies that C++ is sufﬁciently expressive and efﬁcient for the most demanding systems programming tasks.  C++ is a statically typed language. That is, the type of every entity  e.g., object, value, name, and expression  must be known to the compiler at its point of use. The type of an object determines the set of operations applicable to it.   Section 2.2.1  Hello, World!   39  2.2.1  Hello, World! The minimal C++ program is  int main   { }     the minimal C++ program  This deﬁnes a function called main, which takes no arguments and does nothing  §15.4 .  Curly braces, { }, express grouping in C++. Here, they indicate the start and end of the function body. The double slash,   , begins a comment that extends to the end of the line. A comment is for the human reader; the compiler ignores comments.  Every C++ program must have exactly one global function named main  . The program starts by executing that function. The int value returned by main  , if any, is the program’s return value to ‘‘the system.’’  If no value is returned, the system will receive a value indicating successful comple- tion.  A nonzero  value  from main   indicates  failure.  Not ev ery  operating  system  and  execution environment  make use  of  that  return  value:  Linux Unix-based  environments  often  do,  but  Win- dows-based environments rarely do.  Typically, a program produces some output. Here is a program that writes Hello, World!:  include    int main   {  }  std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";  std::cout << "Hello, World!\n"  The  line include    instructs  the  compiler  to include the  declarations  of  the  standard stream I O facilities as found in iostream. Without these declarations, the expression  would make no sense.  The operator <<  ‘‘put to’’  writes its second argument onto its ﬁrst. In this case, the string literal "Hello, World!\n" is written onto the standard output stream std::cout. A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes. In a string literal, the backslash character \ followed by another character denotes a single ‘‘special character.’’ In this case, \n is the newline character, so that the characters written are Hello, World! followed by a newline.  The std:: speciﬁes that the name cout is to be found in the standard-library namespace  §2.4.2, Chapter 14 . I usually leave out the std:: when discussing standard features; §2.4.2 shows how to make names from a namespace visible without explicit qualiﬁcation.  Essentially  all  executable  code  is  placed  in  functions  and  called  directly  or  indirectly  from  main  . For example:  include   using namespace std;  double square double x  {  return x∗x;  }     makenames from std visible without std::  §2.4.2      square a double precision ﬂoating-point number   40  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  void print_square double x  {  cout << "the square of " << x << " is " << square x  << "\n";  }  }  int main   {  int inch;  named entity:  print_square 1.234 ;      print:the square of 1.234 is 1.52276  A ‘‘return type’’ void indicates that a function does not return a value.  2.2.2  Types, Variables, and Arithmetic Every name and every expression has a type that determines the operations that may be performed on it. For example, the declaration  speciﬁes that inch is of type int; that is, inch is an integer variable.  A declaration is a statement that introduces a name into the program. It speciﬁes a type for the   cid:129  A type deﬁnes a set of possible values and a set of operations  for an object .  cid:129  An object is some memory that holds a value of some type.  cid:129  A value is a set of bits interpreted according to a type.  cid:129  A variable is a named object. C++ offers a variety of fundamental types. For example:  bool  char  int  double      Boolean, possible values are true and false    character,for example,'a', ' z', and '9'    integer,for example,1,42, and 1066    double-precision ﬂoating-point number,for example,3.14 and 299793.0  Each fundamental type corresponds directly to hardware facilities and has a ﬁxed size that deter- mines the range of values that can be stored in it:  bool:  char:  int:  double:  A char variable  is  of  the  natural  size  to  hold  a  character  on  a  given machine   typically  an  8-bit byte , and the sizes of other types are quoted in multiples of the size of a char. The size of a type is implementation-deﬁned   i.e.,  it  can  vary  among  different  machines   and  can  be  obtained  by  the sizeof operator; for example, sizeof char  equals 1 and sizeof int  is often 4.  The arithmetic operators can be used for appropriate combinations of these types:   Section 2.2.2  Types, Variables, and Arithmetic  41     plus    unar yplus    minus    unar yminus    multiply    divide    remainder  modulus  for integers  So can the comparison operators:     equal    not equal    less than    greater than    less than or equal    greater than or equal  x+y  +x  x−y  −x  x∗y x y  x%y   x==y  x!=y  x<y  x>y  x<=y  x>=y   }  In  assignments  and  in  arithmetic  operations,  C++  performs  all  meaningful  conversions   §10.5.3  between the basic types so that they can be mixed freely:  void some_function   {     function that doesn’t returnavalue  double d = 2.2; int i = 7; d = d+i;  i = d∗i;      initializeﬂoating-point number    initializeinteger    assign sum to d    assign product to i  truncating the double d*i to an int   Note that = is the assignment operator and == tests equality.  C++ offers a variety of notations for expressing initialization, such as the = used above, and a  universal form based on curly-brace-delimited initializer lists:  double d1 = 2.3; double d2 {2.3};  complex  z = 1; complex  z2 {d1,d2}; complex  z3 = {1,2};     acomplexnumber with double-precision ﬂoating-point scalars     the = is optional with { ... }  vector  v {1,2,3,4,5,6};     avector of ints  The = form is traditional and dates back to C, but if in doubt, use the general {}-list form  §6.3.5.2 . If nothing else, it saves you from conversions that lose information  narrowing conversions; §10.5 :  int i1 = 7.2; int i2 {7.2}; int i3 = {7.2};     i1 becomes 7    error :ﬂoating-point to integer conversion    error :ﬂoating-point to integer conversion  the = is redundant   A constant  §2.2.3  cannot be left uninitialized and a variable should only be left uninitialized in extremely rare circumstances. Don’t introduce a name until you have a suitable value for it. User- deﬁned types  such as string, vector, Matrix, Motor_controller, and Orc_warrior  can be deﬁned to be implicitly initialized  §3.2.1.1 .   42  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  When  deﬁning  a  variable,  you  don’t actually  need  to  state  its  type  explicitly  when  it  can  be  deduced from the initializer:  auto b = true; auto ch = 'x';  auto i = 123; auto d = 1.2; auto z = sqrt y ;      abool    achar    an int    adouble    zhas the type of whateversqr t y retur ns  With auto, we use the = syntax because there is no type conversion involved that might cause prob- lems  §6.3.6.2 .  We  use auto where  we  don’t hav e a speciﬁc  reason  to  mention  the  type  explicitly. ‘‘Speciﬁc  reasons’’ include:  of our code.   cid:129  The deﬁnition is in a large scope where we want to make the type clearly visible to readers   cid:129  We want to be explicit about a variable’s range or precision  e.g., double rather than ﬂoat .  Using auto, we avoid  redundancy and  writing  long  type  names. This  is  especially  important  in generic programming where the exact type of an object can be hard for the programmer to know and the type names can be quite long  §4.5.1 .  In addition to the conventional arithmetic and logical operators  §10.3 , C++ offers more spe-  ciﬁc operations for modifying a variable:  x+=y  ++x  x−=y  −−x  x∗=y  x =y  x%=y      x=x+y    increment: x = x+1    x=x-y    decrement: x = x-1    scaling: x = x*y    scaling: x = x y    x=x%y  These operators are concise, convenient, and very frequently used.  2.2.3  Constants C++ supports two notions of immutability  §7.5 :   cid:129    cid:129   const: meaning roughly ‘‘I promise not to change this value’’  §7.5 .  This is used primarily to specify interfaces, so that data can be passed to functions without fear of it being modi- ﬁed.  The compiler enforces the promise made by const. constexpr: meaning roughly ‘‘to be evaluated at compile time’’  §10.4 .  This is used primar- ily to specify constants, to allow placement of data in memory where it is unlikely to be cor- rupted, and for performance.  For example:  const int dmv = 17; int var = 17; constexpr double max1 = 1.4∗square dmv ;  constexpr double max2 = 1.4∗square var ;  const double max3 = 1.4∗square var ;      dmv is a named constant    varisnot a constant    OK if square 17  is a constant expression    error :varisnot a constant expression    OK, maybeevaluated at run time   Section 2.2.3  Constants   43  double sum const vector & ;  vector  v {1.2, 3.4, 4.5}; const double s1 = sum v ; constexpr double s2 = sum v ;     sum will not modify its argument  §2.2.5     visnot a constant    OK: evaluated at run time    error :sum v  not constant expression  For a function to be usable in a constant expression, that is, in an expression that will be evaluated by the compiler, it must be deﬁned constexpr. For example:  constexpr double square double x  { return x∗x; }  To  be constexpr, a function  must  be  rather  simple:  just  a return-statement  computing  a  value.  A constexpr function can be used for non-constant arguments, but when that is done the result is not a constant expression.  We allow a constexpr function to be called with non-constant-expression argu- ments in contexts that do not require constant expressions, so that we don’t hav e to deﬁne essen- tially the same function twice: once for constant expressions and once for variables.  In a few places, constant expressions are required by language rules  e.g., array bounds  §2.2.5, §7.3 , case labels  §2.2.4, §9.4.2 , some template arguments  §25.2 , and constants declared using constexpr .  In other cases, compile-time evaluation is important for performance. Independently of performance  issues,  the  notion  of  immutability   of  an  object  with  an  unchangeable  state   is  an important design concern  §10.4 .  2.2.4  Tests and Loops C++ provides a conventional set of statements for expressing selection and looping. For example, here is a simple function that prompts the user and returns a Boolean indicating the response:  cout << "Do you want to proceed  y or n ?\n";     writequestion     read answer  bool accept   {  char answer = 0; cin >> answer;   if  answer == 'y'  return true; return false;  }  To  match the  > operator  ‘‘get from’’  is used for input; cin is the  standard  input  stream. The  type  of  the  right-hand  operand  of >> determines  what  input  is accepted, and its right-hand operand is the target of the input operation. The \n character at the end of the output string represents a newline  §2.2.1 .  The example could be improved by taking an n  for ‘‘no’’  answer into account:  bool accept2   {  char answer = 0; cin >> answer;   cout << "Do you want to proceed  y or n ?\n";     writequestion     read answer   44  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  A switch-statement tests a value against a set of constants. The case constants must be distinct, and if the value tested does not match any of them, the default is chosen. If no default is provided, no action is taken if the value doesn’t match any case constant.  Few programs are written without loops. For example, we might like to giv e the user a few tries  cout << "Do you want to proceed  y or n ?\n"; char answer = 0; cin >> answer;      writequestion     read answer  switch  answer  { case 'y':  return true;  case 'n':  default:  return false;  cout << "I'll take that for a no.\n"; return false;  }  }  to produce acceptable input:  bool accept3   {  int tries = 1; while  tries<4  {  switch  answer  { case 'y':  return true;  case 'n':  default:  return false;  cout << "Sorry, I don't understand that.\n"; ++tries;      increment  }  } cout << "I'll take that for a no.\n"; return false;  }  The while-statement executes until its condition becomes false.  2.2.5  Pointers, Arrays, and Loops An array of elements of type char can be declared like this:  char v[6];     array of6characters  Similarly, a pointer can be declared like this:  char∗ p;      pointer to character  In  declarations, [] means  ‘‘array  of’’  and ∗ means  ‘‘pointer  to.’’  All  arrays  have 0 as  their  lower   Section 2.2.5  Pointers, Arrays, and Loops  45  bound,  so v has  six  elements, v[0] to v[5]. The  size  of  an  array  must  be  a  constant  expression  §2.2.3 .  A pointer variable can hold the address of an object of the appropriate type:  char∗ p = &v[3];  char x = ∗p;      ppoints to v’sfour thelement    *p is the object that p points to  In an expression, preﬁx unary ∗ means ‘‘contents of’’  and preﬁx unary & means ‘‘address of.’’  We can represent the result of that initialized deﬁnition graphically:  p:  v:  0:  1:  2:  3:  4:  5:  Consider copying ten elements from one array to another:  void copy_fct   {     ...  }  int v1[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; int v2[10];     to become a copyofv1  for  auto i=0; i!=10; ++i      copyelements  v2[i]=v1[i];  This for-statement can be read as ‘‘set i to zero; while i is not 10, copy the ith element and increment i.’’ When applied to an integer variable, the increment operator, ++, simply adds 1. C++ also offers a simpler for-statement, called a range-for-statement, for loops that traverse a sequence in the sim- plest way:  void print   {  int v[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};  for  auto x : v      foreach x in v  cout << x << '\n';  for  auto x : {10,21,32,43,54,65}   cout << x << '\n';     ...  }  The ﬁrst range-for-statement can be read as ‘‘for every element of v, from the ﬁrst to the last, place a copy in x and print it.’’  Note that we don’t hav e to specify an array bound when we initialize it with a list. The range-for-statement can be used for any sequence of elements  §3.4.1 .  If we didn’t want to copy the values from v into the variable x, but rather just have x refer to an  element, we could write:   46  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  void increment   {  int v[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};  for  auto& x : v   ++x;     ...  }  {  }  In  a  declaration,  the  unary  sufﬁx & means  ‘‘reference  to.’’  A reference  is  similar  to  a  pointer, except that you don’t need to use a preﬁx ∗ to access the value referred to by the reference. Also, a reference cannot be made to refer to a different object after its initialization. When used in declara- tions, operators  such as &, ∗, and []  are called declarator operators:  T a[n];  T∗ p;  T& r; T f A ;      T[n]: array ofnTs §7.3     T*: pointer to T  §7.2     T&: reference to T  §7.7     T A : function taking an argument of type A returning a result of type T  §2.2.1   We  try to ensure that a pointer always points to an object, so that dereferencing it is valid.  When we don’t hav e an object to point to or if we need to represent the notion of ‘‘no object available’’  e.g., for an end of a list , we give the pointer the value nullptr  ‘‘the null pointer’’ .  There is only one nullptr shared by all pointer types:  double∗ pd = nullptr; Link ∗ lst = nullptr;  int x = nullptr;      pointer to a Link to a Record    error :nullptr is a pointer not an integer  It is often wise to check that a pointer argument that is supposed to point to something, actually points to something:  int count_x char∗ p, char x      count the number of occurrences of x in p[]    pisassumed to point to a zero-ter minatedarray ofchar  or to nothing   if  p==nullptr  return 0; int count = 0; for  ; ∗p!=0; ++p   if  ∗p==x   ++count;  return count;  Note how we can move a pointer to point to the next element of an array using ++ and that we can leave out the initializer in a for-statement if we don’t need it.  The  deﬁnition  of count_x   assumes  that  the char∗ is  a C-style  string, that  is,  that  the  pointer  points to a zero-terminated array of char.  In  older  code, 0 or NULL is  typically  used  instead  of nullptr  §7.2.2 .  However,  using nullptr  eliminates potential confusion between integers  such as 0 or NULL  and pointers  such as nullptr .   Section 2.3  User-Deﬁned Types   47  2.3  User-Deﬁned Types We call the types that can be built from the fundamental types  §2.2.2 , the const modiﬁer  §2.2.3 , and  the  declarator  operators   §2.2.5  built-in  types. C++’s set  of  built-in  types  and  operations  is rich, but deliberately low-level.  They directly and efﬁciently reﬂect the capabilities of conventional computer hardware.  However, they don’t provide the programmer with high-level facilities to con- veniently  write  advanced  applications. Instead,  C++  augments  the  built-in  types  and  operations with a sophisticated set of abstraction mechanisms out of which programmers can build such high- level facilities.  The C++ abstraction mechanisms are primarily designed to let programmers design and implement their own types, with suitable representations and operations, and for programmers to simply and elegantly use such types. Types built out of the built-in types using C++’s abstraction mechanisms are called user-deﬁned types. They are referred to as classes and enumerations. Most of this book is devoted to the design, implementation, and use of user-deﬁned types. The rest of this  chapter  presents  the  simplest  and  most  fundamental  facilities  for  that. Chapter  3  is  a  more complete  description  of  the  abstraction  mechanisms  and  the  programming  styles  they support. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 present an overview of the standard library, and since the standard library mainly  consists  of  user-deﬁned  types,  they provide  examples  of  what  can  be  built  using  the  lan- guage facilities and programming techniques presented in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.  2.3.1  Structures The ﬁrst step in building a new type is often to organize the elements it needs into a data structure, a struct:  };  }  struct Vector {  int sz;    number of elements double∗ elem;     pointer to elements  This ﬁrst version of Vector consists of an int and a double∗.  A variable of type Vector can be deﬁned like this:  Vector v;  However, by itself that is not of much use because v’s elem pointer doesn’t point to anything.  To be useful, we must give v some elements to point to. For example, we can construct a Vector like this:  void vector_init Vector& v, int s  {  v.elem = new double[s];     allocate an array ofsdoubles v.sz = s;  That is, v’s elem member gets a pointer produced by the new operator and v’s size member gets the number  of  elements. The & in Vector& indicates  that  we  pass v by  non-const reference   §2.2.5, §7.7 ; that way, vector_init   can modify the vector passed to it.  The new operator allocates memory from an area called the free store  also known as dynamic  memory and heap; §11.2 .   48  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  {  }  }  A simple use of Vector looks like this:  double read_and_sum int s      read s integers from cin and returntheir sum; s is assumed to be positive     allocate s elements for v     read into elements  Vector v; vector_init v,s ;  for  int i=0; i!=s; ++i  cin>>v.elem[i];   double sum = 0; for  int i=0; i!=s; ++i   return sum;  sum+=v.elem[i];      takethe sum of the elements  There is a long way to go before our Vector is as elegant and ﬂexible as the standard-library vector. In particular, a user of Vector has to know every detail of Vector’s  representation.  The rest of this chapter and the next gradually improve Vector as an example of language features and techniques. Chapter 4 presents the standard-library vector, which contains many nice improvements, and Chap- ter 31 presents the complete vector in the context of other standard-library facilities.  I use vector and other standard-library components as examples  cid:129   cid:129   to illustrate language features and design techniques, and to help you learn and use the standard-library components.  Don’t reinvent standard-library components, such as vector and string; use them.  We  use .  dot  to access struct members through a name  and through a reference  and −> to  access struct members through a pointer. For example:  void f Vector v, Vector& rv, Vector∗ pv  {  int i1 = v.sz;  int i2 = rv.sz;  int i4 = pv−>sz;     access through name    access through reference    access through pointer  2.3.2  Classes Having the data speciﬁed separately from the operations on it has advantages, such as the ability to use the data in arbitrary ways.  However,  a  tighter connection between the representation and the operations is needed for a user-deﬁned type to have all the properties expected of a ‘‘real type.’’  In particular, we often want to keep the representation inaccessible to users, so as to ease use, guaran- tee consistent use of the data, and allow us to later improve the representation. To  do that we have to distinguish between the interface to a type  to be used by all  and its implementation  which has access to the otherwise inaccessible data . The language mechanism for that is called a class. A class is deﬁned to have a set of members, which can be data, function, or type members. The inter- face is deﬁned by the public members of a class, and private members are accessible only through that interface.  For example:   Classes   49  Section 2.3.2  class Vector { public:  Vector int s  :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s} { } double& operator[] int i  { return elem[i]; } int size   { return sz; }     constr uctaVector    element access: subscripting  private:  };  double∗ elem;     pointer to the elements int sz;    the number of elements  Given that, we can deﬁne a variable of our new type Vector:  Vector v 6 ;     aVector with 6 elements  We can illustrate a Vector object graphically:  Vector:  elem: sz:  6  0:  1:  2:  3:  4:  5:  Basically, the Vector object is a ‘‘handle’’ containing a pointer to the elements  elem  plus the num- ber of elements  sz .  The number of elements  6 in the example  can vary from Vector object to Vector object,  and  a Vector object  can  have  a  different  number  of  elements  at  different  times  §3.2.1.3 .  However, the Vector object itself is always the same size. This is the basic technique for handling varying amounts of information in C++: a ﬁxed-size handle referring to a variable amount of data ‘‘elsewhere’’  e.g., on the free store allocated by new; §11.2 .  How to design and use such objects is the main topic of Chapter 3.  Here, the representation of a Vector  the members elem and sz  is accessible only through the interface  provided  by  the public members: Vector  , operator[]  , and siz e  . The read_and_sum   example from §2.3.1 simpliﬁes to:  double read_and_sum int s  {  Vector v s ; for  int i=0; i!=v.siz e  ; ++i   cin>>v[i];   double sum = 0; for  int i=0; i!=v.siz e  ; ++i   sum+=v[i];   return sum;  }     makeavector of s elements     read into elements     takethe sum of the elements  A ‘‘function’’ with the same name as its class is called a constructor, that is, a function used to con- struct objects of a class. So, the constructor, Vector  , replaces vector_init   from §2.3.1. Unlike an ordinary  function,  a  constructor  is  guaranteed  to  be  used  to  initialize  objects  of  its  class. Thus, deﬁning a constructor eliminates the problem of uninitialized variables for a class.   50  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  Vector int  deﬁnes how objects of type Vector are constructed. In particular, it states that it needs an integer to do that. That integer is used as the number of elements. The constructor initializes the Vector members using a member initializer list:  :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s}  That is, we ﬁrst initialize elem with a pointer to s elements of type double obtained from the free store.  Then, we initialize sz to s.  Access to elements is provided by a subscript function, called operator[]. It returns a reference  to the appropriate element  a double& .  The size   function is supplied to give users the number of elements. Obviously, error handling is completely missing, but we’ll return to that in §2.4.3. Similarly, we  did  not  provide  a  mechanism  to  ‘‘give  back’’ the  array  of doubles acquired  by new; §3.2.1.2 shows how to use a destructor to elegantly do that.  2.3.3  Enumerations In addition to classes, C++ supports a simple form of user-deﬁned type for which we can enumer- ate the values:  enum class Color { red, blue , green }; enum class Trafﬁc_light { green, yellow, red };  Color col = Color::red; Trafﬁc_light light = Trafﬁc_light::red;  Note  that  enumerators   e.g., red  are  in  the  scope  of  their enum  class, so that  they can  be  used repeatedly  in  different enum  classes  without  confusion. For example, Color::red is Color’s red which is different from Trafﬁc_light::red.  Enumerations are used to represent small sets of integer values.  They are used to make code more readable and less error-prone than it would have been had the symbolic  and mnemonic  enu- merator names not been used.  The class after the enum speciﬁes that an enumeration is strongly typed and that its enumerators are scoped. Being separate types, enum  classes  help  prevent  accidental  misuses  of  constants. In particular, we cannot mix Trafﬁc_light and Color values:  Color x = red; Color y = Trafﬁc_light::red;  Color z = Color::red;     error :which red?    error :that red is not a Color    OK  Similarly, we cannot implicitly mix Color and integer values:  int i = Color::red; Color c = 2;     error :Color ::redis not an int    error :2isnot a Color  If  you  don’t want  to  explicitly  qualify  enumerator  names  and  want  enumerator  values  to  be ints  without the need for an explicit conversion , you can remove the class from enum  class to get a ‘‘plain enum’’  §8.4.2 .  By default, an enum  class has only assignment, initialization, and comparisons  e.g., == and <;  §2.2.2  deﬁned. However, an enumeration is a user-deﬁned type so we can deﬁne operators for it:   Section 2.3.3  Enumerations   51  Trafﬁc_light& operator++ Trafﬁc_light& t      preﬁx increment: ++  switch  t  { case Trafﬁc_light::green:  case Trafﬁc_light::yellow:  case Trafﬁc_light::red:  }  return t=Trafﬁc_light::yellow; return t=Trafﬁc_light::red; return t=Trafﬁc_light::green;  Trafﬁc_light next = ++light;     next becomes Trafﬁc_light::green  C++ also offers a less strongly typed ‘‘plain’’ enum  §8.4.2 .  2.4  Modularity A C++  program  consists  of  many separately  developed  parts,  such  as  functions   §2.2.1,  Chapter 12 ,  user-deﬁned  types   §2.3,  §3.2,  Chapter  16 ,  class  hierarchies   §3.2.4,  Chapter  20 ,  and  tem- plates   §3.4,  Chapter  23 . The  key  to managing  this  is  to  clearly  deﬁne  the  interactions  among those parts. The ﬁrst and most important step is to distinguish between the interface to a part and its implementation. At the language level, C++ represents interfaces by declarations. A declara- tion speciﬁes all that’s needed to use a function or a type. For example:  double sqrt double ;      the square root function takes a double and returns a double  class Vector { public:  Vector int s ; double& operator[] int i ; int size  ;  private:  double∗ elem;     elem points to an array ofszdoubles int sz;  The key point here is that the function bodies, the function deﬁnitions, are ‘‘elsewhere.’’  For this example, we might like for the representation of Vector to be ‘‘elsewhere’’ also, but we will deal with that later  abstract types; §3.2.2 . The deﬁnition of sqrt   will look like this:  double sqrt double d  {     deﬁnition of sqrt       ... algorithm as found in math textbook ...  For Vector, we need to deﬁne all three member functions:  Vector::Vector int s   :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s}     deﬁnition of the constructor    initializemembers  {  }  };  }  { }   52  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  double& Vector::operator[] int i  {  return elem[i];     deﬁnition of subscripting     deﬁnition of size    }  }  int Vector::siz e   {  return sz;  We must deﬁne Vector’s functions, but not sqrt   because it is part of the standard library. Howev er, that makes no real difference: a library is simply some ‘‘other code we happen to use’’ written with the same language facilities as we use.  2.4.1  Separate Compilation C++ supports a notion of separate compilation where user code sees only declarations of types and functions used. The deﬁnitions of those types and functions are in separate source ﬁles and com- piled separately. This can be used to organize a program into a set of semi-independent code frag- ments.  Such separation can be used to minimize compilation times and to strictly enforce separa- tion  of  logically  distinct  parts  of  a  program   thus  minimizing  the  chance  of  errors . A library  is often a separately compiled code fragments  e.g., functions .  Typically, we place the declarations that specify the interface to a module in a ﬁle with a name  indicating its intended use. For example:     Vector.h:  class Vector { public:  Vector int s ; double& operator[] int i ; int size  ;  private:  double∗ elem;  int sz;  };     user.cpp:     elem points to an array ofszdoubles  This declaration would be placed in a ﬁle Vector.h, and users will include that ﬁle, called a header ﬁle, to access that interface.  For example:  include "Vector.h"  include   using namespace std;     get Vector’sinterface    get the the standard-librar ymath function interface including sqrt      makestd members visible  §2.4.2    Section 2.4.1  Separate Compilation  53     sum of square roots  To  help the compiler ensure consistency,  the .cpp ﬁle providing the implementation of Vector will also include the .h ﬁle providing its interface:  double sqrt_sum Vector& v  {  double sum = 0; for  int i=0; i!=v.siz e  ; ++i   sum+=sqrt v[i] ;  return sum;  }  { }  }  }     Vector.cpp:  include "Vector.h"     get the interface  Vector::Vector int s   :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s}  double& Vector::operator[] int i  {  return elem[i];  int Vector::siz e   {  return sz;  The code in user.cpp and Vector.cpp shares the Vector interface information presented in Vector.h, but the two ﬁles are otherwise independent and can be separately compiled. Graphically, the pro- gram fragments can be represented like this:  Vector.h:  Vector interface  user.cpp:  Vector.cpp:  include "Vector.h"  use Vector  include "Vector.h"  deﬁne Vector  Strictly  speaking,  using  separate  compilation  isn’t a language  issue;  it  is  an  issue  of  how best  to take advantage  of  a  particular  language  implementation. However,  it is of great  practical  impor- tance.  The best  approach  is  to  maximize  modularity, represent  that  modularity  logically  through language  features,  and  then  exploit  the  modularity  physically  through  ﬁles  for  effective  separate compilation  Chapter 14, Chapter 15 .   54  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  2.4.2  Namespaces In addition to functions  §2.2.1, Chapter 12 , classes  Chapter 16 , and enumerations  §2.3.3, §8.4 , C++ offers namespaces  Chapter 14  as a mechanism for expressing that some declarations belong together  and  that  their  names  shouldn’t clash  with  other  names. For example,  I  might  want  to experiment with my own complex number type  §3.2.1.1, §18.3, §40.4 :  namespace My_code {  class complex {  * ...*  }; complex sqr t complex ;    ... int main  ;  int My_code::main   {  int main   {  return My_code::main  ;  }  };  }  complex z {1,2}; auto z2 = sqrt z ; std::cout << '{' << z2.real   << ',' << z2.imag   << "}\n";    ...  By putting my code into the namespace My_code, I make sure that my names do not conﬂict with the standard-library names in namespace std  §4.1.2 .  The precaution is wise, because the standard library does provide support for complex arithmetic  §3.2.1.1, §40.4 .  The simplest way to access a name in another namespace is to qualify it with the namespace name   e.g., std::cout and My_code::main .  The ‘‘real main  ’’  is deﬁned  in  the  global  namespace, that is, not local to a deﬁned namespace, class, or function. To  gain access to names in the stan- dard-library namespace, we can use a using-directive  §14.2.3 :  using namespace std;  Namespaces  are  primarily  used  to  organize  larger  program  components,  such  as  libraries. They simplify the composition of a program out of separately developed parts.  2.4.3  Error Handling Error handling is a large and complex topic with concerns and ramiﬁcations that go far beyond lan- guage facilities into programming techniques and tools. However, C++ provides a few features to help.  The major tool is the type system itself. Instead of painstakingly building up our applications from the built-in types  e.g., char, int, and double  and statements  e.g., if, while, and for , we build more  types  that  are  appropriate  for  our  applications   e.g., string, map, and regex  and  algorithms  e.g., sort  , ﬁnd_if  , and draw_all   .  Such higher level constructs simplify our programming, limit our opportunities for mistakes  e.g., you are unlikely to try to apply a tree traversal to a dialog box ,   Section 2.4.3  Error Handling  55  and increase the compiler’s chances of catching such errors. The majority of C++ constructs are dedicated to the design and implementation of elegant and efﬁcient abstractions  e.g., user-deﬁned types and algorithms using them . One effect of this modularity and abstraction  in particular, the use of libraries  is that the point where a run-time error can be detected is separated from the point where  it  can  be  handled. As  programs  grow,  and  especially  when  libraries  are  used  extensively, standards for handling errors become important.  2.4.3.1  Exceptions  Consider again the Vector example.  What ought to be done when we try to access an element that is out of range for the vector from §2.3.2?   cid:129  The writer of Vector doesn’t know what the user would like to hav e done in this case  the  writer of Vector typically doesn’t even know in which program the vector will be running .   cid:129  The user of Vector cannot consistently detect the problem  if the user could, the out-of-range  access wouldn’t happen in the ﬁrst place .  The solution is for the Vector implementer to detect the attempted out-of-range access and then tell the user about it. The user can then take appropriate action. For example, Vector::operator[]   can detect an attempted out-of-range access and throw an out_of_range exception:  double& Vector::operator[] int i  {  if  i<0  size  <=i  throw out_of_rang e{"Vector::operator[]"}; return elem[i];  The throw transfers control to a handler for exceptions of type out_of_range in some function that directly  or  indirectly  called Vector::operator[]  . To do that,  the  implementation  will  unwind  the function call stack as needed to get back to the context of that caller  §13.5.1 . For example:  }  }  void f Vector& v  {     ... try {    exceptions here are handled bythe handler deﬁned below  v[v.siz e  ] = 7;    tr yto access beyond the end of v  } catch  out_of_rang e  {     ... handle range error ...     oops: out_of_range error  }    ...  We  put code for which we are interested in handling exceptions into a try-block.  That attempted assignment to v[v.siz e  ] will fail.  Therefore, the catch-clause providing a handler for out_of_range will be entered. The out_of_range type is deﬁned in the standard library and is in fact used by some standard-library container access functions.  Use of the exception-handling mechanisms can make error handling simpler, more systematic,  and more readable. See Chapter 13 for further discussion, details, and examples.   56  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  2.4.3.2  Invariants  The use of exceptions to signal out-of-range access is an example of a function checking its argu- ment and refusing to act because a basic assumption, a precondition, didn’t hold.  Had we formally speciﬁed Vector’s subscript operator, we would have said something like ‘‘the index must be in the [0:size    range,’’  and  that  was  in  fact  what  we  tested  in  our operator[]  . Whenever we deﬁne  a function, we should consider what its preconditions are and if feasible test them  see §12.4, §13.4 . However, operator[]   operates  on  objects  of  type Vector and  nothing  it  does  makes  any sense unless the members of Vector have ‘‘reasonable’’ values.  In particular, we did say ‘‘elem points to an array of sz doubles’’ but we only said that in a comment. Such a statement of what is assumed to be true for a class is called a class invariant, or simply an invariant. It is the job of a constructor to establish the invariant for its class  so that the member functions can rely on it  and for the mem- ber functions to make sure that the invariant holds when they exit.  Unfortunately, our Vector con- structor only partially did its job. It properly initialized the Vector members, but it failed to check that the arguments passed to it made sense. Consider:  I use  the  standard-library  exception length_error to  report  a  non-positive  number  of  elements because  some  standard-library  operations  use  that  exception  to  report  problems  of  this  kind. If operator new can’t ﬁnd memory to allocate, it throws a std::bad_alloc. We can now write:  Vector v −27 ;  This is likely to cause chaos.  Here is a more appropriate deﬁnition:  Vector::Vector int s  {  if  s<0  throw length_error{}; elem = new double[s]; sz = s;  }  void test   {  try {  }  }  Vector v −27 ;  } catch  std::length_error  {    handle negativesize  } catch  std::bad_alloc  {     handle memoryexhaustion  You can deﬁne your own classes to be used as exceptions and have them carry arbitrary information from a point where an error is detected to a point where it can be handled  §13.5 .  Often,  a  function  has  no  way  of  completing  its  assigned  task  after  an  exception  is  thrown. Then, ‘‘handling’’ an exception simply means doing some minimal local cleanup and rethrowing the exception  §13.5.2.1 .   Section 2.4.3.2  Invariants   57  The notion of invariants is central to the design of classes, and preconditions serve a similar role  in the design of functions. Invariants   cid:129   cid:129   helps us to understand precisely what we want forces  us  to  be  speciﬁc;  that  gives us a better  chance  of  getting  our  code  correct   after debugging and testing .  The notion of invariants underlies C++’s notions of resource management supported by construc- tors  §2.3.2  and destructors  §3.2.1.2, §5.2 . See also §13.4, §16.3.1, and §17.2.  2.4.3.3  Static Assertions  Exceptions report errors found at run time. If an error can be found at compile time, it is usually preferable to do so. That’s what much of the type system and the facilities for specifying the inter- faces to user-deﬁned types are for. Howev er, we can also perform simple checks on other proper- ties that are known at compile time and report failures as compiler error messages. For example:  static_assert 4<=sizeof int , "integers are too small" ;     checkinteger size  This will write integers are too small if 4<=sizeof int  does not hold, that is, if an int on this system does not have at least 4 bytes. We call such statements of expectations assertions.  The static_assert mechanism can be used for anything that can be expressed in terms of constant  expressions  §2.2.3, §10.4 . For example:  constexpr double C = 299792.458;     km s  const double local_max = 160.0  60∗60 ;      160 km h == 160.0  60*60  km s  static_assert speed<C,"can't go that fast" ; static_assert local_max<C,"can't go that fast" ;     error :speed must be a constant    OK  void f double speed  {     ...  }  In general, static_assert A,S  prints S as a compiler error message if A is not true.  The  most  important  uses  of static_assert come  when  we  make assertions  about  types  used  as  parameters in generic programming  §5.4.2, §24.3 .  For runtime-checked assertions, see §13.4.  2.5  Postscript The topics covered in this chapter roughly correspond to the contents of Part II  Chapters 6–15 . Those are the parts of C++ that underlie all programming techniques and styles supported by C++. Experienced C and C++ programmers, please note that this foundation does not closely correspond to the C or C++98 subsets of C++  that is, C++11 .   58  A Tour of C++: The Basics  Chapter 2  2.6  Advice [1]  Don’t panic!

It  informally  presents  ways  of  deﬁning  and  using  new types  user-deﬁned types .  In particular, it presents the basic properties, implementation techniques, and language facilities used for concrete classes, abstract classes, and class hierarchies. Templates are introduced  as  a  mechanism  for  parameterizing  types  and  algorithms  with   other   types  and  algo- rithms.  Computations on user-deﬁned and built-in types are represented as functions, sometimes generalized to template functions and function objects. These are the language facilities supporting the  programming  styles  known  as object-oriented  programming and generic  programming. The next two chapters follow up by presenting examples of standard-library facilities and their use.  The  assumption  is  that  you  have  programmed  before. If  not,  please  consider  reading  a  text- book, such as Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ [Stroustrup,2009], before contin- uing  here. Even  if  you  have  programmed  before,  the  language  you  used  or  the  applications  you wrote may be very different from the style of C++ presented here. If you ﬁnd this ‘‘lightning tour’’ confusing, skip to the more systematic presentation starting in Chapter 6.   60  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  As  in  Chapter  2,  this  tour  presents  C++  as  an  integrated  whole,  rather  than  as  a  layer  cake. Consequently, it does  not  identify  language  features  as  present  in  C,  part  of  C++98,  or  new in C++11.  Such historical information can be found in §1.4 and Chapter 44.  3.2  Classes The central language feature of C++ is the class. A class is a user-deﬁned type provided to repre- sent a concept in the code of a program. Whenever our design for a program has a useful concept, idea, entity, etc., we try to represent it as a class in the program so that the idea is there in the code, rather than just in our head, in a design document, or in some comments. A program built out of a well chosen set of classes is far easier to understand and get right than one that builds everything directly in terms of the built-in types. In particular, classes are often what libraries offer.  Essentially all language facilities beyond the fundamental types, operators, and statements exist to help deﬁne better classes or to use them more conveniently. By ‘‘better,’’ I mean more correct, easier to maintain, more efﬁcient, more elegant, easier to use, easier to read, and easier to reason about.  Most programming techniques rely on the design and implementation of speciﬁc kinds of classes.  The needs  and  tastes  of  programmers  vary  immensely. Consequently, the  support  for classes  is  extensive. Here,  we  will  just  consider  the  basic  support  for  three  important  kinds  of classes:   cid:129  Concrete classes  §3.2.1   cid:129  Abstract classes  §3.2.2   cid:129  Classes in class hierarchies  §3.2.4   An astounding number of useful classes turn out to be of these three kinds. Even more classes can be seen as simple variants of these kinds or are implemented using combinations of the techniques used for these.  3.2.1  Concrete Types The  basic  idea  of concrete  classes is  that  they behave  ‘‘just  like built-in  types.’’  For  example,  a complex number type and an inﬁnite-precision integer are much like built-in int, except of course that they hav e their own semantics and sets of operations. Similarly, a vector and a string are much like built-in arrays, except that they are better behaved  §4.2, §4.3.2, §4.4.1 .  The deﬁning characteristic of a concrete type is that its representation is part of its deﬁnition. In many important cases, such as a vector, that representation is only one or more pointers to more data stored elsewhere, but it is present in each object of a concrete class. That allows implementa- tions to be optimally efﬁcient in time and space. In particular, it allows us to   cid:129    cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   place  objects  of  concrete  types  on  the  stack,  in  statically  allocated  memory, and  in  other objects  §6.4.2 ; refer to objects directly  and not just through pointers or references ; initialize objects immediately and completely  e.g., using constructors; §2.3.2 ; and copy objects  §3.3 .  The representation can be private  as it is for Vector; §2.3.2  and accessible only through the mem- ber functions, but it is present. Therefore, if the representation changes in any signiﬁcant way, a user must recompile. This is the price to pay for having concrete types behave exactly like built-in   Section 3.2.1  Concrete Types   61  types.  For  types  that  don’t change  often,  and  where  local  variables  provide  much-needed  clarity and efﬁciency,  this is acceptable and often ideal. To  increase ﬂexibility, a concrete type can keep major parts of its representation on the free store  dynamic memory, heap  and access them through the part stored in the class object itself. That’s the way vector and string are implemented; they can be considered resource handles with carefully crafted interfaces.  3.2.1.1  An Arithmetic Type  The ‘‘classical user-deﬁned arithmetic type’’ is complex:  class complex {  public:  double re, im;     representation: twodoubles  complex double r, double i  :re{r}, im{i} {} complex double r  :re{r}, im{0} {} complex   :re{0}, im{0} {}     constructcomplexfrom twoscalars    constructcomplexfrom one scalar    default complex: {0,0}  double real   const { return re; } void real double d  { re=d; } double imag   const { return im; } void imag double d  { im=d; }  complex& operator+= complex z  { re+=z.re , im+=z.im; return ∗this; }  complex& operator−= complex z  { re−=z.re , im−=z.im; return ∗this; }     add to re and im    and returnthe result  complex& operator∗= complex ;  complex& operator = complex ;      deﬁned out-of-class somewhere    deﬁned out-of-class somewhere  };  This  is  a  slightly  simpliﬁed  version  of  the  standard-library complex  §40.4 .  The class  deﬁnition itself contains only the operations requiring access to the representation. The representation is sim- ple and conventional.  For practical reasons, it has to be compatible with what Fortran provided 50 years ago, and we need a conventional set of operators. In addition to the logical demands, complex must  be  efﬁcient  or  it  will  remain  unused. This  implies  that  simple  operations  must  be  inlined. That is, simple operations  such as constructors, +=, and imag    must be implemented without func- tion calls in the generated machine code. Functions deﬁned in a class are inlined by default.  An industrial-strength complex  like the standard-library one  is carefully implemented to do appropri- ate inlining.  A constructor that can be invoked without an argument is called a default constructor. Thus, complex   is complex’s default constructor. By deﬁning a default constructor you eliminate the pos- sibility of uninitialized variables of that type.  The const speciﬁers on the functions returning the real and imaginary parts indicate that these  functions do not modify the object for which they are called.  Many useful  operations  do  not  require  direct  access  to  the  representation  of complex, so they  can be deﬁned separately from the class deﬁnition:   62  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  complex operator+ complex a, complex b  { return a+=b; } complex operator− complex a, complex b  { return a−=b; } complex operator− complex a  { return {−a.real  , −a.imag  }; } complex operator∗ complex a, complex b  { return a∗=b; } complex operator  complex a, complex b  { return a =b; }     unar yminus  Here, I use the fact that an argument passed by value is copied, so that I can modify an argument without affecting the caller’s copy, and use the result as the return value.  The deﬁnitions of == and != are straightforward:  bool operator== complex a, complex b  {     equal  return a.real  ==b.real   && a.imag  ==b.imag  ;  bool operator!= complex a, complex b  {     not equal  return ! a==b ;  complex sqr t complex ;     ...  Class complex can be used like this:  void f complex z  {  complex a {2.3};  complex b {1 a}; complex c {a+z∗complex{1,2.3}};    ... if  c != b   c =−  b a +2∗b;     construct{2.3,0.0} from 2.3  }  }  }  The  compiler  converts  operators  involving complex numbers  into  appropriate  function  calls. For example, c!=b means operator!= c,b  and 1 a means operator  complex{1},a .  User-deﬁned operators  ‘‘overloaded operators’’  should be used cautiously and conventionally. The syntax is ﬁxed by the language, so you can’t deﬁne a unary  . Also, it is not possible to change the meaning of an operator for built-in types, so you can’t redeﬁne + to subtract ints.  3.2.1.2  A Container  A container is an object holding a collection of elements, so we call Vector a container because it is the type of objects that are containers. As deﬁned in §2.3.2, Vector isn’t an unreasonable container of doubles:  it  is  simple  to  understand,  establishes  a  useful  invariant   §2.4.3.2 ,  provides  range- checked access  §2.4.3.1 , and provides size   to allow us to iterate over its elements. However, it does  have  a  fatal  ﬂaw:  it  allocates  elements  using new but nev er deallocates  them. That’s not  a good  idea  because  although  C++  deﬁnes  an  interface  for  a  garbage  collector   §34.5 ,  it  is  not   Section 3.2.1.2  A Container   63  guaranteed that one is available to make unused memory available for new objects.  In some envi- ronments you can’t use a collector, and sometimes you prefer more precise control of destruction  §13.6.4   for  logical  or  performance  reasons. We  need  a  mechanism  to  ensure  that  the  memory allocated by the constructor is deallocated; that mechanism is a destructor:  class Vector { private:  double∗ elem;  int sz;  public:     elem points to an array ofszdoubles  Vector int s  :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s} {     constructor:acquire resources  for  int i=0; i!=s; ++i  elem[i]=0;     initializeelements  ˜Vector   { delete[] elem; }     destructor:release resources  The name of a destructor is the complement operator, ˜, followed by the name of the class; it is the complement of a constructor. Vector’s  constructor allocates some memory on the free store  also called the heap or dynamic store  using the new operator. The destructor cleans up by freeing that memory  using  the delete operator. This  is  all  done  without  intervention  by  users  of Vector. The users simply create and use Vectors much as they would variables of built-in types. For example:  }  {  double& operator[] int i ; int size   const;  };  void fct int n  {  Vector v n ;     ... use v ...  Vector v2 2∗n ;    ... use v and v2 ...  }    v2 is destroyedhere     ... use v ..  }    visdestroyedhere  Vector obeys  the  same  rules  for  naming,  scope,  allocation,  lifetime,  etc.,  as  does  a  built-in  type, such as int and char. For details on how to control the lifetime of an object, see §6.4. This Vector has been simpliﬁed by leaving out error handling; see §2.4.3.  The constructor destructor combination is the basis of many elegant techniques. In particular, it is  the  basis  for  most  C++  general  resource  management  techniques   §5.2,  §13.3 . Consider  a graphical illustration of a Vector:   64  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  Vector:  elem: sz:  6  0: 0  1: 0  2: 0  3: 0  4: 0  5: 0  The  constructor  allocates  the  elements  and  initializes  the Vector members  appropriately. The  de- structor  deallocates  the  elements. This handle-to-data  model is  very  commonly  used  to  manage data that can vary in size during the lifetime of an object. The technique of acquiring resources in a constructor and releasing them in a destructor, known as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization or RAII, allows us to eliminate ‘‘naked new operations,’’  that is, to avoid allocations in general code and keep them buried inside the implementation of well-behaved abstractions.  Similarly, ‘‘naked delete operations’’ should be avoided.  Avoiding naked new and naked delete makes code far less error-prone and far easier to keep free of resource leaks  §5.2 .  3.2.1.3  Initializing Containers  A container exists to hold elements, so obviously we need convenient ways of getting elements into a container. We can handle that by creating a Vector with an appropriate number of elements and then  assigning  to  them,  but  typically  other  ways  are  more  elegant.  Here, I just  mention  two favorites:   cid:129   cid:129   Initializer-list constructor: Initialize with a list of elements. push_back  : Add a new element at the end  at the back of  the sequence.  These can be declared like this:  class Vector { public:  };  }  Vector read istream& is  {  Vector v; for  double d; is>>d;  v.push_back d ;   return v;  Vector std::initializ er_list  ;     ... void push_back double ;     ...     initializewith a list     add element at end increasing the sizebyone  The push_back   is useful for input of arbitrary numbers of elements. For example:     read ﬂoating-point values into d    add d to v  The input loop is terminated by an end-of-ﬁle or a formatting error. Until that happens, each num- ber read is added to the Vector so that at the end, v’s size is the number of elements read. I used a for-statement rather than the more conventional while-statement to keep the scope of d limited to the loop.  The implementation of push_back   is discussed in §13.6.4.3. The way to provide Vector with a move  constructor, so that  returning  a  potentially  huge  amount  of  data  from read   is  cheap,  is explained in §3.3.2.   Section 3.2.1.3  Initializing Containers  65  The std::initializer_list used  to  deﬁne  the  initializer-list  constructor  is  a  standard-library  type known to the compiler: when we use a {}-list, such as {1,2,3,4}, the compiler will create an object of type initializer_list to give to the program. So, we can write:  Vector v1 = {1,2,3,4,5}; Vector v2 = {1.23, 3.45, 6.7, 8};     v1 has 5 elements    v2 has 4 elements  Vector’s initializer-list constructor might be deﬁned like this:  Vector::Vector std::initializ er_list  lst  :elem{new double[lst.siz e  ]}, sz{lst.siz e  }     initializewith a list  copy lst.begin  ,lst.end  ,elem ;      copyfrom lst into elem  3.2.2  Abstract Types Types such as complex and Vector are called concrete types because their representation is part of their  deﬁnition. In  that,  they resemble  built-in  types. In  contrast,  an abstract  type is  a  type  that completely  insulates  a  user  from  implementation  details. To  do that,  we  decouple  the  interface from the representation and give up genuine local variables.  Since we don’t know anything about the representation of an abstract type  not even its size , we must allocate objects on the free store  §3.2.1.2, §11.2  and access them through references or pointers  §2.2.5, §7.2, §7.7 .  First, we deﬁne the interface of a class Container which we will design as a more abstract ver-  sion of our Vector:  class Container { public:  virtual double& operator[] int  = 0; virtual int size   const = 0; virtual ˜Container   {}     pure virtual function    const member function  §3.2.1.1     destructor §3.2.1.2   This class is a pure interface to speciﬁc containers deﬁned later. The word virtual means ‘‘may be redeﬁned  later  in  a  class  derived from  this  one.’’  Unsurprisingly, a function  declared virtual is called a virtual function. A class derived from Container provides an implementation for the Con- tainer interface.  The curious =0 syntax says the function is pure virtual; that is, some class derived from Container must deﬁne the function. Thus, it is not possible to deﬁne an object that is just a Container; a Container can only serve as the interface to a class that implements its operator[]   and size   functions.  A class with a pure virtual function is called an abstract class.  This Container can be used like this:  void use Container& c  {  const int sz = c.size  ;  for  int i=0; i!=sz; ++i   cout << c[i] << '\n';  {  }  };  }   66  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  Note  how use   uses  the Container interface  in  complete  ignorance  of  implementation  details. It uses size   and [] without  any idea  of  exactly  which  type  provides  their  implementation. A class that provides the interface to a variety of other classes is often called a polymorphic type  §20.3.2 . As is common for abstract classes, Container does not have a constructor. After all, it does not have any data to initialize. On the other hand, Container does have a destructor and that destructor is virtual. Again, that is common for abstract classes because they tend to be manipulated through references  or  pointers,  and  someone  destroying  a Container through  a  pointer  has  no  idea  what resources are owned by its implementation; see also §3.2.4.  A container that implements the functions required by the interface deﬁned by the abstract class  Container could use the concrete class Vector:  class Vector_container : public Container {     Vector_container implements Container  Vector v;  public:  Vector_container int s  : v s  { } ˜Vector_container   {}     Vector of s elements  double& operator[] int i  { return v[i]; } int size   const { return v.siz e  ; }  };  The :public can be read as ‘‘is derived from’’ or ‘‘is a subtype of.’’  Class Vector_container is said to be derived from class Container, and class Container is said to be a base of class Vector_container. An  alternative  terminology  calls Vector_container and Container subclass and superclass, respec- tively. The  derived class  is  said  to  inherit  members  from  its  base  class,  so  the  use  of  base  and derived classes is commonly referred to as inheritance.  The members operator[]   and size   are said to override the corresponding members in the base class Container  §20.3.2 .  The destructor   ˜Vector_container    overrides  the  base  class  destructor  ˜Container   .  Note that  the  member  destructor   ˜Vector    is implicitly  invoked by its  class’s de- structor  ˜Vector_container   .  For a  function like use Container&  to use a Container in complete ignorance of implementation  details, some other function will have to make an object on which it can operate. For example:  void g   {  }  public:  Vector_container vc {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}; use vc ;  Since use   doesn’t know about Vector_containers but  only  knows  the Container interface,  it  will work just as well for a different implementation of a Container. For example:  class List_container : public Container {    List_container implements Container  std::list  ld;      standard-librar y list of doubles  §4.4.2   List_container   { } List_container initializer_list  il  : ld{il} { } ˜List_container   {}     empty List   Section 3.2.2  Abstract Types   67  };  }  }  }  double& operator[] int i ; int size   const { return ld.size  ; }  double& List_container::operator[] int i  {  for  auto& x : ld  {  if  i==0  return x; −−i;  } throw out_of_rang e "List container" ;  Here, the representation is a standard-library list . Usually, I would not implement a con- tainer with a subscript operation using a list, because performance of list subscripting is atrocious compared to vector subscripting.  However,  here I just wanted to show an implementation that is radically different from the usual one.  A function can create a List_container and have use   use it:  void h   {  List_container lc = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }; use lc ;  The point is that use Container&  has no idea if its argument is a Vector_container, a List_container, or some other kind of container; it doesn’t need to know.  It can use any kind of Container. It knows only the interface deﬁned by Container. Consequently, use Container&  needn’t be recompiled if the implementation of List_container changes or a brand-new class derived from Container is used.  The ﬂip side of this ﬂexibility is that objects must be manipulated through pointers or references   §3.3, §20.4 .  3.2.3  Virtual Functions Consider again the use of Container:  void use Container& c  {  const int sz = c.size  ;  for  int i=0; i!=sz; ++i   cout << c[i] << '\n';  How is the call c[i] in use   resolved to the right operator[]  ? When h   calls use  , List_container’s operator[]   must be called. When g   calls use  , Vector_container’s operator[]   must be called. To achieve  this resolution, a Container object must contain information to allow it to select the right function to call at run time. The usual implementation technique is for the compiler to convert the name of a virtual function into an index into a table of pointers to functions. That table is usually   68  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  called the virtual function table or simply the vtbl. Each class with virtual functions has its own vtbl identifying its virtual functions. This can be represented graphically like this:  Vector_container:  vtbl:  v  ld  List_container:  vtbl:  Vector_container::operator[]    Vector_container::siz e    Vector_container::˜Vector_container    List_container::operator[]    List_container::size    List_container::˜List_container    The functions in the vtbl allow the object to be used correctly even when the size of the object and the  layout  of  its  data  are  unknown  to  the  caller. The  implementation  of  the  caller  needs  only  to know the location of the pointer to the vtbl in a Container and the index used for each virtual func- tion.  This virtual call mechanism can be made almost as efﬁcient as the ‘‘normal function call’’ mechanism  within 25% . Its space overhead is one pointer in each object of a class with virtual functions plus one vtbl for each such class.  3.2.4  Class Hierarchies  The Container example is a very simple example of a class hierarchy.  A class hierarchy is a set of classes ordered in a lattice created by derivation  e.g., : public .  We use class hierarchies to rep- resent  concepts  that  have  hierarchical  relationships,  such  as  ‘‘A  ﬁre  engine  is  a  kind  of  a  truck which is a kind of a vehicle’’ and ‘‘A  smiley face is a kind of a circle which is a kind of a shape.’’ Huge hierarchies, with hundreds of classes, that are both deep and wide are common. As a semi- realistic classic example, let’s consider shapes on a screen:  Shape  Circle  Triangle  Smiley  The  arrows  represent  inheritance  relationships. For example,  class Circle is  derived from  class Shape. To represent that simple diagram in code, we must ﬁrst specify a class that deﬁnes the gen- eral properties of all shapes:   Section 3.2.4  class Shape { public:  Class Hierarchies   69  virtual Point center   const =0; virtual void move Point to  =0;     pure virtual  virtual void draw   const = 0; virtual void rotate int angle  = 0;     draw oncurrent "Canvas"  virtual ˜Shape   {}    ...     destructor  };  }  Naturally, this interface is an abstract class: as far as representation is concerned, nothing  except the location of the pointer to the vtbl  is common for every Shape. Giv en this deﬁnition, we can write general functions manipulating vectors of pointers to shapes:  void rotate_all vector & v, int angle     rotate v’selements byangle degrees {  for  auto p : v   p−>rotate angle ;  To  deﬁne  a  particular  shape,  we  must  say  that  it  is  a Shape and  specify  its  particular  properties  including its virtual functions :  class Circle : public Shape { public:  Circle Point p, int rr ;     constructor  Point center   const { return x; } void move Point to  { x=to; }  private:  void draw   const; void rotate int  {}  Point x; int r;     center    radius  };     nice simple algorithm  So  far, the Shape and Circle example  provides  nothing  new compared  to  the Container and Vector_container example, but we can build further:  class Smiley : public Circle {      use the circle as the base for a face public:  Smiley Point p, int r  : Circle{p,r}, mouth{nullptr} { }  ˜Smiley   {  }  delete mouth; for  auto p : eyes  delete p;   70  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  void move Point to ;  void draw   const; void rotate int ;  void add_eye Shape∗ s  { eyes.push_back s ; } void set_mouth Shape∗ s ; virtual void wink int i ;     winkeye number i     ...  private:  };  vector  eyes;  Shape∗ mouth;     usually twoeyes  void Smiley::draw   {  Circle::draw  ; for  auto p : eyes   p−>draw  ; mouth−>draw  ;  The push_back   member  function  adds  its  argument  to  the vector  here, eyes ,  increasing  that vector’s size by one.  We can now deﬁne Smiley::draw   using calls to Smiley’s base and member draw  s:  }   cid:129    cid:129   Note  the  way  that Smiley keeps  its  eyes  in  a  standard-library vector and  deletes  them  in  its  de- structor. Shape’s  destructor  is virtual and Smiley’s  destructor  overrides  it. A virtual  destructor  is essential for an abstract class because an object of a derived class is usually manipulated through the interface provided by its abstract base class. In particular, it may be deleted through a pointer to a base class. Then, the virtual function call mechanism ensures that the proper destructor is called. That destructor then implicitly invokes the destructors of its bases and members.  In this simpliﬁed example, it is the programmer’s task to place the eyes and mouth appropri-  ately within the circle representing the face.  We  can  add  data  members,  operations,  or  both  as  we  deﬁne  a  new class  by  derivation.  This gives great ﬂexibility with corresponding opportunities for confusion and poor design. See Chapter 21.  A class hierarchy offers two kinds of beneﬁts:  Interface inheritance: An object of a derived class can be used wherever an object of a base class is required. That is, the base class acts as an interface for the derived class.  The Con- tainer and Shape classes are examples.  Such classes are often abstract classes. Implementation  inheritance: A base  class  provides  functions  or  data  that  simpliﬁes  the implementation of derived classes. Smiley’s uses of Circle’s constructor and of Circle::draw   are examples.  Such base classes often have data members and constructors.  Concrete classes – especially classes with small representations – are much like built-in types: we deﬁne them as local variables, access them using their names, copy them around, etc. Classes in class hierarchies are different: we tend to allocate them on the free store using new, and we access   Section 3.2.4  Class Hierarchies   71  them through pointers or references. For example, consider a function that reads data describing shapes from an input stream and constructs the appropriate Shape objects:  enum class Kind { circle, triangle , smiley };  Shape∗ read_shape istream& is  {     ... read shape header from is and ﬁnd its Kind k ...     read shape descriptions from input stream is  switch  k  { case Kind::circle:     read circle data {Point,int} into p and r return new Circle{p,r};  case Kind::triangle:     read triangle data {Point,Point,Point} into p1, p2, and p3 return new Triangle{p1,p2,p3};  case Kind::smiley:     read smileydata {Point,int,Shape,Shape,Shape} into p,r,e1,e2, and m Smiley∗ ps = new Smiley{p,r}; ps−>add_eye e1 ; ps−>add_eye e2 ; ps−>set_mouth m ; return ps;  }  }  }  A program may use that shape reader like this:  void user   {  std::vector  v; while  cin   v.push_back read_shape cin  ;  draw_all v ;  rotate_all v,45 ;  for  auto p : v  delete p;     call draw   for each element    call rotate 45  for each element    remember to delete elements  Obviously, the  example  is  simpliﬁed  –  especially  with  respect  to  error  handling  –  but  it  vividly illustrates  that user   has  absolutely  no  idea  of  which  kinds  of  shapes  it  manipulates. The user   code can be compiled once and later used for new Shapes added to the program. Note that there are no pointers to the shapes outside user  , so user   is responsible for deallocating them. This is done with the delete operator and relies critically on Shape’s virtual destructor. Because that destructor is virtual, delete invokes the destructor for the most derived class.  This is crucial because a derived class may have acquired all kinds of resources  such as ﬁle handles, locks, and output streams  that need to be released. In this case, a Smiley deletes its eyes and mouth objects.  Experienced programmers will notice that I left open two obvious opportunities for mistakes:  cid:129  A user might fail to delete the pointer returned by read_shape  .  cid:129  The owner of a container of Shape pointers might not delete the objects pointed to.  In that sense, functions returning a pointer to an object allocated on the free store are dangerous.   72  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  One  solution  to  both  problems  is  to  return  a  standard-library unique_ptr  §5.2.1   rather  than  a ‘‘naked pointer’’ and store unique_ptrs in the container:  unique_ptr  read_shape istream& is     read shape descriptions from input stream is {     read shape header from is and ﬁnd its Kind k  switch  k  { case Kind::circle:     read circle data {Point,int} into p and r return unique_ptr {new Circle{p,r}};      §5.2.1     ...  }  void user   {  vector > v; while  cin   v.push_back read_shape cin  ;  draw_all v ;  rotate_all v,45 ;      call draw   for each element     call rotate 45  for each element  }    all Shapes implicitly destroyed  Now the object is owned by the unique_ptr which will delete the object when it is no longer needed, that is, when its unique_ptr goes out of scope.  For the unique_ptr version of user   to work, we need versions of draw_all   and rotate_all   that accept vector >s.  Writing many such _all   functions could become tedious, so §3.4.3 shows an alternative.  3.3  Copy and Move By default, objects can be copied. This is true for objects of user-deﬁned types as well as for built- in  types. The  default  meaning  of  copy is memberwise  copy:  copy each  member. For  example, using complex from §3.2.1.1:  void test complex z1  {  complex z2 {z1};  complex z3; z3 = z2;    ...  }     copyinitialization     copyassignment  Now z1, z2, and z3 have the same value because both the assignment and the initialization copied both members.  When we design a class, we must always consider if and how an object might be copied. For simple concrete types, memberwise copy is often exactly the right semantics for copy.  For some sophisticated concrete types, such as Vector, memberwise copy is not the right semantics for copy, and for abstract types it almost never is.   Section 3.3.1  Copying Containers  73  3.3.1  Copying Containers When a class is a resource handle, that is, it is responsible for an object accessed through a pointer, the default memberwise copy is typically a disaster. Memberwise copy would violate the resource handle’s inv ariant  §2.4.3.2 . For example, the default copy would leave a copy of a Vector refer- ring to the same elements as the original:  void bad_copy Vector v1  {  Vector v2 = v1; v1[0] = 2; v2[1] = 3;     copyv1’srepresentation into v2    v2[0] is nowalso 2!    v1[1] is nowalso 3!  }  Assuming that v1 has four elements, the result can be represented graphically like this:  v1:  v2:  4  4  2  3  Fortunately, the fact that Vector has a destructor is a strong hint that the default  memberwise  copy semantics is wrong and the compiler should at least warn against this example  §17.6 . We need to deﬁne better copy semantics.  Copying  of  an  object  of  a  class  is  deﬁned  by  two members:  a copy  constructor and  a copy  assignment:  class Vector { private:  public:  double∗ elem;     elem points to an array ofszdoubles int sz;  Vector int s ; ˜Vector   { delete[] elem; }     constructor:establish invariant, acquire resources    destructor:release resources  Vector const Vector& a ; Vector& operator= const Vector& a ;     copyconstr uctor    copyassignment  double& operator[] int i ; const double& operator[] int i  const;  int size   const;  };  A suitable deﬁnition of a copy constructor for Vector allocates the space for the required number of elements and then copies the elements into it, so that after a copy each Vector has its own copy of the elements:   74  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  Vector::Vector const Vector& a   :elem{new double[sz]},  sz{a.sz}     copyconstr uctor    allocate space for elements  for  int i=0; i!=sz; ++i      copyelements  elem[i] = a.elem[i];  The result of the v2=v1 example can now be presented as:  v1:  v2:  4  4  2  3  Of course, we need a copy assignment in addition to the copy constructor:  Vector& Vector::operator= const Vector& a  {     copyassignment  double∗ p = new double[a.sz]; for  int i=0; i!=a.sz; ++i   p[i] = a.elem[i];     delete old elements  delete[] elem; elem = p; sz = a.sz; return ∗this;  The name this is predeﬁned in a member function and points to the object for which the member function is called.  A copy constructor and a copy assignment for a class X are typically declared to take an argu-  ment of type const X&.  3.3.2  Moving Containers We  can control copying by deﬁning a copy constructor and a copy assignment, but copying can be costly for large containers. Consider:  Vector operator+ const Vector& a, const Vector& b  {  if  a.size  !=b.siz e     throw Vector_siz e_mismatch{};  Vector res a.size   ; for  int i=0; i!=a.size  ; ++i   res[i]=a[i]+b[i];  return res;  {  }  }  }   Section 3.3.2  Moving Containers  75  Returning  from  a + involves  copying  the  result  out  of  the  local  variable res and  into  some  place where the caller can access it. We might use this + like this:  void f const Vector& x, const Vector& y, const Vector& z  {  Vector r;    ... r = x+y+z;    ...  class Vector {     ...  }  };  {  }  That would be copying a Vector at least twice  one for each use of the + operator .  If a Vector is large, say, 10,000 doubles, that could be embarrassing. The most embarrassing part is that res in operator+   is never used again after the copy.  We didn’t really want a copy; we just wanted to get the result out of a function: we wanted to move a Vector rather than to copy it.  Fortunately, we can state that intent:  Vector const Vector& a ; Vector& operator= const Vector& a ;     copyconstr uctor     copyassignment  Vector Vector&& a ; Vector& operator= Vector&& a ;     move constr uctor     move assignment  Given that deﬁnition, the compiler will choose the move constructor to implement the transfer of the return value out of the function. This means that r=x+y+z will involve no copying of Vectors. Instead, Vectors are just moved.  As is typical, Vector’s move constructor is trivial to deﬁne:  Vector::Vector Vector&& a      "grabthe elements" from a  :elem{a.elem},  sz{a.sz}  a.elem = nullptr;  a.sz = 0;     nowahas no elements  The && means ‘‘rvalue reference’’ and is a reference to which we can bind an rvalue  §6.4.1 . The word  ‘‘rvalue’’ is intended  to  complement  ‘‘lvalue,’’  which  roughly  means  ‘‘something  that  can appear on the left-hand side of an assignment.’’  So an rvalue is – to a ﬁrst approximation – a value that you can’t assign to, such as an integer returned by a function call, and an rvalue reference is a reference to something that nobody else can assign to. The res local variable in operator+   for Vec- tors is an example.  A move constructor does not take a const argument: after all, a move constructor is supposed to  remove the value from its argument.  A move assignment is deﬁned similarly.  A move operation is applied when an rvalue reference is used as an initializer or as the right-  hand side of an assignment.   76  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  After a move, a moved-from object should be in a state that allows a destructor to be run. Typi-  cally, we should also allow assignment to a moved-from object  §17.5, §17.6.2 .  Where  the  programmer  knows  that  a  value  will  not  be  used  again,  but  the  compiler  can’t be  expected to be smart enough to ﬁgure that out, the programmer can be speciﬁc:  Vector f   {  Vector x 1000 ; Vector y 1000 ; Vector z 1000 ;    ... z = x; y = std::move x ;     ... return z;  };     we get a copy    we get a move     we get a move  The standard-library function move   returns an rvalue reference to its argument.  Just before the return we have:  z:  x:  y:  1000  nullptr  0  1000  1  2  ...  1  2  ...  When z is destroyed, it too has been moved from  by the return  so that, like x, it is empty  it holds no elements .  3.3.3  Resource Management By  deﬁning  constructors,  copy operations,  move operations,  and  a  destructor, a  programmer  can provide  complete  control  of  the  lifetime  of  a  contained  resource   such  as  the  elements  of  a  con- tainer .  Furthermore, a move constructor allows an object to move simply and cheaply from one scope to another. That way, objects that we cannot or would not want to copy out of a scope can be simply and cheaply moved out instead. Consider a standard-library thread representing a concur- rent activity  §5.3.1  and a Vector of a million doubles.  We can’t copy the former and don’t want to copy the latter.  std::vector  my_threads;  Vector init int n  {  thread t {heartbeat};  my_threads.push_back move t  ;     ... more initialization ...     runhear tbeatconcurrently  on its own thread     move t into my_threads   Section 3.3.3  Resource Management  77  Vector vec n ; for  int i=0; i<vec.size  ; ++i  vec[i] = 777; return vec;     move res out of init    }  auto v = init  ;    star thear tbeatand initializev  This makes resource handles, such as Vector and thread, an alternative  to using pointers in many cases.  In fact, the standard-library ‘‘smart pointers,’’  such as unique_ptr, are themselves resource handles  §5.2.1 .  I used  the  standard-library vector to  hold  the threads because  we  don’t get  to  parameterize  Vector with an element type until §3.4.1.  In very much the same way as new and delete disappear from application code, we can make pointers disappear into resource handles. In both cases, the result is simpler and more maintainable code, without added overhead.  In particular, we can achieve strong resource safety; that is, we can eliminate resource leaks for a general notion of a resource. Examples are vectors holding memory, threads holding system threads, and fstreams holding ﬁle handles.  3.3.4  Suppressing Operations Using the default copy or move for a class in a hierarchy is typically a disaster: given only a pointer to a base, we simply don’t know what members the derived class has  §3.2.2 , so we can’t know how to copy them.  So, the best thing to do is usually to delete the default copy and move opera- tions, that is, to eliminate the default deﬁnitions of those two operations:  Shape const Shape&  =delete; Shape& operator= const Shape&  =delete;     no copyoperations  Shape Shape&&  =delete; Shape& operator= Shape&&  =delete;     no move operations  class Shape { public:  ˜Shape  ;    ...  };  Now an attempt to copy a Shape will be caught by the compiler. If you need to copy an object in a class hierarchy, write some kind of clone function  §22.2.4 .  In this particular case, if you forgot to delete a copy or move  operation, no harm is done. A move operation is not implicitly generated for a class where the user has explicitly declared a de- structor. Furthermore, the generation of copy operations is deprecated in this case  §44.2.3 . This can be a good reason to explicitly deﬁne a destructor even where the compiler would have implic- itly provided one  §17.2.3 .  A base class in a class hierarchy is just one example of an object we wouldn’t want to copy.  A  resource handle generally cannot be copied just by copying its members  §5.2, §17.2.2 .  The =delete mechanism is general, that is, it can be used to suppress any operation  §17.6.4 .   78  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  3.4  Templates Someone who wants a vector is unlikely always to want a vector of doubles.  A vector is a general concept, independent of the notion of a ﬂoating-point number. Consequently, the element type of a vector ought to be represented independently. A template is a class or a function that we parame- terize with a set of types or values.  We use templates to represent concepts that are best understood as something very general from which we can generate speciﬁc types and functions by specifying arguments, such as the element type double.  3.4.1  Parameterized Types We  can generalize our vector-of-doubles type to a vector-of-anything type by making it a template and replacing the speciﬁc type double with a parameter. For example:  template  class Vector { private:  public:  T∗ elem;     elem points to an array ofszelements of type T int sz;  Vector int s ; ˜Vector   { delete[] elem; }     constructor:establish invariant, acquire resources    destructor:release resources  The template  preﬁx makes T a parameter of the declaration it preﬁxes.  It is C++’s ver- sion of the mathematical ‘‘for all T’’ or more precisely ‘‘for all types T.’’  The member functions might be deﬁned similarly:     ... copyand move operations ...  T& operator[] int i ; const T& operator[] int i  const; int size   const { return sz; }  };  }  }  template  Vector ::Vector int s  {  if  s<0  throw Negative_siz e{}; elem = new T[s]; sz = s;  template  const T& Vector ::operator[] int i  const {  if  i<0  size  <=i   return elem[i];  throw out_of_rang e{"Vector::operator[]"};   Section 3.4.1  Parameterized Types   79  Given these deﬁnitions, we can deﬁne Vectors like this:  Vector  vc 200 ; Vector  vs 17 ; Vector > vli 45 ;     vector of 200 characters    vector of 17 strings    vector of 45 lists of integers  The >> in Vector > terminates  the  nested  template  arguments;  it  is  not  a  misplaced  input operator. It is not  as in C++98  necessary to place a space between the two >s.  We can use Vectors like this:  void write const Vector & vs  {  for  int i = 0; i!=vs.size  ; ++i   cout << vs[i] << '\n';     Vector of some strings  To support the range-for loop for our Vector, we must deﬁne suitable begin   and end   functions:  }  }  }  }  return &x[0];     pointer to ﬁrst element  template  T∗ begin Vector & x  {  template  T∗ end Vector & x  {  return x.begin  +x.size  ;    pointer to one-past-last element  Given those, we can write:  void f2 const Vector & vs  {  for  auto& s : vs   cout << s << '\n';     Vector of some strings  Similarly, we can  deﬁne  lists,  vectors,  maps   that  is,  associative  arrays ,  etc.,  as  templates   §4.4, §23.2, Chapter 31 .  Templates are a compile-time mechanism, so their use incurs no run-time overhead compared to  ‘‘handwritten code’’  §23.2.2 .  3.4.2  Function Templates Templates have many more uses than simply parameterizing a container with an element type. In particular, they are extensively used for parameterization of both types and algorithms in the stan- dard library  §4.4.5, §4.5.5 . For example, we can write a function that calculates the sum of the element values of any container like this:   80  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  template  Value sum const Container& c, Value v  {  for  auto x : c   v+=x;  return v;  }  }  };  }  The Value template argument and the function argument v are there to allow the caller to specify the type and initial value of the accumulator  the variable in which to accumulate the sum :  void user Vector & vi, std::list & ld, std::vector >& vc  {  int x = sum vi,0 ; double d = sum vi,0.0 ; double dd = sum ld,0.0 ;  auto z = sum vc,complex {} ;      the sum of a vector of ints  add ints     the sum of a vector of ints  add doubles     the sum of a list of doubles    the sum of a vector of complex     the initial value is {0.0,0.0}  The point of adding ints in a double would be to gracefully handle a number larger than the largest int. Note  how the  types  of  the  template  arguments  for sum  are  deduced  from  the  function arguments.  Fortunately, we do not need to explicitly specify those types.  This sum   is a simpliﬁed version of the standard-library accumulate    §40.6 .  3.4.3  Function Objects One particularly useful kind of template is the function object  sometimes called a functor , which is used to deﬁne objects that can be called like functions.  For example:  template  class Less_than { const T val;   public:     value to compare against  Less_than const T& v  :val v  { } bool operator   const T& x  const { return x<val; }    call operator  The function called operator   implements the ‘‘function call,’’ ‘‘call,’’ or ‘‘application’’ operator   .  We can deﬁne named variables of type Less_than for some argument type:  Less_than  lti {42}; Less_than  lts {"Backus"};     lts s  will compare s to "Backus" using <  s<"Backus"      lti i  will compare i to 42 using <  i<42   We can call such an object, just as we call a function:  void fct int n, const string & s  {  bool b1 = lti n ; bool b2 = lts s ;    ...     trueif n<42    trueif s<"Backus"   Section 3.4.3  Function Objects  81  Such function objects are widely used as arguments to algorithms. For example, we can count the occurrences of values for which a predicate returns true:  template  int count const C& c, P pred  {  int cnt = 0; for  const auto& x : c   if  pred x   ++cnt;  return cnt;  }  }  }  A predicate is something that we can invoke to return true or false. For example:  void f const Vector & vec, const list & lst, int x, const string& s  {  cout << "number of values less than " << x   {x}  << '\n';  cout << "number of values less than " << s   {s}  << '\n';  Here, Less_than {x} constructs an object for which the call operator compares to the int called x; Less_than {s} constructs an object that compares to the string called s. The beauty of these function objects is that they carry the value to be compared against with them. We  don’t hav e to write  a  separate  function  for  each  value   and  each  type ,  and  we  don’t hav e to  introduce  nasty global variables to hold values.  Also, for a simple function object like Less_than inlining is simple, so that a call of Less_than is far more efﬁcient than an indirect function call. The ability to carry data plus their efﬁciency make function objects particularly useful as arguments to algorithms.  Function objects used to specify the meaning of key operations of a general algorithm  such as  Less_than for count    are often referred to as policy objects.  We hav e to deﬁne Less_than separately from its use. That could be seen as inconvenient.  Con-  sequently, there is a notation for implicitly generating function objects:  void f const Vector & vec, const list & lst, int x, const string& s  {  cout << "number of values less than " << x  << ": " << count vec,[&] int a { return a<x; }  << '\n';  cout << "number of values less than " << s  << ": " << count lst,[&] const string& a { return a<s; }  << '\n';  The notation [&] int  a {  return  a<x;  } is called a lambda expression  §11.4 .  It generates a function object  exactly  like Less_than {x}. The [&] is  a capture list specifying  that  local  names  used  such as x  will be passed by reference. Had we wanted to ‘‘capture’’ only x, we could have said   82  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  so: [&x]. Had we wanted to give the generated object a copy of x, we could have said so: [=x]. Cap- ture nothing is [], capture all local names used by reference is [&], and capture all local names used by value is [=].  Using lambdas can be convenient and terse, but also obscure. For nontrivial actions  say, more than a simple expression , I prefer to name the operation so as to more clearly state its purpose and to make it available for use in several places in a program.  In §3.2.4, we noticed the annoyance of having to write many functions to perform operations on elements of vectors of pointers and unique_ptrs, such as draw_all   and rotate_all  . Function objects  in particular, lambdas  can help by allowing us to separate the traversal of the container from the speciﬁcation of what is to be done with each element.  First, we need a function that applies an operation to each object pointed to by the elements of a  container of pointers:  template  void for_all C& c, Oper op  {  for  auto& x : c   op ∗x ;      assume that C is a container of pointers     pass op   a reference to each element pointed to  Now, we can write a version of user   from §3.2.4 without writing a set of _all functions:  void user   {  vector > v; while  cin   v.push_back read_shape cin  ;  for_all v,[] Shape& s { s.draw  ; } ; for_all v,[] Shape& s { s.rotate 45 ; } ;     draw_all      rotate_all 45   I pass a reference to Shape to a lambda so that the lambda doesn’t hav e to care exactly how the objects are stored in the container. In particular, those for_all   calls would still work if I changed v to a vector .  3.4.4  Variadic Templates A template can be deﬁned to accept an arbitrary number of arguments of arbitrary types. Such a template is called a variadic template. For example:  template  void f T head, Tail... tail  {  g head ;  f tail... ;      do something to head    tr yagain with tail  void f   { }     do nothing  The key to implementing a variadic template is to note that when you pass a list of arguments to it,  }  }  }   Section 3.4.4  Variadic Templates   83  you can separate the ﬁrst argument from the rest. Here, we do something to the ﬁrst argument  the head  and then recursively call f   with the rest of the arguments  the tail .  The ellipsis, ..., is used to indicate ‘‘the rest’’ of a list.  Eventually, of course, tail will become empty and we need a separate function to deal with that.  We can call this f   like this:  int main   {  cout << "ﬁrst: "; f 1,2.2,"hello" ;  cout << "\nsecond: " f 0.2,'c',"yuck!",0,1,2 ; cout << "\n";  }  }  template  void g T x  {  cout << x << " ";  Given that, the output will be:  ﬁrst: 1 2.2 hello second: 0.2 c yuck! 0 1 2  This would call f 1,2.2,"hello" , which will call f 2.2,"hello" , which will call f "hello" , which will call f  . What might the call g head  do?  Obviously, in a real program it will do whatever we wanted done to each argument.  For example, we could make it write its argument  here, head  to output:  It seems that f   is a simple variant of printf   printing arbitrary lists or values – implemented in three lines of code plus their surrounding declarations.  The strength of variadic templates  sometimes just called variadics  is that they can accept any arguments you care to give them.  The weakness is that the type checking of the interface is a possi- bly elaborate template program. For details, see §28.6. For examples, see §34.2.4.2  N-tuples  and Chapter 29  N-dimensional matrices .  3.4.5  Aliases Surprisingly often, it is useful to introduce a synonym for a type or a template  §6.5 . For example, the standard header   contains a deﬁnition of the alias size_t, maybe:  using size_t = unsigned int;  The  actual  type  named size_t is  implementation-dependent,  so  in  another  implementation size_t may be an unsigned long. Having the alias size_t allows the programmer to write portable code.  It is very common for a parameterized type to provide an alias for types related to their template  arguments.  For example:   84  A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms  Chapter 3  In fact, every standard-library container provides value_type as the name of its value type  §31.3.1 . This allows us to write code that will work for every container that follows this convention.  For example:  template  using Element_type = typename C::value_type;  template  void algo Container& c  {  Vector > vec;    keep results here    ...  The aliasing mechanism can be used to deﬁne a new template by binding some or all template argu- ments.  For example:  template  class Vector { public:  using value_type = T;    ...  };  }  };  template  class Map {     ...  template  using String_map = Map ;  String_map  m;    misaMap   See §23.6.  3.5  Advice [1]  Express ideas directly in code; §3.2.

First, a set of libraries is developed.  These then form the basis for further work.  Most programs are tedious to write in the bare language, whereas just about any task can be rendered simple by the use of good libraries.  Continuing from Chapters 2 and 3, this chapter and the next give a quick tour of key standard- library  facilities.  I assume  that  you  have  programmed  before. If  not,  please  consider  reading  a textbook,  such  as Programming:  Principles  and  Practice  Using  C++ [Stroustrup,2009],  before continuing.  Even if you have  programmed before, the libraries you used or the applications you wrote may be very different from the style of C++ presented here. If you ﬁnd this ‘‘lightning tour’’ confusing, you might skip to the more systematic and bottom-up language presentation starting in Chapter 6. Similarly, a more systematic description of the standard library starts in Chapter 30.   88  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  I very  brieﬂy  present  useful  standard-library  types,  such  as string, ostream, vector, map  this chapter , unique_ptr, thread, regex, and complex  Chapter 5 , as well as the most common ways of using them. Doing this allows me to give better examples in the following chapters. As in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, you are strongly encouraged not to be distracted or discouraged by an incomplete understanding of details. The purpose of this chapter is to give you a taste of what is to come and to convey a basic understanding of the most useful library facilities.  The speciﬁcation of the standard library is almost two thirds of the ISO C++ standard. Explore it, and prefer it to home-made alternatives.  Much though have gone into its design, more still into its implementations, and much effort will go into its maintenance and extension.  The standard-library facilities described in this book are part of every complete C++ implemen- tation.  In addition to the standard-library components, most implementations offer ‘‘graphical user interface’’ systems   GUIs ,  Web  interfaces,  database  interfaces,  etc. Similarly, most  application development  environments  provide  ‘‘foundation  libraries’’ for  corporate  or  industrial  ‘‘standard’’ development  and or  execution  environments.  Here, I do not  describe  such  systems  and  libraries. The intent is to provide a self-contained description of C++ as deﬁned by the standard and to keep the examples portable, except where speciﬁcally noted. Naturally, a programmer is encouraged to explore the more extensive facilities available on most systems.  4.1.1  Standard-Library Overview The facilities provided by the standard library can be classiﬁed like this:   cid:129  Run-time language support  e.g., for allocation and run-time type information ; see §30.3.  cid:129  The  C  standard  library   with  very  minor  modiﬁcations  to  minimize  violations  of  the  type  system ; see Chapter 43.   cid:129  Strings and I O streams  with support for international character sets and localization ; see Chapter 36, Chapter 38, and Chapter 39. I O streams is an extensible framework to which users can add their own streams, buffering strategies, and character sets.   cid:129  A framework of containers  such as vector and map  and algorithms  such as ﬁnd  , sort  , and merge   ;  see  §4.4,  §4.5,  Chapters  31-33. This  framework,  conventionally  called  the STL [Stepanov,1994], is extensible so users can add their own containers and algorithms.   cid:129  Support  for  numerical  computation   such  as  standard  mathematical  functions,  complex numbers, vectors with arithmetic operations, and random number generators ; see §3.2.1.1 and Chapter 40.   cid:129  Support for regular expression matching; see §5.5 and Chapter 37.  cid:129  Support for concurrent programming, including threads and locks; see §5.3 and Chapter 41. The  concurrency support  is  foundational  so  that  users  can  add  support  for  new models  of concurrency as libraries.   cid:129  Utilities  to  support  template  metaprogramming   e.g.,  type  traits;  §5.4.2,  §28.2.4,  §35.4 , STL-style  generic  programming   e.g., pair; §5.4.3,  §34.2.4.1 ,  and  general  programming  e.g., clock; §5.4.1, §35.2 . ‘‘Smart pointers’’ for resource management  e.g., unique_ptr and shared_ptr; §5.2.1, §34.3  and an interface to garbage collectors  §34.5 .   cid:129    cid:129  Special-purpose containers, such as array  §34.2.1 , bitset  §34.2.2 , and tuple  §34.2.4.2 .   Section 4.1.1  Standard-Library Overview   89  The main criteria for including a class in the library were that:   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   it could be helpful to almost every C++ programmer  both novices and experts , it could be provided in a general form that did not add signiﬁcant overhead compared to a simpler version of the same facility, and that simple uses should be easy to learn  relative to the inherent complexity of their task .  Essentially, the  C++  standard  library  provides  the  most  common  fundamental  data  structures together with the fundamental algorithms used on them.  4.1.2  The Standard-library Headers and Namespace Every standard-library facility is provided through some standard header. For example:  include  include   This makes the standard string and list available.  library facilities, the std:: preﬁx can be used:  The  standard  library  is  deﬁned  in  a  namespace   §2.4.2,  §14.3.1   called std. To use  standard  std::string s {"Four legs Good; two legs Baaad!"}; std::list  slogans {"War is peace", "Freedom is Slaver y", "Ignorance is Strength"};  For simplicity, I will  rarely  use  the std:: preﬁx  explicitly  in  examples.  Neither will  I  always include the  necessary  headers  explicitly. To compile  and  run  the  program  fragments  here,  you must include the appropriate headers  as listed in §4.4.5, §4.5.5, and §30.2  and make the names they declare accessible. For example:  include   using namespace std;     makethe standard string facilities accessible    makestd names available without std:: preﬁx  string s {"C++ is a general−purpose programming language"};      OK: string is std::string  It  is  generally  in  poor  taste  to  dump  every  name  from  a  namespace  into  the  global  namespace. However, in this book, I use the standard library almost exclusively and it is good to know what it offers.  So, I don’t preﬁx  every  use  of  a  standard  library  name  with std::. Nor  do  I include the appropriate headers in every example.  Assume that done.  Here is a selection of standard-library headers, all supplying declarations in namespace std:  Selected Standard Library Headers  continues                            copy  , ﬁnd  , sort   array duration, time_point sqrt  , pow   complex, sqrt  , pow   fstream, ifstream, ofstream future, promise istream, ostream, cin, cout  §32.2  §34.2.1  §35.2  §40.3  §40.4  §38.2.1  §5.3.5  §38.1   §iso.25 §iso.23.3.2 §iso.20.11.2 §iso.26.8 §iso.26.8 §iso.27.9.1 §iso.30.6 §iso.27.4   90  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4                                   Selected Standard Library Headers  continued  map, multimap unique_ptr, shared_ptr, allocator default_random_engine, normal_distribution regex, smatch string, basic_string set, multiset istrstream, ostrstream thread unordered_map, unordered_multimap move  , swap  , pair vector  §31.4.3  §5.2.1  §40.7  Chapter 37 Chapter 36 §31.4.3  §38.2.2  §5.3.1  §31.4.3.2  §35.5  §31.4   §iso.23.4.4 §iso.20.6 §iso.26.5 §iso.28.8 §iso.21.3 §iso.23.4.6 §iso.27.8 §iso.30.3 §iso.23.5.4 §iso.20.1 §iso.23.3.6  This listing is far from complete; see §30.2 for more information.  4.2  Strings The standard library provides a string type to complement the string literals. The string type pro- vides a variety of useful string operations, such as concatenation. For example:  string compose const string& name, const string& domain  {  return name + '@' + domain;  auto addr = compose "dmr","bell−labs.com" ;  Here, addr is initialized to the character sequence dmr@bell−labs.com. ‘‘Addition’’ of strings means concatenation.  You  can  concatenate  a string, a string  literal,  a  C-style  string,  or  a  character  to  a string. The standard string has a move constructor so returning even long strings by value is efﬁ- cient  §3.3.2 .  In many applications, the most common form of concatenation is adding something to the end  of a string. This is directly supported by the += operation.  For example:  void m2 string& s1, string& s2  {  s1 = s1 + '\n'; s2 += '\n';     append newline    append newline  }  }  The two ways of adding to the end of a string are semantically equivalent, but I prefer the latter because it is more explicit about what it does, more concise, and possibly more efﬁcient.  A string is mutable. In addition to = and +=, subscripting  using []  and substring operations are supported.  The standard-library string is described in Chapter 36. Among other useful features, it provides the ability to manipulate substrings. For example:   Strings   91  string s = name.substr 6,10 ;  name.replace 0,5,"nicholas" ;  name[0] = toupper name[0] ;     s="Stroustr up"    name becomes "nicholas Stroustrup"    name becomes "Nicholas Stroustrup"  The substr   operation  returns  a string that  is  a  copy of the  substring  indicated  by  its  arguments. The ﬁrst argument is an index into the string  a position , and the second is the length of the desired substring.  Since indexing starts from 0, s gets the value Stroustrup.  The replace   operation replaces a substring with a value.  In this case, the substring starting at 0 with  length 5 is Niels; it is replaced  by nicholas. Finally, I replace  the  initial  character  with  its uppercase equivalent.  Thus, the ﬁnal value of name is Nicholas  Stroustrup. Note that the replace- ment string need not be the same size as the substring that it is replacing.  Naturally, strings can be compared against each other and against string literals. For example:  Section 4.2  void m3   {  string name = "Niels Stroustrup";  }  }  string incantation;  void respond const string& answer  {  if  answer == incantation  {     perfor mmagic  } else if  answer == "yes"  {     ...  }    ...  The string library  is  described  in  Chapter  36. The  most  common  techniques  for  implementing string are presented in the String example  §19.3 .  4.3  Stream I O The  standard  library  provides  formatted  character  input  and  output  through  the iostream library. The input operations are typed and extensible to handle user-deﬁned types. This section is a very brief introduction to the use of iostreams; Chapter 38 is a reasonably complete description of the iostream library facilities.  Other forms of user interaction, such as graphical I O, are handled through libraries that are not  part of the ISO standard and therefore not described here.  4.3.1  Output The I O stream library deﬁnes output for every built-in type. Further, it is easy to deﬁne output of a user-deﬁned type  §4.3.3 . The operator <<  ‘‘put to’’  is used as an output operator on objects of   92  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  type ostream; cout is the standard output stream and cerr is the standard stream for reporting errors. By default, values written to cout are converted to a sequence of characters. For example, to output the decimal number 10, we can write:  This places the character 1 followed by the character 0 on the standard output stream.  Equivalently, we could write:  Output of different types can be combined in the obvious way:  cout << "the value of i is "; cout << i; cout << '\n';  For h 10 , the output will be:  the value of i is 10  void h2 int i  {  cout << "the value of i is " << i << '\n';  People soon tire of repeating the name of the output stream when outputting several related items. Fortunately, the result of an output expression can itself be used for further output. For example:  This h2   produces the same output as h  .  A character constant is a character enclosed in single quotes. Note that a character is output as  a character rather than as a numerical value.  For example:  void k   {  int b = 'b'; char c = 'c'; cout << 'a' << b << c;     note: char implicitly converted to int  The integer value of the character 'b' is 98  in the ASCII encoding used on the C++ implementation that I used , so this will output a98c.  void f   {  cout << 10;  void g   {  int i {10}; cout << i;  void h int i  {  }  }  }  }  }   Section 4.3.2  Input   93  4.3.2  Input The  standard  library  offers istreams for  input. Like ostreams, istreams deal  with  character  string representations of built-in types and can easily be extended to cope with user-deﬁned types.  The operator >>  ‘‘get from’’  is used as an input operator; cin is the standard input stream. The type of the right-hand operand of >> determines what input is accepted and what is the target of the input operation. For example:  void f   {  int i; cin >> i;  double d; cin >> d;     read an integer into i     read a double-precision ﬂoating-point number into d  This reads a number, such as 1234, from the standard input into the integer variable i and a ﬂoating- point number, such as 12.34e5, into the double-precision ﬂoating-point variable d.  Often, we want to read a sequence of characters. A convenient way of doing that is to read into  }  }  }  a string. For example:  void hello   {  cout << "Please enter your name\n"; string str; cin >> str; cout << "Hello, " << str << "!\n";  If you type in Eric the response is:  Hello, Eric!  Hello, Eric!  void hello_line   {  cout << "Please enter your name\n"; string str; getline cin,str ; cout << "Hello, " << str << "!\n";  With this program, the input Eric Bloodaxe yields the desired output:  Hello, Eric Bloodaxe!  By default, a whitespace character  §7.3.2 , such as a space, terminates the read, so if you enter Eric Bloodaxe pretending to be the ill-fated king of York, the response is still:  You can read a whole line  including the terminating newline character  using the getline   function. For example:   94  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  The newline that terminated the line is discarded, so cin is ready for the next input line.  The  standard  strings  have  the  nice  property  of  expanding  to  hold  what  you  put  in  them;  you don’t hav e to precalculate a maximum size. So, if you enter a couple of megabytes of semicolons, the program will echo pages of semicolons back at you.  4.3.3  I O of User-Deﬁned Types In addition to the I O of built-in types and standard strings, the iostream library allows programmers to deﬁne I O for their own types. For example, consider a simple type Entry that we might use to represent entries in a telephone book:  struct Entry {  string name; int number;  };  We can deﬁne a simple output operator to write an Entry using a {"name",number} format similar to the one we use for initialization in code:  ostream& operator<< ostream& os, const Entry& e  {  return os << "{\"" << e.name << "\", " << e.number << "}";  A user-deﬁned  output  operator  takes  its  output  stream   by  reference   as  its  ﬁrst  argument  and returns it as its result. See §38.4.2 for details.  The corresponding input operator is more complicated because it has to check for correct for-  matting and deal with errors:  istream& operator>> istream& is, Entry& e      read { "name" , number } pair.Note: for mattedwith { " " , and }  char c, c2; if  is>>c && c=='{' && is>>c2 && c2=='"'  {    star twith a { "  string name; while  is.get c  && c!='"'      the default value of a string is the empty string: ""    anything before a " is partofthe name  name+=c;  if  is>>c && c==','  { int number = 0; if  is>>number>>c && c=='}'  {    read the number and a }  e = {name ,number};  return is;     assign to the entry  }  }  } is.setf ios_base::failbit ;  return is;     register the failure in the stream  }  {  }  An  input  operation  returns  a  reference  to  its istream which  can  be  used  to  test  if  the  operation   Section 4.3.3  I O of User-Deﬁned Types   95  succeeded.  For example, when used as a condition, is>>c means ‘‘Did we succeed at reading from is into c?’’  The is>>c skips  whitespace  by  default,  but is.g et c  does  not,  so  that  this Entr y-input  operator  ignores  skips  whitespace outside the name string, but not within it. For example:  { "John Marwood Cleese" , 123456 {"Michael Edward Palin",987654}  }  We can read such a pair of values from input into an Entr y like this:  for  Entr y ee; cin>>ee;   cout << ee << '\n';     read from cin into ee    wr iteee to cout  The output is:  {"John Marwood Cleese", 123456} {"Michael Edward Palin", 987654}  See §38.4.1 for more technical details and techniques for writing input operators for user-deﬁned types.  See §5.5 and Chapter 37 for a more systematic technique for recognizing patterns in streams of characters  regular expression matching .  4.4  Containers Most  computing  involves  creating  collections  of  values  and  then  manipulating  such  collections. Reading characters into a string and printing out the string is a simple example.  A class with the main purpose of holding objects is commonly called a container. Providing suitable containers for a giv en task  and  supporting  them  with  useful  fundamental  operations  are  important  steps  in  the construction of any program.  To  illustrate the standard-library containers, consider a simple program for keeping names and telephone numbers. This is the kind of program for which different approaches appear ‘‘simple and obvious’’ to people of different backgrounds. The Entr y class from §4.3.3 can be used to hold a simple phone book entry. Here, we deliberately ignore many real-world complexities, such as the fact that many phone numbers do not have a simple representation as a 32-bit int.  4.4.1 vector The most useful standard-library container is vector. A vector is a sequence of elements of a given type.  The elements are stored contiguously in memory:  vector:  elem: sz:  6  0:  1:  2:  3:  4:  5:  The Vector examples in §3.2.2 and §3.4 give an idea of the implementation of vector and §13.6 and §31.4 provide an exhaustive discussion.   96  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  };  }  }  }  We can initialize a vector with a set of values of its element type:  vector  phone_book = {  {"David Hume",123456}, {"Karl Popper",234567}, {"Bertrand Ar thur William Russell",345678}  Elements can be accessed through subscripting:  void print_book const vector & book  {  for  int i = 0; i!=book.size  ; ++i   cout << book[i] << '\n';  As usual, indexing starts at 0 so that book[0] holds the entry for David  Hume. The vector member function size   gives the number of elements.  The elements of a vector constitute a range, so we can use a range-for loop  §2.2.5 :  void print_book const vector & book  {  for  const auto& x : book      for"auto" see §2.2.2  cout << x << '\n';  When we deﬁne a vector, we giv e it an initial size  initial number of elements :  vector  v1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}; vector  v2; vector  v3 23 ;  vector  v4 32,9.9 ;     sizeis4    sizeis0    sizeis23; initial element value: nullptr    sizeis32; initial element value: 9.9  An explicit size is enclosed in ordinary parentheses, for example,  23 , and by default the elements are initialized to the element type’s default value  e.g., nullptr for pointers and 0 for numbers . If you don’t want the default value, you can specify one as a second argument  e.g., 9.9 for the 32 ele- ments of v4 .  The initial size can be changed. One of the most useful operations on a vector is push_back  ,  which adds a new element at the end of a vector, increasing its size by one. For example:  void input   {  for  Entr y e; cin>>e;   phone_book.push_back e ;  This  reads Entrys from  the  standard  input  into phone_book until  either  the  end-of-input   e.g.,  the end  of  a  ﬁle   is  reached  or  the  input  operation  encounters  a  format  error. The  standard-library vector is implemented so that growing a vector by repeated push_back  s is efﬁcient.  A vector can be copied in assignments and initializations. For example:  vector  book2 = phone_book;   Section 4.4.1  vector  97  Copying  and  moving  of vectors are  implemented  by  constructors  and  assignment  operators  as described in §3.3. Assigning a vector involves copying its elements. Thus, after the initialization of book2, book2 and phone_book hold separate copies of every Entry in the phone book. When a vector holds many elements, such innocent-looking assignments and initializations can be expen- sive. Where copying is undesirable, references or pointers  §7.2, §7.7  or move operations  §3.3.2, §17.5.2  should be used.  4.4.1.1  Elements  Like all  standard-library  containers, vector is  a  container  of  elements  of  some  type T, that  is,  a vector . Just about any type qualiﬁes as an element type: built-in numeric types  such as char, int, and double , user-deﬁned types  such as string, Entry, list , and Matrix  , and point- ers  such as const char∗, Shape∗, and double∗ .  When you insert a new element, its value is copied into  the  container. For  example,  when  you  put  an  integer  with  the  value 7 into  a  container, the resulting element really has the value 7. The element is not a reference or a pointer to some object containing 7. This makes for nice compact containers with fast access. For people who care about memory sizes and run-time performance this is critical.  4.4.1.2  Range Checking  The standard-library vector does not guarantee range checking  §31.2.2 . For example:  void silly vector & book  {  int i = book[ph.size  ].number;     ...     book.size   is out of range  That  initialization  is  likely  to  place  some  random  value  in i rather  than  giving  an  error. This  is undesirable,  and  out-of-range  errors  are  a  common  problem. Consequently, I often  use  a  simple range-checking adaptation of vector:  template  class Vec : public std::vector  { public:  using vector ::vector;    use the constructors from vector  under the name Vec ; see §20.3.5.1  T& operator[] int i      range check  { return vector ::at i ; }  const T& operator[] int i  const { return vector ::at i ; }     range checkconst objects; §3.2.1.1  }  };  Vec inherits everything from vector except for the subscript operations that it redeﬁnes to do range checking.  The at   operation  is  a vector subscript  operation  that  throws  an  exception  of  type out_of_range if its argument is out of the vector’s range  §2.4.3.1, §31.2.2 .   98  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  For Vec, an out-of-range access will throw an exception that the user can catch. For example:  book[book.size  ] = {"Joe",999999};     ...     will throwanexception  void checked Vec & book  {  try {  } catch  out_of_rang e  {  cout << "range error\n";  }  }  The exception will be thrown, and then caught  §2.4.3.1, Chapter 13 . If the user doesn’t catch an exception, the program will terminate in a well-deﬁned manner rather than proceeding or failing in an undeﬁned manner. One way to minimize surprises from uncaught exceptions is to use a main   with a tr y-block as its body. For example:  int main   try {     your code  } catch  out_of_rang e  {  cerr << "range error\n";  } catch  ...  {  }  cerr << "unknown exception thrown\n";  This provides default exception handlers so that if we fail to catch some exception, an error mes- sage is printed on the standard error-diagnostic output stream cerr  §38.1 .  Some implementations save you the bother of deﬁning Vec  or equivalent  by providing a range-  checked version of vector  e.g., as a compiler option .  4.4.2 list The standard library offers a doubly-linked list called list:  list:  4  links  links  links  links  We  use a list for sequences where we want to insert and delete elements without moving other ele- ments.  Insertion and deletion of phone book entries could be common, so a list could be appropri- ate for representing a simple phone book. For example:  list  phone_book = {  {"David Hume",123456},   };  }  }  }  Section 4.4.2  list  99  {"Karl Popper",234567}, {"Bertrand Ar thur William Russell",345678}  When  we  use  a  linked  list,  we  tend  not  to  access  elements  using  subscripting  the  way  we  com- monly do for vectors.  Instead, we might search the list looking for an element with a given value. To do this, we take advantage of the fact that a list is a sequence as described in §4.5:  int get_number const string& s  {  for  const auto& x : phone_book   if  x.name==s   return 0;  return x.number;    use 0 to represent "number not found"  The  search  for s starts  at  the  beginning  of  the  list  and  proceeds  until s is  found  or  the  end  of phone_book is reached.  Sometimes, we need to identify an element in a list. For example, we may want to delete it or insert a new entry before it. To  do that we use an iterator: a list iterator identiﬁes an element of a list and can be used to iterate through a list  hence its name . Every standard-library container pro- vides  the  functions begin   and end  , which  return  an  iterator  to  the  ﬁrst  and  to  one-past-the-last element, respectively  §4.5, §33.1.1 . Using iterators explicitly, we can – less elegantly – write the get_number   function like this:  int get_number const string& s  {  for  auto p = phone_book.begin  ; p!=phone_book.end  ; ++p   if  p−>name==s   return 0;  return p−>number;    use 0 to represent "number not found"  In fact, this is roughly the way the terser and less error-prone range-for loop is implemented by the compiler. Giv en an iterator p, ∗p is the element to which it refers, ++p advances p to refer to the next element, and when p refers to a class with a member m, then p−>m is equivalent to  ∗p .m.  Adding elements to a list and removing elements from a list is easy:  void f const Entry& ee, list ::iterator p, list ::iterator q  {  phone_book.insert p,ee ; phone_book.erase q ;      add ee before the element referred to byp    remove the element referred to byq  For a more complete description of insert   and erase  , see §31.3.7.  These list examples  could  be  written  identically  using vector and   surprisingly, unless  you understand machine architecture  perform better with a small vector than with a small list. When all we want is a sequence of elements, we have a choice between using a vector and a list. Unless you  have  a  reason  not  to,  use  a vector. A vector performs  better  for  traversal   e.g., ﬁnd   and count    and for sorting and searching  e.g., sort   and binary_search   .   100  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  4.4.3 map Writing code to look up a name in a list of  name,number  pairs is quite tedious. In addition, a lin- ear search is inefﬁcient for all but the shortest lists. The standard library offers a search tree  a red- black tree  called map:  map:  4  links  key: value:  links  links  links  In other contexts, a map is known as an associative array or a dictionary. It is implemented as a bal- anced binary tree.  The standard-library map  §31.4.3  is a container of pairs of values optimized for lookup. We  can use the same initializer as for vector and list  §4.4.1, §4.4.2 :  map  phone_book {  {"David Hume",123456}, {"Karl Popper",234567}, {"Ber trand Ar thur William Russell",345678}  };  }  int get_number const string& s  {  return phone_book[s];  When indexed by a value of its ﬁrst type  called the key , a map returns the corresponding value of the second type  called the value or the mapped type .  For example:  In other words, subscripting a map is essentially the lookup we called get_number  . If a key isn’t found, it is entered into the map with a default value for its value. The default value for an integer type is 0; the value I just happened to choose represents an invalid telephone number.  If we wanted to avoid entering invalid numbers into our phone book, we could use ﬁnd   and  inser t   instead of []  §31.4.3.1 .  4.4.4 unordered_map The cost of a map lookup is O log n   where n is the number of elements in the map. That’s pretty good.  For  example,  for  a map with  1,000,000  elements,  we  perform  only  about  20  comparisons and indirections to ﬁnd an element. However,  in many cases, we can do better by using a hashed lookup rather than comparison using an ordering function, such as <. The standard-library hashed   Section 4.4.4  unordered_map  101  containers are referred to as ‘‘unordered’’ because they don’t require an ordering function:  For example, we can use an unordered_map from   for our phone book:  unordered_map:  rep  hash table:  unordered_map  phone_book {  {"David Hume",123456}, {"Karl Popper",234567}, {"Bertrand Ar thur William Russell",345678}  As for a map, we can subscript an unordered_map:  int get_number const string& s  {  return phone_book[s];  };  }  The standard-library unordered_map provides a default hash function for strings.  If necessary, you can provide your own  §31.4.3.4 .  4.4.5  Container Overview The standard library provides some of the most general and useful container types to allow the pro- grammer to select a container that best serves the needs of an application:  vector  list  forward_list  deque  set  multiset  map  multimap  unordered_map  unordered_multimap  unordered_set  unordered_multiset   Standard Container Summary A variable-size vector  §31.4  A doubly-linked list  §31.4.2  A singly-linked list  §31.4.2  A double-ended queue  §31.2  A set  §31.4.3  A set in which a value can occur many times  §31.4.3  An associative array  §31.4.3  A map in which a key can occur many times  §31.4.3  A map using a hashed lookup  §31.4.3.2  A multimap using a hashed lookup  §31.4.3.2  A set using a hashed lookup  §31.4.3.2  A multiset using a hashed lookup  §31.4.3.2   The unordered containers are optimized for lookup with a key  often a string ; in other words, they are implemented using hash tables.   102  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  The standard containers are described in §31.4. The containers are deﬁned in namespace std and  presented  in  headers  ,  ,  , etc.   §4.1.2,  §30.2 . In  addition,  the  standard library provides container adaptors queue   §31.5.2 , stack   §31.5.1 , deque   §31.4 , and priority_queue   §31.5.3 .  The standard  library  also  provides  more  specialized  container-like types, such as a ﬁxed-size array array   §34.2.1  and bitset   §34.2.2 .  The standard containers and their basic operations are designed to be similar from a notational point of view.  Furthermore, the meanings of the operations are equivalent for the various contain- ers.  Basic operations apply to every kind of container for which they make sense and can be efﬁ- ciently implemented. For example:   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   begin   and end   give iterators to the ﬁrst and one-beyond-the-last elements, respectively. push_back   can be used  efﬁciently  to add elements to the end of a vector, forward_list, list, and other containers. size   returns the number of elements.  This notational and semantic uniformity enables programmers to provide new container types that can  be  used  in  a  very  similar  manner  to  the  standard  ones. The  range-checked  vector, Vector  §2.3.2, §2.4.3.1 , is an example of that. The uniformity of container interfaces also allows us to specify algorithms independently of individual container types. However,  each has strengths and weaknesses.  For  example,  subscripting  and  traversing  a vector is  cheap  and  easy. On the  other hand, vector elements are moved when we insert or remove elements; list has exactly the opposite properties.  Please note that a vector is usually more efﬁcient than a list for short sequences of small elements  even for insert   and erase   .  I recommend the standard-library vector as the default type for sequences of elements: you need a reason to choose another.  4.5  Algorithms A data structure, such as a list or a vector, is not very useful on its own.  To use one, we need opera- tions  for  basic  access  such  as  adding  and  removing  elements   as  is  provided  for list and vector . Furthermore, we rarely just store objects in a container. We sort them, print them, extract subsets, remove  elements,  search  for  objects,  etc. Consequently, the  standard  library  provides  the  most common algorithms for containers in addition to providing the most common container types. For example, the following sorts a vector and places a copy of each unique vector element on a list:  bool operator< const Entry& x, const Entry& y  {     less than  return x.name<y.name;      order Entrys bytheir names  }  }  void f vector & vec, list & lst  {  sort vec.begin  ,vec.end   ; unique_copy vec.begin  ,vec.end  ,lst.begin   ;      use < for order    don’t copyadjacent equal elements  The standard algorithms are described in Chapter 32. They are expressed in terms of sequences of elements.  A sequence is represented by a pair of iterators specifying the ﬁrst element and the one- beyond-the-last element:   Section 4.5  Algorithms   103  iterators:  begin    elements:  end    In the example, sor t   sorts the sequence deﬁned by the pair of iterators vec.begin   and vec.end   – which just happens to be all the elements of a vector. For writing  output , you need only to specify the ﬁrst element to be written. If more than one element is written, the elements following that ini- tial element will be overwritten.  Thus, to avoid errors, lst must have at least as many elements as there are unique values in vec.  If we wanted to place the unique elements in a new container, we could have written:  list  f vector & vec  {  list  res; sor t vec.begin  ,vec.end   ; unique_copy vec.begin  ,vec.end  ,back_inser ter res  ;    append to res return res;  A back_inser ter   adds elements at the end of a container, extending the container to make room for them  §33.2.2 . Thus, the standard containers plus back_inser ter  s eliminate the need to use error- prone, explicit C-style memory management using realloc    §31.5.1 .  The standard-library list has a move  constructor  §3.3.2, §17.5.2  that makes returning res by value efﬁcient  even for lists of thousands of elements .  If you ﬁnd the pair-of-iterators style of code, such as sor t vec.begin  ,vec.end   , tedious, you can  deﬁne container versions of the algorithms and write sor t vec   §4.5.6 .  4.5.1  Use of Iterators When you ﬁrst encounter a container, a few iterators referring to useful elements can be obtained; begin   and end   are the best examples of this. In addition, many algorithms return iterators. For example, the standard algorithm ﬁnd looks for a value in a sequence and returns an iterator to the element found:     does s contain the character c?  bool has_c const string& s, char c  {  auto p = ﬁnd s.begin  ,s.end  ,c ; if  p!=s.end     else  return true;  return false;  }  }  Like many standard-library search algorithms, ﬁnd returns end   to indicate ‘‘not found.’’  An equiv- alent, shorter, deﬁnition of has_c   is:   104  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  bool has_c const string& s, char c  {  return ﬁnd s.begin  ,s.end  ,c !=s.end  ;     does s contain the character c?  A more  interesting  exercise  would  be  to  ﬁnd  the  location  of  all  occurrences  of  a  character  in  a string.  We can return the set of occurrences as a vector of string iterators.  Returning a vector is efﬁcient  because  of vector provides  move semantics   §3.3.1 . Assuming  that  we  would  like to modify the locations found, we pass a non-const string:     ﬁnd all occurrences of c in s  vector  ﬁnd_all string& s, char c  {  vector  res; for  auto p = s.begin  ; p!=s.end  ; ++p   if  ∗p==c   res.push_back p ;  return res;  We  iterate through the string using a conventional loop, moving the iterator p forward one element at  a  time  using ++ and  looking  at  the  elements  using  the  dereference  operator ∗. We could  test ﬁnd_all   like this:  void test   {  string m {"Mary had a little lamb"}; for  auto p : ﬁnd_all m,'a'    if  ∗p!='a'   cerr << "a bug!\n";  That call of ﬁnd_all   could be graphically represented like this:  ﬁnd_all m,’a’ :  m:  M a  r  y  h a d  a  l  i  t  t  l  e  l  a m b  Iterators and standard algorithms work equivalently on every standard container for which their use makes sense. Consequently, we could generalize ﬁnd_all  :     ﬁnd all occurrences of v in c  template  vector  ﬁnd_all C& c, V v  {  vector  res; for  auto p = c.begin  ; p!=c.end  ; ++p   if  ∗p==v   res.push_back p ;  return res;  }  }  }  }   Section 4.5.1  Use of Iterators  105  The typename is needed to inform the compiler that C’s iterator is supposed to be a type and not a value of some type, say, the integer 7. We can hide this implementation detail by introducing a type alias  §3.4.5  for Iterator:     ﬁnd all occurrences of v in c     pisastr ing::iterator  template  using Iterator  = typename T::iterator;  template  vector > ﬁnd_all C& c, V v  {  vector > res; for  auto p = c.begin  ; p!=c.end  ; ++p   if  ∗p==v   res.push_back p ;  return res;  We can now write:  void test   {  string m {"Mary had a little lamb"}; for  auto p : ﬁnd_all m,'a'    if  ∗p!='a'   cerr << "string bug!\n";  list  ld {1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 1.1}; for  auto p : ﬁnd_all ld,1.1    if  ∗p!=1.1   cerr << "list bug!\n";  if  ∗p!="green"   cerr << "vector bug!\n";  for  auto p : ﬁnd_all vs,"green"    ∗p = "ver t";  }  }  vector  vs { "red", "blue", "green", "green", "orange", "green" }; for  auto p : ﬁnd_all vs,"green"    Iterators are used to separate algorithms and containers. An algorithm operates on its data through iterators  and  knows  nothing  about  the  container  in  which  the  elements  are  stored. Conversely, a container knows nothing about the algorithms operating on its elements; all it does is to supply iter- ators  upon  request   e.g., begin   and end   .  This model  of  separation  between  data  storage  and algorithm delivers very general and ﬂexible software.  4.5.2  Iterator Types What are iterators really? Any particular iterator is an object of some type. There are, however, many different iterator types, because an iterator needs to hold the information necessary for doing   106  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  its job for a particular container type. These iterator types can be as different as the containers and the  specialized  needs  they serve.  For  example,  a vector’s  iterator  could  be  an  ordinary  pointer, because a pointer is quite a reasonable way of referring to an element of a vector:  iterator:  vector:  p  P  i  e  t  H  e  i  n  Alternatively, a vector iterator could be implemented as a pointer to the vector plus an index:  iterator:   start == p, position == 3   vector:  P  i  e  t  H  e  i  n  Using such an iterator would allow range checking.  A list iterator must be something more complicated than a simple pointer to an element because an element of a list in general does not know where the next element of that list is.  Thus, a list iter- ator might be a pointer to a link:  iterator:  list:  elements:  p  link P  link  i  link e  link  t  ...  What is common for all iterators is their semantics and the naming of their operations. For exam- ple, applying ++ to any iterator yields an iterator that refers to the next element. Similarly, ∗ yields the element to which the iterator refers. In fact, any object that obeys a few simple rules like these is an iterator  §33.1.4 . Furthermore, users rarely need to know the type of a speciﬁc iterator; each container ‘‘knows’’ its iterator types and makes them available under the conventional names itera- tor and const_iterator. For example, list ::iterator is the general iterator type for list . We rarely have to worry about the details of how that type is deﬁned.  4.5.3  Stream Iterators Iterators  are  a  general  and  useful  concept  for  dealing  with  sequences  of  elements  in  containers. However, containers are not the only place where we ﬁnd sequences of elements. For example, an input stream produces a sequence of values, and we write a sequence of values to an output stream. Consequently, the notion of iterators can be usefully applied to input and output.  To  make an ostream_iterator, we need  to  specify  which  stream  will  be  used  and  the  type  of  objects written to it. For example:   Section 4.5.3  Stream Iterators  107  ostream_iterator  oo {cout};     writestr ingsto cout  The effect of assigning to ∗oo is to write the assigned value to cout. For example:  int main   {  ∗oo = "Hello, "; ++oo; ∗oo = "world!\n";      meaning cout<<"Hello,"     meaning cout<<"wor ld!\n"  This is yet another way of writing the canonical message to standard output. The ++oo is done to mimic writing into an array through a pointer.  Similarly, an istream_iterator is something that allows us to treat an input stream as a read-only  container. Again, we must specify the stream to be used and the type of values expected:  Input iterators are used in pairs representing a sequence, so we must provide an istream_iterator to indicate the end of input. This is the default istream_iterator:  istream_iterator  ii {cin};  istream_iterator  eos {};  Typically, istream_iterators and ostream_iterators are not used directly. Instead, they are provided as arguments to algorithms. For example, we can write a simple program to read a ﬁle, sort the words read, eliminate duplicates, and write the result to another ﬁle:  int main   {  string from, to; cin >> from >> to;     get source and target ﬁle names  ifstream is {from};  istream_iterator  ii {is}; istream_iterator  eos {};     input stream for ﬁle "from"    input iterator for stream    input sentinel  ofstream os{to}; ostream_iterator  oo {os,"\n"};     output stream for ﬁle "to"    output iterator for stream  vector  b {ii,eos}; sort b.begin  ,b.end   ;     bisavector initialized from input [ii:eos     sor tthe buffer  unique_copy b.begin  ,b.end  ,oo ;      copybuffer to output, discard replicated values  return !is.eof    !os;     returnerror state  §2.2.1, §38.3   An ifstream is an istream that can be attached to a ﬁle, and an ofstream is an ostream that can be attached to a ﬁle. The ostream_iterator’s second argument is used to delimit output values.  Actually, this program is longer than it needs to be. We  read the strings into a vector, then we sort   them, and then we write them out, eliminating duplicates. A more elegant solution is not to  }  }   108  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  store duplicates at all. This can be done by keeping the strings in a set, which does not keep dupli- cates and keeps its elements in order  §31.4.3 . That way, we could replace the two lines using a vector with one using a set and replace unique_copy   with the simpler copy  :  set  b {ii,eos}; copy b.begin  ,b.end  ,oo ;      collect strings from input    copybuffer to output  We used the names ii, eos, and oo only once, so we could further reduce the size of the program:  int main   {  string from, to; cin >> from >> to;     get source and target ﬁle names  ifstream is {from};  ofstream os {to};     input stream for ﬁle "from"    output stream for ﬁle "to"  set  b {istream_iterator {is},istream_iterator {}};    read input copy b.begin  ,b.end  ,ostream_iterator {os,"\n"} ;      copytooutput  return !is.eof    !os;     returnerror state  §2.2.1, §38.3   It is a matter of taste and experience whether or not this last simpliﬁcation improves readability.  4.5.4  Predicates In the examples above, the algorithms have simply ‘‘built in’’ the action to be done for each ele- ment of a sequence. However, we often want to make that action a parameter to the algorithm. For example, the ﬁnd algorithm  §32.4  provides a convenient way of looking for a speciﬁc value.  A more general variant looks for an element that fulﬁlls a speciﬁed requirement, a predicate  §3.4.2 . For example, we might want to search a map for the ﬁrst value larger than 42. A map allows us to access its elements as a sequence of  key,value  pairs, so we can search a map ’s sequence for a pair  where the int is greater than 42:  void f map & m  {  auto p = ﬁnd_if m.begin  ,m.end  ,Greater_than{42} ;    ...  Here, Greater_than is a function object  §3.4.3  holding the value  42  to be compared against:  struct Greater_than {  int val; Greater_than int v  : val{v} { } bool operator   const pair & r  { return r.second>val; }  Alternatively, we could use a lambda expression  §3.4.3 :  int cxx = count_if m.begin  , m.end  , [] const pair & r  { return r.second>42; } ;  }  }  };   Section 4.5.4  Predicates   109  4.5.5  Algorithm Overview A general deﬁnition of an algorithm is ‘‘a ﬁnite set of rules which gives a sequence of operations for solving a speciﬁc set of problems [and] has ﬁve important features: Finiteness ... Deﬁniteness ... Input ... Output ... Effectiveness’’ [Knuth,1968,§1.1].  In the context of the C++ standard library, an algorithm is a function template operating on sequences of elements.  The standard library provides dozens of algorithms. The algorithms are deﬁned in namespace std and presented in the   header. These standard-library algorithms all take sequences as inputs  §4.5 . A half-open sequence from b to e is referred to as [b:e .  Here are a few I hav e found particularly useful:  Selected Standard Algorithms  p=ﬁnd b,e,x  p=ﬁnd_if b,e,f  n=count b,e,x  n=count_if b,e,f  replace b,e,v,v2  replace_if b,e,f,v2  p=copy b,e ,out  p=copy_if b,e ,out,f  p=unique_copy b,e ,out  sort b,e  sort b,e,f   p1,p2 =equal_range b,e,v   p=merge b,e ,b2,e2,out   p is the ﬁrst p in [b:e  so that ∗p==x p is the ﬁrst p in [b:e  so that f ∗p ==true n is the number of elements ∗q in [b:e  so that ∗q==x n is the number of elements ∗q in [b:e  so that f ∗q,x  Replace elements ∗q in [b:e  so that ∗q==v by v2 Replace elements ∗q in [b:e  so that f ∗q  by v2 Copy [b:e  to [out:p  Copy elements ∗q from [b:e  so that f ∗q  to [out:p  Copy [b:e  to [out:p ; don’t copy adjacent duplicates Sort elements of [b:e  using < as the sorting criterion Sort elements of [b:e  using f as the sorting criterion [p1:p2  is the subsequence of the sorted sequence [b:e  with the value v; basically a binary search for v Merge two sorted sequences [b:e  and [b2:e2  into [out:p   These  algorithms,  and  many more   see  Chapter  32 ,  can  be  applied  to  elements  of  containers, strings, and built-in arrays.  4.5.6  Container Algorithms A sequence is deﬁned by a pair of iterators [begin:end .  This is general and ﬂexible, but most often, we apply an algorithm to a sequence that is the contents of a container. For example:  Why don’t we just say sort v ? We can easily provide that shorthand:  sort v.begin  ,v.end   ;  namespace Estd {  using namespace std;  template  void sort C& c  {  sort c.begin  ,c.end   ;  }   110  A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms  Chapter 4  template  void sort C& c, Pred p  {  sort c.begin  ,c.end  ,p ;  }     ...  }  I put  the  container  versions  of sort    and  other  algorithms   into  their  own  namespace Estd  ‘‘extended std’’  to avoid interfering with other programmers’ uses of namespace std.  iostreams are type sensitive, type-safe, and extensible; §4.3.  4.6  Advice [1]  Don’t reinvent the wheel; use libraries; §4.1.

For a giv en application  domain,  a  huge  commercial  library  can come  close  to  that  ideal. However,  that  is  not  what  the  C++  standard  library  is  trying  to  do. A manageable,  universally  available,  library  cannot  be  everything  to  everybody. Instead,  the  C++ standard  library  aims  to  provide  components  that  are  useful  to  most  people  in  most  application areas.  That is, it aims to serve the intersection of all needs rather than their union. In addition, sup- port  for  a  few widely  important  application  areas,  such  as  mathematical  computation  and  text manipulation, have crept in.   112  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  5.2  Resource Management One of the key tasks of any nontrivial program is to manage resources. A resource is something that  must  be  acquired  and  later   explicitly  or  implicitly   released. Examples  are  memory, locks, sockets, thread handles, and ﬁle handles. For a long-running program, failing to release a resource in a timely manner  ‘‘a leak’’  can cause serious performance degradation and possibly even a mis- erable  crash. Even  for  short  programs,  a  leak  can  become  an  embarrassment,  say  by  a  resource shortage increasing the run time by orders of magnitude.  The standard library components are designed not to leak resources. To do this, they rely on the basic language support for resource management using constructor destructor pairs to ensure that a resource  doesn’t outlive  an object  responsible  for  it. The  use  of  a  constructor destructor  pair  in Vector to manage the lifetime of its elements is an example  §3.2.1.2  and all standard-library con- tainers are implemented in similar ways.  Importantly, this approach interacts correctly with error handling using exceptions.  For example, the technique is used for the standard-library lock classes:  mutex m;    used to protect access to shared data    ... void f   {  unique_lock  lck {m};     acquire the mutexm    ... manipulate shared data ...  }  A thread will  not  proceed  until lck’s  constructor  has  acquired  its mutex, m  §5.3.4 .  The corre- sponding destructor releases the resource. So, in this example, unique_lock’s destructor releases the mutex when the thread of control leaves f    through a return, by ‘‘falling off the end of the func- tion,’’ or through an exception throw .  This is an application of the ‘‘Resource Acquisition Is Initialization’’ technique  RAII; §3.2.1.2, §13.3 .  This technique is fundamental to the idiomatic handling of resources in C++. Containers  such as vector and map , string, and iostream manage their resources  such as ﬁle handles and buf- fers  similarly.  5.2.1 unique_ptr and shared_ptr The examples so far take care of objects deﬁned in a scope, releasing the resources they acquire at the exit from the scope, but what about objects allocated on the free store? In  , the stan- dard library provides two ‘‘smart pointers’’ to help manage objects on the free store:  [1] [2]  unique_ptr to represent unique ownership  §34.3.1  shared_ptr to represent shared ownership  §34.3.2   The most basic use of these ‘‘smart pointers’’ is to prevent memory leaks caused by careless pro- gramming.  For example:  void f int i, int j  {     X* vs.unique_ptr   X∗ p = new X; unique_ptr  sp {new X};     ...     allocate a newX    allocate a newXand giveits pointer to unique_ptr   Section 5.2.1  unique_ptr and shared_ptr  113  if  i<99  throw Z{};  if  j<77  return; p−>do_something  ;  sp−>do_something  ;     ... delete p;     maythrowanexception    mayretur n"ear ly"    maythrowanexception    maythrowanexception     destroy*p  Here, we ‘‘forgot’’ to delete p if i<99 or if j<77. On the other hand, unique_ptr ensures that its object is properly destroyed whichever way we exit f    by throwing an exception, by executing return, or by  ‘‘falling  off the  end’’ .  Ironically, we could  have  solved  the  problem  simply  by not using  a pointer and not using new:     use a local var iable  void f int i, int j  {  X x;    ...  Unfortunately, overuse of new  and of pointers and references  seems to be an increasing problem.  However,  when  you  really  need  the  semantics  of  pointers, unique_ptr is  a  very  lightweight mechanism with no space or time overhead compared to correct use of a built-in pointer. Its further uses include passing free-store allocated objects in and out of functions:  unique_ptr  make_X int i      makeanXand immediately giveittoaunique_ptr     ... checki,etc. ... return unique_ptr {new X{i}};  A unique_ptr is a handle to an individual object  or an array  in much the same way that a vector is a handle to a sequence of objects. Both control the lifetime of other objects  using RAII  and both rely on move semantics to make return simple and efﬁcient.  The shared_ptr is  similar  to unique_ptr except  that shared_ptrs are  copied  rather  than  moved. The shared_ptrs for an object share ownership of an object and that object is destroyed when the last of its shared_ptrs is destroyed.  For example:  void f shared_ptr  ; void g shared_ptr  ;  void user const string& name, ios_base::openmode mode  {  shared_ptr  fp {new fstream name ,mode }; if  !∗fp  throw No_ﬁle{};      makesure the ﬁle was properly opened  f fp ; g fp ;    ...  }  }  {  }  }   114  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  Now, the ﬁle opened by fp’s constructor will be closed by the last function to  explicitly or implic- itly  destroy a copy of fp. Note that f   or g   may spawn a task holding a copy of fp or in some other way store a copy that outlives user  . Thus, shared_ptr provides a form of garbage collection that respects the destructor-based resource management of the memory-managed objects. This is neither cost free nor exorbitantly expensive, but does make the lifetime of the shared object hard to predict.  Use shared_ptr only if you actually need shared ownership.  Given unique_ptr and shared_ptr, we can  implement  a  complete  ‘‘no  naked new’’  policy  §3.2.1.2  for many programs.  However, these ‘‘smart pointers’’ are still conceptually pointers and therefore only my second choice for resource management – after containers and other types that manage their resources at a higher conceptual level.  In particular, shared_ptrs do not in themselves provide  any rules  for  which  of  their  owners  can  read  and or  write  the  shared  object. Data  races  §41.2.4  and other forms of confusion are not addressed simply by eliminating the resource man- agement issues.  Where do we use ‘‘smart pointers’’  such as unique_ptr  rather than resource handles with oper- ations designed speciﬁcally for the resource  such as vector or thread ?  Unsurprisingly, the answer is ‘‘when we need pointer semantics.’’   cid:129  When we share an object, we need pointers  or references  to refer to the shared object, so a  shared_ptr becomes the obvious choice  unless there is an obvious single owner .   cid:129  When we refer to a polymorphic object, we need a pointer  or a reference  because we don’t know the exact type of the object referred to or even its size , so a unique_ptr becomes the obvious choice.   cid:129  A shared polymorphic object typically requires shared_ptrs.  We do not need to use a pointer to return a collection of objects from a function; a container that is a resource handle will do that simply and efﬁciently  §3.3.2 .  5.3  Concurrency Concurrency – the execution of several tasks simultaneously – is widely used to improve through- put  by using several processors for a single computation  or to improve responsiveness  by allow- ing one part of a program to progress while another is waiting for a response . All modern pro- gramming languages provide support for this. The support provided by the C++ standard library is a portable and type-safe variant of what has been used in C++ for more than 20 years and is almost universally supported by modern hardware.  The standard-library support is primarily aimed at sup- porting systems-level concurrency rather than directly providing sophisticated higher-level concur- rency models; those can be supplied as libraries built using the standard-library facilities.  The  standard  library  directly  supports  concurrent  execution  of  multiple  threads  in  a  single address space. To  allow that, C++ provides a suitable memory model  §41.2  and a set of atomic operations  §41.3 . However, most users will see concurrency only in terms of the standard library and libraries built on top of that. This section brieﬂy gives examples of the main standard-library concurrency support  facilities: threads, mutexes, lock   operations, packaged_tasks,  and futures. These features are built directly upon what operating systems offer and do not incur performance penalties compared with those.   Section 5.3.1  Tasks and threads  115  5.3.1  Tasks and threads We call a computation that can potentially be executed concurrently with other computations a task. A thread is the system-level representation of a task in a program. A task to be executed concur- rently with other tasks is launched by constructing a std::thread  found in    with the task as its argument.  A task is a function or a function object:     function  void operator    ;     function object    F’scall operator  §3.4.3   thread t1 {f}; thread t2 {F  };     f   executes in separate thread    F     executes in separate thread  t1.join  ;  t2.join  ;      wait for t1    wait for t2  void f  ;  struct F {  void user   {  };  }  The join  s ensure that we don’t exit user   until the threads have completed.  To ‘‘join’’ means to ‘‘wait for the thread to terminate.’’  Threads of a program share a single address space. In this, threads differ from processes, which generally do not directly share data. Since threads share an address space, they can communicate through  shared  objects   §5.3.4 . Such  communication  is  typically  controlled  by  locks  or  other mechanisms to prevent data races  uncontrolled concurrent access to a variable .  Programming  concurrent  tasks  can  be very tricky.  Consider  possible  implementations  of  the  tasks f  a function  and F  a function object :  void f   { cout << "Hello "; }  struct F {  };  void operator     { cout << "Parallel World!\n"; }  This is an example of a bad error: Here, f and F   each use the object cout without any form of syn- chronization.  The resulting output would be unpredictable and could vary between different execu- tions of the program because the order of execution of the individual operations in the two tasks is not deﬁned. The program may produce ‘‘odd’’ output, such as  PaHerallllel o World!  When deﬁning tasks of a concurrent program, our aim is to keep tasks completely separate except where they communicate in simple and obvious ways.  The simplest way of thinking of a concur- rent task is as a function that happens to run concurrently with its caller. For that to work, we just have  to pass  arguments,  get  a  result  back,  and  make sure  that  there  is  no  use  of  shared  data  in between  no data races .   116  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  5.3.2  Passing Arguments Typically, a task needs data to work upon. We can easily pass data  or pointers or references to the data  as arguments.  Consider:  void f vector & v ;     function do something with v  struct F {     function object: do something with v  vector & v; F vector & vv  :v{vv} { } void operator    ;     application operator ;§3.4.3  int main   {  };  }  t1.join  ; t2.join  ;  vector  some_vec {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; vector  vec2 {10,11,12,13,14};  thread t1 {f,some_vec};  thread t2 {F{vec2}};     f some_vec  executes in a separate thread    F vec2    executes in a separate thread  Obviously, F{vec2} saves a reference  to  the  argument  vector  in F. F can  now use  that  array  and hopefully no other task accesses vec2 while F is executing.  Passing vec2 by value would eliminate that risk.  The initialization with {f,some_vec} uses a thread variadic template constructor that can accept an  arbitrary  sequence  of  arguments   §28.6 . The  compiler  checks  that  the  ﬁrst  argument  can  be invoked giv en the  following  arguments  and  builds  the  necessary  function  object  to  pass  to  the thread.  Thus, if F::operator     and f   perform the same algorithm, the handling of the two tasks are roughly equivalent: in both cases, a function object is constructed for the thread to execute.  5.3.3  Returning Results In the example in §5.3.2, I pass the arguments by non-const reference.  I only do that if I expect the task to modify the value of the data referred to  §7.7 . That’s a somewhat sneaky,  but not uncom- mon, way of returning a result. A less obscure technique is to pass the input data by const refer- ence and to pass the location of a place to deposit the result as a separate argument:  void f const vector & v, double∗ res ;   takeinput from v; place result in *res  class F { public:  F const vector & vv, double∗ p  :v{vv}, res{p} { } void operator    ;     place result in *res   Returning Results  117  const vector & v; double∗ res;      source of input     target for output  Section 5.3.3  private:  };  int main   {  vector  some_vec; vector  vec2;    ...  double res1; double res2;  t1.join  ; t2.join  ;  cout << res1 << ' ' << res2 << '\n';  }  thread t1 {f,some_vec,&res1};    f some_vec,&res1  executes in a separate thread thread t2 {F{vec2,&res2}};     F{vec2,&res2}   executes in a separate thread  I don’t consider returning results through arguments particularly elegant, so I return to this topic in §5.3.5.1.  5.3.4  Sharing Data Sometimes tasks need to share data. In that case, the access has to be synchronized so that at most one  task  at  a  time  has  access. Experienced  programmers  will  recognize  this  as  a  simpliﬁcation  e.g.,  there  is  no  problem  with  many tasks  simultaneously  reading  immutable  data ,  but  consider how to ensure that at most one task at a time has access to a given set of objects.  The  fundamental  element  of  the  solution  is  a mutex, a ‘‘mutual  exclusion  object.’’  A thread  acquires a mutex using a lock   operation:  mutex m;    controlling mutex int sh;     shared data  void f   {  unique_lock  lck {m};     acquire mutex sh += 7;    release muteximplicitly     manipulate shared data  }  The unique_lock’s  constructor  acquires  the  mutex  through  a  call m.lock   .  If another  thread  has already acquired the mutex, the thread waits  ‘‘blocks’’  until the other thread completes its access. Once a thread has completed its access to the shared data, the unique_lock releases the mutex  with a call m.unlock   .  The mutual exclusion and locking facilities are found in  .   118  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  The correspondence between the shared data and a mutex is conventional: the programmer simply has to know which mutex is supposed to correspond to which data. Obviously, this is error-prone, and equally obviously we try to make the correspondence clear through various language means. For example:  class Record { public:  mutex rm;    ...  };  It doesn’t take a genius to guess that for a Record called rec, rec.rm is a mutex that you are supposed to acquire before accessing the other data of rec, though a comment or a better name might have helped a reader.  It is not uncommon to need to simultaneously access several resources to perform some action. This can lead to deadlock. For example, if thread1 acquires mutex1 and then tries to acquire mutex2 while thread2 acquires mutex2 and then tries to acquire mutex1, then neither task will ever proceed further. The  standard  library  offers  help  in  the  form  of  an  operation  for  acquiring  several  locks simultaneously:  void f   {     ... unique_lock  lck1 {m1,defer_lock};  unique_lock  lck2 {m2,defer_lock}; unique_lock  lck3 {m3,defer_lock};    ... lock lck1,lck2,lck3 ;     ... manipulate shared data ...  }    implicitly release all mutexes     defer_lock: don’t yet trytoacquire the mutex     acquire all three locks  This lock   will only proceed after acquiring all its mutex arguments and will never block  ‘‘go to sleep’’   while  holding  a mutex. The  destructors  for  the  individual unique_locks ensure  that  the mutexes are released when a thread leaves the scope.  Communicating through shared data is pretty low lev el.  In particular, the programmer has to devise ways of knowing what work has and has not been done by various tasks. In that regard, use of shared data is inferior to the notion of call and return. On the other hand, some people are con- vinced that sharing must be more efﬁcient than copying arguments and returns. That can indeed be so  when  large  amounts  of  data  are  involved,  but  locking  and  unlocking  are  relatively  expensive operations.  On the other hand, modern machines are very good at copying data, especially compact data,  such  as vector elements.  So don’t choose  shared  data  for  communication  because  of  ‘‘efﬁ- ciency’’ without thought and preferably not without measurement.  5.3.4.1  Waiting for Events  Sometimes, a thread needs to wait for some kind of external event, such as another thread complet- ing a task or a certain amount of time having passed. The simplest ‘‘event’’ is simply time passing. Consider:   Section 5.3.4.1  Waiting for Events   119  using namespace std::chrono;      see §35.2  auto t0 = high_resolution_clock::now  ; this_thread::sleep_for milliseconds{20} ; auto t1 = high_resolution_clock::now  ; cout   t1−t0 .count   << " nanoseconds passed\n";  Note that I didn’t even hav e to launch a thread; by default, this_thread refers to the one and only thread  §42.2.6 .  I used duration_cast to  adjust  the  clock’s units  to  the  nanoseconds  I  wanted.  See §5.4.1  and §35.2 before trying anything more complicated than this with time. The time facilities are found in  .  The  basic  support  for  communicating  using  external  events  is  provided  by condition_variables found in    §42.3.4 .  A condition_variable is a mechanism allowing one thread to wait for another. In particular, it allows a thread to wait for some condition  often called an event  to occur as the result of work done by other threads.  Consider the classical example of two threads communicating by passing messages through a queue. For simplicity, I declare the queue and the mechanism for avoiding race conditions on that queue global to the producer and consumer:  class Message {     object to be communicated     ...  };  queue  mqueue;  condition_variable mcond; mutex mmutex;      the queue of messages    the var iable communicating events    the locking mechanism  The types queue, condition_variable, and mutex are provided by the standard library.  The consumer   reads and processes Messages:  void consumer   {  while true  {  }  }  unique_lock  lck{mmutex};  while  mcond.wait lck    * do nothing* ;   auto m = mqueue.front  ;  mqueue.pop  ; lck.unlock  ;     ... process m ...     acquire mmutex    release lckand wait;    re-acquire lckupon wakeup    get the message     release lck  Here,  I  explicitly  protect  the  operations  on  the queue and  on  the condition_variable with  a unique_lock on the mutex. Waiting on condition_variable releases its lock argument until the wait is over  so that the queue is non-empty  and then reacquires it.  The corresponding producer looks like this:   120  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  void producer   {  while true  {  }  }  Message m;    ... ﬁll the message ... unique_lock  lck {mmutex};  mqueue.push m ; mcond.notify_one  ;      protect operations     notify    release lock at end of scope   Using condition_variables supports many forms of elegant and efﬁcient sharing, but can be rather tricky  §42.3.4 .  5.3.5  Communicating Tasks The  standard  library  provides  a  few facilities  to  allow programmers  to  operate  at  the  conceptual level of tasks  work to potentially be done concurrently  rather than directly at the lower level of threads and locks:  [1] [2] [3]  future and promise for returning a value from a task spawned on a separate thread packaged_task to help launch tasks and connect up the mechanisms for returning a result async   for launching of a task in a manner very similar to calling a function.  These facilities are found in  .  5.3.5.1 future and promise  The important point about future and promise is that they enable a transfer of a value between two tasks  without  explicit  use  of  a  lock;  ‘‘the  system’’ implements  the  transfer  efﬁciently. The  basic idea is simple: When a task wants to pass a value to another, it puts the value into a promise. Some- how, the implementation makes that value appear in the corresponding future, from which it can be read  typically by the launcher of the task . We can represent this graphically:  task1:  task2:  get    future  promise  set_value    set_exception    value  If we have a future  called fx, we can get   a value of type X from it:  X v = fx.g et  ;     if necessary, wait for the value to get computed  If the value isn’t there yet, our thread is blocked until it arrives.  If the value couldn’t be computed, get   might throw an exception  from the system or transmitted from the task from which we were trying to get   the value .   Section 5.3.5.1  future and promise  121  The  main  purpose  of  a promise is  to  provide  simple  ‘‘put’’ operations   called set_value   and set_exception    to match future’s get  . The names ‘‘future’’ and ‘‘promise’’ are historical; please don’t blame me. They are yet another fertile source of puns.  If you have  a promise and need to send a result of type X to a future, you can do one of two  things: pass a value or pass an exception.  For example:  void f promise & px  {     atask: place the result in px     ... try {  }  }  X res;    ... compute a value for res ... px.set_value res ;  } catch  ...  {     oops: couldn’t compute res     pass the exception to the future’sthread: px.set_exception current_exception   ;  The current_exception   refers to the caught exception  §30.4.1.2 .  To  deal with an exception transmitted through a future, the caller of get   must be prepared to  catch it somewhere.  For example:     atask: get the result from fx  void g future & fx  {     ... try {  X v = fx.g et  ;    ... use v ...  } catch  ...  {     ... handle error ...  }  }  5.3.5.2 packaged_task     if necessary, wait for the value to get computed     oops: someone couldn’t compute v  How do we get  a future into  the  task  that  needs  a  result  and  the  corresponding promise into  the thread that should produce that result? The packaged_task type is provided to simplify setting up tasks connected with futures and promises to be run on threads.  A packaged_task provides wrapper code  to  put  the  return  value  or  exception  from  the  task  into  a promise  like the  code  shown  in §5.3.5.1 .  If you ask it by calling get_future, a packaged_task will give you the future corresponding to  its promise. For  example,  we  can  set  up  two tasks  to  each  add  half  of  the  elements  of  a vector  using the standard-library accumulate    §3.4.2, §40.6 :   122  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  double accum double∗ beg, double ∗ end, double init      compute the sum of [beg:end  starting with the initial value init  return accumulate beg,end,init ;  {  }  }  {  double comp2 vector & v  {  using Task_type = double double∗,double∗,double ;      type of task  packaged_task  pt0 {accum}; packaged_task  pt1 {accum};     package the task  i.e., accum   future  f0 {pt0.get_future  };  future  f1 {pt1.get_future  };      get hold of pt0’sfuture    get hold of pt1’sfuture  double∗ ﬁrst = &v[0]; thread t1 {move pt0 ,ﬁrst,ﬁrst+v.siz e   2,0}; thread t2 {move pt1 ,ﬁrst+v.siz e   2,ﬁrst+v.siz e  ,0};     star tathread for pt0    star tathread for pt1     ...  return f0.get  +f1.g et  ;     get the results  The packaged_task template takes the type of the task as its template argument  here Task_type, an alias  for double double∗,double∗,double   and  the  task  as  its  constructor  argument   here, accum . The move   operations are needed because a packaged_task cannot be copied.  Please note the absence of explicit mention of locks in this code: we are able to concentrate on tasks  to  be  done,  rather  than  on  the  mechanisms  used  to  manage  their  communication. The  two tasks will be run on separate threads and thus potentially in parallel.  5.3.5.3 async    The line of thinking I have pursued in this chapter is the one I believe to be the simplest yet still among the most powerful: Treat a task as a function that may happen to run concurrently with other tasks.  It is far from the only model supported by the C++ standard library, but it serves well for a wide range of needs. More subtle and tricky models, e.g., styles of programming relying on shared memory, can be used as needed.  To launch tasks to potentially run asynchronously, we can use async  :  double comp4 vector & v      spawn manytasks if v is large enough  if  v.siz e  <10000  return accum v.begin  ,v.end  ,0.0 ;  auto v0 = &v[0]; auto sz = v.siz e  ;   Section 5.3.5.3  async    123  auto f0 = async accum,v0,v0+sz 4,0.0 ; auto f1 = async accum,v0+sz 4,v0+sz 2,0.0 ; auto f2 = async accum,v0+sz 2,v0+sz∗3 4,0.0 ;  auto f3 = async accum,v0+sz∗3 4,v0+sz,0.0 ;      ﬁrst quarter    second quarter    third quarter    four thquar ter  return f0.get  +f1.g et  +f2.get  +f3.get  ;    collect and combine the results  }  Basically, async   separates the ‘‘call part’’ of a function call from the ‘‘get the result part,’’ and sep- arates  both  from  the  actual  execution  of  the  task. Using async  , you  don’t hav e to  think  about threads and locks. Instead, you think just in terms of tasks that potentially compute their results asynchronously. There  is  an  obvious  limitation:  Don’t even think  of  using async   for  tasks  that share resources needing locking – with async   you don’t even know how many threads will be used because that’s up to async   to decide based on what it knows about the system resources available at the time of a call. For example, async   may check whether any idle cores  processors  are avail- able before deciding how many threads to use.  Please  note  that async   is  not  just  a  mechanism  specialized  for  parallel  computation  for increased performance. For example, it can also be used to spawn a task for getting information from a user, leaving the ‘‘main program’’ active with something else  §42.4.6 .  5.4  Small Utility Components Not all standard-library components come as part of obviously labeled facilities, such as ‘‘contain- ers’’ or ‘‘I O.’’  This section gives a few examples of small, widely useful components:  clock and duration for measuring time.   cid:129   cid:129  Type functions, such as iterator_traits and is_arithmetic, for gaining information about types.  cid:129   pair and tuple for representing small potentially heterogeneous sets of values.  The point here is that a function or a type need not be complicated or closely tied to a mass of other functions and types to be useful. Such library components mostly act as building blocks for more powerful library facilities, including other components of the standard library.  5.4.1  Time The standard library provides facilities for dealing with time. For example, here is the basic way of timing something:  using namespace std::chrono;      see §35.2  auto t0 = high_resolution_clock::now  ; do_work  ; auto t1 = high_resolution_clock::now  ; cout   t1−t0 .count   << "msec\n";  The  clock  returns  a time_point  a  point  in  time . Subtracting  two time_points giv es a duration  a period of time . Various clocks give their results in various units of time  the clock I used measures nanoseconds , so it is usually a good idea to convert a duration into a known unit. That’s what dura- tion_cast does.   124  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  The standard-library facilities for dealing with time are found in the subnamespace std::chrono in    §35.2 .  Don’t make statements  about  ‘‘efﬁciency’’ of code  without  ﬁrst  doing  time  measurements.  Guesses about performance are most unreliable.  5.4.2  Type Functions A type  function is  a  function  that  is  evaluated  at  compile-time  given a type  as  its  argument  or returning a type. The standard library provides a variety of type functions to help library imple- menters and programmers in general to write code that take advantage of aspects of the language, the standard library, and code in general.  For numerical  types, numeric_limits from   presents  a  variety  of  useful  information   §5.6.5 .  For example:  constexpr ﬂoat min = numeric_limits ::min  ;      smallest positiveﬂoat  §40.2   Similarly, object sizes can be found by the built-in sizeof operator  §2.2.2 . For example:  constexpr int szi = sizeof int ;    the number of bytes in an int  Such type functions are part of C++’s mechanisms for compile-time computation that allow tighter type checking and better performance than would otherwise have been possible. Use of such fea- tures  is  often  called metaprogramming or   when  templates  are  involved  template  metaprogram- ming  Chapter 28 . Here, I just present two facilities provided by the standard library: iterator_traits  §5.4.2.1  and type predicates  §5.4.2.2 .  5.4.2.1 iterator_traits  The standard-library sort   takes a pair of iterators supposed to deﬁne a sequence  §4.5 . Further- more,  those  iterators  must  offer  random  access  to  that  sequence,  that  is,  they must  be random- access  iterators. Some  containers,  such  as forward_list, do not  offer  that. In  particular, a for- ward_list is a singly-linked list so subscripting would be expensive and there is no reasonable way to refer back to a previous element. However, like most containers, forward_list offers forward iter- ators that can be used to traverse the sequence by algorithms and for-statements  §33.1.1 .  The standard library provides a mechanism, iterator_traits that allows us to check which kind of iterator  is  supported. Given that,  we  can  improve the  range sort   from  §4.5.6  to  accept  either  a vector or a forward_list. For example:  void test vector & v, forward_list & lst  {  sort v ; sort lst ;     sor tthe vector    sor tthe singly-linked list  }  The techniques needed to make that work are generally useful.  First, I write two helper functions that take an extra argument indicating whether they are to be used  for  random-access  iterators  or  forward  iterators. The  version  taking  random-access  iterator arguments is trivial:   Section 5.4.2.1  iterator_traits  125  template  void sort_helper Ran beg, Ran end, random_access_iterator_tag   {  sort beg,end ;     just sortit     forrandom-access iterators    we can subscript into [beg:end   }  }  }   cid:129   cid:129   The version for forward iterators is almost as simple; just copy the list into a vector, sort, and copy back again:  template  void sort_helper For beg, For end, forward_iterator_tag   {     forforward iterators    we can traverse [beg:end   vector  v {beg,end}; sort v.begin  ,v.end   ; copy v.begin  ,v.end  ,beg ;      initializeavector from [beg:end      copythe elements back  The decltype   is a built-in type function that returns the declared type of its argument  §6.3.6.3 . Thus, v is a vector  where X is the element type of the input sequence.  The real ‘‘type magic’’ is in the selection of helper functions:  template  void sort C& c  {  using Iter = Iterator_type ; sort_helper c.begin  ,c.end  ,Iterator_category {} ;  Here, I use two type functions: Iterator_type  returns the iterator type of C  that is, C::iterator  and then Iterator_category {} constructs a ‘‘tag’’ value indicating the kind of iterator provided:  std::random_access_iterator_tag if C’s iterator supports random access. std::forward_iterator_tag if C’s iterator supports forward iteration.  Given that,  we  can  select  between  the  two sorting  algorithms  at  compile  time. This  technique, called tag dispatch is one of several used in the standard library and elsewhere to improve ﬂexibil- ity and performance.  The standard-library support for techniques for using iterators, such as tag dispatch, comes in the form of a simple class template iterator_traits from    §33.1.3 .  This allows simple deﬁ- nitions of the type functions used in sort  :  template   using Iterator_type = typename C::iterator;     C’siterator type  template   using Iterator_category = typename std::iterator_traits ::iterator_category;      Iter’scategor y  If you don’t want to know what kind of ‘‘compile-time type magic’’ is used to provide the standard- library features, you are free to ignore facilities such as iterator_traits. But then you can’t use the techniques they support to improve your own code.   126  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  5.4.2.2  Type Predicates  A standard-library  type  predicate  is  a  simple  type  function  that  answers  a  fundamental  question about types. For example:  bool b1 = Is_arithmetic   ; bool b2 = Is_arithmetic   ;     yes, int is an arithmetic type    no,std::str ingis not an arithmetic type  These predicates are found in   and described in §35.4.1. Other examples are is_class, is_pod, is_literal_type, has_virtual_destructor, and is_base_of. They are most useful when we write templates.  For example:  static_assert Is_arithmetic   , "Sorr y, I only suppor t complex of arithmetic types" ;    ...  To improve readability compared to using the standard library directly, I deﬁned a type function:  template  class complex {  Scalar re, im;  public:  };  }  template  constexpr bool Is_arithmetic   {  return std::is_arithmetic ::value ;  Older programs use ::value directly instead of   , but I consider that quite ugly and it exposes imple- mentation details.  5.4.3 pair and tuple Often, we need some data that is just data; that is, a collection of values, rather than an object of a class with a well-deﬁned semantics and an invariant for its value  §2.4.3.2, §13.4 . In such cases, we could deﬁne a simple struct with an appropriate set of appropriately named members. Alterna- tively, we could  let  the  standard  library  write  the  deﬁnition  for  us. For example,  the  standard- library algorithm equal_range  §32.6.1  returns a pair of iterators specifying a sub-sequence meeting a predicate:  template   pair  equal_range Forward_iterator ﬁrst, Forward_iterator last, const T& val, Compare cmp ;  Given a sorted sequence [ﬁrst:last , equal_range   will return the pair representing the subsequence that matches the predicate cmp. We can use that to search in a sorted sequence of Records:  auto rec_eq = [] const Record& r1, const Record& r2  { return r1.name<r2.name;};   compare names  void f const vector & v  {     assume that v is sorted on its "name" ﬁeld  auto er = equal_range v.begin  ,v.end  ,Record{"Reg"},rec_eq ;   Section 5.4.3  pair and tuple  127  for  auto p = er.ﬁrst; p!=er.second; ++p   cout << ∗p;      printall equal records    assume that << is deﬁned for Record  }  }  The ﬁrst member of a pair is called ﬁrst and the second member is called second. This naming is not particularly creative and may look a bit odd at ﬁrst, but such consistent naming is a boon when we want to write generic code.  The  standard-library pair  from    is quite  frequently  used  in  the  standard  library  and elsewhere.  A pair provides operators, such as =, ==, and <, if its elements do. The make_pair   func- tion makes it easy to create a pair without explicitly mentioning its type  §34.2.4.1 . For example:  void f vector & v  {  auto pp = make_pair v.begin  ,2 ;     ...     pp is a pair ::iterator,int>  If you need more than two elements  or less , you can use tuple  from  ; §34.2.4.2 .  A tuple is a heterogeneous sequence of elements; for example:  tuple  t2 "Sild",123, 3.14 ;     the type is explicitly speciﬁed  auto t = make_tuple string "Herring" ,10, 1.23 ;     the type is deduced    tisatuple   string s = get  t ;    get ﬁrst element of tuple int x = get  t ; double d = get  t ;  The elements of a tuple are numbered  starting with zero , rather than named the way elements of pairs are  ﬁrst and second .  To get compile-time selection of elements, I must unfortunately use the ugly get  t , rather than get t,1  or t[1]  §28.5.2 .  Like pairs, tuples can be assigned and compared if their elements can be. A pair is common in interfaces because often we want to return more than one value, such as a result and an indicator of the quality of that result. It is less common to need three or more parts to a result, so tuples are more often found in the implementations of generic algorithms.  5.5  Regular Expressions Regular  expressions  are  a  powerful  tool  for  text  processing. They provide  a  way  to  simply  and tersely describe patterns in text  e.g., a U.S. ZIP code such as TX 77845, or an ISO-style date, such as 2009−06−07  and to efﬁciently ﬁnd such patterns in text.  In  , the standard library provides support for regular expressions in the form of the std::regex class and its supporting functions. To give a taste of the style of the regex library, let us deﬁne and print a pattern:  regex pat  R" \w{2}\s∗\d{5} −\d{4} ? " ;  cout << "pattern: " << pat << '\n';     ZIP code pattern: XXddddd-dddd and var iants   128  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  People who have used regular expressions in just about any language will ﬁnd \w{2}\s∗\d{5} −\d{4} ? familiar. It speciﬁes a pattern starting with two letters \w{2} optionally followed by some space \s∗ followed by ﬁve digits \d{5} and optionally followed by a dash and four digits −\d{4}. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, this may be a good time to learn about them  [Stroustrup,2009], [Maddock,2009], [Friedl,1997] . Regular expressions are summarized in §37.1.1.  To express the pattern, I use a raw string literal  §7.3.2.1  starting with R"  and terminated by  ".  This allows backslashes and quotes to be used directly in the string.  The simplest way of using a pattern is to search for it in a stream:  int lineno = 0; for  string line; getline cin,line ;  {  ++lineno; smatch matches;  if  regex_search line ,matches,pat        read into line buffer     matched strings go here    search for pat in line  cout << lineno << ": " << matches[0] << '\n';  The regex_search line ,matches,pat  searches the line for anything that matches the regular expression stored  in pat and  if  it  ﬁnds  any matches,  it  stores  them  in matches. If no match  was  found, regex_search line ,matches,pat  returns false. The matches variable  is  of  type smatch. The  ‘‘s’’ stands for ‘‘sub’’ and an smatch is a vector of sub-matches. The ﬁrst element, here matches[0], is the complete match.  For a more complete description see Chapter 37.  5.6  Math C++  wasn’t designed  primarily  with  numerical  computation  in  mind. However,  C++  is  heavily used for numerical computation and the standard library reﬂects that.  5.6.1  Mathematical Functions and Algorithms In  , we ﬁnd  the  ‘‘usual  mathematical  functions,’’  such  as sqrt  , log  , and sin   for  argu- ments of type ﬂoat, double, and long double  §40.3 .  Complex number versions of these functions are found in    §40.4 .  In  , we ﬁnd a small set of generalized numerical algorithms, such as accumulate  . For  list  lst {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9999.99999}; auto s = accumulate lst.begin  ,lst.end  ,0.0 ;     calculate the sum cout << s << '\n';    print10014.9999  These  algorithms  work  for  every  standard-library  sequence  and  can  have  operations  supplied  as arguments  §40.6 .  }  }  example:  void f   {   Section 5.6.2  Complex Numbers  129  5.6.2  Complex Numbers The  standard  library  supports  a  family  of  complex number  types  along  the  lines  of  the complex class described in §2.3. To  support complex numbers where the scalars are single-precision ﬂoat- ing-point  numbers   ﬂoats ,  double-precision  ﬂoating-point  numbers   doubles ,  etc.,  the  standard library complex is a template:  The  usual  arithmetic  operations  and  the  most  common  mathematical  functions  are  supported  for complex numbers.  For example:  template  class complex { public:  complex const Scalar& re ={}, const Scalar& im ={} ;    ...  };  }  void f complex  ﬂ, complex  db  {  complex  ld {ﬂ+sqrt db }; db += ﬂ∗3; ﬂ = pow 1 ﬂ,2 ;    ...  The sqrt   and pow    exponentiation  functions are among the usual mathematical functions deﬁned in  . For more details, see §40.4.  5.6.3  Random Numbers Random  numbers  are  useful  in  many contexts,  such  as  testing,  games,  simulation,  and  security. The diversity of application areas is reﬂected in the wide selection of random number generators provided by the standard library in  . A random number generator consists of two parts:  [1]  [2]   an engine that produces a sequence of random or pseudo-random values. a distribution that maps those values into a mathematical distribution in a range.  Examples  of  distributions  are uniform_int_distribution  where  all  integers  produced  are  equally likely , normal_distribution  ‘‘the  bell  curve’’ ,  and exponential_distribution  exponential  growth ; each for some speciﬁed range. For example:  using my_engine = default_random_engine; using my_distribution = uniform_int_distribution ;      type of engine    type of distribution  my_engine re {}; my_distribution one_to_six {1,6}; auto die = bind one_to_six,re ;     the default engine    distribution that maps to the ints 1..6    makeagenerator  int x = die  ;     roll the die: x becomes a value in [1:6]  The  standard-library  function bind   makes  a  function  object  that  will  invoke  its  ﬁrst  argument  here, one_to_six  giv en its second argument  here, re  as its argument  §33.5.1 . Thus a call die   is equivalent to a call one_to_six re .   130  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  Thanks to its uncompromising attention to generality and performance one expert has deemed the standard-library random number component ‘‘what every random number library wants to be when it grows up.’’  Howev er,  it can hardly be deemed ‘‘novice friendly.’’ The using statements makes what is being done a bit more obvious.  Instead, I could just have written:  auto die = bind uniform_int_distribution {1,6}, default_random_engine{} ;  Which version is the more readable depends entirely on the context and the reader.  For novices  of any background  the fully general interface to the random number library can be a serious  obstacle. A simple  uniform  random  number  generator  is  often  sufﬁcient  to  get  started. For example:  Rand_int rnd {1,10}; int x = rnd  ;     xisanumber in [1:10]     makearandom number generator for [1:10]  So, how could we get that? We hav e to get something like die   inside a class Rand_int:  class Rand_int { public:  Rand_int int low, int high  :dist{low,high} { } int operator     { return dist re ; }     draw anint  default_random_engine re; uniform_int_distribution  dist;  That deﬁnition is still ‘‘expert level,’’  but the use of Rand_int   is manageable in the ﬁrst week of a C++ course for novices.  For example:  Rand_int rnd {0,4};     makeaunifor mrandom number generator  vector  histogram 5 ; for  int i=0; i!=200; ++i   ++histogram[rnd  ];      makeavector of size5     ﬁll histogramwith the frequencies of numbers [0:4]  for  int i = 0; i!=mn.size  ; ++i  {     writeout a bar graph  cout << i << '\t'; for  int j=0; j!=mn[i]; ++j  cout << '∗'; cout << endl;  The output is a  reassuringly boring  uniform distribution  with reasonable statistical variation :  ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗  private:  };  int main   {  }  }  0 1 2 3 4   Section 5.6.3  Random Numbers  131  There is no standard graphics library for C++, so I use ‘‘ASCII graphics.’’  Obviously, there are lots of  open  source  and  commercial  graphics  and  GUI  libraries  for  C++,  but  in  this  book  I’ll  restrict myself to ISO standard facilities.  For more information about random numbers, see §40.7.  5.6.4  Vector Arithmetic The vector described in §4.4.1 was designed to be a general mechanism for holding values, to be ﬂexible, and to ﬁt into the architecture of containers, iterators, and algorithms. However, it does not support mathematical vector operations. Adding such operations to vector would be easy, but its generality  and  ﬂexibility  precludes  optimizations  that  are  often  considered  essential  for  serious numerical work.  Consequently, the standard library provides  in    a vector-like template, called valarray, that is less general and more amenable to optimization for numerical computation:  template  class valarray {     ...  };  The  usual  arithmetic  operations  and  the  most  common  mathematical  functions  are  supported  for valarrays.  For example:  void f valarray & a1, valarray & a2  {  valarray  a = a1∗3.14+a2 a1;  a2 += a1∗3.14; a = abs a ; double d = a2[7];    ...  }     numer icarray operators *, +,  , and =  For more details, see §40.5. In particular, valarray offers stride access to help implement multidi- mensional computations.  5.6.5  Numeric Limits In  , the standard library provides classes that describe the properties of built-in types – such as the maximum exponent of a ﬂoat or the number of bytes in an int; see §40.2. For example, we can assert that a char is signed:  static_assert numeric_limits ::is_signed,"unsigned characters!" ; static_assert 100000 ::max  ,"small ints!" ;  Note that the second assert  only  works because numeric_limits ::max   is a constexpr function  §2.2.3, §10.4 .   132  A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities  Chapter 5  5.7  Advice [1]  Use resource handles to manage resources  RAII ; §5.2.

In this book, references to the standard are of the form §iso.23.3.6.1. In cases where the text of this book  is  considered  imprecise,  incomplete,  or  possibly  wrong,  consult  the  standard. But  don’t expect the standard to be a tutorial or to be easily accessible by non-experts.  Strictly  adhering  to  the  C++  language  and  library  standard  doesn’t by itself  guarantee  good code or even portable code. The standard doesn’t say whether a piece of code is good or bad; it simply says what a programmer can and cannot rely on from an implementation. It is easy to write perfectly awful standard-conforming programs, and most real-world programs rely on features that the  standard  does  not  guarantee  to  be  portable. They do so to access  system  interfaces  and   136  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  hardware features that cannot be expressed directly in C++ or require reliance on speciﬁc imple- mentation details.  Many important  things  are  deemed implementation-deﬁned by  the  standard. This  means  that each implementation must provide a speciﬁc, well-deﬁned behavior for a construct and that behav- ior must be documented. For example:  unsigned char c1 = 64; unsigned char c2 = 1256;     well deﬁned: a char has at least 8 bits and can alwayshold 64    implementation-deﬁned: truncation if a char has only 8 bits  The initialization of c1 is well deﬁned because a char must be at least 8 bits. However, the behavior of the initialization of c2 is implementation-deﬁned because the number of bits in a char is imple- mentation-deﬁned.  If the char has only 8 bits, the value 1256 will be truncated to 232  §10.5.2.1 . Most implementation-deﬁned features relate to differences in the hardware used to run a program.  Other  behaviors  are unspeciﬁed; that  is,  a  range  of  possible  behaviors  are  acceptable,  but  the implementer is not obliged to specify which actually occur. Usually, the reason for deeming some- thing unspeciﬁed is that the exact behavior is unpredictable for fundamental reasons. For example, the exact value returned by new is unspeciﬁed. So is the value of a variable assigned to from two threads unless some synchronization mechanism has been employed to prevent a data race  §41.2 . When  writing  real-world  programs,  it  is  usually  necessary  to  rely  on  implementation-deﬁned behavior. Such behavior is the price we pay for the ability to operate effectively on a large range of systems.  For example, C++ would have been much simpler if all characters had been 8 bits and all pointers 32 bits. However, 16-bit and 32-bit character sets are not uncommon, and machines with 16-bit and 64-bit pointers are in wide use.  To maximize portability, it is wise to be explicit about what implementation-deﬁned features we rely on and to isolate the more subtle examples in clearly marked sections of a program. A typical example of this practice is to present all dependencies on hardware sizes in the form of constants and type deﬁnitions in some header ﬁle. To  support such techniques, the standard library provides numeric_limits  §40.2 .  Many assumptions about implementation-deﬁned features can be checked by stating them as static assertions  §2.4.3.3 . For example:  static_assert 4<=sizeof int ,"siz eof int  too small" ;  Undeﬁned behavior is nastier. A construct is deemed undeﬁned by the standard if no reasonable behavior is required by an implementation. Typically, some obvious implementation technique will cause a program using an undeﬁned feature to behave very badly. For example:  const int size = 4∗1024; char page[siz e];  void f   {  }  page[siz e+size] = 7;    undeﬁned  Plausible outcomes of this code fragment include overwriting unrelated data and triggering a hard- ware  error exception.  An implementation  is  not  required  to  choose  among  plausible  outcomes. Where  powerful  optimizers  are  used,  the  actual  effects  of  undeﬁned  behavior  can  become  quite unpredictable.  If a set of plausible and easily implementable alternatives exist, a feature is deemed   Section 6.1  The ISO C++ Standard  137  unspeciﬁed or implementation-deﬁned rather than undeﬁned.  It is worth spending considerable time and effort to ensure that a program does not use some-  thing deemed unspeciﬁed or undeﬁned by the standard. In many cases, tools exist to help do this.  6.1.1  Implementations A C++ implementation can be either hosted or freestanding  §iso.17.6.1.3 .  A hosted implementa- tion includes all the standard-library facilities as described in the standard  §30.2  and in this book. A freestanding implementation may provide fewer standard-library facilities, as long as the follow- ing are provided:  Freestanding Implementation Headers  Types Implementation properties Integer types Start and termination Dynamic memory management Type identiﬁcation Exception handling Initializer lists Other run-time support Type traits Atomics                                 §10.3.1 §40.2 §43.7 §43.7 §11.2.3 §22.5 §30.4.1.1 §30.3.1 §12.2.4, §44.3.4 §35.4.1 §41.3  Freestanding  implementations  are  meant  for  code  running  with  only  the  most  minimal  operating system support. Many implementations also provide a  non-standard  option for not using excep- tions for really minimal, close-to-the-hardware,  programs.  6.1.2  The Basic Source Character Set The C++ standard and the examples in this book are written using the basic source character set consisting of the letters, digits, graphical characters, and whitespace characters from the U.S. vari- ant of the international 7-bit character set ISO 646-1983 called ASCII  ANSI3.4-1968 . This can cause problems for people who use C++ in an environment with a different character set:   cid:129  ASCII contains punctuation characters and operator symbols  such as ], {, and !  that are not  available in some character sets.   cid:129  We need  a  notation  for  characters  that  do  not  have  a  convenient  character  representation   such as newline and ‘‘the character with value 17’’ .   cid:129  ASCII doesn’t contain characters  such as ñ, Þ, and Æ  that are used for writing languages  other than English.  To  use  an  extended  character  set  for  source  code,  a  programming  environment  can  map  the extended character set into the basic source character set in one of several ways, for example, by using universal character names  §6.2.3.2 .   138  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  6.2  Types Consider:  x = y+f 2 ;  For this to make sense in a C++ program, the names x, y, and f must be suitably declared. That is, the  programmer  must  specify  that  entities  named x, y, and f exist  and  that  they are  of  types  for which =  assignment , +  addition , and     function call , respectively, are meaningful.  Every name  identiﬁer  in a C++ program has a type associated with it. This type determines what operations can be applied to the name  that is, to the entity referred to by the name  and how such operations are interpreted. For example:  ﬂoat x; int y = 7; ﬂoat f int ;     xisaﬂoating-point var iable    yisaninteger var iable with the initial value 7    fisafunction taking an argument of type int and returning a ﬂoating-point number  These declarations would make the example meaningful. Because y is declared to be an int, it can be assigned to, used as an operand for +, etc.  On the other hand, f is declared to be a function that takes an int as its argument, so it can be called given the interger 2.  This  chapter  presents  fundamental  types   §6.2.1   and  declarations   §6.3 .  Its  examples  just demonstrate  language  features;  they are  not  intended  to  do  anything  useful. More  extensive  and realistic  examples  are  saved for  later  chapters. This  chapter  simply  provides  the  most  basic  ele- ments from which C++ programs are constructed. You must know these elements, plus the termi- nology and simple syntax that go with them, in order to complete a real project in C++ and espe- cially to read code written by others. However, a thorough understanding of every detail mentioned in this chapter is not a requirement for understanding the following chapters. Consequently, you may prefer to skim through this chapter, observing the major concepts, and return later as the need for understanding more details arises.  6.2.1  Fundamental Types C++  has  a  set  of fundamental  types corresponding  to  the  most  common  basic  storage  units  of  a computer and the most common ways of using them to hold data:  §6.2.2 A Boolean type  bool  §6.2.3 Character types  such as char and wchar_t  §6.2.4 Integer types  such as int and long long  §6.2.5 Floating-point types  such as double and long double  §6.2.7 A type, void, used to signify the absence of information  From these types, we can construct other types using declarator operators:  Pointer types  such as int∗  §7.2 §7.3 Array types  such as char[]  §7.7 Reference types  such as double& and vector &&   In addition, a user can deﬁne additional types:  §8.2 Data structures and classes  Chapter 16  §8.4  Enumeration types for representing speciﬁc sets of values  enum and enum class    Section 6.2.1  Fundamental Types   139  The Boolean, character, and integer types are collectively called integral  types. The integral and ﬂoating-point types are collectively called arithmetic types. Enumerations and classes  Chapter 16  are called user-deﬁned types because they must be deﬁned by users rather than being available for use without previous declaration, the way fundamental types are. In contrast, fundamental types, pointers, and references are collectively referred to as built-in types. The standard library provides many user-deﬁned types  Chapter 4, Chapter 5 .  The integral and ﬂoating-point types are provided in a variety of sizes to give the programmer a choice of the amount of storage consumed, the precision, and the range available for computations  §6.2.8 .  The assumption is that a computer provides bytes for holding characters, words for hold- ing  and  computing  integer  values,  some  entity  most  suitable  for  ﬂoating-point  computation,  and addresses  for  referring  to  those  entities. The  C++  fundamental  types  together  with  pointers  and arrays present these machine-level notions to the programmer in a reasonably implementation-inde- pendent manner.  For most applications, we could use bool for logical values, char for characters, int for integer values,  and double for  ﬂoating-point  values.  The remaining  fundamental  types  are  variations  for optimizations, special needs, and compatibility that are best ignored until such needs arise.  6.2.2  Booleans A Boolean, bool, can have  one of the two values true or false. A Boolean is used to express the results of logical operations. For example:  void f int a, int b  {  bool b1 {a==b};    ...  }  icate .  For example:  bool is_open File∗ ;  If a and b have the same value, b1 becomes true; otherwise, b1 becomes false.  A common use of bool is as the type of the result of a function that tests some condition  a pred-  bool greater int a, int b  { return a>b; }  By  deﬁnition, true has  the  value 1 when  converted  to  an  integer  and false has  the  value 0. Con- versely, integers can be implicitly converted to bool values: nonzero integers convert to true and 0 converts to false. For example:  bool b1 = 7; bool b2 {7};     7!=0, so b becomes true    error :narrowing  §2.2.2, §10.5   int i1 = true; int i2 {true};     i1 becomes 1    i2 becomes 1  If you prefer to use the {}-initializer syntax to prevent narrowing, yet still want to convert an int to a bool, you can be explicit:   140  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  void f int i  {  bool b {i!=0};    ...  };  bool a = true; bool b = true;  void g int∗ p  {     ...  }  }  In  arithmetic  and  logical  expressions, bools are  converted  to ints;  integer  arithmetic  and  logical operations are performed on the converted values.  If the result needs to be converted back to bool, a 0 is converted to false and a nonzero value is converted to true. For example:  bool x = a+b; bool y = ab; bool z = a−b;     a+b is 2, so x becomes true    ab is 1, so y becomes true  "" means "or"     a-b is 0, so z becomes false  A pointer  can  be  implicitly  converted  to  a bool  §10.5.2.5 .  A non-null  pointer  converts  to true; pointers with the value nullptr convert to false. For example:  bool b = p; bool b2 {p!=nullptr};      narrows to true or false    explicit test against nullptr  if  p  {     equivalent to p!=nullptr  I prefer if  p  over if  p!=nullptr  because it more directly expresses the notion ‘‘if p is valid’’ and also because it is shorter. The shorter form leaves fewer opportunities for mistakes.  6.2.3  Character Types There are many character sets and character set encodings in use. C++ provides a variety of char- acter types that reﬂect that – often bewildering – variety:   cid:129    cid:129   char: The default character type, used for program text.  A char is used for the implementa- tion’s character set and is usually 8 bits. signed char: Like char, but guaranteed to be signed, that is, capable of holding both positive and negative values. unsigned char: Like char, but guaranteed to be unsigned.   cid:129   cid:129  wchar_t: Provided to hold characters of a larger character set such as Unicode  see §7.3.2.2 . The size of wchar_t is implementation-deﬁned and large enough to hold the largest character set supported by the implementation’s locale  Chapter 39 . char16_t: A type for holding 16-bit character sets, such as UTF-16. char32_t: A type for holding 32-bit character sets, such as UTF-32.   cid:129   cid:129   These are six distinct types  despite the fact that the _t sufﬁx is often used to denote aliases; §6.5 . On each implementation, the char type will be identical to that of either signed  char or unsigned   Section 6.2.3  Character Types   141  char, but these three names are still considered separate types.  A char variable can hold a character of the implementation’s character set. For example:  char ch = 'a';  Almost universally, a char has 8 bits so that it can hold one of 256 different values.  Typically, the character set is a variant of ISO-646, for example ASCII, thus providing the characters appearing on your keyboard.  Many problems arise from the fact that this set of characters is only partially standardized.  Serious  variations  occur  between  character  sets  supporting  different  natural  languages  and between character sets supporting the same natural language in different ways.  Here, we are inter- ested only in how such differences affect the rules of C++. The larger and more interesting issue of how to program in a multilingual, multi-character-set environment is beyond the scope of this book, although it is alluded to in several places  §6.2.3, §36.2.1, Chapter 39 .  It  is  safe  to  assume  that  the  implementation  character  set  includes  the  decimal  digits,  the  26 alphabetic  characters  of  English,  and  some  of  the  basic  punctuation  characters. It  is not safe  to assume that:   cid:129  There are no more than 127 characters in an 8-bit character set  e.g., some sets provide 255   cid:129  There  are  no  more  alphabetic  characters  than  English  provides   most  European  languages   cid:129  The alphabetic characters are contiguous  EBCDIC leaves a gap between 'i' and 'j' .  cid:129  Every character used to write C++ is available  e.g., some national character sets do not pro-  characters .  provide more, e.g., æ, þ, and ß .  vide {, }, [, ], , and \ .   cid:129  A char ﬁts in 1 byte. There are embedded processors without byte accessing hardware for which a char is 4 bytes. Also, one could reasonably use a 16-bit Unicode encoding for the basic chars.  Whenever possible, we should avoid making assumptions about the representation of objects. This general rule applies even to characters.  Each character has an integer value in the character set used by the implementation. For exam- ple, the value of 'b' is 98 in the ASCII character set. Here is a loop that outputs the the integer value of any character you care to input:  void intval   {  }  for  char c; cin >> c;    cout << "the value of '" << c << "' is " << int{c} << '\n';  The  notation int{c} gives the  integer  value  for  a  character c  ‘‘the int we  can  construct  from c’’ . The possibility of converting a char to an integer raises the question: is a char signed or unsigned? The 256 values represented by an 8-bit byte can be interpreted as the values 0 to 255 or as the val- ues −127 to 127. No, not −128 to 127 as one might expect: the C++ standard leaves open the possi- bility  of  one’s-complement  hardware  and  that  eliminates  one  value;  thus,  a  use  of −128 is  non- portable.  Unfortunately, the  choice  of  signed  or  unsigned  for  a  plain char is  implementation- deﬁned.  C++ provides two types for which the answer is deﬁnite: signed  char, which can hold at least  the  values −127 to 127, and unsigned  char, which  can  hold  at  least  the  values 0 to 255.   142  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  Fortunately, the difference matters only for values outside the 0 to 127 range, and the most common characters are within that range.  Values  outside  that  range  stored  in  a  plain char can  lead  to  subtle  portability  problems. See  §6.2.3.1 if you need to use more than one type of char or if you store integers in char variables.  Note that the character types are integral types  §6.2.1  so that arithmetic and bitwise logical  operations  §10.3  apply. For example:  void digits   {  for  int i=0; i!=10; ++i   cout   '0'+i ;  }  }  This is a way of writing the ten digits to cout. The character literal '0' is converted to its integer value and i is added. The resulting int is then converted to a char and written to cout. Plain '0'+i is an int, so if I had left out the static_cast , the output would have been something like 48, 49, and so on, rather than 0, 1, and so on.  6.2.3.1  Signed and Unsigned Characters  It is implementation-deﬁned whether a plain char is considered signed or unsigned. This opens the possibility for some nasty surprises and implementation dependencies. For example:  char c = 255; int i = c;     255 is ‘‘all ones,’ ’hexadecimal 0xFF  What will be the value of i? Unfortunately, the answer is undeﬁned. On an implementation with 8-bit bytes, the answer depends on the meaning of the ‘‘all ones’’ char bit pattern when extended into an int. On a machine where a char is unsigned, the answer is 255. On a machine where a char is signed, the answer is −1. In this case, the compiler might warn about the conversion of the literal 255 to the char value −1. Howev er, C++ does not offer a general mechanism for detecting this kind of problem. One solution is to avoid plain char and use the speciﬁc char types only. Unfortunately, some standard-library functions, such as strcmp  , take plain chars only  §43.4 .  A char must behave identically to either a signed char or an unsigned char. Howev er, the three  char types are distinct, so you can’t mix pointers to different char types.  For example:  void f char c, signed char sc, unsigned char uc  {  char∗ pc = &uc; signed char∗ psc = pc; unsigned char∗ puc = pc; psc = puc;     error :no pointer conversion    error :no pointer conversion    error :no pointer conversion    error :no pointer conversion  Variables of the three char types can be freely assigned to each other. Howev er,  assigning a too- large value to a signed char  §10.5.2.1  is still undeﬁned. For example:  void g char c, signed char sc, unsigned char uc  {  c = 255;      implementation-deﬁned if plain chars are signed and have 8 bits   Section 6.2.3.1  Signed and Unsigned Characters  143  c = sc;  c = uc;  sc = uc; uc = sc; sc = c; uc = c;     OK    implementation-deﬁned if plain chars are signed and if uc’svalue is too large    implementation deﬁned if uc’svalue is too large    OK: conversion to unsigned    implementation-deﬁned if plain chars are unsigned and if c’svalue is too large    OK: conversion to unsigned  }  To be concrete, assume that a char is 8 bits:  signed char sc = −160; unsigned char uc = sc; cout << uc;     uc == 116  because 256-160==116     print't'  char count[256]; ++count[sc];  ++count[uc];      assume 8-bit chars    likely disaster:out-of-range access    OK  None of these potential problems and confusions occur if you use plain char throughout and avoid negative character values.  6.2.3.2  Character Literals  A character literal is a single character enclosed in single quotes, for example, 'a' and '0'. The type of a character literal is char. A character literal can be implicitly converted to its integer value in the character set of the machine on which the C++ program is to run. For example, if you are run- ning on a machine using the ASCII character set, the value of '0' is 48. The use of character literals rather than decimal notation makes programs more portable.  A few characters have standard names that use the backslash, \ , as an escape character:  Name   ASCII Name  C++ Name  Newline Horizontal tab Vertical tab Backspace Carriage return Form feed Alert Backslash Question mark Single quote Double quote Octal number Hexadecimal number  NL  LF  HT VT BS CR FF BEL \ ? ’ " ooo hhh  \n \t \v \b \r \f \a \\ \? \’ \" \ooo \xhhh ...  Despite their appearance, these are single characters.  We  can represent a character from the implementation character set as a one-, two-, or three- digit  octal  number   \ followed  by  octal  digits   or  as  a  hexadecimal  number   \x followed  by   144  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  hexadecimal  digits . There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  hexadecimal  digits  in  the  sequence. A sequence of octal or hexadecimal digits is terminated by the ﬁrst character that is not an octal digit or a hexadecimal digit, respectively. For example:  Octal  Hexadecimal  Decimal  ASCII  '\6'  '\60'  '\137'   '\x6' '\x30' '\x05f'  6 48 95  ACK '0' '_'  This makes it possible to represent every character in the machine’s character set and, in particular, to embed such characters in character strings  see §7.3.2 . Using any numeric notation for charac- ters makes a program nonportable across machines with different character sets.  It is possible to enclose more than one character in a character literal, for example, 'ab'. Such uses are archaic, implementation-dependent, and best avoided.  The type of such a multicharacter literal is int.  When embedding a numeric constant in a string using the octal notation, it is wise always to use three  digits  for  the  number. The  notation  is  hard  enough  to  read  without  having  to  worry  about whether or not the character after a constant is a digit. For hexadecimal constants, use two digits. Consider these examples:  char v1[] = "a\xah\129"; char v2[] = "a\xah\127"; char v3[] = "a\xad\127"; char v4[] = "a\xad\0127";     6chars: 'a' '\xa' 'h' '\12' '9' '\0'    5chars: 'a' '\xa' 'h' '\127' '\0'    4chars: 'a' '\xad' '\127' '\0'    5chars: 'a' '\xad' '\012' '7' '\0'  Wide  character  literals  are  of  the  form L'ab' and  are  of  type wchar_t. The  number  of  characters between the quotes and their meanings are implementation-deﬁned.  A C++  program  can  manipulate  character  sets  that  are  much  richer  than  the  127-character ASCII  set,  such  as  Unicode. Literals  of  such  larger  character  sets  are  presented  as  sequences  of four or eight hexadecimal digits preceded by a U or a u. For example:  U'\UFADEBEEF' u'\uDEAD' u'\xDEAD'  The shorter notation u'\uXXXX' is equivalent to U'\U0000XXXX' for any hexadecimal digit X. A num- ber of hexadecimal digits different from four or eight is a lexical error. The  meaning of the hexa- decimal  number  is  deﬁned  by  the  ISO IEC  10646  standard  and  such  values  are  called universal character  names. In the  C++  standard,  universal  character  names  are  described  in  §iso.2.2, §iso.2.3, §iso.2.14.3, §iso.2.14.5, and §iso.E.  6.2.4  Integer Types Like char, each integer type comes in three forms: ‘‘plain’’ int, signed int, and unsigned int. In addi- tion, integers come in four sizes: short int, ‘‘plain’’ int, long int, and long long int. A long int can be referred to as plain long, and a long long int can be referred to as plain long long. Similarly, short is a synonym for short int, unsigned for unsigned  int, and signed for signed  int. No, there is no long short int equivalent to int.   Section 6.2.4  Integer Types   145  The unsigned integer types are ideal for uses that treat storage as a bit array. Using an unsigned instead  of  an int to  gain  one  more  bit  to  represent  positive  integers  is  almost  never a good  idea. Attempts to ensure that some values are positive by declaring variables unsigned will typically be defeated by the implicit conversion rules  §10.5.1, §10.5.2.1 .  Unlike plain chars, plain ints are always signed. The signed int types are simply more explicit  synonyms for their plain int counterparts, rather than different types.  If you need more detailed control over integer sizes, you can use aliases from    §43.7 , such  as int64_t  a  signed  integer  with  exactly  64  bits , uint_fast16_t  an  unsigned  integer  with exactly 8 bits, supposedly the fastest such integer , and int_least32_t  a signed integer with at least 32 bits, just like plain int .  The plain integer types have well-deﬁned minimal sizes  §6.2.8 , so the   are sometimes redundant and can be overused.  In addition to the standard integer types, an implementation may provide extended integer types  signed  and  unsigned . These  types  must  behave  like integers  and  are  considered  integer  types when  considering  conversions  and  integer  literal  values,  but  they usually  have  greater  range  occupy more space .  6.2.4.1  Integer Literals  Integer literals come in three guises: decimal, octal, and hexadecimal.  Decimal literals are the most commonly used and look as you would expect them to:  7 1234  976  12345678901234567890  The compiler ought to warn about literals that are too long to represent, but an error is only guaran- teed for {} initializers  §6.3.5 .  A literal starting with zero followed by x or X  0x or 0X  is a hexadecimal  base 16  number. A  literal starting with zero but not followed by x or X is an octal  base 8  number. For example:  Decimal  Octal  Hexadecimal  2 63  83   0 02 077 0123  0x0 0x2 0x3f 0x63  The letters a, b, c, d, e, and f, or their uppercase equivalents, are used to represent 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively. Octal and hexadecimal notations are most useful for expressing bit patterns. Using these notations to express genuine numbers can lead to surprises. For example, on a machine on which an int is represented as a two’s complement 16-bit integer, 0xffff is the negative decimal number −1. Had more bits been used to represent an integer, it would have been the positive deci- mal number 65535.  The sufﬁx U can be used to write explicitly unsigned literals.  Similarly, the sufﬁx L can be used  to write explicitly long literals.  For example, 3 is an int, 3U is an unsigned int, and 3L is a long int.  Combinations of sufﬁxes are allowed.  For example:  cout << 0xF0UL << ' ' << 0LU << '\n';   146  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  If no sufﬁx is provided, the compiler gives an integer literal a suitable type based on its value and the implementation’s integer sizes  §6.2.4.2 .  It is a good idea to limit the use of nonobvious constants to a few well-commented const  §7.5 ,  constexpr  §10.4 , and enumerator  §8.4  initializers.  6.2.4.2  Types of Integer Literals  In general, the type of an integer literal depends on its form, value, and sufﬁx:   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   If it is decimal and has no sufﬁx, it has the ﬁrst of these types in which its value can be rep- resented: int, long int, long long int. If it is octal or hexadecimal and has no sufﬁx, it has the ﬁrst of these types in which its value can be represented: int, unsigned int, long int, unsigned long int, long long int, unsigned long long int. If it is sufﬁxed by u or U, its type is the ﬁrst of these types in which its value can be repre- sented: unsigned int, unsigned long int, unsigned long long int. If it is decimal and sufﬁxed by l or L, its type is the ﬁrst of these types in which its value can be represented: long int, long long int. If it is octal or hexadecimal and sufﬁxed by l or L, its type is the ﬁrst of these types in which its value can be represented: long int, unsigned long int, long long int, unsigned long long int. If it is sufﬁxed by ul, lu, uL, Lu, Ul, lU, UL, or LU, its type is the ﬁrst of these types in which its value can be represented: unsigned long int, unsigned long long int. If it is decimal and is sufﬁxed by ll or LL, its type is long long int. If it is octal or hexadecimal and is sufﬁxed by ll or LL, its type is the ﬁrst of these types in which its value can be represented: long long int, unsigned long long int. If it is sufﬁxed by llu, llU, ull, Ull, LLu, LLU, uLL, or ULL, its type is unsigned long long int.  For example, 100000 is of type int on a machine with 32-bit ints but of type long  int on a machine with 16-bit ints and 32-bit longs.  Similarly, 0XA000 is of type int on a machine with 32-bit ints but of  type unsigned  int on  a  machine  with  16-bit ints.  These implementation  dependencies  can  be avoided  by  using  sufﬁxes: 100000L is  of  type long  int on  all  machines  and 0XA000U is  of  type unsigned int on all machines.  6.2.5  Floating-Point Types The ﬂoating-point types represent ﬂoating-point numbers. A ﬂoating-point number is an approxi- mation of a real number represented in a ﬁxed amount of memory. There are three ﬂoating-point types: ﬂoat  single-precision , double  double-precision , and long double  extended-precision .  The  exact  meaning  of  single-,  double-,  and  extended-precision  is  implementation-deﬁned. Choosing  the  right  precision  for  a  problem  where  the  choice  matters  requires  signiﬁcant  under- standing of ﬂoating-point computation. If you don’t hav e that understanding, get advice, take the time to learn, or use double and hope for the best.  6.2.5.1  Floating-Point Literals  By default, a ﬂoating-point literal is of type double. Again, a compiler ought to warn about ﬂoat- ing-point literals that are too large to be represented. Here are some ﬂoating-point literals:   Section 6.2.5.1  Floating-Point Literals  147  1.23   .23  0.23  1.  1.0  1.2e10  1.23e−15  Note that a space cannot occur in the middle of a ﬂoating-point literal. For example, 65.43 e−21 is not a ﬂoating-point literal but rather four separate lexical tokens  causing a syntax error :  If you want a ﬂoating-point literal of type ﬂoat, you can deﬁne one using the sufﬁx f or F:  If you want a ﬂoating-point literal of type long double, you can deﬁne one using the sufﬁx l or L:  65.43  e  −  21  3.14159265f  2.0f  2.997925F  2.9e−3f  3.14159265L  2.0L  2.997925L  2.9e−3L  6.2.6  Preﬁxes and Sufﬁxes There is a minor zoo of sufﬁxes indicating types of literals and also a few preﬁxes:  Notation  0 0x  u l ll  f e .

However,  I  consider  the  nomenclature  less  important  than  giving  an  overview of the bewildering variety of literals.  The sufﬁxes l and L can be combined with the sufﬁxes u and U to express unsigned long types.  For example:   148  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  1LU  2UL  3ULL  4LLU  5LUL   1L  1.0L      unsigned long    unsigned long    unsigned long long    unsigned long long    error     long int    long double  The sufﬁxes l and L can be used for ﬂoating-point literals to express long double. For example:  Combinations of R, L, and u preﬁxes are allowed, for example, uR"∗∗ foo\ bar  ∗∗". Note the dra- matic difference in the meaning of a U preﬁx for a character  unsigned  and for a string UTF-32 encoding  §7.3.2.2 .  In addition, a user can deﬁne new sufﬁxes for user-deﬁned types. For example, by deﬁning a  user-deﬁned literal operator  §19.2.6 , we can get  "foo bar"s 123_km      aliteral of type std::string    aliteral of type Distance  Sufﬁxes not starting with _ are reserved for the standard library.  6.2.7 void The type void is syntactically a fundamental type. It can, however, be used only as part of a more complicated type; there are no objects of type void. It is used either to specify that a function does not return a value or as the base type for pointers to objects of unknown type. For example:  void x; void& r; void f  ; void∗ pv;      error :there are no void objects    error :there are no references to void    function f does not returnavalue  §12.1.4     pointer to object of unknown type  §7.2.1   When declaring a function, you must specify the type of the value returned. Logically, you would expect to be able to indicate that a function didn’t return a value by omitting the return type. How- ev er,  that would make a mess of the grammar  §iso.A . Consequently, void is used as a ‘‘pseudo return type’’ to indicate that a function doesn’t return a value.  6.2.8  Sizes Some  of  the  aspects  of  C++’s fundamental  types,  such  as  the  size  of  an int, are  implementation- deﬁned  §6.1 . I point out these dependencies and often recommend avoiding them or taking steps to minimize their impact. Why should you bother? People who program on a variety of systems or use a variety of compilers care a lot because if they don’t, they are forced to waste time ﬁnding and ﬁxing obscure bugs.  People who claim they don’t care about portability usually do so because they use only a single system and feel they can afford the attitude that ‘‘the language is what my com- piler implements.’’  This is a narrow and shortsighted view.  If your program is a success, it will be ported,  so  someone  will  have  to ﬁnd  and  ﬁx  problems  related  to  implementation-dependent  fea- tures.  In addition, programs often need to be compiled with other compilers for the same system, and even a  future release of your favorite compiler may do some things differently from the current   Section 6.2.8  Sizes   149  one.  It is far easier to know and limit the impact of implementation dependencies when a program is written than to try to untangle the mess afterward.  It is relatively easy to limit the impact of implementation-dependent language features. Limit- ing the impact of system-dependent library facilities is far harder. Using standard-library facilities wherever feasible is one approach.  The reason for providing more than one integer type, more than one unsigned type, and more than one ﬂoating-point type is to allow the programmer to take advantage of hardware characteris- tics.  On many machines, there are signiﬁcant differences in memory requirements, memory access times, and computation speed among the different varieties of fundamental types. If you know a machine, it is usually easy to choose, for example, the appropriate integer type for a particular vari- able.  Writing truly portable low-level code is harder.  Here is a graphical representation of a plausible set of fundamental types and a sample string  literal  §7.3.2 :  'a'  1  756  100000000  1234567890  1234567890  &c1  1234567e34  char  bool  short  int  long  long long  int∗  double  long double  char[14]  1234567e34  Hello, world!\0  On the same scale  .2 inch to a byte , a megabyte of memory would stretch about 3 miles  5 km  to the right.  Sizes of C++ objects are expressed in terms of multiples of the size of a char, so by deﬁnition the  size  of  a char is 1. The  size  of  an  object  or  type  can  be  obtained  using  the sizeof operator  §10.3 .  This is what is guaranteed about sizes of fundamental types:   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   1 ≡ sizeof char  ≤ sizeof short  ≤ sizeof int  ≤ sizeof long  ≤ sizeof long long  1 ≤ sizeof bool  ≤ sizeof long  sizeof char  ≤ sizeof wchar_t  ≤ sizeof long  sizeof ﬂoat  ≤ sizeof double  ≤ sizeof long double  sizeof N  ≡ sizeof signed N  ≡ sizeof unsigned N    150  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  In that last line, N can be char, short, int, long, or long long. In addition, it is guaranteed that a char has at least 8 bits, a short at least 16 bits, and a long at least 32 bits. A char can hold a character of the machine’s character set. The char type is supposed to be chosen by the implementation to be the most suitable type for holding and manipulating characters on a given computer; it is typically an 8-bit byte. Similarly, the int type is supposed to be chosen to be the most suitable for holding and manipulating integers on a given computer; it is typically a 4-byte  32-bit  word.  It is unwise to  assume  more. For example,  there  are  machines  with  32-bit chars.  It is  extremely  unwise  to assume that the size of an int is the same as the size of a pointer; many machines  ‘‘64-bit architec- tures’’   have  pointers  that  are  larger  than  integers.  Note that  it  is  not  guaranteed  that sizeof long <sizeof long long  or that sizeof double <siz eof long double .  Some  implementation-deﬁned  aspects  of  fundamental  types  can  be  found  by  a  simple  use  of  sizeof, and more can be found in  . For example:  include   include       §40.2  int main   {  }  cout << "size of long " << sizeof 1L  << '\n'; cout << "size of long long " << sizeof 1LL  << '\n';  cout  ::max   << '\n'; cout  ::is_signed << '\n';  The functions in    §40.2  are constexpr  §10.4  so that they can be used without run-time overhead and in contexts that require a constant expression.  The fundamental types can be mixed freely in assignments and expressions.  Wherever possible,  values are converted so as not to lose information  §10.5 .  If a value v can be represented exactly in a variable of type T, a conversion of v to T is value-  preserving.  Conversions that are not value-preserving are best avoided  §2.2.2, §10.5.2.6 .  If you need a speciﬁc size of integer, say, a 16-bit integer, you can include the standard header    that deﬁnes a variety of types  or rather type aliases; §6.5 . For example:  int16_t x {0xaabb}; int64_t xxxx {0xaaaabbbbccccdddd}; int_least16_t y; int_least32_t yy int_fast32_t z;     2bytes    8bytes    at least 2 bytes  just likeint     at least 4 bytes  just likelong     the fastest int type with at least 4 bytes  The standard header   deﬁnes an alias that is very widely used in both standard-library dec- larations and user code: size_t is an implementation-deﬁned unsigned integer type that can hold the size in bytes of every object. Consequently, it is used where we need to hold an object size. For example:  void∗ allocate size_t n ;     get n bytes  Similarly,   deﬁnes the signed integer type ptrdiff_t for holding the result of subtracting two pointers to get a number of elements.   Section 6.2.9  Alignment   151  6.2.9  Alignment An  object  doesn’t just  need  enough  storage  to  hold  its  representation. In  addition,  on  some machine  architectures,  the  bytes  used  to  hold  it  must  have  proper alignment for  the  hardware  to access it efﬁciently  or in extreme cases to access it at all . For example, a 4-byte int often has to be aligned on a word  4-byte  boundary, and sometimes an 8-byte double has to be aligned on a word  8-byte  boundary. Of course, this is all very implementation speciﬁc, and for most programmers completely  implicit. You can  write  good  C++  code  for  decades  without  needing  to  be  explicit about  alignment. Where  alignment  most  often  becomes  visible  is  in  object  layouts:  sometimes structs contain ‘‘holes’’ to improve alignment  §8.2.1 .  The alignof   operator returns the alignment of its argument expression.  For example:  Sometimes, we have to use alignment in a declaration, where an expression, such as alignof x+y  is not allowed.  Instead, we can use the type speciﬁer alignas: alignas T  means ‘‘align just like a T.’’ For example, we can set aside uninitialized storage for some type X like this:  auto ac = alignof 'c' ; auto ai = alignof 1 ; auto ad = alignof 2.0 ;     the alignment of a char    the alignment of an int    the alignment of a double  int a[20]; auto aa = alignof a ;     the alignment of an int  void user const vector & vx  {  constexpr int bufmax = 1024; alignas X  buffer[bufmax];      uninitialized  const int max = min vx.size  ,bufmax siz eof X  ; uninitialized_copy vx.begin  ,vx.begin  +max,buffer ;    ...  }  6.3  Declarations Before a name  identiﬁer  can be used in a C++ program, it must be declared. That is, its type must be speciﬁed to inform the compiler what kind of entity the name refers to. For example:  char ch; string s; auto count = 1; const double pi {3.1415926535897}; extern int error_number;  const char∗ name = "Njal"; const char∗ season[] = { "spring", "summer", "fall", "winter" }; vector  people { name, "Skarphedin", "Gunnar" };   152  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  struct Date { int d, m, y; }; int day Date∗ p  { return p−>d; } double sqrt double ; template  T abs T a  { return a<0 ? −a : a; }  constexpr int fac int n  { return  n<2 ?1:n∗fac n−1 ; } constexpr double zz { ii∗fac 7  };     possible compile-time evaluation  §2.2.3     compile-time initialization  using Cmplx = std::complex ;  struct User; enum class Beer { Carlsberg, Tuborg, Thor }; namespace NS { int a; }     type alias  §3.4.5, §6.5     type name  As can be seen from these examples, a declaration can do more than simply associate a type with a name.  Most of these declarations are also deﬁnitions. A deﬁnition is a declaration that supplies all that is needed in a program for the use of an entity. In particular, if it takes memory to represent something, that memory is set aside by its deﬁnition. A different terminology deems declarations parts of an interface and deﬁnitions parts of an implementation. When taking that view,  we try to compose interfaces out of declarations that can be replicated in separate ﬁles  §15.2.2 ; deﬁnitions that set aside memory do not belong in interfaces.  Assuming that these declarations are in the global scope  §6.3.4 , we have:  char ch;  auto count = 1; const char∗ name = "Njal";     set aside memoryfor a char and initializeitto0    set aside memoryfor an int initialized to 1    set aside memoryfor a pointer to char    set aside memoryfor a string literal "Njal"    initializethe pointer with the address of that string literal  struct Date { int d, m, y; }; int day Date∗ p  { return p−>d; }     Date is a struct with three members    dayisafunction that executes the speciﬁed code  using Point = std::complex ;   Point is a name for std::complex   Of the declarations above, only three are not also deﬁnitions:  double sqrt double ;  extern int error_number;  struct User;     function declaration    variable declaration    type name declaration  That is, if used, the entity they refer to must be deﬁned elsewhere.  For example:  double sqrt double d  {  * ...*  } int error_number = 1; struct User {  * ...*  };  int count; int count;     error :redeﬁnition  There must always be exactly one deﬁnition for each name in a C++ program  for the effects of include, see §15.2.3 . However, there can be many declarations.  All declarations of an entity must agree on its type. So, this fragment has two errors:   Section 6.3  Declarations   153  extern int error_number; extern short error_number;      error :type mismatch  This has no errors  for the use of extern, see §15.2 :  extern int error_number; extern int error_number;    OK: redeclaration  Some deﬁnitions explicitly specify a ‘‘value’’ for the entities they deﬁne.  For example:  struct Date { int d, m, y; }; using Point = std::complex ; int day Date∗ p  { return p−>d; } const double pi {3.1415926535897};     Point is a name for std::complex   For types,  aliases,  templates,  functions,  and  constants,  the  ‘‘value’’ is permanent.  For  non-const data types, the initial value may be changed later. For example:  int count {1}; const char∗ name {"Bjarne"};    name is a var iable that points to a constant  §7.5  count = 2; name = "Marian";     initializecount to 1     assign 2 to count  Of the deﬁnitions, only two do not specify values:  void f   {  }  char ch; string s;  See  §6.3.5  and  §17.3.3  for  explanations  of  how and  when  a  variable  is  assigned  a  default  value. Any declaration that speciﬁes a value is a deﬁnition.  6.3.1  The Structure of Declarations The structure of a declaration is deﬁned by the C++ grammar  §iso.A . This grammar evolved over four decades, starting with the early C grammars, and is quite complicated. However, without too many radical simpliﬁcations, we can consider a declaration as having ﬁve parts  in order :   cid:129  Optional preﬁx speciﬁers  e.g., static or virtual   cid:129  A base type  e.g., vector  or const int   cid:129  A declarator optionally including a name  e.g., p[7], n, or ∗ ∗ []   cid:129  Optional sufﬁx function speciﬁers  e.g., const or noexcept   cid:129  An optional initializer or function body  e.g., ={7,5,3} or {return x;}   Except for function and namespace deﬁnitions, a declaration is terminated by a semicolon. Con- sider a deﬁnition of an array of C-style strings:  const char∗ kings[] = { "Antigonus", "Seleucus", "Ptolemy" };  Here, the base type is const  char, the declarator is ∗kings[], and the initializer is the = followed by the {}-list.  A speciﬁer is an initial keyword, such as virtual  §3.2.3, §20.3.2 , extern  §15.2 , or constexpr   §2.2.3 , that speciﬁes some non-type attribute of what is being declared.   154  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  A declarator is composed of a name and optionally some declarator operators. The most com-  mon declarator operators are:  Declarator Operators  preﬁx preﬁx preﬁx preﬁx preﬁx preﬁx postﬁx postﬁx postﬁx  ∗ ∗const ∗volatile & && auto []    −>  pointer constant pointer volatile pointer lvalue reference  §7.7.1  rvalue reference  §7.7.2  function  using sufﬁx return type  array function returns from function  Their  use  would  be  simple  if  they were  all  either  preﬁx  or  postﬁx. However, ∗, [], and    were designed to mirror their use in expressions  §10.3 . Thus, ∗ is preﬁx and [] and    are postﬁx. The postﬁx declarator operators bind tighter than the preﬁx ones. Consequently, char∗kings[] is an array of pointers to char, whereas char ∗kings [] is a pointer to an array of char. We hav e to use parenthe- ses to express types such as ‘‘pointer to array’’ and ‘‘pointer to function’’; see the examples in §7.2.  Note that the type cannot be left out of a declaration. For example:  const c = 7;     error :no type  gt int a, int b  {     error :no returntype  return  a>b  ? a : b;  }  unsigned ui; long li;     OK: ‘‘unsigned’’means ‘‘unsigned int’’    OK: ‘‘long’’means ‘‘long int’’  In this, standard C++ differs from early versions of C and C++ that allowed the ﬁrst two examples by considering int to be the type when none was speciﬁed  §44.3 . This ‘‘implicit int’’  rule was a source of subtle errors and much confusion.  Some types have names composed out of multiple keywords, such as long long and volatile int. Some type names don’t even look much like names, such as decltype f x    the return type of a call f x ; §6.3.6.3 .  The volatile speciﬁer is described in §41.4. The alignas   speciﬁer is described in §6.2.9.  6.3.2  Declaring Multiple Names It is possible to declare several names in a single declaration. The declaration simply contains a list of comma-separated declarators. For example, we can declare two integers like this:  int x, y;     int x; int y;   Section 6.3.2  Declaring Multiple Names  155  Operators apply to individual names only – and not to any subsequent names in the same declara- tion.  For example:  int∗ p, y; int x, ∗q;  int v[10], ∗pv;     int v[10];int* pv;     int* p; int y; NOTint* y;    int x; int* q;  Such  declarations  with  multiple  names  and  nontrivial  declarators  make a program  harder  to  read and should be avoided.  6.3.3  Names A name  identiﬁer  consists of a sequence of letters and digits. The ﬁrst character must be a letter. The underscore character, _, is considered a letter. C++ imposes no limit on the number of charac- ters in a name. However, some parts of an implementation are not under the control of the compiler writer  in particular, the linker , and those parts, unfortunately, sometimes do impose limits. Some run-time environments also make it necessary to extend or restrict the set of characters accepted in an identiﬁer. Extensions  e.g., allowing the character $ in a name  yield nonportable programs. A C++  keyword   §6.3.3.1 ,  such  as new or int, cannot  be  used  as  a  name  of  a  user-deﬁned  entity. Examples of names are:  hello  DEFINED  var0   this_is_a_most_unusually_long_identiﬁer_that_is_better_avoided foO  var1   HorseSense ___  u_name  _class   bAr CLASS  Examples of character sequences that cannot be used as identiﬁers are:  012  pay.due   a fool  foo˜bar   $sys .name  class  if  3var  Nonlocal names starting with an underscore are reserved for special facilities in the implementation and the run-time environment, so such names should not be used in application programs. Simi- larly, names starting with a double underscore  __  or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter  e.g., _Foo  are reserved  §iso.17.6.4.3 .  When  reading  a  program,  the  compiler  always  looks  for  the  longest  string  of  characters  that could make up a name.  Hence, var10 is a single name, not the name var followed by the number 10. Also, elseif is a single name, not the keyword else followed by the keyword if.  Uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct, so Count and count are different names, but it is In  general,  it  is  best  to  avoid often  unwise  to  choose  names  that  differ  only  by  capitalization. names that differ only in subtle ways.  For example, in some fonts, the uppercase ‘‘o’’  O  and zero  0  can be hard to tell apart, as can the lowercase ‘‘L’’   l , uppercase ‘‘i’’  I , and one  1 .  Conse- quently, l0, lO, l1, ll, and I1l are poor choices for identiﬁer names. Not all fonts have the same prob- lems, but most have some.  Names from a large scope ought to have relatively long and reasonably obvious names, such as vector, Window_with_border, and Department_number. Howev er, code is clearer if names used only in a small scope have short, conventional names such as x, i, and p. Functions  Chapter 12 , classes  Chapter 16 , and namespaces  §14.3.1  can be used to keep scopes small. It is often useful to keep frequently used names relatively short and reserve really long names for infrequently used entities.   156  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  Choose names to reﬂect the meaning of an entity rather than its implementation. For example, phone_book is better than number_vector ev en if the phone numbers happen to be stored in a vector  §4.4 .  Do not encode type information in a name  e.g., pcname for a name that’s a char∗ or icount for a count that’s an int  as is sometimes done in languages with dynamic or weak type systems:   cid:129  Encoding types in names lowers the abstraction level of the program; in particular, it pre- vents generic programming  which relies on a name being able to refer to entities of differ- ent types .   cid:129  The compiler is better at keeping track of types than you are.  cid:129   If you want to change the type of a name  e.g., use a std::string to hold the name , you’ll have to change every use of the name  or the type encoding becomes a lie .   cid:129  Any  system  of  type  abbreviations  you  can  come  up  with  will  become  overelaborate  and  cryptic as the variety of types you use increases.  Choosing good names is an art.  Try to maintain a consistent naming style. For example, capitalize names of user-deﬁned types and start names of non-type entities with a lowercase letter  for example, Shape and current_token . Also, use all capitals for macros  if you must use macros  §12.6 ; for example, HACK  and never for non-macros  not even for non-macro constants . Use underscores to separate words in an identiﬁer; number_of_elements is  more  readable  than numberOfElements. Howev er,  consistency is hard  to achieve because programs are typically composed of fragments from different sources and several different  reasonable  styles  are  in  use. Be  consistent  in  your  use  of  abbreviations  and  acronyms. Note that the language and the standard library use lowercase for types; this can be seen as a hint that they are part of the standard.  6.3.3.1  Keywords  The C++ keywords are:  C++ Keywords  alignas  bitand  char  constexpr  do  extern  if  new or  reinterpret_cast  static_assert thread_local  typename  volatile   alignof bitor char16_t  const_cast double  false inline noexcept  or_eq return static_cast  throw  union wchar_t   and  bool  char32_t  continue  dynamic_cast  ﬂoat  int  not private  shor t struct true  unsigned  while  and_eq break class  decltype  else for  long not_eq  protected  signed  switch try using xor   asm  case  compl default enum  friend mutable  nullptr  public  sizeof  template  typedef  vir tual xor_eq  auto catch const delete explicit goto namespace operator register static this typeid void  In addition, the word expor t is reserved for future use.   Section 6.3.4  Scope   157  6.3.4  Scope A declaration introduces a name into a scope; that is, a name can be used only in a speciﬁc part of the program text.   cid:129  Local scope: A name declared in a function  Chapter 12  or lambda  §11.4  is called a local name. Its scope extends from its point of declaration to the end of the block in which its de- claration occurs. A block is a section of code delimited by a {} pair. Function and lambda parameter  names  are  considered  local  names  in  the  outermost  block  of  their  function  or lambda.   cid:129  Class scope: A name is called a member name  or a class member name  if it is deﬁned in a class outside any function, class  Chapter 16 , enum class  §8.4.1 , or other namespace. Its scope extends from the opening { of the class declaration to the end of the class declaration.  cid:129  Namespace scope: A name is called a namespace member name if it is deﬁned in a name- space   §14.3.1   outside  any function,  lambda   §11.4 ,  class   Chapter  16 ,  enum  class  §8.4.1 , or other namespace. Its scope extends from the point of declaration to the end of its  namespace. A namespace  name  may  also  be  accessible  from  other  translation  units  §15.2 .   cid:129  Global  scope: A name  is  called  a global  name if  it  is  deﬁned  outside  any function,  class  Chapter  16 ,  enum  class   §8.4.1 ,  or  namespace   §14.3.1 . The  scope  of  a  global  name extends from the point of declaration to the end of the ﬁle in which its declaration occurs. A global  name  may  also  be  accessible  from  other  translation  units   §15.2 . Technically, the global namespace is considered a namespace, so a global name is an example of a name- space member name. Statement scope: A name is in a statement scope if it is deﬁned within the    part of a for-, while-, if-, or switch-statement.  Its scope extends from its point of declaration to the end of its statement. All names in statement scope are local names.   cid:129    cid:129  Function scope: A label  §9.6  is in scope from its point of declaration until the end of the  A declaration of a name in a block can hide a declaration in an enclosing block or a global name. That is, a name can be redeﬁned to refer to a different entity within a block. After exit from the block, the name resumes its previous meaning. For example:  function.  int x;  void f   {  int x; x = 1; {  } x = 3;  }     global x     local x hides global x    assign to local x  int x; x = 2;     hides ﬁrst local x    assign to second local x     assign to ﬁrst local x  int∗ p = &x;      takeaddress of global x   158  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  Hiding names is unavoidable when writing large programs. However,  a  human reader can easily fail to notice that a name has been hidden  also known as shadowed .  Because such errors are rela- tively  rare,  they can  be  very  difﬁcult  to  ﬁnd. Consequently, name  hiding  should  be  minimized. Using names such as i and x for global variables or for local variables in a large function is asking for trouble.  A hidden global name can be referred to using the scope resolution operator, ::. For example:  int x = 1; ::x = 2; x = 2;    ...     hide global x    assign to global x    assign to local x  There is no way to use a hidden local name.  The scope of a name that is not a class member starts at its point of declaration, that is, after the complete declarator and before the initializer. This implies that a name can be used even to specify its own initial value.  For example:  int x = x;     per verse: initializexwith its own  uninitialized  value  A good compiler warns if a variable is used before it has been initialized.  It is possible to use a single name to refer to two different objects in a block without using the ::  operator. For example:     per verse: use of twodifferent objects both called x in a single scope  int y = x; int x = 22; y = x;     use global x: y = 11     use local x: y = 22  Again, such subtleties are best avoided.  The names of function arguments are considered declared in the outermost block of a function.  For example:  void f5 int x  {  int x;     error  int x;  void f2   {  int x = 97;  void f3   {  int x = 11;  void f4   {  }  }  }  }   Section 6.3.4  Scope   159  This is an error because x is deﬁned twice in the same scope.  Names  introduced  in  a for-statement  are  local  to  that  statement   in  statement  scope . This  allows us to use conventional names for loop variables repeatedly in a function. For example:  void f vector & v, list & lst  {  for  const auto& x : v  cout << x << '\n'; for  auto x : lst  cout << x << '\n'; for  int i = 0, i!=v.siz e  , ++i  cout << v[i] << '\n'; for  auto i : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}  cout << i << '\n';  }  This contains no name clashes.  A declaration is not allowed as the only statement on the branch of an if-statement  §9.4.1 .  6.3.5  Initialization If an initializer is speciﬁed for an object, that initializer determines the initial value of an object. An initializer can use one of four syntactic styles:  X a1 {v}; X a2 = {v}; X a3 = v; X a4 v ;  int x1 = 0; char c1 = 'z';  Of these, only the ﬁrst can be used in every context, and I strongly recommend its use. It is clearer and less error-prone than the alternatives.  However, the ﬁrst form  used for a1  is new in C++11, so the other three forms are what you ﬁnd in older code. The two forms using = are what you use in C.  Old habits die hard, so I sometimes  inconsistently  use = when initializing a simple variable with a simple value.  For example:  However, anything much more complicated than that is better done using {}. Initialization using {}, list initialization, does not allow narrowing  §iso.8.5.4 . That is:   cid:129  An integer cannot be converted to another integer that cannot hold its value.  For example,  char to int is allowed, but not int to char.   cid:129  A ﬂoating-point value cannot be converted to another ﬂoating-point type that cannot hold its  value.  For example, ﬂoat to double is allowed, but not double to ﬂoat.   cid:129  A ﬂoating-point value cannot be converted to an integer type.  cid:129  An integer value cannot be converted to a ﬂoating-point type.  For example:  void f double val, int val2  {  int x2 = val;  char c2 = val2;      if val==7.9, x2 becomes 7    if val2==1025, c2 becomes 1   160  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  int x3 {val};  char c3 {val2};      error :possible truncation    error :possible narrowing  char c4 {24}; char c5 {264};     OK: 24 can be represented exactly as a char    error  assuming 8-bit chars : 264 cannot be represented as a char  int x4 {2.0};     error :no double to int value conversion     ...  }  See §10.5 for the conversion rules for built-in types.  There is no advantage to using {} initialization, and one trap, when using auto to get the type determined by the initializer. The trap is that if the initializer is a {}-list, we may not want its type deduced  §6.3.6.2 . For example:  auto z1 {99}; auto z2 = 99;     z1 is an initializer_list     z2 is an int  So prefer = when using auto.  It is possible to deﬁne a class so that an object can be initialized by a list of values and alterna- tively be constructed given a couple of arguments that are not simply values to be stored. The clas- sical example is a vector of integers:  vector  v1 {99}; vector  v2 99 ;     v1 is a vector of 1 element with the value 99    v2 is a vector of 99 elements each with the default value 0  I use the explicit invocation of a constructor,  99 , to get the second meaning. Most types do not offer such confusing alternatives – even most vectors do not; for example:  vector  v1{"hello!"}; vector  v2 "hello!" ;     v1 is a vector of 1 element with the value "hello!"    error :no vector constructor takes a string literal  So, prefer {} initialization over alternatives unless you have a strong reason not to.  The empty initializer list, {}, is used to indicate that a default value is desired. For example:  int x4 {}; double d4 {}; char∗ p {};  vector  v4{}; string s4 {};     x4 becomes 0    d4 becomes 0.0    pbecomes nullptr    v4 becomes the empty vector    s4 becomes ""  Most types have a default value.  For integral types, the default value is a suitable representation of zero.  For pointers, the default value is nullptr  §7.2.2 .  For user-deﬁned types, the default value  if any  is determined by the type’s constructors  §17.3.3 .  For user-deﬁned types, there can be a distinction between direct initialization  where implicit  conversions are allowed  and copy initialization  where they are not ; see §16.2.6.  Initialization of particular kinds of objects is discussed where appropriate:  cid:129  Pointers: §7.2.2, §7.3.2, §7.4  cid:129  References: §7.7.1  lvalues , §7.7.2  rvalues    Section 6.3.5  Initialization   161   cid:129  Arrays: §7.3.1, §7.3.2  cid:129  Constants: §10.4  cid:129  Classes:  §17.3.1   not  using  constructors ,  §17.3.2   using  constructors ,  §17.3.3   default ,  §17.4  member and base , §17.5  copy and move    cid:129  User-deﬁned containers: §17.3.4  6.3.5.1  Missing Initializers  For many types, including all built-in types, it is possible to leave out the initializer. If you do that – and that has unfortunately been common – the situation is more complicated. If you don’t like the complications, just initialize consistently. The only really good case for an uninitialized vari- able is a large input buffer. For example:  constexpr int max = 1024∗1024; char buf[max]; some_stream.get buf,max ;   We could easily have initialized buf:     read at most max characters into buf  char buf[max] {};     initializeevery char to 0  By redundantly initializing, we would have suffered a performance hit which just might have been signiﬁcant.  Avoid such low-level use of buffers where you can, and don’t leave such buffers unini- tialized unless you know  e.g., from measurement  that the optimization compared to using an ini- tialized array is signiﬁcant.  If  no  initializer  is  speciﬁed,  a  global   §6.3.4 ,  namespace   §14.3.1 ,  local static  §12.1.8 ,  or static member   §16.2.12    collectively  called static  objects  is initialized  to {} of  the  appropriate type.  For example:  int a; double d;     means ‘‘int a{};’’sothat a becomes 0    means ‘‘double d{};’’sothat d becomes 0.0  Local  variables  and  objects  created  on  the  free  store   sometimes  called dynamic  objects or heap objects; §11.2   are  not  initialized  by  default  unless  they are  of  user-deﬁned  types  with  a  default constructor  §17.3.3 . For example:  void f   {  int x; char buf[1024];      xdoes not have a well-deﬁned value    buf[i] does not have a well-deﬁned value  int∗ p {new int};  char∗ q {new char[1024]};      *p does not have a well-deﬁned value    q[i] does not have a well-deﬁned value  string s; vector  v;     s=="" because of string’sdefault constructor    v=={} because of vector’sdefault constructor  string∗ ps {new string};     ...  }     *ps is "" because of string’sdefault constructor   162  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  If you want initialization of local variables of built-in type or objects of built-in type created with new, use {}. For example:  int x {}; char buf[1024]{};      xbecomes 0    buf[i] becomes 0 for all i  int∗ p {new int{10}};  char∗ q {new char[1024]{}};      *p becomes 10    q[i] becomes 0 for all i  void ff   {     ...  }  A member of an array or a class is default initialized if the array or structure is.  6.3.5.2  Initializer Lists  So far, we hav e considered the cases of no initializer and one initializer value.  More complicated objects can require more than one value as an initializer. This is primarily handled by initializer lists delimited by { and }. For example:  int a[] = { 1, 2 }; struct S { int x, string s }; S s = { 1, "Helios" }; complex  z = { 0, pi }; vector  v = { 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3 };     array initializer     structinitializer    use constructor    use list constructor  For C-style initialization of arrays, see §7.3.1. For C-style structures, see §8.2. For user-deﬁned types with constructors, see §2.3.2 or §16.2.5. For initializer-list constructors, see §17.3.4.  In the cases above, the = is redundant. However, some prefer to add it to emphasize that a set of  values are used to initialize a set of member variables.  In some cases, function-style argument lists can also be used  §2.3, §16.2.5 . For example:  complex  z 0,pi ; vector  v 10,3.3 ;     use constructor    use constructor :vgets 10 elements initialized to 3.3  In  a  declaration,  an  empty  pair  of  parentheses,   , always  means  ‘‘function’’  §12.1 .  So, if  you want to be explicit about ‘‘use default initialization’’ you need {}. For example:  complex  z1 1,2 ; complex  f1  ;     function-style initializer  initialization byconstr uctor     function declaration  complex  z2 {1,2}; complex  f2 {};     initialization byconstr uctorto {1,2}    initialization byconstr uctorto the default value {0,0}  Note that initialization using the {} notation does not narrow  §6.3.5 .  When using auto, a {}-list has its type deduced to std::initializer_list . For example:  auto x1 {1,2,3,4}; auto x2 {1.0, 2.25, 3.5 }; auto x3 {1.0,2};     x1 is an initializer_list     x2 is an initializer_list of     error :cannot deduce the type of {1.0,2}  §6.3.6.2    Section 6.3.5.2  Initializer Lists  163  6.3.6  Deducing a Type: auto and decltype   The language provides two mechanisms for deducing a type from an expression:   cid:129    cid:129   auto for deducing a type of an object from its initializer; the type can be the type of a vari- able, a const, or a constexpr. decltype expr  for deducing the type of something that is not a simple initializer, such as the return type for a function or the type of a class member.  The deduction done here is very simple: auto and decltype   simply report the type of an expression already known to the compiler.  6.3.6.1  The auto Type Speciﬁer  When  a  declaration  of  a  variable  has  an  initializer, we don’t need  to  explicitly  specify  a  type. Instead, we can let the variable have the type of its initializer. Consider:  int a1 = 123; char a2 = 123; auto a3 = 123;    the type of a3 is ‘‘int’’  The type of the integer literal 123 is int, so a3 is an int. That is, auto is a placeholder for the type of the initializer.  There is not much advantage in using auto instead of int for an expression as simple as 123. The harder the type is to write and the harder the type is to know,  the more useful auto becomes.  For example:  template  void f1 vector & arg  {  for  vector ::iterator p = arg.begin  ; p!=arg.end  ; ++p   ∗p = 7;  ∗p = 7;  for  auto p = arg.begin  ; p!=arg.end  ; ++p   }  }  The loop using auto is the more convenient to write and the easier to read. Also, it is more resilient to code changes. For example, if I changed arg to be a list, the loop using auto would still work cor- rectly whereas the ﬁrst loop would need to be rewritten.  So, unless there is a good reason not to, use auto in small scopes.  If a scope is large, mentioning a type explicitly can help localize errors. That is, compared to  using a speciﬁc type, using auto can delay the detection of type errors. For example:  void f double d  {  constexpr auto max = d+7; int a[max];    ...     error :array bound not an integer  If auto causes surprises, the best cure is typically to make functions smaller, which most often is a good idea anyway  §12.1 .   164  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  We can decorate a deduced type with speciﬁers and modiﬁers  §6.3.1 , such as const and &  ref-  Here, auto is determined by the element type of v, that is, int.  Note that the type of an expression is never a reference because references are implicitly deref-  erenced in expressions  §7.7 . For example:  erence; §7.7 . For example:  void f vector & v  {  for  const auto& x : v  {     xisaconst int&     ...  }  }  }  void g int& v  {  auto x = v; auto& y = v;     xisanint  not an int&     yisanint&  6.3.6.2 auto and {}-lists  char v1 = 12345; int v2 = 'c'; T v3 = f  ;     12345 is an int    'c' is a char  When we explicitly mention the type of an object we are initializing, we have  two  types to con- sider: the type of the object and the type of the initializer. For example:  By using the {}-initializer syntax for such deﬁnitions, we minimize the chances for unfortunate con- versions:  char v1 {12345}; int v2 {'c'}; T v3 {f  };      error :narrowing    ﬁne: implicit char->int conversion    worksifand only if the type of f   can be implicitly converted to a T  When we use auto, there is only one type involved, the type of the initializer, and we can safely use the = syntax:  auto v1 = 12345; auto v2 = 'c'; auto v3 = f  ;     v1 is an int    v2 is a char    v3 is of some appropriate type  In fact, it can be an advantage to use the = syntax with auto, because the {}-list syntax might sur- prise someone:  auto v1 {12345}; auto v2 {'c'}; auto v3 {f  };     v1 is a list of int    v2 is a list of char    v3 is a list of some appropriate type  This is logical. Consider:   Section 6.3.6.2  auto and {}-lists   165  auto x0 {}; auto x1 {1}; auto x2 {1,2}; auto x3 {1,2,3};     error :cannot deduce a type    list of int with one element    list of int with twoelements    list of int with three elements  The  type  of  a  homogeneous  list  of  elements  of  type T is  taken  to  be  of  type initializer_list   §3.2.1.3, §11.3.3 . In particular, the type of x1 is not deduced to be int. Had it been, what would be the types of x2 and x3?  Consequently, I recommend using = rather than {} for objects speciﬁed auto whenever we don’t  mean ‘‘list.’’  6.3.6.3  The decltype   Speciﬁer  We  can  use auto when  we  have  a  suitable  initializer. But  sometimes,  we  want  to  have  a  type deduced  without  deﬁning  an  initialized  variable.  Then, we  can  use  a  declaration  type  speciﬁer: decltype expr  is the declared type of expr. This is mostly useful in generic programming. Consider writing a function that adds two matrices with potentially different element types. What should be the type of the result of the addition? A matrix, of course, but what might its element type be? The obvious answer is that the element type of the sum is the type of the sum of the elements. So, I can declare:  template  auto operator+ const Matrix & a, const Matrix & b  −> Matrix ;  I use the sufﬁx return type syntax  §12.1  to be able to express the return type in terms of the argu- ments: Matrix . That  is,  the  result  is  a Matrix with  the  element  type  being  what you get from adding a pair of elements from the argument Matrixes: T{}+U{}. In the deﬁnition, I again need decltype   to express Matrix’s element type:  template  auto operator+ const Matrix & a, const Matrix & b  −> Matrix  {  Matrix  res; for  int i=0; i!=a.rows  ; ++i   for  int j=0; j!=a.cols  ; ++j  res i,j  += a i,j  + b i,j ;  return res;  }  6.4  Objects and Values We  can allocate and use objects that do not have names  e.g., created using new , and it is possible to  assign  to  strange-looking  expressions   e.g., ∗p[a+10]=7 .  Consequently, we need  a  name  for ‘‘something in memory.’’ This is the simplest and most fundamental notion of an object. That is, an object is a contiguous region of storage; an lvalue is an expression that refers to an object. The word ‘‘lvalue’’ was originally coined to mean ‘‘something that can be on the left-hand side of an assignment.’’  Howev er,  not every lvalue may be used on the left-hand side of an assignment; an   166  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  lvalue can refer to a constant  §7.7 . An lvalue that has not been declared const is often called a modiﬁable lvalue. This simple and low-level notion of an object should not be confused with the notions of class object and object of polymorphic type  §3.2.2, §20.3.2 .  6.4.1  Lvalues and Rvalues To complement the notion of an lvalue, we have the notion of an rvalue. Roughly, rvalue means ‘‘a value that is not an lvalue,’’ such as a temporary value  e.g., the value returned by a function .  If you need to be more technical  say, because you want to read the ISO C++ standard , you need a more reﬁned view of lvalue and rvalue.  There are two properties that matter for an object when it comes to addressing, copying, and moving:   cid:129  Has identity: The program has the name of, pointer to, or reference to the object so that it is possible  to  determine  if  two objects  are  the  same,  whether  the  value  of  the  object  has changed, etc.   cid:129  Movable: The object may be moved from  i.e., we are allowed to move its value to another  location and leave the object in a valid but unspeciﬁed state, rather than copying; §17.5 .  It turns out that three of the four possible combinations of those two properties are needed to pre- cisely describe the C++ language rules  we have no need for objects that do not have identity and cannot be moved .  Using ‘‘m for movable’’ and ‘‘i for has identity,’’ we can represent this classiﬁ- cation of expressions graphically:  lvalue  {i&!m}  xvalue  {i&m}  prvalue  {!i&m}  glvalue  {i}  rvalue  {m}  So, a classical lvalue is something that has identity and cannot be moved  because we could exam- ine it after a move , and a classical rvalue is anything that we are allowed to move from.  The other alternatives are prvalue  ‘‘pure rvalue’’ , glvalue  ‘‘generalized lvalue’’ , and xvalue  ‘‘x’’ for ‘‘ex- traordinary’’ or ‘‘expert only’’; the suggestions for the meaning of this ‘‘x’’ hav e been quite imagi- native .  For example:  void f vector & vs  {  vector & v2 = std::move vs ;     ...     move vstov2  }  Here, std::move vs  is an xvalue: it clearly has identity  we can refer to it as vs , but we have explic- itly given permission for it to be moved from by calling std::move    §3.3.2, §35.5.1 .  For practical  programming,  thinking  in  terms  of  rvalue  and  lvalue  is  usually  sufﬁcient.  Note  that every expression is either an lvalue or an rvalue, but not both.  6.4.2  Lifetimes of Objects The lifetime of an object starts when its constructor completes and ends when its destructor starts executing.  Objects of  types  without  a  declared  constructor, such  as  an int, can  be  considered  to have default constructors and destructors that do nothing.   Section 6.4.2  Lifetimes of Objects  167  We can classify objects based on their lifetimes:  cid:129  Automatic: Unless  the  programmer  speciﬁes  otherwise   §12.1.8,  §16.2.12 ,  an  object declared in a function is created when its deﬁnition is encountered and destroyed when its name goes out of scope. Such objects are sometimes called automatic objects.  In a typical implementation, automatic objects are allocated on the stack; each call of the function gets its own stack frame to hold its automatic objects. Static: Objects declared in global or namespace scope  §6.3.4  and statics declared in func- tions  §12.1.8  or classes  §16.2.12  are created and initialized once  only  and ‘‘live’’  until the program terminates  §15.4.3 . Such objects are called static objects.  A static object has the same address throughout the life of a program execution.  Static objects can cause seri- ous  problems  in  a  multi-threaded  program  because  they are  shared  among  all  threads  and typically require locking to avoid data races  §5.3.1, §42.3 .   cid:129    cid:129  Fr ee store: Using  the new and delete operators,  we  can  create  objects  whose  lifetimes  are  controlled directly  §11.2 .   cid:129  Temporary objects  e.g., intermediate results in a computation or an object used to hold a value for a reference to const argument : their lifetime is determined by their use. If they are bound to a reference, their lifetime is that of the reference; otherwise, they ‘‘live’’  until the end of the full expression of which they are part. A full expression is an expression that is not part of another expression.  Typically, temporary objects are automatic.   cid:129  Thread-local objects;  that  is,  objects  declared thread_local  §42.2.8 :  such  objects  are  cre-  ated when their thread is and destroyed when their thread is. Static and automatic are traditionally referred to as storage classes.  Array  elements  and  nonstatic  class  members  have  their  lifetimes  determined  by  the  object  of  which they are part.  6.5  Type Aliases Sometimes, we need a new name for a type. Possible reasons include:   cid:129  The original name is too long, complicated, or ugly  in some programmer’s eyes .  cid:129  A programming technique requires different types to have the same name in a context.  cid:129  A speciﬁc type is mentioned in one place only to simplify maintenance.  For example:  using Pchar = char∗; using PF = int ∗  double ;      pointer to character    pointer to function taking a double and returning an int  Similar types can deﬁne the same name as a member alias:  template  class vector {  using value_type = T;    ...  };     every container has a value_type   168  Types and Declarations  Chapter 6  template  class list {  using value_type = T;    ...  };     every container has a value_type  For good and bad, type aliases are synonyms for other types rather than distinct types. That is, an alias refers to the type for which it is an alias. For example:  Pchar p1 = nullptr;  char∗ p3 = p1;     p1 is a char*    ﬁne  People  who  would  like to hav e distinct  types  with  identical  semantics  or  identical  representation should look at enumerations  §8.4  and classes  Chapter 16 .  An older syntax using the keyword typedef and placing the name being declared where it would  have been in a declaration of a variable can equivalently be used in many contexts.  For example:  typedef int int32_t; typedef short int16_t;  typedef void ∗PtoF  int ;      equivalent to ‘‘using int32_t = int;’’    equivalent to ‘‘using int16_t = short;’’    equivalent to ‘‘using PtoF = void *  int ;’’  Aliases are used when we want to insulate our code from details of the underlying machine. The name int32_t indicates  that  we  want  it  to  represent  a  32-bit  integer. Having  written  our  code  in terms of int32_t, rather than ‘‘plain int,’’ we can port our code to a machine with sizeof int ==2 by redeﬁning the single occurrence of int32_t in our code to use a longer integer:  using int32_t = long;  The _t sufﬁx is conventional for aliases  ‘‘typedefs’’ .  The int16_t, int32_t, and other such aliases can be found in    §43.7 .  Note that naming a type after its representation rather than its pur- pose is not necessarily a good idea  §6.3.3 .  The using keyword can also be used to introduce a template alias  §23.6 . For example:  template   using Vector = std::vector >;  We cannot apply type speciﬁers, such as unsigned, to an alias.  For example:  using Char = char; using Uchar = unsigned Char; using Uchar = unsigned char;      error    OK  6.6  Advice [1]  For the ﬁnal word on language deﬁnition issues, see the ISO C++ standard; §6.1.

Obviously, we can refer to an object by name, but in C++  most  objects ‘‘have identity.’’ That is, they reside at a speciﬁc address in memory, and an object can be accessed if you know its address and its type. The language constructs for holding and using addresses are pointers and references.   172   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  7.2  Pointers For a  type T, T∗ is the type ‘‘pointer to T.’’ That is, a variable of type T∗ can hold the address of an object of type T. For example:  char c = 'a'; char∗ p = &c;   or graphically:     pholds the address of c; & is the address-of operator  p:  &c  c:  'a'  The fundamental operation on a pointer is dereferencing, that is, referring to the object pointed to by  the  pointer. This  operation  is  also  called indirection. The  dereferencing  operator  is   preﬁx  unary ∗. For example:  char c = 'a'; char∗ p = &c;  char c2 = ∗p;      pholds the address of c; & is the address-of operator    c2 == ’a’; * is the dereference operator  The object pointed to by p is c, and the value stored in c is 'a', so the value of ∗p assigned to c2 is 'a'.  It is possible to perform some arithmetic operations on pointers to array elements  §7.4 . The implementation of pointers is intended to map directly to the addressing mechanisms of the machine on which the program runs. Most machines can address a byte. Those that can’t tend to have hardware to extract bytes from words.  On the other hand, few machines can directly address an  individual  bit. Consequently, the  smallest  object  that  can  be  independently  allocated  and pointed to using a built-in pointer type is a char. Note that a bool occupies at least as much space as a char  §6.2.8 .  To store smaller values more compactly, you can use the bitwise logical operations  §11.1.1 , bit-ﬁelds in structures  §8.2.7 , or a bitset  §34.2.2 .  The ∗, meaning  ‘‘pointer  to,’’  is used  as  a  sufﬁx  for  a  type  name. Unfortunately, pointers  to  arrays and pointers to functions need a more complicated notation:  int∗ pi;  char∗∗ ppc;  int∗ ap[15];  int  ∗fp  char∗ ;  int∗ f char∗ ;      pointer to int    pointer to pointer to char    array of15pointers to ints    pointer to function taking a char* argument; returns an int    function taking a char* argument; returns a pointer to int  See §6.3.1 for an explanation of the declaration syntax and §iso.A for the complete grammar.  Pointers to functions can be useful; they are discussed in §12.5. Pointers to class members are  presented in §20.6.  7.2.1 void∗ In  low-level code,  we  occasionally  need  to  store  or  pass  along  an  address  of  a  memory  location without actually knowing what type of object is stored there. A void∗ is used for that. You can read void∗ as ‘‘pointer to an object of unknown type.’’   Section 7.2.1  void∗  173  A pointer to any type of object can be assigned to a variable of type void∗, but a pointer to func- tion  §12.5  or a pointer to member  §20.6  cannot. In addition, a void∗ can be assigned to another void∗, void∗s can be compared for equality and inequality, and a void∗ can be explicitly converted to another type. Other operations would be unsafe because the compiler cannot know what kind of object is really pointed to. Consequently, other operations result in compile-time errors. To  use a void∗, we must explicitly convert it to a pointer to a speciﬁc type. For example:  void f int∗ pi  {  void∗ pv = pi; ∗pv;  ++pv;      ok: implicit conversion of int* to void*    error :can’t dereference void*    error :can’t increment void*  the sizeofthe object pointed to is unknown   int∗ pi2 = static_cast  pv ;      explicit conversion backtoint*  double∗ pd1 = pv; double∗ pd2 = pi; double∗ pd3 = static_cast  pv ;      error    error    unsafe §11.5.2   }  In general, it is not safe to use a pointer that has been converted  ‘‘cast’’  to a type that differs from the type of the object pointed to. For example, a machine may assume that every double is allo- cated on an 8-byte boundary. If so, strange behavior could arise if pi pointed to an int that wasn’t allocated  that  way. This  form  of  explicit  type  conversion  is  inherently  unsafe  and  ugly. Conse- quently, the notation used, static_cast  §11.5.2 , was designed to be ugly and easy to ﬁnd in code.  The  primary  use  for void∗ is  for  passing  pointers  to  functions  that  are  not  allowed  to  make assumptions about the type of the object and for returning untyped objects from functions. To  use such an object, we must use explicit type conversion.  Functions using void∗ pointers typically exist at the very lowest level of the system, where real  hardware resources are manipulated. For example:  void∗ my_alloc siz e_t n ;      allocate n bytes from myspecial heap  Occurrences of void∗s at higher levels of the system should be viewed with great suspicion because they are likely indicators of design errors. Where used for optimization, void∗ can be hidden behind a type-safe interface  §27.3.1 .  Pointers to functions  §12.5  and pointers to members  §20.6  cannot be assigned to void∗s.  7.2.2 nullptr The literal nullptr represents the null pointer, that is, a pointer that does not point to an object. It can be assigned to any pointer type, but not to other built-in types:  int∗ pi = nullptr; double∗ pd = nullptr; int i = nullptr;      error :iisnot a pointer  There  is  just  one nullptr, which  can  be  used  for  every  pointer  type,  rather  than  a  null  pointer  for each pointer type.   174   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  Before nullptr was introduced, zero  0  was used as a notation for the null pointer. For example: int∗ x = 0;    xgets the value nullptr  No object is allocated with the address 0, and 0  the all-zeros bit pattern  is the most common repre- sentation of nullptr. Zero  0  is an int. Howev er, the standard conversions  §10.5.2.3  allow 0 to be used as a constant of pointer or pointer-to-member type.  It has been popular to deﬁne a macro NULL to represent the null pointer. For example: int∗ p = NULL;     using the macro NULL  However, there are differences in the deﬁnition of NULL in different implementations; for example, NULL might be 0 or 0L. In C, NULL is typically  void∗ 0, which makes it illegal in C++  §7.2.1 :  int∗ p = NULL;     error :can’t assign a void* to an int*  Using nullptr makes  code  more  readable  than  alternatives and  avoids  potential  confusion  when  a function is overloaded to accept either a pointer or an integer  §12.3.1 .  7.3  Arrays For a type T, T[size] is the type ‘‘array of size elements of type T.’’ The elements are indexed from 0 to size−1. For example:  ﬂoat v[3]; char∗ a[32];      an array ofthree ﬂoats: v[0], v[1], v[2]    an array of32pointers to char:a[0] .. a[31]  You can access an array using the subscript operator, [], or through a pointer  using operator ∗ or operator []; §7.4 .  For example:  void f   {  }  }  void f int n  {  int aa[10]; aa[6] = 9; int x = aa[99];     assign to aa’s7th element    undeﬁned behavior  Access  out  of  the  range  of  an  array  is  undeﬁned  and  usually  disastrous. In  particular, run-time range checking is neither guaranteed nor common.  The number of elements of the array, the array bound, must be a constant expression  §10.4 . If  you need variable bounds, use a vector  §4.4.1, §31.4 . For example:  int v1[n]; vector  v2 n ;     error :array sizenot a constant expression    OK: vector with n int elements  Multidimensional arrays are represented as arrays of arrays  §7.4.2 .  An array is C++’s fundamental way of representing a sequence of objects in memory. If what you want is a simple ﬁxed-length sequence of objects of a given type in memory, an array is the ideal solution. For every other need, an array has serious problems.   Section 7.3  Arrays   175  An array can be allocated statically, on the stack, and on the free store  §6.4.2 . For example:  int a1[10];  void f   {  int a2 [20]; int∗p = new int[40];     ...  }     10 ints in static storage     20 ints on the stack    40 ints on the free store  The C++ built-in array is an inherently low-level facility that should primarily be used inside the implementation of higher-level, better-behaved, data structures, such as the standard-library vector or array. There is no array assignment, and the name of an array implicitly converts to a pointer to its ﬁrst element at the slightest provocation  §7.4 . In particular, avoid arrays in interfaces  e.g., as function arguments; §7.4.3, §12.2.2  because the implicit conversion to pointer is the root cause of many common errors in C code and C-style C++ code. If you allocate an array on the free store, be sure to delete[] its pointer once only and only after its last use  §11.2.2 . That’s most easily and most  reliably  done  by  having  the  lifetime  of  the  free-store  array  controlled  by  a  resource  handle  e.g., string  §19.3, §36.3 , vector  §13.6, §34.2 , or unique_ptr  §34.3.1  .  If you allocate an array statically  or  on  the  stack,  be  sure  never to delete[] it.  Obviously, C programmers  cannot  follow these pieces of advice because C lacks the ability to encapsulate arrays, but that doesn’t make the advice bad in the context of C++.  One of the most widely used kinds of arrays is a zero-terminated array of char. That’s the way C stores strings, so a zero-terminated array of char is often called a C-style string. C++ string liter- als follow that convention  §7.3.2 , and some standard-library functions  e.g., strcpy   and strcmp  ; §43.4  rely on it. Often, a char∗ or a const char∗ is assumed to point to a zero-terminated sequence of characters.  7.3.1  Array Initializers An array can be initialized by a list of values.  For example:  int v1[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }; char v2[] = { 'a', 'b', 'c', 0 };  When an array is declared without a speciﬁc size, but with an initializer list, the size is calculated by  counting  the  elements  of  the  initializer  list. Consequently, v1 and v2 are  of  type int[4] and char[4], respectively. If a size is explicitly speciﬁed, it is an error to give surplus elements in an ini- tializer list. For example:  char v3[2] = { 'a', 'b', 0 }; char v4[3] = { 'a', 'b', 0 };     error :too manyinitializers    OK  If the initializer supplies too few elements for an array, 0 is used for the rest. For example:  int v5[8] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };  is equivalent to  int v5[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 , 0, 0, 0, 0 };   176   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  There  is  no  built-in  copy operation  for  arrays. You cannot  initialize  one  array  with  another   not ev en of exactly the same type , and there is no array assignment:  int v6[8] = v5; v6 = v5;     error :can’t copyanarray  cannot assign an int* to an array     error :no array assignment  Similarly, you can’t pass arrays by value.  See also §7.4.  When  you  need  assignment  to  a  collection  of  objects,  use  a vector  §4.4.1,  §13.6,  §34.2 ,  an  array  §8.2.4 , or a valarray  §40.5  instead.  An array of characters can be conveniently initialized by a string literal  §7.3.2 .  7.3.2  String Literals A string literal is a character sequence enclosed within double quotes:  A string literal contains one more character than it appears to have; it is terminated by the null char- acter, '\0', with the value 0. For example:  The type of a string literal is ‘‘array of the appropriate number of const characters,’’ so "Bohr" is of type const char[5].  In C and in older C++ code, you could assign a string literal to a non-const char∗:  "this is a string"  sizeof "Bohr" ==5  void f   {  char∗ p = "Plato";  p[4] = 'e';     error,but accepted in pre-C++11-standard code    error :assignment to const  It would obviously be unsafe to accept that assignment. It was  and is  a source of subtle errors, so please don’t grumble too much if some old code fails to compile for this reason. Having string lit- erals immutable is not only obvious but also allows implementations to do signiﬁcant optimizations in the way string literals are stored and accessed.  If we want a string that we are guaranteed to be able to modify, we must place the characters in  }  }  }  a non-const array:  void f   {  char p[] = "Zeno"; p[0] = 'R';     pisanarray of5char    OK  const char∗ error_message int i  {     ... return "range error";  A string literal is statically allocated so that it is safe to return one from a function. For example:   Section 7.3.2  String Literals  177  The memory holding "range error" will not go away after a call of error_message  .  Whether  two identical  string  literals  are  allocated  as  one  array  or  as  two is implementation-  deﬁned  §6.1 . For example:  const char∗ p = "Heraclitus"; const char∗ q = "Heraclitus";  void g   {  }  if  p == q  cout << "one!\n";    ...     the result is implementation-deﬁned  Note  that == compares  addresses   pointer  values   when  applied  to  pointers,  and  not  the  values pointed to.  The  empty  string  is  written  as  a  pair  of  adjacent  double  quotes, "", and  has  the  type const  char[1]. The one character of the empty string is the terminating '\0'.  The  backslash  convention  for  representing  nongraphic  characters   §6.2.3.2   can  also  be  used within a string. This makes it possible to represent the double quote  "  and the escape character backslash  \  within a string. The most common such character by far is the newline character, '\n'. For example:  cout<<"beep at end of message\a\n";  The escape character, '\a', is the ASCII character BEL  also known as alert , which causes a sound to be emitted.  It is not possible to have a ‘‘real’’ newline in a  nonraw  string literal:  "this is not a string but a syntax error"  Long strings can be broken by whitespace to make the program text neater. For example:  char alpha[] = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"  "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";  The compiler will concatenate adjacent strings, so alpha could equivalently have been initialized by the single string  "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";  It is possible to have the null character in a string, but most programs will not suspect that there are characters after it. For example, the string "Jens\000Munk" will be treated as "Jens" by standard- library functions such as strcpy   and strlen  ; see §43.4.  7.3.2.1  Raw Character Strings  To  represent a backslash  \  or a double quote  "  in a string literal, we have  to precede it with a backslash.  That’s logical and in most cases quite simple. However, if we need a lot of backslashes and a lot of quotes in string literals, this simple technique becomes unmanageable. In particular, in regular  expressions  a  backslash  is  used  both  as  an  escape  character  and  to  introduce  characters   178   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  representing character classes  §37.1.1 . This is a convention shared by many programming lan- guages, so we can’t just change it. Therefore, when you write regular expressions for use with the standard regex library   Chapter  37 ,  the  fact  that  a  backslash  is  an  escape  character  becomes  a notable source of errors. Consider how to write the pattern representing two words separated by a backslash  \ :  string s = "\\w\\\\w";     Ihope I got that right  To  prevent the frustration and errors caused by this clash of conventions, C++ provides raw string literals. A raw string literal is a string literal where a backslash is just a backslash  and a double quote is just a double quote  so that our example becomes:  string s = R" \w\\w ";     I’m pretty sure I got that right  Raw string literals use the R" ccc " notation for a sequence of characters ccc. The initial R is there to distinguish raw string literals from ordinary string literals. The parentheses are there to allow  ‘‘unescaped’’  double quotes. For example:  R" "quoted string" "     the string is "quoted string"  So,  how do we get  the  character  sequence  " into  a  raw string  literal? Fortunately, that’s a rare problem, but "  and  " is only the default delimiter pair. We can add delimiters before the   and after the   in " ... ". For example:  R"∗∗∗ "quoted string containing the usual terminator  "  " ∗∗∗"     "quoted string containing the usual terminator  "  "  The character sequence after the   must be identical to the sequence before the  . This way we can cope with  almost  arbitrarily complicated patterns.  Unless you work with regular expressions, raw string literals are probably just a curiosity  and one more thing to learn , but regular expressions are useful and widely used. Consider a real-world example:  " ' ?:[ˆ\\\\']\\\\. ∗'\" ?:[ˆ\\\\\"]\\\\. ∗\" "      Are the ﬁvebackslashes correct or not?  With examples like that, even experts easily become confused, and raw string literals provide a sig- niﬁcant service.  In contrast to nonraw string literals, a raw string literal can contain a newline.  For example:  string counts {R" 1 22 333 "};  is equivalent to  string x {"1\n22\n333"};  7.3.2.2  Larger Character Sets  A string with the preﬁx L, such as L"angst", is a string of wide characters  §6.2.3 . Its type is const wchar_t[]. Similarly, a string with the preﬁx LR, such as LR" angst ", is a raw  string  §7.3.2.1  of wide characters of type const wchar_t[]. Such a string is terminated by a L'\0' character.   Section 7.3.2.2  Larger Character Sets  179  There  are  six  kinds  of  character  literals  supporting  Unicode   Unicode  literals .  This sounds excessive, but there are three major encodings of Unicode: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. For each of these three alternatives, both raw and ‘‘ordinary’’ strings are supported. All three UTF encod- ings support all Unicode characters, so which you use depends on the system you need to ﬁt into. Essentially all Internet applications  e.g., browsers and email  rely on one or more of these encod- ings.  UTF-8  is  a  variable-width  encoding:  common  characters  ﬁt  into  1  byte,  less  frequently  used characters  by some estimate of use  into 2 bytes, and rarer characters into 3 or 4 bytes. In particu- lar, the ASCII characters ﬁt into 1 byte with the same encodings  integer values  in UTF-8 as in ASCII. The various Latin alphabets, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, and more ﬁt into 2 bytes. A UTF-8 string is terminated by '\0', a UTF-16 string by u'\0', and a UTF-32 string by U'\0'. We  can  represent  an  ordinary  English  character  string  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Consider a ﬁle  name using a backslash as the separator:  "folder\\ﬁle"  R" folder\ﬁle "  u8"folder\\ﬁle"  u8R" folder\ﬁle "  u"folder\\ﬁle"  uR" folder\ﬁle "  U"folder\\ﬁle"  UR" folder\ﬁle "      implementation character set string    implementation character raw set string    UTF-8 string    UTF-8 raw str ing    UTF-16 string     UTF-16 raw str ing     UTF-32 string     UTF-32 raw str ing  If printed, these strings will all look the same, but except for the ‘‘plain’’ and UTF-8 strings their internal representations are likely to differ.  Obviously, the real purpose of Unicode strings is to be able to put Unicode characters into them.  For example:  u8"The ofﬁcial vowels in Danish are: a, e, i, o, u, \u00E6, \u00F8, \u00E5 and y."  Printing that string appropriately gives you  The ofﬁcial vowels in Danish are: a, e, i, o, u, æ, ø, å and y.  The hexadecimal number after the \u is a Unicode code point  §iso.2.14.3  [Unicode,1996]. Such a code point is independent of the encoding used and will in fact have different representations  as bits  in  bytes   in  different  encodings. For example, u'0430'  Cyrillic  lowercase  letter  ‘‘a’’   is  the 2-byte hexadecimal value D0B0 in UTF-8, the 2-byte hexadecimal value 0403 in UTF-16, and the 4-byte hexadecimal value 00000403 in UTF-32. These hexadecimal values are referred to as univer- sal character names.  The order of the us and Rs and their cases are signiﬁcant: RU and Ur are not valid string preﬁxes.  7.4  Pointers into Arrays In C++, pointers and arrays are closely related. The name of an array can be used as a pointer to its initial element. For example:   180   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  int v[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }; int∗ p1 = v; int∗ p2 = &v[0]; int∗ p3 = v+4;  or graphically:     pointer to initial element  implicit conversion     pointer to initial element    pointer to one-beyond-last element  p1  p2  p3  v:  1  2  3  4  Taking  a  pointer  to  the  element  one  beyond  the  end  of  an  array  is  guaranteed  to  work.  This is important for many algorithms  §4.5, §33.1 . However, since such a pointer does not in fact point to  an  element  of  the  array, it may  not  be  used  for  reading  or  writing. The  result  of  taking  the address of the element before the initial element or beyond one-past-the-last element is undeﬁned and should be avoided.  For example:  int∗ p4 = v−1; int∗ p5 = v+7;     before the beginning, undeﬁned: don’t do it    beyond the end, undeﬁned: don’t do it  The implicit conversion of an array name to a pointer to the initial element of the array is exten- sively used in function calls in C-style code. For example:  extern "C" int strlen const char∗ ;      from    void f   {  }  char v[] = "Annemarie"; char∗ p = v; strlen p ; strlen v ;  v = p;     implicit conversion of char[] to char*     implicit conversion of char[] to char*    error :cannot assign to array  The same value is passed to the standard-library function strlen   in both calls. The snag is that it is impossible to avoid the implicit conversion.  In other words, there is no way of declaring a function so that the array v is copied when the function is called. Fortunately, there is no implicit or explicit conversion from a pointer to an array.  The implicit conversion of the array argument to a pointer means that the size of the array is lost to the called function. However, the called function must somehow determine the size to perform a meaningful operation. Like other C standard-library functions taking pointers to characters, strlen   relies  on  zero  to  indicate  end-of-string; strlen p  returns  the  number  of  characters  up  to  and  not including the terminating 0. This is all pretty low-level.  The standard-library vector  §4.4.1, §13.6, §31.4 , array  §8.2.4, §34.2.1 , and string  §4.2  don’t suffer from this problem. These library types give their number of elements as their size   without having to count elements each time.   Section 7.4.1  Navigating Arrays  181  7.4.1  Navigating Arrays Efﬁcient  and  elegant  access  to  arrays   and  similar  data  structures   is  the  key  to many algorithms  see §4.5, Chapter 32 . Access can be achieved either through a pointer to an array plus an index or through a pointer to an element. For example:  void ﬁ char v[]  {  for  int i = 0; v[i]!=0; ++i   use v[i] ;  void fp char v[]  {  for  char∗ p = v;∗p!=0; ++p   use ∗p ;  }  }  }  The preﬁx ∗ operator dereferences a pointer so that ∗p is the character pointed to by p, and ++ incre- ments the pointer so that it refers to the next element of the array.  There is no inherent reason why one version should be faster than the other. With modern com- pilers,  identical  code  should  be   and  usually  is   generated  for  both  examples.  Programmers can choose between the versions on logical and aesthetic grounds.  Subscripting  a  built-in  array  is  deﬁned  in  terms  of  the  pointer  operations + and ∗. For  every  built-in array a and integer j within the range of a, we hav e:  a[j] == ∗ &a[0]+j  == ∗ a+j  == ∗ j+a  == j[a]  It  usually  surprises  people  to  ﬁnd  that a[j]==j[a]. For  example, 3["Texas"]=="Texas"[3]=='a'. Such cleverness  has  no  place  in  production  code. These  equivalences  are  pretty  low-level and  do  not hold for standard-library containers, such as array and vector.  The result of applying the arithmetic operators +, −, ++, or −− to pointers depends on the type of the object pointed to. When an arithmetic operator is applied to a pointer p of type T∗, p is assumed to point to an element of an array of objects of type T; p+1 points to the next element of that array, and p−1 points to the previous element. This implies that the integer value of p+1 will be sizeof T  larger than the integer value of p. For example:  return reinterpret_cast  q −reinterpret_cast  p ;  template  int byte_diff T∗ p, T∗ q  {  void diff_test   {  int vi[10]; short vs[10];   182   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  cout << vi << ' ' << &vi[1] << ' ' << &vi[1]−&vi[0] << ' ' << byte_diff &vi[0],&vi[1]  << '\n'; cout << vs << ' ' << &vs[1] << ' ' << &vs[1]−&vs[0] << ' ' << byte_diff &vs[0],&vs[1]  << '\n';  This produced:  0x7fffaef0 0x7fffaef4 1 4 0x7fffaedc 0x7fffaede 1 2  The  pointer  values  were  printed  using  the  default  hexadecimal  notation. This  shows  that  on  my implementation, sizeof short  is 2 and sizeof int  is 4.  Subtraction of pointers is deﬁned only when both pointers point to elements of the same array  although the language has no fast way of ensuring that is the case . When subtracting a pointer p from another pointer q, q−p, the result is the number of array elements in the sequence [p:q   an integer .  One can add an integer to a pointer or subtract an integer from a pointer; in both cases, the result is a pointer value.  If that value does not point to an element of the same array as the original pointer or one beyond, the result of using that value is undeﬁned. For example:  void f   {  int v1[10]; int v2[10];  int i1 = &v1[5]−&v1[3]; int i2 = &v1[5]−&v2[3];     i1 = 2    result undeﬁned  int∗ p1 = v2+2; int∗ p2 = v2−2;     p1 = &v2[2]    *p2 undeﬁned  Complicated  pointer  arithmetic  is  usually  unnecessary  and  best  avoided.  Addition of  pointers makes no sense and is not allowed.  Arrays are not self-describing because the number of elements of an array is not guaranteed to be stored with the array. This implies that to traverse an array that does not contain a terminator the way C-style strings do, we must somehow supply the number of elements. For example:  use v[i] ;      hope that v has at least sizeelements     error :range-for does not wor kforpointers  void fp char v[], int size  {  for  int i=0; i!=size; ++i   for  int x : v  use x ;   const int N = 7; char v2[N]; for  int i=0; i!=N; ++i   use v2[i] ;  for  int x : v2  use x ;      range-for wor ksforarraysofknown size  }  }  }   Section 7.4.1  Navigating Arrays  183  This array concept is inherently low-level.  Most advantages of the built-in array and few of the dis- advantages can be obtained through the use of the standard-library container array  §8.2.4, §34.2.1 . Some C++ implementations offer optional range checking for arrays. However, such checking can be quite expensive, so it is often used only as a development aid  rather than being included in pro- duction code . If you are not using range checking for individual accesses, try to maintain a consis- tent policy of accessing elements only in well-deﬁned ranges. That is best done when arrays are manipulated through the interface of a higher-level container type, such as vector, where it is harder to get confused about the range of valid elements.  7.4.2  Multidimensional Arrays Multidimensional arrays are represented as arrays of arrays; a 3-by-5 array is declared like this:  int ma[3][5];     3arrayswith 5 ints each  We can initialize ma like this:  void init_ma   {  for  int i = 0; i!=3; i++   for  int j = 0; j!=5; j++  ma[i][j] = 10∗i+j;  }  or graphically:  void print_ma   {  for  int i = 0; i!=3; i++  {  for  int j = 0; j!=5; j++   cout << ma[i][j] << '\t';  cout << '\n';  }  }  ma:  00  01 02 03 04 10 11 12 13 14 20 21 22 23 24  The array ma is simply 15 ints that we access as if it were 3 arrays of 5 ints.  In particular, there is no single object in memory that is the matrix ma – only the elements are stored. The dimensions 3 and 5 exist in the compiler source only. When we write code, it is our job to remember them some- how and supply the dimensions where needed. For example, we might print ma like this:  The comma notation used for array bounds in some languages cannot be used in C++ because the comma  ,  is a sequencing operator  §10.3.2 . Fortunately, most mistakes are caught by the com- piler. For example:  int bad[3,5]; int good[3][5]; int ouch = good[1,4];  int nice = good[1][4];     error :comma not allowedinconstant expression    3arrayswith 5 ints each    error :int initialized byint*  good[1,4] means good[4], which is an int*    184   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  7.4.3  Passing Arrays Arrays cannot directly be passed by value.  Instead, an array is passed as a pointer to its ﬁrst ele- ment.  For example:     arg is a double*  void comp double arg[10]   {  for  int i=0; i!=10; ++i   arg[i]+=99;  }  void f   {  double a1[10]; double a2[5]; double a3[100];  comp a1 ; comp a2 ;  comp a3 ;   void comp double∗ arg  {  for  int i=0; i!=10; ++i   arg[i]+=99;  };  }  void print_m35 int m[3][5]  {  for  int i = 0; i!=3; i++  {  for  int j = 0; j!=5; j++   cout << m[i][j] << '\t';  cout << '\n';  }  }     disaster!    uses only the ﬁrst 10 elements  This code looks sane, but it is not. The code compiles, but the call comp a2  will write beyond the bounds of a2. Also, anyone who guessed that the array was passed by value will be disappointed: the writes to arg[i] are writes directly to the elements of comp  ’s  argument, rather than to a copy. The function could equivalently have been written as  Now the insanity is  hopefully  obvious.  When used as a function argument, the ﬁrst dimension of an array is simply treated as a pointer. Any array bound speciﬁed is simply ignored. This implies that  if  you  want  to  pass  a  sequence  of  elements  without  losing  size  information,  you  should  not pass a built-in array. Instead, you can place the array inside a class as a member  as is done for std::array  or deﬁne a class that acts as a handle  as is done for std::string and std::vector .  If you insist on using arrays directly, you will have to deal with bugs and confusion without get- ting noticeable advantages in return. Consider deﬁning a function to manipulate a two-dimensional matrix.  If the dimensions are known at compile time, there is no problem:   Section 7.4.3  Passing Arrays  185  A matrix represented as a multidimensional array is passed as a pointer  rather than copied; §7.4 . The ﬁrst dimension of an array is irrelevant to ﬁnding the location of an element; it simply states how many elements  here, 3  of the appropriate type  here, int[5]  are present. For example, look at the layout of ma above and note that by knowing only that the second dimension is 5, we can locate ma[i][5] for any i. The ﬁrst dimension can therefore be passed as an argument:  void print_mi5 int m[][5], int dim1  {  for  int i = 0; i!=dim1; i++  { for  int j = 0; j!=5; j++   cout << m[i][j] << '\t';  cout << '\n';  }  }  }  }  }  }  When both dimensions need to be passed, the ‘‘obvious solution’’ does not work:     doesn’t behave asmost people would think  void print_mij int m[][], int dim1, int dim2  {  for  int i = 0; i!=dim1; i++  {  for  int j = 0; j!=dim2; j++  cout << m[i][j] << '\t';  cout << '\n';     sur prise!  Fortunately, the argument declaration m[][] is illegal because the second dimension of a multidimen- sional array must be known in order to ﬁnd the location of an element. However,  the expression m[i][j] is  correctly  interpreted as ∗ ∗ m+i +j , although that is unlikely to be what the programmer intended.  A correct solution is:  void print_mij int∗ m, int dim1, int dim2  {  for  int i = 0; i!=dim1; i++  {  for  int j = 0; j!=dim2; j++   cout << m[i∗dim2+j] << '\t';    obscure  cout << '\n';  The expression used for accessing the members in print_mij   is equivalent to the one the compiler generates when it knows the last dimension.  To call this function, we pass a matrix as an ordinary pointer:  int test   {  };  int v[3][5] = {  {0,1,2,3,4}, {10,11,12,13,14}, {20,21,22,23,24}   186   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  print_m35 v ; print_mi5 v,3 ; print_mij &v[0][0],3,5 ;  Note the use of &v[0][0] for the last call; v[0] would do because it is equivalent, but v would be a type error. This kind of subtle and messy code is best hidden. If you must deal directly with multi- dimensional arrays, consider encapsulating the code relying on it. In that way, you might ease the task  of  the  next  programmer  to  touch  the  code. Providing  a  multidimensional  array  type  with  a proper subscripting operator saves most users from having to worry about the layout of the data in the array  §29.2.2, §40.5.2 .  The standard vector  §31.4  doesn’t suffer from these problems.  7.5  Pointers and const C++ offers two related meanings of ‘‘constant’’:   cid:129   cid:129   constexpr: Evaluate at compile time  §2.2.3, §10.4 . const: Do not modify in this scope  §2.2.3 .  Basically, constexpr’s  role  is  to  enable  and  ensure  compile-time  evaluation,  whereas const’s  pri- mary role is to specify immutability in interfaces.  This section is primarily concerned with the sec- ond role: interface speciﬁcation.  Many objects don’t hav e their values changed after initialization:  cid:129  Symbolic constants lead to more maintainable code than using literals directly in code.  cid:129  Many pointers are often read through but never written through.  cid:129  Most function parameters are read but not written to.  To  express this notion of immutability after initialization, we can add const to the deﬁnition of an object.  For example:  const int model = 90; const int v[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }; const int x;     model is a const    v[i] is a const    error :no initializer  Because an object declared const cannot be assigned to, it must be initialized.  Declaring something const ensures that its value will not change within its scope:  Note that const modiﬁes a type; it restricts the ways in which an object can be used, rather than specifying how the constant is to be allocated. For example:  void f   {  model = 200; v[2] = 3;     error    error  void g const X∗ p  {     can’t modify *p here  }  }  }   Section 7.5  Pointers and const  187  When using a pointer, two objects are involved: the pointer itself and the object pointed to. ‘‘Pre- ﬁxing’’ a declaration of a pointer with const makes the object, but not the pointer, a constant.  To declare  a  pointer  itself,  rather  than  the  object  pointed  to,  to  be  a  constant,  we  use  the  declarator operator ∗const instead of plain ∗. For example:  void h   {  X val;  g &val ;    ...     valcan be modiﬁed here  }  }  void f1 char∗ p  {  char s[] = "Gorm";  const char∗ pc = s; pc[3] = 'g'; pc = p;  char ∗const cp = s; cp[3] = 'a'; cp = p;     pointer to constant    error :pc points to constant    OK     constant pointer    OK    error :cp is constant  const char ∗const cpc = s; cpc[3] = 'a'; cpc = p;     const pointer to const    error :cpc points to constant    error :cpc is constant  The declarator operator that makes a pointer constant is ∗const. There is no const∗ declarator oper- ator, so a const appearing before the ∗ is taken to be part of the base type. For example:  char ∗const cp; char const∗ pc;  const char∗ pc2;      const pointer to char    pointer to const char    pointer to const char  Some  people  ﬁnd  it  helpful  to  read  such  declarations  right-to-left,  for  example,  ‘‘cp is  a const pointer to a char’’ and ‘‘pc2 is a pointer to a char const.’’  An object that is a constant when accessed through one pointer may be variable when accessed in other ways.  This is particularly useful for function arguments.  By declaring a pointer argument const, the function is prohibited from modifying the object pointed to. For example:  const char∗ strchr const char∗ p, char c ; char∗ strchr char∗ p, char c ;     ﬁnd ﬁrst occurrence of c in p    ﬁnd ﬁrst occurrence of c in p  The ﬁrst version is used for strings where the elements mustn’t be modiﬁed and returns a pointer to const that does not allow modiﬁcation.  The second version is used for mutable strings.  You can assign the address of a non-const variable to a pointer to constant because no harm can come from that. However,  the address of a constant cannot be assigned to an unrestricted pointer because this would allow the object’s value to be changed. For example:   188   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  void f4   {  int a = 1; const int c = 2; const int∗ p1 = &c; const int∗ p2 = &a; int∗ p3 = &c; ∗p3 = 7;     OK    OK    error :initialization of int* with const int*    tr yto change the value of c  It  is  possible,  but  typically  unwise,  to  explicitly  remove the  restrictions  on  a  pointer  to const by explicit type conversion  §16.2.9, §11.5 .  7.6  Pointers and Ownership A resource is something that has to be acquired and later released  §5.2 . Memory acquired by new and released by delete  §11.2  and ﬁles opened by fopen   and closed by fclose    §43.2  are exam- ples of resources where the most direct handle to the resource is a pointer. This can be most con- fusing because a pointer is easily passed around in a program, and there is nothing in the type sys- tem that distinguishes a pointer that owns a resource from one that does not. Consider:  }  }  }  void confused int∗ p  {     delete p?  int global {7};  void f   {  X∗ pn = new int{7}; int i {7}; int q = &i; confused pn ; confused q ; confused &global ;  If confused    deletes p the program will seriously misbehave for the second two calls because we may not delete objects not allocated by new  §11.2 .  If confused   does not delete  p the program leaks  §11.2.1 . In this case, obviously f   must manage the lifetime of the object it creates on the free store, but in general keeping track of what needs to be deleted in a large program requires a simple and consistent strategy.  It is usually a good idea to immediately place a pointer that represents ownership in a resource handle class, such as vector, string, and unique_ptr. That way, we can assume that every pointer that is  not  within  a  resource  handle  is  not  an  owner  and  must  not  be deleted.  Chapter 13  discusses resource management in greater detail.   Section 7.7  References   189  7.7  References A pointer allows us to pass potentially large amounts of data around at low cost: instead of copying the data we simply pass its address as a pointer value.  The type of the pointer determines what can be done to the data through the pointer. Using a pointer differs from using the name of an object in a few ways:   cid:129  We use a different syntax, for example, ∗p instead of obj and p−>m rather than obj.m.  cid:129  We can make a pointer point to different objects at different times.  cid:129  We must be more careful when using pointers than when using an object directly: a pointer  may be a nullptr or point to an object that wasn’t the one we expected.  These  differences  can  be  annoying;  for  example,  some  programmers  ﬁnd f &x  ugly  compared  to f x . Worse, managing pointer variables with varying values and protecting code against the possi- bility of nullptr can be a signiﬁcant burden.  Finally, when we want to overload an operator, say +, we  want  to  write x+y rather  than &x+&y. The  language  mechanism  addressing  these  problems  is called a reference. Like a pointer, a reference is an alias for an object, is usually implemented to hold  a  machine  address  of  an  object,  and  does  not  impose  performance  overhead  compared  to pointers, but it differs from a pointer in that:   cid:129  You access a reference with exactly the same syntax as the name of an object.  cid:129  A reference always refers to the object to which it was initialized.  cid:129  There  is  no  ‘‘null  reference,’’  and  we  may  assume  that  a  reference  refers  to  an  object  A reference is an alternative name for an object, an alias. The main use of references is for specify- ing arguments and return values for functions in general and for overloaded operators  Chapter 18  in particular. For example:  T& operator[] int i  { return elem[i]; } const T& operator[] int i  const { return elem[i]; }     returnreference to element    returnreference to const element  void push_back const T& a ;    ...     pass element to be added byreference  void f const vector & v  {  double d1 = v[1]; v[2] = 7;     copythe value of the double referred to byv.operator[] 1  into d1    place 7 in the double referred to bythe result of v.operator[] 2   v.push_back d1 ;      givepush_back   a reference to d1 to wor kwith  The idea of passing function arguments by reference is as old as high-level programming languages  the ﬁrst version of Fortran used that .   §7.7.4 .  template  class vector { T∗ elem;    ...  public:  };  }   190   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  To reﬂect the lvalue rvalue and const non-const distinctions, there are three kinds of references:  cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   lvalue references: to refer to objects whose value we want to change const references: to refer to objects whose value we do not want to change  e.g., a constant  rvalue references: to refer to objects whose value we do not need to preserve after we have used it  e.g., a temporary   Collectively, they are called references. The ﬁrst two are both called lvalue references.  7.7.1  Lvalue References In a type name, the notation X& means ‘‘reference to X.’’ It is used for references to lvalues, so it is often called an lvalue reference. For example:  void f   {  int var = 1; int& r {var};  int x = r;     rand var nowrefer to the same int    xbecomes 1  r = 2;     varbecomes 2  }  }  int var = 1; int& r1 {var};  int& r2; extern int& r3;     OK: r1 initialized    error :initializer missing    OK: r3 initialized elsewhere  void g   {  int var = 0; int& rr {var}; ++rr;  int∗ pp = &rr;     varisincremented to 1    pp points to var  To  ensure that a reference is a name for something  that is, that it is bound to an object , we must initialize the reference. For example:  Initialization  of  a  reference  is  something  quite  different  from  assignment  to  it. Despite  appear- ances, no operator operates on a reference. For example:  Here, ++rr does not increment the reference rr; rather, ++ is applied to the int to which rr refers, that is, to var. Consequently, the value of a reference cannot be changed after initialization; it always refers to the object it was initialized to denote. To get a pointer to the object denoted by a reference rr, we can write &rr. Thus, we cannot have a pointer to a reference. Furthermore, we cannot deﬁne an array of references. In that sense, a reference is not an object.  The obvious implementation of a reference is as a  constant  pointer that is dereferenced each time it is used. It doesn’t do much harm to think about references that way, as long as one remem- bers that a reference isn’t an object that can be manipulated the way a pointer is:   Section 7.7.1  Lvalue References   191  pp:  &ii  rr:  ii:  1  In some cases, the compiler can optimize away a reference so that there is no object representing that reference at run time.  Initialization of a reference is trivial when the initializer is an lvalue  an object whose address  you can take; see §6.4 . The initializer for a ‘‘plain’’ T& must be an lvalue of type T.  The initializer for a const T& need not be an lvalue or even of type T. In such cases: [1]  First, implicit type conversion to T is applied if necessary  see §10.5 . [2]  Then, the resulting value is placed in a temporary variable of type T. [3]  Finally, this temporary variable is used as the value of the initializer.  Consider:  double& dr = 1; const double& cdr {1};     error :lvalue needed    OK  The interpretation of this last initialization might be:  double temp = double{1};  const double& cdr {temp};     ﬁrst create a temporar ywith the right value    then use the temporar yas the initializer for cdr  A temporary created to hold a reference initializer persists until the end of its reference’s scope.  References to variables and references to constants are distinguished because introducing a tem- porary  for  a  variable  would  have  been  highly  error-prone;  an  assignment  to  the  variable  would become an assignment to the – soon-to-disappear – temporary. No such problem exists for refer- ences to constants, and references to constants are often important as function arguments  §18.2.4 . A reference  can  be  used  to  specify  a  function  argument  so  that  the  function  can  change  the  value of an object passed to it. For example:  void increment int& aa  {  ++aa;  void f   {  }  }  int x = 1; increment x ;      x=2  The semantics of argument passing are deﬁned to be those of initialization, so when called, incre- ment’s  argument aa became  another  name  for x. To keep  a  program  readable,  it  is  often  best  to avoid  functions  that  modify  their  arguments.  Instead, you  can  return  a  value  from  the  function explicitly:   192   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  int next int p  { return p+1; }  void g   {  int x = 1; increment x ;  x = next x ;      x=2    x=3  }  }  The increment x  notation doesn’t giv e a clue to the reader that x’s value is being modiﬁed, the way x=next x  does.  Consequently, ‘‘plain’’ reference arguments should be used only where the name of the function gives a strong hint that the reference argument is modiﬁed.  References can also be used as return types. This is mostly used to deﬁne functions that can be used on both the left-hand and right-hand sides of an assignment. A Map is a good example.  For example:  template  class Map { public:     asimple map class  V& operator[] const K& v ;     returnthe value corresponding to the key v  pair ∗ begin   { return &elem[0]; } pair ∗ end   { return &elem[0]+elem.size  ; }  vector > elem;     {key,value} pairs  private:  };  The standard-library map  §4.4.3, §31.4.3  is typically implemented as a red-black tree, but to avoid distracting  implementation  details,  I’ll  just  show an implementation  based  on  linear  search  for  a key match:  template  V& Map ::operator[] const K& k  {  for  auto& x : elem  if  k == x.ﬁrst   return x.second;  elem.push_back {k,V{}} ;  return elem.back  .second;      add pair at end  §4.4.2     returnthe  default  value of the newelement  I pass the key  argument, k, by reference because it might be of a type that is expensive  to copy. Similarly, I return the value by reference because it too might be of a type that is expensive to copy. I use a const reference for k because I don’t want to modify it and because I might want to use a lit- eral or a temporary object as an argument.  I return the result by non-const reference because the user of a Map might very well want to modify the found value.  For example:   Section 7.7.1  Lvalue References   193  int main      count the number of occurrences of each word on input {  Map  buf;  for  string s; cin>>s;  ++buf[s];  for  const auto& x : buf   cout << x.ﬁrst << ": " << x.second << '\n';  }  aa: 5 bb: 3  aa bb bb aa aa bb aa aa  this program will produce  Each time around, the input loop reads one word from the standard input stream cin into the string s  §4.3.2   and  then  updates  the  counter  associated  with  it. Finally, the  resulting  table  of  different words in the input, each with its number of occurrences, is printed. For example, given the input  The  range- for loop  works  for  this  because Map deﬁned begin   and end  , just  as  is  done  for  the standard-library map.  7.7.2  Rvalue References The basic idea of having more than one kind of reference is to support different uses of objects:   cid:129  A non-const lvalue  reference  refers  to  an  object,  to  which  the  user  of  the  reference  can  write.  the user of the reference.   cid:129  A const lvalue reference refers to a constant, which is immutable from the point of view of   cid:129  An rvalue reference refers to a temporary object, which the user of the reference can  and  typically will  modify, assuming that the object will never be used again.  We  want to know if a reference refers to a temporary, because if it does, we can sometimes turn an expensive copy operation into a cheap move operation  §3.3.2, §17.1, §17.5.2 . An object  such as a string or a list  that is represented by a small descriptor pointing to a potentially huge amount of information can be simply and cheaply moved if we know that the source isn’t going to be used again.  The classic  example  is  a  return  value  where  the  compiler  knows  that  a  local  variable returned will never again be used  §3.3.2 .  An rvalue reference can bind to an rvalue, but not to an lvalue.  In that, an rvalue reference is  exactly opposite to an lvalue reference. For example:  string var {"Cambridge"}; string f  ;  string& r1 {var};  string& r2 {f  }; string& r3 {"Princeton"};     lvalue reference,bind r1 to var  an lvalue     lvalue reference,error :f   is an rvalue    lvalue reference,error :cannot bind to temporar y   194   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  string&& rr1 {f  }; string&& rr2 {var};  string&& rr3 {"Oxford"};      rvalue reference,ﬁne: bind rr1 to rvalue  a temporar y     rvalue reference,error :varisanlvalue    rr3 refers to a temporar yholding "Oxford"  const string cr1& {"Harvard"};    OK: maketemporar yand bind to cr1  The && declarator operator means ‘‘rvalue reference.’’  We do not use const rvalue references; most of the beneﬁts from using rvalue references involve writing to the object to which it refers. Both a const lvalue reference and an rvalue reference can bind to an rvalue.  However, the purposes will be fundamentally different:   cid:129  We use rvalue references to implement a ‘‘destructive read’’ for optimization of what would  otherwise have required a copy.   cid:129  We use a const lvalue reference to prevent modiﬁcation of an argument.  An  object  referred  to  by  an  rvalue  reference  is  accessed  exactly  like an object  referred  to  by  an lvalue reference or an ordinary variable name. For example:  Sometimes,  a  programmer  knows  that  an  object  won’t be used  again,  even though  the  compiler does not. Consider:  string f string&& s  {  if  s.size     s[0] = toupper s[0] ;  return s;  template  swap T& a, T& b  {     "old-style swap"  T tmp {a};    nowwehavetwo copies of a    nowwehavetwo copies of b a = b; b = tmp;     nowwehavetwo copies of tmp  aka a   If T is a type for which it can be expensive to copy elements, such as string and vector, this swap   becomes an expensive operation.  Note something curious: we didn’t want any copies at all; we just wanted to move the values of a, b, and tmp around.  We can tell that to the compiler:  template  void swap T& a, T& b  {     "perfect swap"  almost   T tmp {static_cast  a }; a = static_cast  b ;  b = static_cast  tmp ;      the initialization maywrite to a    the assignment maywrite to b    the assignment maywrite to tmp  The result value of static_cast  x  is an rvalue of type T&& for x. An operation that is opti- mized for rvalues can now use its optimization for x. In particular, if a type T has a move construc- tor  §3.3.2, §17.5.2  or a move assignment, it will be used. Consider vector:  }  }  }   };  }  }  Section 7.7.2  Rvalue References   195  template  class vector {     ... vector const vector& r ;    copyconstr uctor copyr’s representation  vector vector&& r ;     move constr uctor "steal" representation from r   vector  s; vector  s2 {s}; vector  s3 {s+"tail" ;     sisanlvalue,souse copyconstr uctor    s+"tail" is an rvalue so pickmoveconstr uctor  The  use  of static_cast in swap   is  a  bit  verbose  and  slightly  prone  to  mistyping,  so  the  standard library  provides  a move   function: move x  means static_cast  x  where X is  the  type  of x. Given that, we can clean up the deﬁnition of swap   a bit:  template  void swap T& a, T& b  {     "perfect swap"  almost   T tmp {move a };  a = move b ;  b = move tmp ;      move from a    move from b    move from tmp  In  contrast  to  the  original swap  , this  latest  version  need  not  make any  copies;  it  will  use  move operations whenever possible.  Since move x  does not move x  it simply produces an rvalue reference to x , it would have been  better if move   had been called rval  , but by now move   has been used for years.  I deemed this swap   ‘‘almost perfect’’ because it will swap only lvalues.  Consider:  void f vector & v  {  swap v,vector {1,2,3} ;     ...     replace v’selements with 1,2,3  It is not uncommon to want to replace the contents of a container with some sort of default value, but this particular swap   cannot do that. A solution is to augment it by two overloads:  template  void swap T&& a, T& b ; template  void swap T& a, T&& b   Our example will be handled by that last version of swap  . The standard library takes a different approach by deﬁning shrink_to_ﬁt   and clear   for vector, string, etc.  §31.3.3  to handle the most common cases of rvalue arguments to swap  :  void f string& s, vector & v  {  s.shrink_to_ﬁt  ;  swap s,string{s} ;      makes.capacity  ==s.size      makes.capacity  ==s.size     196   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  v.clear  ;  swap v.vector {} ;  v = {};      makevempty    makevempty    makevempty  }  Rvalue references can also be used to provide perfect forwarding  §23.5.2.1, §35.5.1 .  All  standard-library  containers  provide  move constructors  and  move assignment   §31.3.2 . Also, their operations that insert new elements, such as insert   and push_back  , hav e versions that take rvalue references.  7.7.3  References to References It you take a reference to a reference to a type, you get a reference to that type, rather than some kind of special reference to reference type. But what kind of reference? Lvalue reference or rvalue reference?  Consider:  using rr_i = int&&; using lr_i = int&; using rr_rr_i = rr_i&&; using lr_rr_i = rr_i&; using rr_lr_i = lr_i&&; using lr_lr_i = lr_i&;     ‘‘int && &&’’isanint&&    ‘‘int && &’’isanint&    ‘‘int & &&’’isanint&    ‘‘int & &’’isanint&  In other words, lvalue reference always wins. This makes sense: nothing we can do with types can change the fact that an lvalue reference refers to an lvalue.  This is sometimes known as reference collapse.  The syntax does not allow  int && & r = i;  Reference to reference can only happen as the result of an alias  §3.4.5, §6.5  or a template type argument  §23.5.2.1 .  7.7.4  Pointers and References Pointers  and  references  are  two mechanisms  for  referring  to  an  object  from  different  places  in  a program without copying.  We can show this similarity graphically:  pp:  &ii  rr:  ii:  1  Each has its strengths and weaknesses.  If you need to change which object to refer to, use a pointer. You can use =, +=, −=, ++, and −−  to change the value of a pointer variable  §11.1.4 . For example:   Section 7.7.4  Pointers and References   197  void fp char∗ p  {  while  ∗p   cout << ++∗p;  void fr char& r  {  while  r   void fr2 char& r  {  char∗ p = &r;  while  ∗p   cout << ++∗p;  }  }  }  };  };  T& m;  public:  Proxy T& mm  :m{mm} {}    ...  T∗ m;  public:  Proxy T∗ mm  :m{mm} {} void rebind T∗ mm  { m = mm; }    ...  Matrix y, z;    ... Matrix x = y+z; Matrix x2 = &y−&z;     OK    error and ugly  cout << ++r;     oops: increments the char referred to,not the reference    near-inﬁnite loop!     get a pointer to the object referred to  Conversely, if you want to be sure that a name always refers to the same object, use a reference. For example:  template  class Proxy {       Proxy refers to the object with which it is initialized  template  class Handle {     Handle refers to its current object  If  you  want  to  use  a  user-deﬁned   overloaded   operator   §18.1   on  something  that  refers  to  an object, use a reference:  Matrix operator+ const Matrix&, const Matrix& ; Matrix operator− const Matrix∗, const Matrix∗ ;      OK    error :no user-deﬁned type argument  It is not possible to  re deﬁne an operator for a pair of built-in types, such as pointers  §18.2.3 .   198   Pointers, Arrays, and References   Chapter 7  If you want a collection of something that refers to an object, you must use a pointer:  int x, y; string& a1[] = {x, y}; string∗ a2[] = {&x, &y}; vector  s1 = {x , y}; vector  s2 = {&x, &y};     error :array ofreferences    OK    error :vector of references    OK  Once we leave the cases where C++ leaves no choice for the programmer, we enter the domain of aesthetics.  Ideally, we will make our choices so as to minimize the probability of error and in par- ticular to maximize readability of code.  If you need a notion of ‘‘no value,’’  pointers offer nullptr. There is no equivalent ‘‘null refer-  ence,’’ so if you need a ‘‘no value,’’ using a pointer may be most appropriate. For example:  void fp X∗ p  {  if  p == nullptr  {    no value  } else {  }     use *p  }  }  }  void fr X& r  {     common style     assume that r is valid and use it  if  &r == &nullX  {     or maybe r==nullX  void fr2 X& r  {     no value  } else {  }     use r  char∗ ident char ∗ p  { return p; }  char& r {∗ident nullptr };     invalid code  If you really want to, you can construct and check for a ‘‘null reference’’ for a particular type:  Obviously, you need to have suitably deﬁned nullX. The style is not idiomatic and I don’t recom- mend it. A programmer is allowed to assume that a reference is valid.  It is possible to create an invalid reference, but you have to go out of your way to do so. For example:  This  code  is  not  valid  C++  code. Don’t write  such  code  even if your  current  implementation doesn’t catch it.   Section 7.8  Advice   199  7.8  Advice [1]  Keep use of pointers simple and straightforward; §7.4.1.

This chapter intro- duces the three most primitive variants of the notion of a user-deﬁned type:   cid:129  A struct  a structure  is a sequence of elements  called members  of arbitrary types.  cid:129  A union is a struct that holds the value of just one of its elements at any one time.  cid:129  An enum  an enumeration  is a type with a set of named constants  called enumerators .  cid:129   enum  class  a scoped enumeration  is an enum where the enumerators are within the scope of the enumeration and no implicit conversions to other types are provided.  Variants of these kinds of simple types have existed since the earliest days of C++. They are pri- marily focused on the representation of data and are the backbone of most C-style programming. The notion of a struct as described here is a simple form of a class  §3.2, Chapter 16 .   202   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  8.2  Structures An array is an aggregate of elements of the same type. In its simplest form, a struct is an aggregate of elements of arbitrary types. For example:  struct Address {  const char∗ name;  int number;  const char∗ street;  const char∗ town;  char state[2]; const char∗ zip;      "Jim Dandy"    61    "South St"    "NewProvidence"    'N' 'J'    "07974"  This deﬁnes a type called Address consisting of the items you need in order to send mail to some- one within the USA. Note the terminating semicolon.  Variables of type Address can be declared exactly like other variables, and the individual mem-  bers can be accessed using the .  dot  operator. For example:  void f   {  Address jd; jd.name = "Jim Dandy"; jd.number = 61;  Address jd = {  "Jim Dandy", 61, "South St", "New Providence", {'N','J'}, "07974"  };  }  };  }  Variables of struct types can be initialized using the {} notation  §6.3.5 . For example:  Note that jd.state could not be initialized by the string "NJ". Strings are terminated by a zero char- acter, '\0', so "NJ" has three characters – one more than will ﬁt into jd.state. I deliberately use rather low-level types for the members to illustrate how that can be done and what kinds of problems it can cause.  Structures are often accessed through pointers using the −>  struct pointer dereference  operator.  For example:  void print_addr Address∗ p  {  cout  name << '\n'   number  street << '\n'  town << '\n'  state[0]  state[1]  zip << '\n';  When p is a pointer, p−>m is equivalent to  ∗p .m.   Section 8.2  Structures   203  Alternatively, a struct can  be  passed  by  reference  and  accessed  using  the .   struct member  access  operator:  void print_addr2 const Address& r  {  cout << r.name << '\n'  << r.number << ' ' << r.street << '\n' << r.town << '\n' << r.state[0] << r.state[1] << ' ' << r.zip << '\n';  }  }  Argument passing is discussed in §12.2.  result from a function. For example:  Address current;  Address set_current Address next  {  address prev = current; current = next; return prev;  Objects of structure types can be assigned, passed as function arguments, and returned as the  Other plausible operations, such as comparison  == and != , are not available by default.  However, the user can deﬁne such operators  §3.2.1.1, Chapter 18 .  8.2.1 struct Layout An object of a struct holds its members in the order they are declared. For example, we might store primitive equipment readout in a structure like this:  struct Readout { char hour; int value; char seq;  };     [0:23]     sequence mark['a':'z']  You could imagine the members of a Readout object laid out in memory like this:  hour: value:  seq:  Members are allocated in memory in declaration order, so the address of hour must be less than the address of value. See also §8.2.6.  However, the size of an object of a struct is not necessarily the sum of the sizes of its members. This  is  because  many machines  require  objects  of  certain  types  to  be  allocated  on  architecture- dependent boundaries or handle such objects much more efﬁciently if they are.  For example, inte- gers  are  often  allocated  on  word  boundaries. On  such  machines,  objects  are  said  to  have  to be properly aligned  §6.2.9 .  This leads  to  ‘‘holes’’ in the  structures. A more  realistic  layout  of  a   204   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  In  this  case,  as  on  many machines, siz eof Readout  is 12, and  not 6 as  one  would  naively  expect from simply adding the sizes of the individual members.  You can  minimize  wasted  space  by  simply  ordering  members  by  size   largest  member  ﬁrst .  Readout on a machine with 4-byte int would be:  hour: value: seq:  For example:  struct Readout {  int value; char hour; char seq;  };  This would give us:     [0:23]    sequence mark['a':'z']  value:  hour,seq :  Note that this still leaves a 2-byte ‘‘hole’’  unused space  in a Readout and siz eof Readout ==8. The reason is that we need to maintain alignment when we put two objects next to each other, say, in an array of Readouts.  The size of an array of 10 Readout objects is 10∗siz eof Readout .  It  is  usually  best  to  order  members  for  readability  and  sort  them  by  size  only  if  there  is  a  demonstrated need to optimize.  Use of multiple access speciﬁers  i.e., public, private, or protected  can affect layout  §20.5 .  8.2.2 struct Names The name of a type becomes available for use immediately after it has been encountered and not just after the complete declaration has been seen. For example:  struct Link {  Link∗ previous; Link∗ successor;  };  };  However, it is not possible to declare new objects of a struct until its complete declaration has been seen.  For example:  struct No_good {  No_good member;     error :recursivedeﬁnition  This is an error because the compiler is not able to determine the size of No_good. To allow two  or   Section 8.2.2  struct Names   205  more  structs to refer to each other, we can declare a name to be the name of a struct. For example:  struct List;     structname declaration: List to be deﬁned later  struct Link {  Link∗ pre; Link∗ suc; List∗ member_of; int data;  struct List {  Link∗ head;  };  };  }  extern S a; S f  ; void g S ; S∗ h S∗ ;  void k S∗ p  {  S a;  Without the ﬁrst declaration of List, use of the pointer type List∗ in the declaration of Link would have been a syntax error.  The name of a struct can be used before the type is deﬁned as long as that use does not require the name of a member or the size of the structure to be known.  However, until the completion of the declaration of a struct, that struct is an incomplete type. For example:  struct S;     ‘‘S’’isthe name of some type  However, many such declarations cannot be used unless the type S is deﬁned:     error :Snot deﬁned; sizeneeded to allocate  f  ;  g a ;  p−>m = 7;     error :Snot deﬁned; sizeneeded to returnvalue    error :Snot deﬁned; sizeneeded to pass argument    error :Snot deﬁned; member name not known  S∗ q = h p ;  q−>m = 7;     ok: pointers can be allocated and passed    error :Snot deﬁned; member name not known  For reasons that reach into the prehistory of C, it is possible to declare a struct and a non-struct with the same name in the same scope. For example:  struct stat {  * ...*  }; int stat char∗ name, struct stat∗ buf ;  In that case, the plain name  stat  is the name of the non-struct, and the struct must be referred to with the preﬁx struct. Similarly, the keywords class, union  §8.3 , and enum  §8.4  can be used as preﬁxes for disambiguation. However, it is best not to overload names to make such explicit disam- biguation necessary.   206   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  8.2.3  Structures and Classes A struct is simply a class where the members are public by default.  So, a struct can have member functions  §2.3.2, Chapter 16 . In particular, a struct can have constructors.  For example:  struct Points {  vector  elem;   must contain at least one Point Points Point p0  { elem.push_back p0 ;} Points Point p0, Point p1  { elem.push_back p0 ; elem.push_back p1 ; }    ...  Points x0; Points x1{ {100,200} }; Points x1{ {100,200}, {300,400} };     error :no default constructor    one Point    twoPoints  You do not need to deﬁne a constructor simply to initialize members in order. For example:  struct Point { int x, y;  };  Point p0; Point p1 {}; Point p2 {1}; Point p3 {1,2};    {1,2}     danger :uninitialized if in local scope  §6.3.5.1     default construction: {{},{}}; that is {0.0}    the second member is default constructed: {1,{}}; that is {1,0}  Constructors are needed if you need to reorder arguments, validate arguments, modify arguments, establish invariants  §2.4.3.2, §13.4 , etc. For example:  struct Address {  string name; int number;  string street; string town;  char state[2]; char zip[5];     "Jim Dandy"    61    "South St"    "NewProvidence"    ’N’ ’J’    07974  Address const string n, int nu, const string& s, const string& t, const string& st, int z ;  Here, I added a constructor to ensure that every member was initialized and to allow me to use a string and an int for the postal code, rather than ﬁddling with individual characters. For example:  Address jd = {  "Jim Dandy", 61, "South St", "New Providence", "NJ", 7974      07974 would be octal; §6.2.4.1   The Address constructor might be deﬁned like this:  };  };  };   Section 8.2.3  Structures and Classes  207  Address::Address const string& n, int nu, const string& s, const string& t, const string& st, int z      validate postal code  error "State abbreviation should be two characters"     store postal code as characters    an output string stream; see §38.4.2    extract characters from int  :name{n}, number{nu}, street{s}, town{t}  if  st.size  !=2   state = {st[0],st[1]}; ostringstream ost; ost << z; string zi {ost.str  }; switch  zi.siz e    { case 5:  zip = {zi[0], zi[1], zi[2], zi[3], zi[4]}; break;  case 4:     star tswith ’0’  zip = {'0', zi[0], zi[1], zi[2], zi[3]}; break;  default:  error "unexpected ZIP code format" ;  }    ... checkthat the code makes sense ...  {  }  };  };  struct Point {  int x,y  Point points[3] {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}; int x2 = points[2].x;  struct Array {  Point elem[3];  Array points2 {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}; int y2 = points2.elem[2].y;  8.2.4  Structures and Arrays Naturally, we can have arrays of structs and structs containing arrays. For example:  Placing a built-in array in a struct allows us to treat that array as an object: we can copy the struct containing it in initialization  including argument passing and function return  and assignment. For example:   208   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  The  notation  for Array is  a  bit  primitive: Why i!=3? Why  keep  repeating .elem[i]? Why  just  ele- ments of type Point? The standard library provides std::array  §34.2.1  as a more complete and ele- gant development of the idea of a ﬁxed-size array as a struct:  Array shift Array a, Point p  {  for  int i=0; i!=3; ++i  { a.elem[i].x += p.x; a.elem[i].y += p.y;  } return a;  }  Array ax = shift points2,{10,20} ;  template  struct array {      simpliﬁed  see §34.2.1   T elem[N];  T∗ begin   noexcept { return elem; } const T∗ begin   const noexcept {return elem; } T∗ end   noexcept { return elem+N; } const T∗ end   const noexcept { return elem+N; }  constexpr size_t size   noexcept;  T& operator[] size_t n  { return elem[n]; } const T& operator[] size_type n  const { return elem[n]; }  T ∗ data   noexcept { return elem; } const T ∗ data   const noexcept { return elem; }     ...  };  };  struct Point {  int x,y  using Array = array ;     array of3Points  Array points {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}; int x2 = points[2].x; int y2 = points[2].y;  This array is  a  template  to  allow arbitrary  numbers  of  elements  of  arbitrary  types. It  also  deals directly with the possibility of exceptions  §13.5.1.1  and const objects  §16.2.9.1 . Using array, we can now write:   Section 8.2.4  Structures and Arrays  209  The main advantages of std::array over a built-in array are that it is a proper object type  has assign- ment, etc.  and does not implicitly convert to a pointer to an individual element:  Array shift Array a, Point p  {  for  int i=0; i!=a.size  ; ++i  {  a[i].x += p.x; a[i].y += p.y;  } return a;  Array ax = shift points,{10,20} ;  }  }  }  }  }  ostream& operator<< ostream& os, Point p  {  cout << '{' << p[i].x << ',' << p[i].y << '}';  void print Point a[],int s     must specify number of elements {  for  int i=0; i!=s; ++i   cout << a[i] << '\n';  template  void print array & a  {  for  int i=0; i!=a.size  ; ++i   cout << a[i] << '\n';  Point point1[] = {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}; array  point2 = {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}};     3elements    3elements  void f   {  print point1,4 ;  print point2 ;     4isabad error  The disadvantage of std::array compared to a built-in array is that we can’t deduce the number of elements from the length of the initializer:  Point point1[] = {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}; array  point2 = {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}; array  point3 = {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}};     3elements    3elements    error :number of elements not given   210   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  8.2.5  Type Equivalence Tw o structs are different types even when they hav e the same members. For example:  struct S1 { int a; }; struct S2 { int a; };  S1 and S2 are two different types, so:  S1 x; S2 y = x;  S1 x; int i = x;     error :type mismatch     error :type mismatch  A struct is also a different type from a type used as a member. For example:  Every struct must have a unique deﬁnition in a program  §15.2.3 .  8.2.6  Plain Old Data Sometimes, we want to treat an object as just ‘‘plain old data’’  a contiguous sequence of bytes in memory   and  not  worry  about  more  advanced  semantic  notions,  such  as  run-time  polymorphism  §3.2.3, §20.3.2 , user-deﬁned copy semantics  §3.3, §17.5 , etc. Often, the reason for doing so is to be able to move objects around in the most efﬁcient way the hardware is capable of. For exam- ple, copying a 100-element array using 100 calls of a copy constructor is unlikely to be as fast as calling std::memcpy  , which typically simply uses a block-move machine instruction. Even if the constructor is inlined, it could be hard for an optimizer to discover this optimization. Such ‘‘tricks’’ are not uncommon, and are important, in implementations of containers, such as vector, and in low- level I O routines. They are unnecessary and should be avoided in higher-level code.  So, a POD  ‘‘Plain Old Data’’  is an object that can be manipulated as ‘‘just data’’ without wor- rying  about  complications  of  class  layouts  or  user-deﬁned  semantics  for  construction,  copy,  and move. For example:  struct S0 { }; struct S1 { int a; }; struct S2 { int a; S2 int aa  : a aa  { } }; struct S3 { int a; S3 int aa  : a aa  { } S3   {} }; struct S4 { int a; S4 int aa  : a aa  { } S4   = default; }; struct S5 { virtual void f  ;  * ...*  };     aPOD    aPOD    not a POD  no default constructor     aPOD  user-deﬁned default constructor     aPOD    not a POD  has a virtual function   struct S6 : S1 { }; struct S7 : S0 { int b; }; struct S8 : S1 { int b; }; struct S9 : S0, S1 {};     aPOD    aPOD    not a POD  data in both S1 and S8     aPOD  For us to manipulate an object as ‘‘just data’’  as a POD , the object must not have a complicated layout  e.g., with a vptr;  §3.2.3, §20.3.2 , not have nonstandard  user-deﬁned  copy semantics, and hav e a trivial default constructor.   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   Obviously, we need  to  be  precise  about  the  deﬁnition  of  POD  so  that  we  only  use  such   Section 8.2.6  Plain Old Data  211  optimizations where they don’t break any language guarantees. Formally  §iso.3.9, §iso.9 , a POD object must be of  a standard layout type, and a trivially copyable type, a type with a trivial default constructor.  A related concept is a trivial type, which is a type with  a trivial default constructor and trivial copy and move operations   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   cid:129   Informally, a default constructor is trivial if it does not need to do any work  use =default if you need to deﬁne one §17.6.1 .  A type has standard layout unless it  cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   has a non-static member or a base that is not standard layout, has a virtual function  §3.2.3, §20.3.2 , has a virtual base  §21.3.5 , has a member that is a reference  §7.7 , has multiple access speciﬁers for non-static data members  §20.5 , or prevents important layout optimizations  cid:129   by having non-static data members in more than one base class or in both the derived class and a base, or by having a base class of the same type as the ﬁrst non-static data member.   cid:129   Basically, a standard layout type is one that has a layout with an obvious equivalent in C and is in the union of what common C++ Application Binary Interfaces  ABIs  can handle.  A type  is  trivially  copyable  unless  it  has  a  nontrivial  copy operation,  move operation,  or  de- structor  §3.2.1.2, §17.6 . Informally, a copy operation is trivial if it can be implemented as a bit- wise copy.  So, what makes a copy, move, or destructor nontrivial?   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   It is user-deﬁned. Its class has a virtual function. Its class has a virtual base. Its class has a base or a member that is not trivial.  An object of built-in type is trivially copyable, and has standard layout. Also, an array of trivially copyable objects is trivially copyable and an array of standard layout objects has standard layout. Consider an example:  template   void mycopy T∗ to, const T∗ from, int count ;  I’d like to optimize the simple case where T is a POD. I could do that by only calling mycopy   for PODs, but that’s error-prone: if I use mycopy   can I rely on a maintainer of the code to remember never to call mycopy   for non-PODs? Realistically, I cannot.  Alternatively, I could call std::copy  , which  is  most  likely  implemented  with  the  necessary  optimization. Anyway, here  is  the  general and optimized code:   212   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  template  void mycopy T∗ to, const T∗ from, int count  {  if  is_pod ::value   memcpy to,from,count∗sizeof T  ;  else  }  for  int i=0; i!=count; ++i   to[i]=from[i];  The is_pod is a standard-library type property predicate  §35.4.1  deﬁned in   allowing us to ask the question ‘‘Is T a POD?’’ in our code. The best thing about is_pod  is that it saves us from remembering the exact rules for what a POD is.  Note that adding or subtracting non-default constructors does not affect layout or performance   that was not true in C++98 .  If you feel an urge to become a language lawyer, study the layout and triviality concepts in the standard  §iso.3.9, §iso.9  and try to think about their implications to programmers and compiler writers.  Doing so might cure you of the urge before it has consumed too much of your time.  8.2.7  Fields It seems extravagant to use a whole byte  a char or a bool  to represent a binary variable – for exam- ple,  an  on off switch  –  but  a char is  the  smallest  object  that  can  be  independently  allocated  and addressed in C++  §7.2 . It is possible, however, to bundle several such tiny variables together as ﬁelds in a struct. A ﬁeld is often called a bit-ﬁeld. A member is deﬁned to be a ﬁeld by specifying the number of bits it is to occupy.  Unnamed ﬁelds are allowed.  They do not affect the meaning of the named ﬁelds, but they can be used to make the layout better in some machine-dependent way:  struct PPN {     R6000 Physical Page Number     Page Frame Number    unused     Cache Coherency Algorithm  unsigned int PFN : 22; int : 3; unsigned int CCA : 3; bool nonreachable : 1; bool dirty : 1; bool valid : 1; bool global : 1;  };  This example also illustrates the other main use of ﬁelds: to name parts of an externally imposed layout.  A ﬁeld must be of an integral or enumeration type  §6.2.1 . It is not possible to take the address of a ﬁeld. Apart from that, however, it can be used exactly like other variables.  Note that a bool ﬁeld really can be represented by a single bit. In an operating system kernel or in a debugger, the type PPN might be used like this: void part_of_VM_system PPN∗ p  {     ...   Section 8.2.7  Fields   213  if  p−>dirty  {     contents changed     copytodisk p−>dirty = 0;  }  }  Surprisingly, using  ﬁelds  to  pack  several  variables  into  a  single  byte  does  not  necessarily  save space.  It saves data space, but the size of the code needed to manipulate these variables increases on most machines. Programs have been known to shrink signiﬁcantly when binary variables were converted from bit-ﬁelds to characters! Furthermore, it is typically much faster to access a char or an int than  to  access  a  ﬁeld. Fields  are  simply  a  convenient  shorthand  for  using  bitwise  logical operators  §11.1.1  to extract information from and insert information into part of a word.  8.3  Unions A union is a struct in which all members are allocated at the same address so that the union occu- pies only as much space as its largest member. Naturally, a union can hold a value for only one member at a time. For example, consider a symbol table entry that holds a name and a value:  enum Type { str, num };  struct Entry {  char∗ name; Type t; char∗ s;  int i;     use s if t==str    use i if t==num  void f Entry∗ p  {  if  p−>t == str   cout  s;     ...  };  }  };  union Value { char∗ s; int i;  The members s and i can never be used at the same time, so space is wasted.  It can be easily recov- ered by specifying that both should be members of a union, like this:  The language doesn’t keep track of which kind of value is held by a union, so the programmer must do that:   214   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8     use v.s if t==str;use v.i if t==num  struct Entry {  char∗ name; Type t; Value v;  void f Entry∗ p  {  if  p−>t == str   cout  v.s;     ...  To  avoid errors, one can encapsulate a union so that the correspondence between a type ﬁeld and access to the union members can be guaranteed  §8.3.2 .  Unions are sometimes misused for ‘‘type conversion.’’  This misuse is practiced mainly by pro- grammers trained in languages that do not have explicit type conversion facilities, so that cheating is necessary. For example, the following ‘‘converts’’ an int to an int∗ simply by assuming bitwise equivalence:     bad use  This is not really a conversion at all. On some machines, an int and an int∗ do not occupy the same amount of space, while on others, no integer can have an odd address. Such use of a union is dan- gerous and nonportable. If you need such an inherently ugly conversion, use an explicit type con- version operator  §11.5.2  so that the reader can see what is going on. For example:  return reinterpret_cast  i ;      obviously ugly and dangerous  Here, at least the compiler has a chance to warn you if the sizes of objects are different and such code stands out like the sore thumb it is.  Use of unions can be essential for compactness of data and through that for performance. How- ev er, most programs don’t improve much from the use of unions and unions are rather error-prone. Consequently, I consider unions an overused feature; avoid them when you can.  };  }  }  }  union Fudge {  int i; int∗ p;  };  int∗ cheat int i  {  Fudge a; a.i = i; return a.p;  int∗ cheat2 int i  {   Section 8.3.1  Unions and Classes  215  8.3.1  Unions and Classes Many nontrivial unions hav e a member that is much larger than the most frequently used members. Because the size of a union is at least as large as its largest member, space is wasted.  This waste can often be eliminated by using a set of derived classes  §3.2.2, Chapter 20  instead of a union.  Technically, a union is a kind of a struct  §8.2  which in turn is a kind of a class  Chapter 16 . However, many of the facilities provided for classes are not relevant for unions, so some restrictions are imposed on unions:  [1]  A union cannot have virtual functions. [2]  A union cannot have members of reference type. [3]  A union cannot have base classes. [4]   If a union has a member with a user-deﬁned constructor, a copy operation, a move opera- tion, or a destructor, then that special function is deleted  §3.3.4, §17.6.4  for that union; that is, it cannot be used for an object of the union type.  [5]  At most one member of a union can have an in-class initializer  §17.4.4 . [6]  A union cannot be used as a base class.  These restrictions prevent many subtle errors and simplify the implementation of unions.  The latter is important because the use of unions is often an optimization and we won’t want ‘‘hidden costs’’ imposed to compromise that.  The rule that deletes constructors  etc.  from a union with a member that has a constructor  etc.  keeps simple unions simple and forces the programmer to provide complicated operations if they are  needed. For example,  since Entry has  no  member  with  constructors,  destructors,  or  assign- ments, we can create and copy Entrys freely. For example:  void f Entry a  {  Entry b = a;  union U {  int m1; complex  m2; string m3;  void f2 U x  {  U u; U u2 = x; u.m1 = 1; string s = u.m3; return;   };  };  }  Doing so with a more complicated union would cause implementation difﬁculties or errors:     complexhas a constructor    stringhas a constructor  maintaining a serious invariant   To copy a U we would have to decide which copy operation to use. For example:     error :which default constructor?    error :which copyconstr uctor?    assign to int member    disaster :read from string member    error :which destructors are called for x, u, and u2?  It’s illegal to write one member and then read another, but people do that nevertheless  usually by mistake .  In this case, the string copy constructor would be called with an invalid argument.  It is   216   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  fortunate  that U won’t compile.  When needed,  a  user  can  deﬁne  a  class  containing  a union that properly  handles union members  with  constructors,  destructors,  and  assignments   §8.3.2 . If desired, such a class can also prevent the error of writing one member and then reading another.  It is possible to specify an in-class initializer for at most one member. If so, this initializer will  be used for default initialization. For example:  8.3.2  Anonymous unions To  see how we can write a class that overcomes the problems with misuse of a union, consider a variant of Entry  §8.3 :  class Entry2 {    twoalter nativerepresentations represented as a union private:  union U2 { int a; const char∗ p {""};  };  U2 x1; U2 x2 {7};     default initialized to x1.p == ""    x2.a == 7  enum class Tag { number, text }; Ta g type;     discriminant  union {     representation  int i; string s;  }; public:  struct Bad_entry { };     used for exceptions  string name;  ˜Entry2  ; Entry2& operator= const Entry2& ;  Entry2 const Entr y2& ;    ...  int number   const; string text   const;  void set_number int n ; void set_text const string& ;    ...  };     stringhas default constructor,copyoperations,and destructor     necessar ybecause of the string var iant  I’m not a fan of get set functions, but in this case we really need to perform a nontrivial user-speci- ﬁed action on each access. I chose to name the ‘‘get’’ function after the value and use the set_ pre- ﬁx for the ‘‘set’’ function.  That happens to be my favorite among the many naming conventions.   Section 8.3.2  Anonymous unions  217  These  access  functions  check  the type tag,  and  if  it  is  the  one  that  correctly  corresponds  to  the access we want, it returns a reference to the value; otherwise, it throws an exception.  Such a union is often called a tagged union or a discriminated union.  The write-access functions basically do the same checking of the type tag, but note how setting  a new value must take the previous value into account:     explicitly destroystr ing §11.2.4   The read-access functions can be deﬁned like this:  int Entry2::number   const {  if  type!=Tag::number  throw Bad_entr y{}; return i;  string Entry2::text   const {  if  type!=Tag::text  throw Bad_entr y{}; return s;  };  };  }  }  void Entry2::set_number int n  {  if  type==Tag::text  {  s.˜string  ;  type = Tag::number;  } i = n;  void Entry2::set_text const string& ss  {  if  type==Tag::text   s = ss;  else {  new &s  string{ss}; type = Tag::text;  }     placement new: explicitly construct string  §11.2.4   The  use  of  a union forces  us  to  use  otherwise  obscure  and  low-level language  facilities   explicit construction and destruction  to manage the lifetime of the union elements.  This is another reason to be wary of using unions.  Note  that  the union in  the  declaration  of Entry2 is  not  named. That  makes  it  an anonymous union. An anonymous union is  an  object,  not  a  type,  and  its  members  can  be  accessed  without mentioning an object name. That means that we can use members of an anonymous union exactly as we use other members of a class – as long as we remember that union members really can be used only one at a time.  Entry2 has  a  member  of  a  type  with  a  user-deﬁned  assignment  operator, string, so Entry2’s assignment operator is deleted  §3.3.4, §17.6.4 . If we want to assign Entry2s, we have  to deﬁne   }  }  switch  e.type  { case Tag::number:  i = e.i; break;  case Tag::text:  new &s  e .s ; type = e.type;  return ∗this;  218   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  Entry2::operator=  . Assignment combines the complexities of reading and writing but is otherwise logically similar to the access functions:  Entry2& Entr y2::operator= const Entr y2& e      necessar ybecause of the string var iant {  if  type==Tag::text && e.type==Tag::text  {     usual string assignment  s = e.s;  return ∗this;  if  type==Tag::text  s.˜string  ;    explicit destroy §11.2.4      placement new: explicit construct  §11.2.4   }  }  Constructors and a move assignment can be deﬁned similarly as needed. We  need at least a con- structor or two to establish the correspondence between the type tag and a value.  The destructor must handle the string case:  Entry2::˜Entry2   {  if  type==Tag::text  s.˜string  ;    explicit destroy §11.2.4   8.4  Enumerations An enumeration is  a  type  that  can  hold  a  set  of  integer  values  speciﬁed  by  the  user   §iso.7.2 . Some of an enumeration’s possible values are named and called enumerators. For example:  enum class Color { red, green, blue };  This deﬁnes an enumeration called Color with the enumerators red, green, and blue. ‘‘An enumera- tion’’ is colloquially shortened to ‘‘an enum.’’  There are two kinds of enumerations: [1]  enum classes, for which the enumerator names  e.g., red  are local to the enum and their values do not implicitly convert to other types ‘‘Plain enums,’’  for which the enumerator names are in the same scope as the enum and their values implicitly convert to integers  [2]   In general, prefer the enum classes because they cause fewer surprises.

For example:  enum class Trafﬁc_light { red, yellow, green }; enum class Warning { green, yellow, orang e, red };   ﬁre alertlev els  Warning a1 = 7; int a2 = green; int a3 = Warning::green;  Warning a4 = Warning::green;      error :no int->War ningconversion    error :green not in scope    error :no War ning->intconversion    OK  void f Trafﬁc_light x  {  if  x == 9  {  * ...*  } if  x == red  {  * ...*  } if  x == Warning::red   {  * ...*  } if  x == Trafﬁc_light::red  {  * ...*  }     error :9isnot a Trafﬁc_light    error :no red in scope    error :xisnot a War ning    OK  }  Note that the enumerators present in both enums do not clash because each is in the scope of its own enum class.  An  enumeration  is  represented  by  some  integer  type  and  each  enumerator  by  some  integer value.  We call the type used to represent an enumeration its underlying type. The underlying type must be one of the signed or unsigned integer types  §6.2.4 ; the default is int. We could be explicit about that:  enum class Warning : int { green, yellow, orang e, red };    sizeof War ning ==sizeof int   If we considered that too wasteful of space, we could instead use a char:  enum class Warning : char { green, yellow, orang e, red };     sizeof War ning ==1  By default, enumerator values are assigned increasing from 0. Here, we get:  Declaring a variable Warning instead of plain int can give both the user and the compiler a hint  as to the intended use. For example:  static_cast  Warning::green ==0 static_cast  Warning::yellow ==1 static_cast  Warning::orang e ==2 static_cast  Warning::red ==3  void f Warning key  {  switch  key  { case Warning::green:     do something break;  case Warning::orang e:     do something break;   220   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  A human might notice that yellow was missing, and a compiler might issue a warning because only three out of four Warning values are handled.  An enumerator can be initialized by a constant expression  §10.4  of integral type  §6.2.1 . For  case Warning::red:    do something break;  }  }  example:  enum class Printer_ﬂags {  acknowledg e=1, paper_empty=2, busy=4, out_of_black=8, out_of_color=16,     };  }  }  }  The values for the Printer_ﬂags enumerators are chosen so that they can be combined by bitwise operations.  An enum is a user-deﬁned type, so we can deﬁne the  and & operators for it  §3.2.1.1, Chapter 18 . For example:  constexpr Printer_ﬂags operator Printer_ﬂags a, Printer_ﬂags b  {  return static_cast  static_cast  a  static_cast  b  ;  constexpr Printer_ﬂags operator& Printer_ﬂags a, Printer_ﬂags b  {  return static_cast  static_cast  a  &static_cast  b  ;  The explicit conversions are necessary because a class enum does not support implicit conversions. Given these deﬁnitions of  and & for Printer_ﬂags, we can write:  void try_to_print Printer_ﬂags x  {  if  x&Printer_ﬂags::acknowledg e  {  } else if  x&Printer_ﬂags::busy  {     ...     ...  } else if  x& Printer_ﬂags::out_of_blackPrinter_ﬂags::out_of_color   {     either weare out of blackorweare out of color    ...  }    ...   Section 8.4.1  enum classes   221  I deﬁned operator   and operator&   to  be constexpr functions   §10.4,  §12.1.6   because  someone might want to use those operators in constant expressions.  For example:  void g Printer_ﬂags x  {  switch  x  { case Printer_ﬂags::acknowledg e:  case Printer_ﬂags::busy:  case Printer_ﬂags::out_of_black:  case Printer_ﬂags::out_of_color:     ... break;     ... break;     ... break;     ... break;  case Printer_ﬂags::out_of_black&Printer_ﬂags::out_of_color:     we are out of black*and* out of color    ... break;  }     ...  }  };  It is possible to declare an enum class without deﬁning it  §6.3  until later. For example:  enum class Color_code : char;  void foobar Color_code∗ p ;     ... enum class Color_code : char {  red, yellow, green, blue     declaration    use of declaration     deﬁnition  A value of integral type may be explicitly converted to an enumeration type. The result of such a conversion is undeﬁned unless the value is within the range of the enumeration’s underlying type. For example:  enum class Flag : char{ x=1, y=2, z=4, e=8 };  Flag f0 {};  Flag f1 = 5; Flag f2 = Flag{5};  Flag f3 = static_cast  5 ;  Flag f4 = static_cast  999 ;      f0 gets the default value 0    type error:5isnot of type Flag    error :no narrowing conversion to an enum class    bruteforce    error :999 is not a char value  maybe not caught   The last assignments show why there is no implicit conversion from an integer to an enumeration; most integer values do not have a representation in a particular enumeration.   222   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  Each enumerator has an integer value.  We can extract that value explicitly. For example:  int i = static_cast  Flag::y ;  char c = static_cast  Flag::e ;      ibecomes 2    cbecomes 8  The notion of a range of values for an enumeration differs from the enumeration notion in the Pas- cal family of languages. However, bit-manipulation examples that require values outside the set of enumerators to be well deﬁned  e.g., the Printer_ﬂags example  have a long history in C and C++.  The sizeof an enum class is the sizeof of its underlying type. In particular, if the underlying type  is not explicitly speciﬁed, the size is sizeof int .  8.4.2  Plain enums A ‘‘plain enum’’  is roughly what C++ offered before the enum  classes were introduced, so you’ll ﬁnd them in lots of C and C++98-style code. The enumerators of a plain enum are exported into the enum’s  scope, and they implicitly convert to values of some integer type. Consider the exam- ples from §8.4.1 with the ‘‘class’’ removed:  enum Trafﬁc_light { red, yellow, green }; enum Warning { green, yellow, orang e, red };    ﬁre alertlev els     error :twodeﬁnitions of yellow to the same value     error :twodeﬁnitions of red  to different values   Warning a1 = 7; int a2 = green; int a3 = Warning::green;  Warning a4 = Warning::green;      error :no int->War ningconversion    OK: green is in scope and convertstoint    OK: War ning->intconversion    OK  void f Trafﬁc_light x  {  if  x == 9  {  * ...*  } if  x == red  {  * ...*  } if  x == Warning::red   {  * ...*  } if  x == Trafﬁc_light::red  {  * ...*  }    OK     OK  but Trafﬁc_light doesn’t have a 9     error :tworeds in scope    OK  Ouch!   }  We were ‘‘lucky’’ that deﬁning red in two plain enumerations in a single scope saved us from hard- to-spot errors. Consider ‘‘cleaning up’’ the plain enums by disambiguating the enumerators  as is easily done in a small program but can be done only with great difﬁculty in a large one :  enum Trafﬁc_light { tl_red, tl_yellow, tl_green }; enum Warning { green, yellow, orang e, red };    ﬁre alertlev els   Section 8.4.2  void f Trafﬁc_light x  {  Plain enums  223  if  x == red  {  * ...*  } if  x == Warning::red   {  * ...*  } if  x == Trafﬁc_light::red  {  * ...*  }     OK  ouch!     OK  ouch!     error :red is not a Trafﬁc_light value  }  The compiler accepts the x==red, which is almost certainly a bug.  The injection of names into an enclosing scope  as enums, but not enum classes or classes, do  is namespace pollution and can be a major problem in larger programs  Chapter 14 .  You can specify the underlying type of a plain enumeration, just as you can for enum classes.  If  you do, you can declare the enumerations without deﬁning them until later. For example:  enum Trafﬁc_light : char { tl_red, tl_yellow, tl_green };     underlyingtype is char  enum Color_code : char;  void foobar Color_code∗ p ;     ... enum Color_code : char { red, yellow, green, blue };    deﬁnition     declaration    use of declaration  If  you  don’t specify  the  underlying  type,  you  can’t declare  the enum without  deﬁning  it,  and  its underlying type is determined by a relatively complicated algorithm: when all enumerators are non- negative, the range of the enumeration is [0:2k-1] where 2k is the smallest power of 2 for which all enumerators are within the range. If there are negative enumerators, the range is [-2k:2k-1].  This deﬁnes the smallest bit-ﬁeld capable of holding the enumerator values using the conventional two’s complement representation. For example:  enum E1 { dark, light }; enum E2 { a = 3, b = 9 }; enum E3 { min = −10, max = 1000000 };     range 0:1    range 0:15    range -1048576:1048575  The  rule  for  explicit  conversion  of  an  integer  to  a  plain enum is  the  same  as  for  the class  enum except that when there is no explicit underlying type, the result of such a conversion is undeﬁned unless the value is within the range of the enumeration. For example:  enum Flag { x=1, y=2, z=4, e=8 };     range 0:15  Flag f0 {};  Flag f1 = 5; Flag f2 = Flag{5};  Flag f2 = static_cast  5 ;  Flag f3 = static_cast  ze ;  Flag f4 = static_cast  99 ;      f0 gets the default value 0    type error:5isnot of type Flag    error :no explicit conversion from int to Flag    OK: 5 is within the range of Flag    OK: 12 is within the range of Flag    undeﬁned: 99 is not within the range of Flag  Because there is an implicit conversion from a plain enum to its underlying type, we don’t need to deﬁne  to make this example work: z and e are converted to int so that ze can be evaluated.  The sizeof an enumeration is the sizeof its underlying type. If the underlying type isn’t explicitly speci- ﬁed, it is some integral type that can hold its range and not larger than sizeof int , unless an enumer- ator  cannot  be  represented  as  an int or  as  an unsigned  int. For  example, sizeof e1  could  be 1 or maybe 4 but not 8 on a machine where sizeof int ==4.   224   Structures, Unions, and Enumerations  Chapter 8  8.4.3  Unnamed enums A plain enum can be unnamed. For example:  enum { arrow_up=1, arrow_down, arrow_sideways };  We use that when all we need is a set of integer constants, rather than a type to use for variables.  8.5  Advice [1]  When compactness of data is important, lay out structure data members with larger members  [2]  Use bit-ﬁelds to represent hardware-imposed data layouts; §8.2.7.

Basically all that is either interesting or complicated  is  found  in  expressions  and  declarations. Note  that  a  declaration  is  a  statement  and that an expression becomes a statement when you add a semicolon at its end.  Unlike an expression, a statement does not have a value.  Instead, statements are used to specify  the order of execution.  For example:  a = b+c;  if  a==7   b = 9;     expression statement    if-statement    execute if and only if a==9  Logically, a=b+c is executed before the if, as everyone would expect.  A compiler may reorder code to improve performance as long as the result is identical to that of the simple order of execution.   226   Statements  Chapter 9  9.2  Statement Summary Here is a summary of C++ statements:  statement:  declaration expressionopt ; { statement-listopt } try { statement-listopt } handler-list case constant-expression : statement default : statement break ; continue ;  return expressionopt ; goto identiﬁer ; identiﬁer : statement  selection-statement iteration-statement  selection-statement:  if   condition   statement if   condition   statement else statement switch   condition   statement  iteration-statement:  while   condition   statement do statement while   expression   ; for   for-init-statement conditionopt ; expressionopt   statement for   for-init-declaration : expression   statement  statement-list:  statement statement-listopt  condition:  expression type-speciﬁer declarator = expression type-speciﬁer declarator { expression }  handler-list:  handler handler-listopt  handler:  catch   exception-declaration   { statement-listopt }  A semicolon is by itself a statement, the empty statement.   Section 9.2  Statement Summary  227  A  possibly empty  sequence of statements within ‘‘curly braces’’  i.e., { and }  is called a block or a compound  statement. A name declared in a block goes out of scope at the end of its block  §6.3.4 .  A declaration is a statement and there is no assignment statement or procedure-call statement;  assignments and function calls are expressions.  A for-init-statement must be either a declaration or an expression-statement. Note that both end  with a semicolon.  A for-init-declaration must be the declaration of a single uninitialized variable. The statements for handling exceptions, try-blocks, are described in §13.5.  9.3  Declarations as Statements A declaration is a statement. Unless a variable is declared static, its initializer is executed whenever the thread of control passes through the declaration  see also §6.4.2 . The reason for allowing dec- larations wherever a statement can be used  and a few other places; §9.4.3, §9.5.2  is to enable the programmer to minimize the errors caused by uninitialized variables and to allow better locality in code.  There is  rarely  a  reason  to  introduce  a  variable  before  there  is  a  value  for  it  to  hold. For example:  void f vector & v, int i, const char∗ p  {  if  p==nullptr  return; if  i<0  v.siz e  <=i   error "bad index" ;  string s = v[i]; if  s == p  {     ...  }    ...  void use   {  string s1; s1 = "The best is the enemy of the good.";    ...  }  }  The ability to place declarations after executable code is essential for many constants and for sin- gle-assignment styles of programming where a value of an object is not changed after initialization. For user-deﬁned types, postponing the deﬁnition of a variable until a suitable initializer is available can also lead to better performance. For example:  This requests a default initialization  to the empty string  followed by an assignment. This can be slower than a simple initialization to the desired value:  string s2 {"Voltaire"};  The most common reason to declare a variable without an initializer is that it requires a statement   228   Statements  Chapter 9  to give it its desired value.  Input variables are among the few reasonable examples of that:  void input   {  int buf[max]; int count = 0; for  int i; cin>>i;  {  }    ...  }  if  i<0  error "unexpected negative value" ; if  count==max  error "buffer overﬂow" ; buf[count++] = i;  I assume  that error   does  not  return;  if  it  does,  this  code  may  cause  a  buffer  overﬂow.  Often, push_back    §3.2.1.3, §13.6, §31.3.6  provides a better solution to such examples.  9.4  Selection Statements A value can be tested by either an if-statement or a switch-statement:  if   condition   statement if   condition   statement else statement switch   condition   statement  A condition is either an expression or a declaration  §9.4.3 .  9.4.1 if Statements In an if-statement, the ﬁrst  or only  statement is executed if the condition is true and the second statement  if it is speciﬁed  is executed otherwise. If a condition evaluates to something different from a Boolean, it is – if possible – implicitly converted to a bool. This implies that any arithmetic or pointer expression can be used as a condition. For example, if x is an integer, then  if  x     ...  means  if  x != 0     ...  For a pointer p,  if  p     ...  if  p != nullptr     ...  is a direct statement of the test ‘‘Does p point to a valid object  assuming proper initialization ?’’ and is equivalent to  Note that a ‘‘plain’’ enum can be implicitly converted to an integer and then to a bool, whereas an enum class cannot  §8.4.1 . For example:   Section 9.4.1  if Statements   229  enum E1 { a, b }; enum class E2 { a, b };  void f E1 x, E2 y  {     OK  if  x   if  y      ...     ...     ...  if  y==E2::a      OK  The logical operators  &&     !     error :no conversion to bool  }  }  }  void f2 int i  {  if  i  {  int x = i+2; ++x;    ...  } else {  } ++x;   ++x;    error :xisnot in scope     error :xisnot in scope  are most commonly used in conditions. The operators && and  will not evaluate their second argu- ment unless doing so is necessary. For example,  if  p && 1 count     ...  This tests 1 count only if p is not nullptr.  For choosing between two alternatives each of which produces a value, a conditional expression   §11.1.3  is a more direct expression of intent than an if-statement.  For example:  int max int a, int b  {  return  a>b ?a:b;     returnthe larger of a and b  A name can only be used within the scope in which it is declared. In particular, it cannot be used on another branch of an if-statement.  For example:  A branch  of  an if-statement  cannot  be  just  a  declaration. branch, it must be enclosed in a block  §9.2 . For example:  If  we  need  to  introduce  a  name  in  a   230   Statements  Chapter 9  int x = i+2;     error :declaration of if-statement branch  9.4.2 switch Statements A switch-statement  selects  among  a  set  of  alternatives  case-labels .  The expression  in  the case labels  must  be  a  constant  expression  of  integral  or  enumeration  type. A value  may  not  be  used more than once for case-labels in a switch-statement.  For example:  switch  i  { case 2.7:    error :ﬂoating point uses for case  case 4−2:    error :2used twice in case labels  A switch-statement can alternatively be written as a set of if-statements.  For example:  void f1 int i  {  if  i   }  void f int i  {  case 2:     ...     ...     ...  };  switch  val  { case 1: f  ; break;  case 2:  g  ; break;  default: h  ; break;  }  else if  val == 2   if  val == 1   f  ;  g  ;  h  ;  else  This could be expressed as:  The meaning is the same, but the ﬁrst  switch  version is preferred because the nature of the opera- tion  testing a single value against a set of constants  is explicit.  This makes the switch-statement easier  to  read  for  nontrivial  examples.  It typically  also  leads  to  the  generation  of  better  code because there is no reason to repeatedly check individual values.  Instead, a jump table can be used.   Section 9.4.2  switch Statements   231  Beware that a case of a switch must be terminated somehow unless you want to carry on execut-  ing the next case. Consider:  switch  val  { case 1:     beware  cout << "case 1\n";  cout << "case 2\n";  case 2:  default:  }  case 1 case 2 default: case not found  cout << "default: case not found\n";  Invoked with val==1, the output will greatly surprise the uninitiated:  switch  action  { case do_and_print:  act value ;    no break: fall through to print     handle  action,value  pair  case print:  print value ; break;     ... }  It is a good idea to comment the  rare  cases in which a fall-through is intentional so that an uncom- mented fall-through can be assumed to be an error. For example:  A break is the most common way of terminating a case, but a return is often useful  §10.2.1 .  When should a switch-statement have a default? There is no single answer that covers all situa- tions.  One use  is  for  the default to  handle  the  most  common  case. Another  common  use  is  the exact opposite: the default: action is simply a way to catch errors; every valid alternative is covered by the cases.  However, there is one case where a default should not be used: if a switch is intended to  have  one  case  for  each  enumerator  of  an  enumeration. If  so,  leaving  out  the default gives the compiler a chance to warn against a set of cases that almost but not quite match the set of enumera- tors.  For example, this is almost certainly an error:  enum class Vessel { cup, glass, goblet, chalice };  void problematic Vessel v  {  switch  v  { case Vessel::cup:  case Vessel::glass:  case Vessel::goblet:  }  }   * ...*    * ...*    * ...*    break; break; break;   232   Statements  Chapter 9  Such a mistake can easily occur when a new enumerator is added during maintenance.  Testing for an ‘‘impossible’’ enumerator value is best done separately.  9.4.2.1  Declarations in Cases  It is possible, and common, to declare variables within the block of a switch-statement.  However, it is not possible to bypass an initialization. For example:  void f int i  {  switch  i  { case 0:  case 1:  ++x;  ++y; s = "nasty!";  }  }  int x; int y = 3; string s;     uninitialized    error :declaration can be bypassed  explicitly initialized     error :declaration can be bypassed  implicitly initialized      error :use of uninitialized object  Here, if i==1, the thread of execution would bypass the initializations of y and s, so f   will not com- pile.  Unfortunately, because an int needn’t be initialized, the declaration of x is not an error. How- ev er, its use is an error: we read an uninitialized variable.  Unfortunately, compilers often give just a warning  for  the  use  of  an  uninitialized  variable  and  cannot  reliably  catch  all  such  misuses. As usual, avoid uninitialized variables  §6.3.5.1 .  If we need a variable within a switch-statement, we can limit its scope by enclosing its declara-  tion and its use in a block. For an example, see prim   in §10.2.1.  9.4.3  Declarations in Conditions To  avoid accidental misuse of a variable, it is usually a good idea to introduce the variable into the smallest scope possible. In particular, it is usually best to delay the deﬁnition of a local variable until one can give it an initial value.  That way,  one cannot get into trouble by using the variable before its initial value is assigned.  One of the most elegant applications of these two principles is to declare a variable in a condi-  tion.  Consider:  if  double d = prim true   {  left  = d; break;  }  Here, d is declared and initialized and the value of d after initialization is tested as the value of the condition.  The scope of d extends from its point of declaration to the end of the statement that the condition controls. For example, had there been an else-branch to the if-statement, d would be in scope on both branches.   Section 9.4.3  Declarations in Conditions  233  The obvious and traditional alternative is to declare d before the condition. However, this opens  the scope  literally  for the use of d before its initialization or after its intended useful life:  double d;    ... d2 = d;    ... if  d = prim true   {     oops!  left  = d; break;  }    ... d = 2.0;      twounrelated uses of d  In addition to the logical beneﬁts of declaring variables in conditions, doing so also yields the most compact source code.  A declaration in a condition must declare and initialize a single variable or const.  9.5  Iteration Statements A loop can be expressed as a for-, while-, or do-statement:  while   condition   statement do statement while   expression   ; for   for-init-statement conditionopt ; expressionopt   statement for   for-declaration : expression   statement  A for-init-statement must  be  either  a  declaration  or  an expression-statement. Note  that  both  end with a semicolon.  The statement of a for-statement  called the controlled statement or the loop body  is executed repeatedly until the condition becomes false or the programmer breaks out of the loop some other way  such as a break, a return, a throw, or a goto .  More complicated loops can be expressed as an algorithm plus a lambda expression  §11.4.2 .  9.5.1  Range-for Statements The simplest loop is a range-for-statement; it simply gives the programmer access to each element of a range. For example:  int sum vector & v  {  int s = 0; for  int x : v   s+=x;  return s;  }   234   Statements  Chapter 9  The for  int x : v  can be read as ‘‘for each element x in the range v’’  or just ‘‘for each x in v.’’ The elements of v are visited in order from the ﬁrst to the last.  The scope of the variable naming the element  here, x  is the for-statement. The expression after the colon must denote a sequence  a range ; that is, it must yield a value  for which we can call v.begin   and v.end   or begin v  and end v  to obtain an iterators  §4.5 :  [1]   the compiler ﬁrst looks for members begin and end and tries to use those. If a begin or an end is found that cannot be used as a range  e.g., because a member begin is a variable rather than a function , the range-for is an error.  [2]  Otherwise, the  compiler  looks  for  a begin end member  pair  in  the  enclosing  scope. If none is found or if what is found cannot be used  e.g., because the begin did not take an argument of the sequence’s type , the range-for is an error.  The compiler uses v and v+N as begin v  and end v  for a built-in array T v[N]. The   header provides begin c  and end c  for  built-in  arrays  and  for  all  standard-library  containers. For sequences of our own design, we can deﬁne begin   and end   in the same way as it is done for stan- dard-library containers  §4.4.5 .  The controlled variable, x in the example, that refers to the current element is equivalent to ∗p  when using an equivalent for-statement:  int sum2 vector & v  {  int s = 0; for  auto p = begin v ; p!=end v ; ++p   s+=∗p;  return s;  }  }  }  void incr vector & v  {  for  int& x : v   ++x;  template  T accum vector & v  {  T sum = 0; for  const T& x : v   sum += x;  return sum;  If you need to modify an element in a range-for loop, the element variable should be a reference. For example, we can increment each element of a vector like this:  References are also appropriate for elements that might be large, so that copying them to the ele- ment value could be costly. For example:  Note that a range-for loop is a deliberately simple construct. For example, using it you can’t touch two elements at the same time and can’t effectively traverse two ranges simultaneously. For that we need a general for-statement.   Section 9.5.2  for Statements   235  9.5.2 for Statements There is also a more general for-statement allowing greater control of the iteration. The loop vari- able, the termination condition, and the expression that updates the loop variable are explicitly pre- sented ‘‘up front’’ on a single line. For example:  void f int v[], int max  {  for  int i = 0; i!=max; ++i   v[i] = i∗i;  This is equivalent to  void f int v[], int max  {  int i = 0; while  i!=max  {     introduce loop var iable     test termination condition  v[i] = i∗i;     execute the loop body ++i;     increment loop var iable  }  }  }  }  A variable can be declared in the initializer part of a for-statement.  If that initializer is a declara- tion, the variable  or variables  it introduced is in scope until the end of the for-statement.  It is not always obvious what is the right type to use for a controlled variable in a for loop, so  auto often comes in handy:  for  auto p = begin c ; c!=end c ; ++p  {     ... use iterator p for elements in container c ...  If the ﬁnal value of an index needs to be known after exit from a for-loop, the index variable must be declared outside the for-loop  e.g., see §9.6 .  If no initialization is needed, the initializing statement can be empty. If  the  expression  that  is  supposed  to  increment  the  loop  variable  is  omitted,  we  must  update some form of loop variable elsewhere, typically in the body of the loop. If the loop isn’t of the sim- ple ‘‘introduce a loop variable, test the condition, update the loop variable’’ variety, it is often better expressed as a while-statement.  However, consider this elegant variant:  Here, the reading and testing for termination and combined in cin>>s, so we don’t need an explicit loop variable.  On the other hand, the use of for, rather than while, allows us to limit the scope of the ‘‘current element,’’ s, to the loop itself  the for-statement .  A for-statement is also useful for expressing a loop without an explicit termination condition:  for  string s; cin>>s;  v.push_back s ;  for  ;;  {     ‘‘forever’’     ...  }   }  }  }  236   Statements  Chapter 9  However, many consider this idiom obscure and prefer to use:  while true  {     ‘‘forever’’     ...  9.5.3 while Statements A while-statement executes its controlled statement until its condition becomes false. For example:  template  Iter ﬁnd Iter ﬁrst, Iter last, Value val  {  while  ﬁrst!=last && ∗ﬁrst!=val   ++ﬁrst; return ﬁrst;  I tend to prefer while-statements over for-statements when there isn’t an obvious loop variable or where the update of a loop variable naturally comes in the middle of the loop body.  A for-statement  §9.5.2  is easily rewritten into an equivalent while-statement and vice versa.  9.5.4 do Statements A do-statement is similar to a while-statement except that the condition comes after the body. For example:  void print_backwards char a[], int i  {     imust be positive  cout << '{'; do {  } while  i ; cout << '}';  cout << a[−−i];  This might be called like this: print_backwards s,strlen s  ; but it is all too easy to make a horrible mistake.  For example, what if s was the empty string?  In my experience, the do-statement is a source of errors and confusion. The reason is that its body is always executed once before the condition is evaluated.  However, for the body to work cor- rectly, something very much like the condition must hold even the ﬁrst time through. More often than I would have guessed, I have found that condition not to hold as expected either when the pro- gram was ﬁrst written and tested or later after the code preceding it has been modiﬁed. I also prefer the condition ‘‘up front where I can see it.’’  Consequently, I recommend avoiding do-statements.  9.5.5  Loop Exit If the condition of an iteration statement  a for-, while-, or do-statement  is omitted, the loop will not  terminate  unless  the  user  explicitly  exits  it  by  a break, return  §12.1.4 , goto  §9.6 , throw  §13.5 , or some less obvious way such as a call of exit    §15.4.3 .  A break ‘‘breaks out of’’  the   Section 9.5.5  Loop Exit  237  nearest enclosing switch-statement  §9.4.2  or iteration-statement. For example:  We use a break when we need to leave the loop body ‘‘in the middle.’’  Unless it warps the logic of a loop  e.g., requires the introduction of an extra varible , it is usually better to have the complete exit condition as the condition of a while-statement or a for-statement.  Sometimes, we don’t want to exit the loop completely, we just want to get to the end of the loop  body. A continue skips the rest of the body of an iteration-statement. For example:  After a continue, the increment part of the loop  if any  is executed, followed by the loop condition  if any .  So ﬁnd_prime   could equivalently have been written as:  void f vector & v, string terminator  {  char c; string s; while  cin>>c  {     ... if  c == '\n'  break;    ...  }  }  }  }  }  }  void ﬁnd_prime vector & v  {  for  int i = 0; i!=v.siz e  ; ++i  { if  !prime v[i]  continue; return v[i];  void ﬁnd_prime vector & v  {  for  int i = 0; i!=v.siz e  ; ++i  {  if  !prime v[i]  { return v[i];  }  9.6 goto Statements C++ possesses the infamous goto:  goto identiﬁer ; identiﬁer : statement  The goto has few uses in general high-level programming, but it can be very useful when C++ code is generated by a program rather than written directly by a person; for example, gotos can be used in a parser generated from a grammar by a parser generator.   238   Statements  Chapter 9  The scope of a label is the function it is in  §6.3.4 . This implies that you can use goto to jump both into and out of blocks. The only restriction is that you cannot jump past an initializer or into an exception handler  §13.5 .  One  of  the  few sensible  uses  of goto in  ordinary  code  is  to  break  out  from  a  nested  loop  or switch-statement  a break breaks out of only the innermost enclosing loop or switch-statement .  For example:  void do_something int i, int j      do something to a two-dimensional matrix called mn  for  i = 0; i!=n; ++i   for  j = 0; j!=m; ++j   if  nm[i][j] == a   goto found;     not found    ...  found:     nm[i][j] == a  {  }  Note that this goto just jumps forward to exit its loop. It does not introduce a new loop or enter a new scope.  That makes it the least troublesome and least confusing use of a goto.  9.7  Comments and Indentation Judicious  use  of  comments  and  consistent  use  of  indentation  can  make the  task  of  reading  and understanding a program much more pleasant. Several different consistent styles of indentation are in use. I see no fundamental reason to prefer one over another  although, like most programmers, I have my preferences, and this book reﬂects them . The same applies to styles of comments.  Comments can be misused in ways that seriously affect the readability of a program. The com-  piler does not understand the contents of a comment, so it has no way of ensuring that a comment   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   is meaningful, describes the program, and is up to date.  Most  programs  contain  comments  that  are  incomprehensible,  ambiguous,  and  just  plain  wrong. Bad comments can be worse than no comments.  If something can be stated in the language itself, it should be, and not just mentioned in a com-  ment.  This remark is aimed at comments such as these:     variable "v" must be initialized     variable "v" must be used only byfunction "f  "     call function "init  " before calling anyother function in this ﬁle     call function "cleanup  " at the end of your program   Section 9.7  Comments and Indentation  239  Such comments can typically be rendered unnecessary by proper use of C++.  Once something has been stated clearly in the language, it should not be mentioned a second     don’t use function "weird  "     function "f int ... " takes twoorthree arguments  time in a comment. For example:  a = b+c;  count++;     increment the counter     abecomes b+c  Such comments are worse than simply redundant. They increase the amount of text the reader has to look at, they often obscure the structure of the program, and they may be wrong. Note, however, that such comments are used extensively for teaching purposes in programming language textbooks such as this. This is one of the many ways a program in a textbook differs from a real program.  A good comment states what a piece of code is supposed to do  the intent of the code , whereas the code  only  states what it does  in terms of how it does it . Preferably, a comment is expressed at a suitably high level of abstraction so that it is easy for a human to understand without delving into minute details.  My preference is for:  cid:129  A comment for each source ﬁle stating what the declarations in it have in common, refer-  ences to manuals, the name of the programmer, general hints for maintenance, etc.   cid:129  A comment for each class, template, and namespace  cid:129  A comment for each nontrivial function stating its purpose, the algorithm used  unless it is  obvious , and maybe something about the assumptions it makes about its environment   cid:129  A comment for each global and namespace variable and constant  cid:129  A few comments where the code is nonobvious and or nonportable  cid:129  Very little else  For example:  tbl.c: Implementation of the symbol table.       *  *       Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. See Ralston: "A ﬁrst course ..." pg 411.  scan p,n,c  requires that p points to an array ofatleast n elements     sor t p,q  sorts the elements of the sequence [p:q  using < for comparison.     Revised to handle invalid dates.Bjar neStroustr up,Feb 29 2013  A well-chosen and well-written set of comments is an essential part of a good program. Writing good comments can be as difﬁcult as writing the program itself. It is an art well worth cultivating.   240   Statements  Chapter 9  Note that  ∗ ∗  style comments do not nest. For example:   *  ∗   remove expensivecheck if  check p,q   error "bad p q"   * should neverhappen*   This nesting should give an error for an unmatched ﬁnal ∗ .  9.8  Advice [1]  Don’t declare a variable until you have a value to initialize it with; §9.3, §9.4.3, §9.5.2.

In C++, an assignment is an expression, a func- tion  call  is  an  expression,  the  construction  of  an  object  is  an  expression,  and  so  are  many other operations that go beyond conventional arithmetic expression evaluation.  To giv e an impression of how expressions are used and to show them in context, I ﬁrst present a small complete program, a simple ‘‘desk calculator.’’ Next, the complete set of operators is listed and their meaning for built- in types is brieﬂy outlined. The operators that require more extensive explanation are discussed in Chapter 11.   242  Expressions   Chapter 10  10.2  A Desk Calculator Consider a simple desk calculator program that provides the four standard arithmetic operations as inﬁx operators on ﬂoating-point numbers. The user can also deﬁne variables.  For example, given the input   pi is predeﬁned  the calculator program will write  r = 2.5 area = pi ∗ r ∗ r  2.5 19.635  where 2.5 is the result of the ﬁrst line of input and 19.635 is the result of the second.  The  calculator  consists  of  four  main  parts:  a  parser, an input  function,  a  symbol  table,  and  a driver.  Actually, it is a miniature compiler in which the parser does the syntactic analysis, the input function handles input and lexical analysis, the symbol table holds permanent information, and the driver handles initialization, output, and errors. We  could add many features to this calculator to make it more useful, but the code is long enough as it is, and most features would just add code without providing additional insight into the use of C++.  10.2.1  The Parser Here is a grammar for the language accepted by the calculator:     end is end-of-input  expression print expression print expr_list     printis newline or semicolon  program: end  expr_list end  expr_list:  expression:  expression + term expression − term term  term:  term   primary term ∗ primary primary  primary:  number  name  name = expression − primar y   expression       number is a ﬂoating-point literal    name is an identiﬁer   Section 10.2.1  The Parser   243  In other words, a program is a sequence of expressions separated by semicolons. The basic units of an  expression  are  numbers,  names,  and  the  operators ∗,  , +, −  both  unary  and  binary ,  and =  assignment .  Names need not be declared before use.  I use a style of syntax analysis called recursive descent; it is a popular and straightforward top- down technique. In a language such as C++, in which function calls are relatively cheap, it is also efﬁcient.  For each production in the grammar, there is a function that calls other functions. Termi- nal symbols  for example, end, number, +, and −  are recognized by a lexical analyzer and nonter- minal symbols are recognized by the syntax analyzer functions, expr  , term  , and prim  . As soon as both operands of a  sub expression are known, the expression is evaluated; in a real compiler, code could be generated at this point.  For input, the parser uses a Token_stream that encapsulates the reading of characters and their composition into Tokens.  That is, a Token_stream ‘‘tokenizes’’: it turns streams of characters, such as 123.45, into Tokens.  A Token is a {kind-of-token,value} pair, such as {number,123.45}, where the 123.45 has been turned into a ﬂoating point value.  The main parts of the parser need only to know the name of the Token_stream, ts, and how to get Tokens from it. To  read the next Token, it calls ts.get  . To get the most recently read Token  the ‘‘current token’’ , it calls ts.current  . In addition to providing tokenizing, the Token_stream hides the actual source of the characters. We’ll see that they can come directly from a user typing to cin, from a program command line, or from any other input stream  §10.2.7 .  The deﬁnition of Token looks like this:  enum class Kind : char { name, number, end, plus='+', minus='−', mul='∗', div=' ’, print=';', assign='=', lp=' ', rp=' '  struct Token {  Kind kind; string string_value; double number_value;  };  };  };  Representing each token by the integer value of its character is convenient and efﬁcient and can be a help to people using debuggers.  This works as long as no character used as input has a value used as an enumerator – and no current character set I know of has a printing character with a single- digit integer value.  The interface to Token_stream looks like this:  class Token_stream { public:  Token get  ;  const Token& current  ;    ...     read and returnnexttoken    most recently read token  The implementation is presented in §10.2.2.  Each parser function takes a bool  §6.2.2  argument, called get, indicating whether the function needs  to  call Token_stream::g et   to  get  the  next  token.  Each parser  function  evaluates  ‘‘its’’   244  Expressions   Chapter 10  expression and returns the value.  The function expr   handles addition and subtraction. It consists of a single loop that looks for terms to add or subtract:  double expr bool get   {  double left = term get ;     add and subtract  for  ;;  {     ‘‘forever’’  switch  ts.current  .kind  { case Kind::plus:  left += term true ; break;  case Kind::minus:  left −= term true ; break;  default:  return left;  }  }  }  This  function  really  does  not  do  much  itself. In  a  manner  typical  of  higher-level functions  in  a large program, it calls other functions to do the work.  The switch-statement  §2.2.4, §9.4.2  tests the value of its condition, which is supplied in paren- theses after the switch keyword, against a set of constants. The break-statements are used to exit the switch-statement.  If the value tested does not match any case label, the default is chosen. The pro- grammer need not provide a default.  Note that an expression such as 2−3+4 is evaluated as  2−3 +4, as speciﬁed in the grammar. The  curious  notation for ;;  is  a  way  to  specify  an  inﬁnite  loop;  you  could  pronounce  it  ‘‘for- ev er’’  §9.5 ; while true  is an alternative. The switch-statement is executed repeatedly until some- thing different from + and − is found, and then the return-statement in the default case is executed.  The operators += and −= are used to handle the addition and subtraction; left=left+term true  and left=left−term true  could have been used without changing the meaning of the program. However, left+=term true  and left−=term true  are  not  only  shorter  but  also  express  the  intended  operation directly. Each assignment operator is a separate lexical token, so a + = 1; is a syntax error because of the space between the + and the =.  C++ provides assignment operators for the binary operators:  +  −     % &      ˆ   >  so that the following assignment operators are possible:  =  +=  −=   = %= &= =  ˆ=   >=  ∗  ∗=  The % is the modulo, or remainder, operator; &, , and ˆ are the bitwise logical operators and, or, and exclusive or;  > are the left shift and right shift operators; §10.3 summarizes the operators and their meanings. For a binary operator @ applied to operands of built-in types, an expression x@=y means x=x@y, except that x is evaluated once only.   The function term   handles multiplication and division in the same way expr   handles addition  The Parser   245  Section 10.2.1  and subtraction:  for  ;;  {  double term bool get   {  double left = prim get ;     multiply and divide  switch  ts.current  .kind  { case Kind::mul:  left ∗= prim true ; break;  case Kind::div:  if  auto d = prim true   {  left  = d; break;  } return error "divide by 0" ;  default:  return left;  }  }  }  The result of dividing by zero is undeﬁned and usually disastrous. We  therefore test for 0 before dividing and call error   if we detect a zero divisor. The function error   is described in §10.2.4.  The variable d is introduced into the program exactly where it is needed and initialized immedi- ately. The scope of a name introduced in a condition is the statement controlled by that condition, and  the  resulting  value  is  the  value  of  the  condition   §9.4.3 . Consequently, the  division  and assignment left =d are done if and only if d is nonzero.  The function prim   handling a primary is much like expr   and term  , except that because we are  getting lower in the call hierarchy a bit of real work is being done and no loop is necessary:  double prim bool get   {     handle primar ies  if  get  ts.get  ;    read next token  switch  ts.current  .kind  { case Kind::number:  {  double v = ts.current  .number_value; ts.get  ; return v;     ﬂoating-point constant  } case Kind::name: {  }  double& v = table[ts.current  .string_value];  if  ts.get  .kind == Kind::assign  v = expr true ;  return v;     ﬁnd the corresponding    ’=’ seen: assignment   246  Expressions   Chapter 10  case Kind::minus:      unar yminus  return −prim true ;  case Kind::lp: {  auto e = expr true ; if  ts.current  .kind != Kind::rp  return error "' ' expected" ; ts.get  ; return e;     eat ’ ’  } default:  }  }  return error "primar y expected" ;  When a Token that is a number  that is, an integer or ﬂoating-point literal  is seen, its value is placed in  its number_value. Similarly, when  a Token that  is  a name  however deﬁned;  see  §10.2.2  and §10.2.3  is seen, its value is placed in its string_value.  Note  that prim   always  reads  one  more Token than  it  uses  to  analyze  its  primary  expression. The reason is that it must do that in some cases  e.g., to see if a name is assigned to , so for consis- tency it must do it in all cases. In the cases where a parser function simply wants to move ahead to the  next Token, it doesn’t use  the  return  value  from ts.get  . That’s ﬁne  because  we  can  get  the result from ts.current  . Had ignoring the return value of get   bothered me, I’d hav e either added a read   function that just updated current   without returning a value or explicitly ‘‘thrown away’’ the result: void ts.g et   .  Before  doing  anything  to  a  name,  the  calculator  must  ﬁrst  look  ahead  to  see  if  it  is  being assigned to or simply read. In both cases, the symbol table is consulted. The symbol table is a map  §4.4.3, §31.4.3 :  map  table;  That  is,  when table is  indexed by a string, the  resulting  value  is  the double corresponding  to  the string. For example, if the user enters  radius = 6378.388;  the calculator will reach case Kind::name and execute  double& v = table["radius"];    ... expr   calculates the value to be assigned ... v = 6378.388;  The reference v is used to hold on to the double associated with radius while expr   calculates the value 6378.388 from the input characters.  Chapter 14 and Chapter 15 discuss how to org anize a program as a set of modules. However, with one exception, the declarations for this calculator example can be ordered so that everything is declared exactly once and before it is used. The exception is expr  , which calls term  , which calls prim  , which in turn calls expr  . This loop of calls must be broken somehow.  A declaration  double expr bool ;  before the deﬁnition of prim   will do nicely.   Section 10.2.2  Input   247  10.2.2  Input Reading input is often the messiest part of a program. To communicate with a person, the program must cope with that person’s whims, conventions, and seemingly random errors. Trying to force the person to behave in a manner more suitable for the machine is often  rightly  considered offen- sive. The task of a low-level input routine is to read characters and compose higher-level tokens from them. These tokens are then the units of input for higher-level routines.  Here, low-level input is done by ts.get  . Writing a low-level input routine need not be an everyday task. Many systems provide standard functions for this.  First we need to see the complete deﬁnition of Token_stream:  class Token_stream { public:  Token_stream istream& s  : ip{&s}, owns{false} { } Token_stream istream∗ p  : ip{p}, owns{true} { }  ˜Token_stream   { close  ; }  Token get  ;  Token& current  ;     read and returnnexttoken    most recently read token  void set_input istream& s  { close  ; ip = &s; owns=false; } void set_input istream∗ p  { close  ; ip = p; owns = true; }  private:  void close   { if  owns  delete ip; }  istream∗ ip;  bool owns;  Token ct {Kind::end} ;     pointer to an input stream    does the Token_stream own the istream?    current token  };  We  initialize a Token_stream with an input stream  §4.3.2, Chapter 38  from which it gets its char- acters.  The Token_stream implements the convention that it owns  and eventually deletes; §3.2.1.2, §11.2  an istream passed as a pointer, but not an istream passed as a reference. This may be a bit elaborate for this simple program, but it is a useful and general technique for classes that hold a pointer to a resource requiring destruction.  A Token_stream holds three values: a pointer to its input stream  ip , a Boolean  owns , indicat-  ing ownership of the input stream, and the current token  ct .  I gav e ct a default value because it seemed sloppy not to. People should not call current   before get  , but if they do, they get a well-deﬁned Token. I chose Kind::end as the initial value for ct so that a program that misuses current   will not get a value that wasn’t on the input stream.  I present Token_stream::g et   in  two stages.  First, I provide  a  deceptively  simple  version  that imposes a burden on the user. Next, I modify it into a slightly less elegant, but much easier to use, version.  The idea for get   is to read a character, use that character to decide what kind of token needs to be composed, read more characters when needed, and then return a Token representing the characters read.   248  Expressions   Chapter 10  The initial statements read the ﬁrst non-whitespace character from ∗ip  the stream pointed to by  ip  into ch and check that the read operation succeeded:  Token Token_stream::g et   {  char ch = 0; ∗ip>>ch;  switch  ch  { case 0:  return ct={Kind::end};     assign and return  By default, operator >> skips whitespace  that is, spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.  and leaves the value of ch unchanged if the input operation failed.  Consequently, ch==0 indicates end-of-input.  Assignment is an operator, and the result of the assignment is the value of the variable assigned to.  This allows  me  to  assign  the  value Kind::end to curr_tok and  return  it  in  the  same  statement. Having a single statement rather than two is useful in maintenance. If the assignment and the return became separated in the code, a programmer might update the one and forget to update the other.  Note also how the {}-list notation  §3.2.1.3, §11.3  is used on the right-hand side of an assign-  ment.  That is, it is an expression.  I could have written that return-statement as:  ct.kind = Kind::end;    assign return ct;    return  However, I think that assigning a complete object {Kind::end} is clearer than dealing with individual members of ct. The {Kind::end} is equivalent to {Kind::end,0,0}. That’s good if we care about the last two members of the Token and not so good if we are worried about performance. Neither is the case here, but in general dealing with complete objects is clearer and less error-prone than manipu- lating data members individually. The cases below giv e examples of the other strategy.  Consider some of the cases separately before considering the complete function. The expres-  sion terminator, ';', the parentheses, and the operators are handled simply by returning their values:     end of expression; print  case ';': case '∗': case ' ': case '+': case '−': case ' ': case ' ': case '=':  return ct={static_cast  ch };  The static_cast  §11.5.2   is  needed  because  there  is  no  implicit  conversion  from char to Kind  §8.4.1 ; only some characters correspond to Kind values, so we have to ‘‘certify’’ that in this case ch does.  Numbers are handled like this:  case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4': case '5': case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9': case '.':   Section 10.2.2  Input   249  ip−>putback ch ;  ∗ip >> ct.number_value;     read the number into ct ct.kind=Kind::number; return ct;     put the ﬁrst digit  or .  backinto the input stream  Stacking case labels  horizontally  rather  than  vertically  is  generally  not  a  good  idea  because  this arrangement is harder to read. However, having one line for each digit is tedious. Because opera- tor >> is already deﬁned for reading ﬂoating-point values into a double, the code is trivial.  First the initial character  a digit or a dot  is put back into cin. Then, the ﬂoating-point value can be read into ct.number_value.  If the token is not the end of input, an operator, a punctuation character, or a  number, it must be  a name.  A name is handled similarly to a number:  default:      name,name =, or error  if  isalpha ch   {  ip−>putback ch ;  ∗ip>>ct.string_value;  ct.kind=Kind::name; return ct;  }     put the ﬁrst character backinto the input stream    read the string into ct  Finally, we may  simply  have  an error. The  simple-minded,  but  reasonably  effective  way  to  deal with an error is the write call an error   function and then return a print token if error   returns:  error "bad token" ; return ct={Kind::print};  The standard-library function isalpha    §36.2.1  is used to avoid listing every character as a sepa- rate case label.  Operator >> applied to a string  in this case, string_value  reads until it hits white- space.  Consequently, a user must terminate a name by a space before an operator using the name as an operand. This is less than ideal, so we will return to this problem in §10.2.3.  Here, ﬁnally, is the complete input function:  Token Token_stream::g et   {  char ch = 0; ∗ip>>ch;  switch  ch  { case 0:  case ';': case '∗': case ' ': case '+': case '−': case ' ': case ' ': case '=':  return ct={Kind::end};     assign and return     end of expression; print  return ct=={static_cast  ch };   250  Expressions   Chapter 10  case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4': case '5': case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9': case '.':     put the ﬁrst digit  or .  backinto the input stream    read number into ct  default:      name,name =, or error  if  isalpha ch   {     put the ﬁrst character backinto the input stream    read string into ct  ip−>putback ch ;  ∗ip >> ct.number_value;  ct.kind=Kind::number; return ct;  ip−>putback ch ;  ∗ip>>ct.string_value;  ct.kind=Kind::name; return ct;  }  error "bad token" ; return ct={Kind::print};  }  }  The  conversion  of  an  operator  to  its Token value  is  trivial  because  the kind of  an  operator  was deﬁned as the integer value of the operator  §10.2.1 .  10.2.3  Low-Level Input Using the calculator as deﬁned so far reveals a few inconveniences.  It is tedious to remember to add a semicolon after an expression in order to get its value printed, and having a name terminated by whitespace only is a real nuisance. For example, x=7 is an identiﬁer – rather than the identiﬁer x followed by the operator = and the number 7. To get what we  usually  want, we would have to add whitespace  after x: x =7. Both  problems  are  solved  by  replacing  the  type-oriented  default  input operations in get   with code that reads individual characters.  First, we’ll make a newline equivalent to the semicolon used to mark the end-of-expression:  Token Token_stream::g et   {  char ch;  do {    skip whitespace except ’\n’  if  !ip−>get ch   return ct={Kind::end};  } while  ch!='\n' && isspace ch  ;  switch  ch  { case ';': case '\n':  return ct={Kind::print};  Here, I use a do-statement; it is equivalent to a while-statement except that the controlled statement is always executed at least once. The call ip−>get ch  reads a single character from the input stream ∗ip into ch. By default, get   does not skip whitespace the way >> does.  The test if   !ip−>get ch   succeeds if no character can be read from cin; in this case, Kind::end is returned to terminate the calculator session. The operator !  not  is used because get   returns true in case of success.   Section 10.2.3  Low-Level Input   251  The  standard-library  function isspace   provides  the  standard  test  for  whitespace   §36.2.1 ; isspace c  returns  a  nonzero  value  if c is  a  whitespace  character  and  zero  otherwise. The  test  is implemented  as  a  table  lookup,  so  using isspace   is  much  faster  than  testing  for  the  individual whitespace characters. Similar functions test if a character is a digit  isdigit   , a letter  isalpha   , or a digit or letter  isalnum   .  After whitespace has been skipped, the next character is used to determine what kind of lexical  token is coming.  The  problem  caused  by >> reading  into  a  string  until  whitespace  is  encountered  is  solved  by  reading one character at a time until a character that is not a letter or a digit is found:  default:      NAME, NAME=, or error  if  isalpha ch   {  string_value = ch; while  ip−>get ch  && isalnum ch    ip−>putback ch ; return ct={Kind::name};  }  string_value += ch;     append ch to end of string_value  Fortunately, these two improvements could both be implemented by modifying a single local sec- tion of code. Constructing programs so that improvements can be implemented through local mod- iﬁcations only is an important design aim.  You might worry that adding characters to the end of a string one by one would be inefﬁcient.  It would  be  for  very  long strings,  but  all  modern string implementations  provide  the  ‘‘small  string optimization’’  §19.3.3 .  That means that handling the kind of strings we are likely to use as names in  a  calculator   or  even in a compiler   doesn’t inv olve any  inefﬁcient  operations. In  particular, using a short string doesn’t require any use of free store. The maximum number of characters for a short string is implementation-dependent, but 14 would be a good guess.  10.2.4  Error Handling It is always important to detect and report errors. However,  for this program, a simple error han- dling strategy sufﬁces.  The error   function simply counts the errors, writes out an error message, and returns:  int no_of_errors;  double error const string& s  {  no_of_errors++; cerr << "error: " << s << '\n'; return 1;  }  The stream cerr is an unbuffered output stream usually used to report errors  §38.1 .  The reason for returning a value is that errors typically occur in the middle of the evaluation of an expression, so we should either abort that evaluation entirely or return a value that is unlikely to cause subsequent errors. The latter is adequate for this simple calculator. Had Token_stream::g et     252  Expressions   Chapter 10  kept track of the line numbers, error   could have informed the user approximately where the error occurred.  This would be useful when the calculator is used noninteractively.  A more stylized and general error-handling strategy would separate error detection from error recovery. This can be implemented using exceptions  see §2.4.3.1, Chapter 13 , but what we have here is quite suitable for a 180-line calculator.  10.2.5  The Driver With all the pieces of the program in place, we need only a driver to start things. I decided on two functions: main   to do setup and error reporting and calculate   to handle the actual calculation:  Token_stream ts {cin};     use input from cin  ts.get  ; if  ts.current  .kind == Kind::end  break; if  ts.current  .kind == Kind::print  continue; cout << expr false  << '\n';  void calculate   {  for  ;;  {  }  int main   {  }  }  calculate  ;  return no_of_errors;  table["pi"] = 3.1415926535897932385; table["e"] = 2.7182818284590452354;     inser tpredeﬁned names  Conventionally, main   returns  zero  if  the  program  terminates  normally  and  nonzero  otherwise  §2.2.1 .  Returning the number of errors accomplishes this nicely. As it happens, the only initial- ization needed is to insert the predeﬁned names into the symbol table.  The  primary  task  of  the  main  loop   in calculate    is to read  expressions  and  write  out  the  answer. This is achieved by the line:  cout << expr false  << '\n';  The argument false tells expr   that it does not need to call ts.get   to read a token on which to work. Testing for Kind::end ensures that the loop is correctly exited when ts.get   encounters an input error  or  an  end-of-ﬁle. A break-statement  exits  its  nearest  enclosing switch-statement  or  loop  §9.5 .  Testing for Kind::print  that is, for '\n' and ';'  relieves expr   of the responsibility for han- dling empty expressions.  A continue-statement is equivalent to going to the very end of a loop.   Section 10.2.6  Headers   253  10.2.6  Headers The calculator uses standard-library facilities.  Therefore, appropriate headers must be included to complete the program:  include     I O include   include   include       strings    map    isalpha  , etc.  using namespace std;  All of these headers provide facilities in the std namespace, so to use the names they provide we must either use explicit qualiﬁcation with std:: or bring the names into the global namespace by  To  avoid confusing the discussion of expressions with modularity issues, I did the latter. Chapter 14 and Chapter 15 discuss ways of organizing this calculator into modules using namespaces and how to org anize it into source ﬁles.  10.2.7  Command-Line Arguments After the program was written and tested, I found it a bother to ﬁrst start the program, then type the expressions,  and  ﬁnally  quit. My  most  common  use  was  to  evaluate  a  single  expression.  If that expression could be presented as a command-line argument, a few keystrokes could be avoided.  A program starts by calling main    §2.2.1, §15.4 . When this is done, main   is given two argu- ments specifying the number of arguments, conventionally called argc, and an array of arguments, conventionally called argv. The arguments are C-style character strings  §2.2.5, §7.3 , so the type of argv is char∗[argc+1]. The name of the program  as it occurs on the command line  is passed as argv[0], so argc is always at least 1. The list of arguments is zero-terminated; that is, argv[argc]==0. For example, for the command  dc 150 1.1934  the arguments have these values:  argc:  2  argv:  0  "dc"  "150 1.1934"  Because the conventions for calling main   are shared with C, C-style arrays and strings are used.  The  idea  is  to  read  from  the  command  string  in  the  same  way  that  we  read  from  the  input stream.  A stream that reads from a string is unsurprisingly called an istringstream  §38.2.2 .  So to calculate expressions presented on the command line, we simply have to get our Token_stream to read from an appropriate istringstream:   254  Expressions   Chapter 10  Token_stream ts {cin};  int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  switch  argc  { case 1:  break;  case 2:  ts.set_input new istringstream{argv[1]} ; break;  default:  }  error "too many arguments" ; return 1;     read from standard input     read from argument string  table["pi"] = 3.1415926535897932385; table["e"] = 2.7182818284590452354;     inser tpredeﬁned names  calculate  ;  return no_of_errors;  }  }  To use an istringstream, include  .  It would be easy to modify main   to accept several command-line arguments, but this does not  appear to be necessary, especially as several expressions can be passed as a single argument:  dc "rate=1.1934;150 rate;19.75 rate;217 rate"  I use quotes because ; is the command separator on my UNIX systems. Other systems have differ- ent conventions for supplying arguments to a program on startup.  Simple as they are, argc and argv are still a source of minor, yet annoying, bugs.  To avoid those and especially to make it easier to pass around the program arguments, I tend to use a simple func- tion to create a vector :  vector  arguments int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  vector  res; for  int i = 0; i!=argc; ++i   res.push_back argv[i] ;  return res;  More elaborate argument parsing functions are not uncommon.  10.2.8  A Note on Style To  programmers  unacquainted  with  associative  arrays,  the  use  of  the  standard-library map as  the symbol  table  seems  almost  like cheating.  It is  not. The  standard  library  and  other  libraries  are meant to be used. Often, a library has received more care in its design and implementation than a   Section 10.2.8  A Note on Style  255  programmer could afford for a handcrafted piece of code to be used in just one program.  Looking at the code for the calculator, especially at the ﬁrst version, we can see that there isn’t much traditional C-style, low-level code presented. Many of the traditional tricky details have been replaced by uses of standard-library classes such as ostream,  string, and map  §4.3.1, §4.2, §4.4.3, §31.4, Chapter 36, Chapter 38 .  Note the relative scarcity of loops, arithmetic, and assignments. This is the way things ought to  be in code that doesn’t manipulate hardware directly or implement low-level abstractions.  10.3  Operator Summary This section presents a summary of expressions and some examples.  Each operator is followed by one or more names commonly used for it and an example of its use. In these tables:   cid:129  A name is an identiﬁer  e.g., sum and map , an operator name  e.g., operator int, operator+, and operator""  km ,  or  the  name  of  a  template  specialization   e.g., sort  and array  , possibly qualiﬁed using ::  e.g., std::vector and vector ::operator[] .   cid:129  A class-name is the name of a class  including decltype expr  where expr denotes a class .  cid:129  A member is a member name  including the name of a destructor or a member template .  cid:129  An object is an expression yielding a class object.  cid:129  A pointer is an expression yielding a pointer  including this and an object of that type that  supports the pointer operation .   cid:129  An expr is an expression, including a literal  e.g., 17, "mouse", and true   cid:129  An expr-list is a  possibly empty  list of expressions.  cid:129  An lvalue is an expression denoting a modiﬁable object  §6.4.1 .  cid:129  A type can be a fully general type name  with ∗,   , etc.   only when it appears in parenthe-  ses; elsewhere, there are restrictions  §iso.A .   cid:129  A lambda-declarator is a  possibly empty, comma-separated  list of parameters optionally followed by the mutable speciﬁer, optionally followed by a noexcept speciﬁer, optionally fol- lowed by a return type  §11.4 .   cid:129  A capture-list is a  possibly empty  list specifying context dependencies  §11.4 .  cid:129  A stmt-list is a  possibly empty  list of statements  §2.2.4, Chapter 9 .  The  syntax  of  expressions  is  independent  of  operand  types. The  meanings  presented  here  apply when the operands are of built-in types  §6.2.1 . In addition, you can deﬁne meanings for operators applied to operands of user-deﬁned types  §2.3, Chapter 18 .  A table can only approximate the rules of the grammar. For details, see §iso.5 and §iso.A.

Unary  operators  and  assignment  operators  are  right-associative; all  others  are  left-associative.  For example, a=b=c means a= b=c  whereas a+b+c means  a+b +c.  A few  grammar  rules  cannot  be  expressed  in  terms  of  precedence   also  known  as  binding strength  and associativity. For example, a=b<c?d=e:f=g means a=  b<c ? d=e : f=g  , but you need to look at the grammar  §iso.A  to determine that.   258  Expressions   Chapter 10  Before applying the grammar rules, lexical tokens are composed from characters. The longest possible sequence of characters is chosen to make a token.  For example, && is a single operator, rather than two & operators, and a+++1 means  a ++  + 1. This is sometimes called the Max Munch rule.

Some characters from the basic source character set  §6.1.2 , such as , are not convenient to type on some keywords.  Also, some programmers ﬁnd it odd to use of symbols, such as && and ˜, for  basic  logical  operations. Consequently, a set  of  alternative  representation  are  provided  as keywords:  Alternative Representation   §iso.2.12   and  &  and_eq &=  bitand  &  bitor    compl  ˜  not !  not_eq  !=   or   or_eq  =   xor ˆ  xor_eq ˆ=  For example  bool b = not  x or y  and z; int x4 = ˜  x1 bitor x2  bitand x3;  is equivalent to  bool b = ! x  y  && z; int x4 = ˜ x1  x2  & x3;  Note that and= is not equivalent to &=; if you prefer keywords, you must write and_eq.  10.3.1  Results The result types of arithmetic operators are determined by a set of rules known as ‘‘the usual arith- metic conversions’’  §10.5.3 .  The overall aim is to produce a result of the ‘‘largest’’ operand type. For example, if a binary operator has a ﬂoating-point operand, the computation is done using ﬂoat- ing-point arithmetic and the result is a ﬂoating-point value.  Similarly, if it has a long operand, the computation  is  done  using  long  integer  arithmetic,  and  the  result  is  a long. Operands  that  are smaller than an int  such as bool and char  are converted to int before the operator is applied.   }  }  void f   {  Section 10.3.1  Results   259  The relational operators, ==, <=, etc., produce Boolean results. The meaning and result type of  user-deﬁned operators are determined by their declarations  §18.2 .  Where  logically  feasible,  the  result  of  an  operator  that  takes  an  lvalue  operand  is  an  lvalue  denoting that lvalue operand. For example:  void f int x, int y  {  int j = x = y; int∗ p = &++x;  int∗ q = & x++ ;  int∗ p2 = & x>y?x:y ; int& r =  x<y ?x:1;     the value of x=y is the value of x after the assignment    ppoints to x    error :x++ is not an lvalue  it is not the value stored in x     address of the int with the larger value    error :1isnot an lvalue  If both the second and third operands of ?: are lvalues and have the same type, the result is of that type and is an lvalue.  Preserving lvalues in this way allows greater ﬂexibility in using operators. This is particularly useful when writing code that needs to work uniformly and efﬁciently with both built-in and user-deﬁned types  e.g., when writing templates or programs that generate C++ code .  The result of sizeof is of an unsigned integral type called size_t deﬁned in  . The result  of pointer subtraction is of a signed integral type called ptrdiff_t deﬁned in  .  Implementations do not have to check for arithmetic overﬂow and hardly any do.  For example:  int i = 1; while  0 < i  ++i; cout << "i has become negative!" << i << '\n';  This will  eventually  try to increase i past the largest integer. What happens then is undeﬁned, but typically the value ‘‘wraps around’’ to a neg ative number  on my machine −2147483648 .  Similarly, the effect of dividing by zero is undeﬁned, but doing so usually causes abrupt termination of the program.  In particular, underﬂow, overﬂow, and division by zero do not throw standard exceptions  §30.4.1.1 .  10.3.2  Order of Evaluation The order of evaluation of subexpressions within an expression is undeﬁned. In particular, you can- not assume that the expression is evaluated left-to-right. For example:  int x = f 2 +g 3 ;     undeﬁned whether f   or g   is called ﬁrst  Better code can be generated in the absence of restrictions on expression evaluation order. How- ev er, the absence of restrictions on evaluation order can lead to undeﬁned results. For example:  int i = 1; v[i] = i++;    undeﬁned result  The assignment may be evaluated as either v[1]=1 or v[2]=1 or may cause some even stranger behav- ior. Compilers can warn about such ambiguities. Unfortunately, most do not, so be careful not to write an expression that reads or writes an object more than once, unless it does so using a single   260  Expressions   Chapter 10  operator  that  makes  it  well  deﬁned,  such  as ++ and +=, or explicitly  express  sequencing  using ,  comma , &&, or .  The operators ,  comma , &&  logical and , and   logical or  guarantee that their left-hand oper- and is evaluated before their right-hand operand. For example, b= a=2,a+1  assigns 3 to b. Exam- ples of the use of  and && can be found in §10.3.3. For built-in types, the second operand of && is evaluated only if its ﬁrst operand is true, and the second operand of  is evaluated only if its ﬁrst op- erand is false; this is sometimes called short-circuit evaluation. Note that the sequencing operator ,  comma  is logically different from the comma used to separate arguments in a function call. For example:  f1 v[i],i++ ;  f2   v[i],i++   ;     twoarguments    one argument  The call of f1 has two arguments, v[i] and i++, and the order of evaluation of the argument expres- sions  is  undeﬁned.  So  it  should  be  avoided.  Order dependence  of  argument  expressions  is  very poor style and has undeﬁned behavior. The call of f2 has only one argument, the comma expression  v[i],i++ , which is equivalent to i++. That is confusing, so that too should be avoided.  Parentheses  can  be  used  to  force  grouping. For example, a∗b c means  a∗b  c, so parentheses must be used to get a∗ b c ; a∗ b c  may be evaluated as  a∗b  c only if the user cannot tell the differ- ence.  In particular, for many ﬂoating-point computations a∗ b c  and  a∗b  c are signiﬁcantly differ- ent, so a compiler will evaluate such expressions exactly as written.  10.3.3  Operator Precedence Precedence levels and associativity rules reﬂect the most common usage. For example:  means ‘‘if i is less than or equal to 0 or if max is less than i.’’ That is, it is equivalent to  if  i<=0  max<i     ...  if    i<=0    max<i       ...  and not the legal but nonsensical  if  i <=  0max  < i     ...  However, parentheses should be used whenever a programmer is in doubt about those rules. Use of parentheses becomes more common as the subexpressions become more complicated, but compli- cated subexpressions are a source of errors. Therefore, if you start feeling the need for parentheses, you might consider breaking up the expression by using an extra variable.  There are cases when the operator precedence does not result in the ‘‘obvious’’ interpretation.  For example:  if  i&mask == 0      oops! == expression as operand for &  This does not apply a mask to i and then test if the result is zero. Because == has higher precedence than &, the expression is interpreted as i& mask==0 . Fortunately, it is easy enough for a compiler to warn about most such mistakes.  In this case, parentheses are important:  if   i&mask  == 0     ...  It is worth noting that the following does not work the way a mathematician might expect:   Section 10.3.3  Operator Precedence   261  This is legal, but it is interpreted as  0<=x <=99, where the result of the ﬁrst comparison is either true or false. This Boolean value is then implicitly converted to 1 or 0, which is then compared to 99, yielding true. To test whether x is in the range 0..99, we might use  if  0 <= x <= 99     ...  if  0<=x && x<=99     ...  A common mistake for novices is to use =  assignment  instead of ==  equals  in a condition:  if  a = 7      oops! constant assignment in condition  This is natural because = means ‘‘equals’’ in many languages.  Again, it is easy for a compiler to warn about most such mistakes – and many do.  I do not recommend warping your style to com- pensate for compilers with weak warnings.  In particular, I don’t consider this style worthwhile:  if  7 == a     tr yto protect against misuse of =; not recommended  10.3.4  Temporary Objects Often, the compiler must introduce an object to hold an intermediate result of an expression.  For example, for v=x+y∗z the result of y∗z has to be put somewhere before it is added to x. For built-in types, this is all handled so that a temporary object  often referred to as just a temporary  is invisi- ble to the user. Howev er,  for a user-deﬁned type that holds a resource knowing the lifetime of a temporary can be important. Unless bound to a reference or used to initialize a named object, a temporary  object  is  destroyed  at  the  end  of  the  full  expression  in  which  it  was  created. A full expression is an expression that is not a subexpression of some other expression.  The standard-library string has a member c_str    §36.3  that returns a C-style pointer to a zero- terminated array of characters  §2.2.5, §43.4 . Also, the operator + is deﬁned to mean string con- catenation.  These are useful facilities for strings.  However, in combination they can cause obscure problems.  For example:  void f string& s1, string& s2, string& s3  {  const char∗ cs =  s1+s2 .c_str  ; cout << cs; if  strlen cs= s2+s3 .c_str   <8 && cs[0]=='a'  {     cs used here  }  }  Probably, your ﬁrst reaction is ‘‘But don’t do that!’’ and I agree. However, such code does get writ- ten, so it is worth knowing how it is interpreted.  A temporary string object  is  created  to  hold s1+s2. Next,  a  pointer  to  a  C-style  string  is extracted from that object. Then – at the end of the expression – the temporary object is deleted. However, the C-style string returned by c_str   was allocated as part of the temporary object holding s1+s2, and that storage is not guaranteed to exist after that temporary is destroyed.  Consequently, cs points to deallocated storage. The output operation cout<<cs might work as expected, but that would be sheer luck. A compiler can detect and warn against many variants of this problem.   262  Expressions   Chapter 10  The  problem  with  the if-statement  is  a  bit  more  subtle. The  condition  will  work  as  expected because the full expression in which the temporary holding s2+s3 is created is the condition itself. However,  that temporary is destroyed before the controlled statement is entered, so any use of cs there is not guaranteed to work.  Please note that in this case, as in many others, the problems with temporaries arose from using a high-level data type in a low-level way. A cleaner programming style yields a more understand- able program fragment and avoids the problems with temporaries completely. For example:  A temporary can be used as an initializer for a const reference or a named object. For example:  void f string& s1, string& s2, string& s3  {  cout << s1+s2; string s = s2+s3; if  s.length  <8 && s[0]=='a'  {     use s here  }  void g const string&, const string& ;  void h string& s1, string& s2  {  const string& s = s1+s2; string ss = s1+s2;  g s,ss ;      we can use s and ss here  }  }  }  This is ﬁne. The temporary is destroyed when ‘‘its’’ reference or named object goes out of scope. Remember that returning a reference to a local variable is an error  §12.1.4  and that a temporary object cannot be bound to a non-const lvalue reference  §7.7 .  A temporary  object  can  also  be  created  explicitly  in  an  expression  by  invoking  a  constructor   §11.5.1 .  For example:  void f Shape& s, int n, char ch  {  s.move string{n,ch} ;     ...     constructastr ingwith n copies of ch to pass to Shape::move    Such temporaries are destroyed in exactly the same way as the implicitly generated temporaries.  10.4  Constant Expressions C++ offers two related meanings of ‘‘constant’’:   cid:129   cid:129   constexpr: Evaluate at compile time  §2.2.3 . const: Do not modify in this scope  §2.2.3, §7.5 .  Basically, constexpr’s  role  is  to  enable  and  ensure  compile-time  evaluation,  whereas const’s   Section 10.4  Constant Expressions   263  primary role is to specify immutability in interfaces.  This section is primarily concerned with the ﬁrst role: compile-time evaluation.  A constant expression is an expression that a compiler can evaluate.  It cannot use values that are not known at compile time and it cannot have  side effects.  Ultimately, a constant expression must  start  out  with  an  integral  value   §6.2.1 ,  a  ﬂoating-point  value   §6.2.5 ,  or  an  enumerator  §8.4 , and we can combine those using operators and constexpr functions that in turn produce val- ues.  In addition, some addresses can be used in some forms of constant expressions.  For simplic- ity, I discuss those separately in §10.4.5.  There are a variety of reasons why someone might want a named constant rather than a literal or  a value stored in a variable:  [1]  Named constants make the code easier to understand and maintain. [2]  A variable might be changed  so we have to be more careful in our reasoning than for a  constant .  value arguments.  [3]  The language  requires  constant  expressions  for  array  sizes, case labels,  and template  [4]  Embedded systems  programmers  like to put  immutable  data  into  read-only  memory because read-only memory is cheaper than dynamic memory  in terms of cost and energy consumption ,  and  often  more  plentiful. Also,  data  in  read-only  memory  is  immune  to most system crashes. If initialization  is  done  at  compile  time,  there  can  be  no  data  races  on  that  object  in  a multi-threaded system.  [5]   [6]  Sometimes, evaluating something once  at compile time  gives signiﬁcantly better perfor-  mance than doing so a million times at run time.  Note that reasons [1], [2], [5], and  partly  [4] are logical. We  don’t just use constant expressions because of an obsession with performance. Often, the reason is that a constant expression is a more direct representation of our system requirements.  As  part  of  the  deﬁnition  of  a  data  item   here,  I  deliberately  avoid  the  word  ‘‘variable’’ , constexpr expresses the need for compile-time evaluation.  If the initializer for a constexpr can’t be evaluated at compile time, the compiler will give an error. For example:  int x1 = 7; constexpr int x2 = 7;  constexpr int x3 = x1; constexpr int x4 = x2;  void f   {  }  constexpr int y3 = x1; constexpr int y4 = x2;    ...     error :initializer is not a constant expression    OK     error :initializer is not a constant expression    OK  A clever compiler could deduce that the value of x1 in the initializer for x3 was 7. Howev er,  we prefer not to rely on degrees of cleverness in compilers. In a large program, determining the values of variables at compile time is typically either very difﬁcult or impossible.   264  Expressions   Chapter 10  The expressive power of constant expressions is great. We  can use integer, ﬂoating-point, and enumeration values.  We can use any operator that doesn’t modify state  e.g., +, ?:, and [], but not = or ++ .  We can use constexpr functions  §12.1.6  and literal types  §10.4.3  to provide a signiﬁcant level of type safety and expressive power. It is almost unfair to compare this to what is commonly done with macros  §12.6 .  The conditional-expression operator ?: is the means of selection in a constant expression.  For  example, we can compute an integer square root at compile time:  constexpr int isqrt_helper int sq, int d, int a  {  return sq <= a ? isqrt_helper sq+d,d+2,a  : d;  }  }  constexpr int isqrt int x  {  return isqrt_helper 1,3,x  2 − 1;  constexpr int s1 = isqrt 9 ;  constexpr int s2 = isqrt 1234 ;     s1 becomes 3  The condition of a ?: is evaluated and then the selected alternative is evaluated.  The alternative not selected is not evaluated and might even not be a constant expression.  Similarly, operands of && and  that are not evaluated need not be constant expressions.  This feature is primarily useful in constexpr functions that are sometimes used as constant expressions and sometimes not.  10.4.1  Symbolic Constants The most important single use of constants  constexpr or const values  is simply to provide sym- bolic names for values.  Symbolic names should be used systematically to avoid ‘‘magic numbers’’ in code. Literal values scattered freely around in code is one of the nastiest maintenance hazards. If a numeric constant, such as an array bound, is repeated in code, it becomes hard to revise that code  because  every  occurrence  of  that  constant  must  be  changed  to  update  the  code  correctly. Using  a  symbolic  name  instead  localizes  information. Usually, a numeric  constant  represents  an assumption about the program. For example, 4 may represent the number of bytes in an integer, 128 the number of characters needed to buffer input, and 6.24 the exchange factor between Danish kroner and U.S. dollars. Left as numeric constants in the code, these values are hard for a main- tainer  to  spot  and  understand. Also,  many such  values  need  to  change  over time.  Often, such numeric  values  go  unnoticed  and  become  errors  when  a  program  is  ported  or  when  some  other change  violates  the  assumptions  they represent.  Representing assumptions  as  well-commented named  symbolic  constants minimizes such maintenance problems.  10.4.2 consts in Constant Expressions A const is primarily used to express interfaces  §7.5 . However, const can also be used to express constant values.  For example:   Section 10.4.2  consts in Constant Expressions   265  const int x = 7; const string s = "asdf"; const int y = sqrt x ;  A const initialized with a constant expression can be used in a constant expression.  A const differs from a constexpr in that it can be initialized by something that is not a constant expression; in that case, the const cannot be used as a constant expression.  For example:  constexpr int xx = x; constexpr string ss = s; constexpr int yy = y;     OK    error :sisnot a constant expression    error :sqr t x is not a constant expression  The reasons for the errors are that string is not a literal type  §10.4.3  and sqrt   is not a constexpr function  §12.1.6 .  Usually, constexpr is a better choice than const for deﬁning simple constants, but constexpr is new in C++11,  so  older  code  tends  to  use const. In many cases,  enumerators   §8.4   are  another alternative to consts.  10.4.3  Literal Types A sufﬁciently simple user-deﬁned type can be used in a constant expression.  For example:  struct Point { int x,y,z; constexpr Point up int d  { return {x,y,z+d}; } constexpr Point move int dx, int dy  { return {x+dx,y+dy}; }    ...  };  A class with a constexpr constructor is called a literal type. To be simple enough to be constexpr, a constructor must have an empty body and all members must be initialized by potentially constant expressions.  For example:  constexpr Point origo {0,0}; constexpr int z = origo.x;  constexpr Point a[] = {  }; constexpr int x = a[1].x;  origo, Point{1,1}, Point{2,2}, origo.move 3,3      xbecomes 1  constexpr Point xy{0,sqrt 2 };      error :sqr t 2 is not a constant expression  Note that we can have constexpr arrays and also access array elements and object members.  Naturally, we can deﬁne constexpr functions to take arguments of literal types. For example:  constexpr int square int x  {  return x∗x;  }   266  Expressions   Chapter 10  constexpr int radial_distance Point p  {  return isqrt square p.x +square p.y +square p.z  ;  constexpr Point p1 {10,20,30}; constexpr p2 {p1.up 20 }; constexpr int dist = radial_distance p2 ;     the default constructor is constexpr    Point::up   is constexpr  I used int rather than double just because I didn’t hav e a constexpr ﬂoating-point square root func- tion handy.  For a member function constexpr implies const, so I did not have to write:  constexpr Point move int dx, int dy  const { return {x+dx,y+dy}; }  10.4.4  Reference Arguments When  working  with constexpr, the  key  thing  to  remember  is  that constexpr is  all  about  values. There  are  no  objects  that  can  change  values  or  side  effects  here: constexpr provides  a  miniature compile-time functional programming language. That said, you might guess that constexpr cannot deal with references, but that’s only partially true because const references refer to values and can therefore  be  used. Consider  the  specialization  of  the  general complex  to  a complex  from the standard library:  template  class complex  { public:  constexpr complex double re = 0.0, double im = 0.0 ; constexpr complex const complex & ; explicit constexpr complex const complex & ;  constexpr double real  ; void real double ;  constexpr double imag  ;  void imag double ;      read the real part    set the real part    read the imaginarypar t    set the imaginarypar t  complex & operator=  double ; complex & operator+= double ;    ...  }  };  Obviously, operations, such as = and +=, that modify  an object cannot be constexpr. Conversely, operations that simply read an object, such as real   and imag  , can be constexpr and be evaluated at compile time given a constant expression.  The interesting member is the template constructor from another complex type.  Consider:  constexpr complex  z1 {1,2}; constexpr double re = z1.real  ; constexpr double im = z1.imag  ; constexpr complex  z2 {re,im};  constexpr complex  z3 {z1};     note:   not       z2 becomes a copyofz1    z3 becomes a copyofz1   Section 10.4.4  Reference Arguments   267  The  copy constructor  works  because  the  compiler  recognizes  that  the  reference   the const  com- plex &  refers  to  a  constant  value  and  we  just  use  that  value   rather  than  trying  anything advanced or silly with references or pointers .  Literal types allow for type-rich compile-time programming. Traditionally, C++ compile-time evaluation has been restricted to using integer values  and without functions . This has resulted in code that was unnecessarily complicated and error-prone, as people encoded every kind of informa- tion  as  integers.  Some uses  of  template  metaprogramming   Chapter  28   are  examples  of  that. Other programmers have simply preferred run-time evaluation to avoid the difﬁculties of writing in an impoverished language.  10.4.5  Address Constant Expressions The address of a statically allocated object  §6.4.2 , such as a global variable, is a constant. How- ev er, its value is assigned by the linker, rather than the compiler, so the compiler cannot know the value of such an address constant. That limits the range of constant expressions of pointer and ref- erence type. For example:  constexpr const char∗ p1 = "asdf"; constexpr const char∗ p2 = p1; constexpr const char∗ p2 = p1+2; constexpr char c = p1[2];     OK    error :the compiler does not knowthe value of p1    OK, c==’d’; the compiler knows the value pointed to byp1  10.5  Implicit Type Conversion Integral  and  ﬂoating-point  types   §6.2.1   can  be  mixed  freely  in  assignments  and  expressions. Wherever possible, values are converted so as not to lose information. Unfortunately, some value- destroying   ‘‘narrowing’’   conversions  are  also  performed  implicitly. A conversion  is  value-pre- serving if you can convert a value and then convert the result back to its original type and get the original value.  If a conversion cannot do that, it is a narrowing conversion  §10.5.2.6 .  This sec- tion provides a description of conversion rules, conversion problems, and their resolution.  10.5.1  Promotions The implicit conversions that preserve values are commonly referred to as promotions. Before an arithmetic  operation  is  performed, integral  promotion is  used  to  create ints out  of  shorter  integer types.  Similarly, ﬂoating-point promotion is used to create doubles out of ﬂoats.  Note that these promotions will not promote to long  unless the operand is a char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t, or a plain enumeration that is already larger than an int  or long double. This reﬂects the original purpose of these promotions in C: to bring operands to the ‘‘natural’’ size for arithmetic operations.  The integral promotions are:  cid:129  A char, signed char, unsigned char, short int, or unsigned short int is converted to an int if int  can represent all the values of the source type; otherwise, it is converted to an unsigned int.   cid:129  A char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t  §6.2.3 , or a plain enumeration type  §8.4.2  is converted to the ﬁrst of the following types that can represent all the values of its underlying type: int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, or unsigned long long.   268  Expressions   Chapter 10   cid:129  A bit-ﬁeld  §8.2.7  is converted to an int if int can represent all the values of the bit-ﬁeld; otherwise, it is converted to unsigned  int if unsigned  int can represent all the values of the bit-ﬁeld.  Otherwise, no integral promotion applies to it.   cid:129  A bool is converted to an int; false becomes 0 and true becomes 1. Promotions are used as part of the usual arithmetic conversions  §10.5.3 .  10.5.2  Conversions The fundamental types can be implicitly converted into each other in a bewildering number of ways  §iso.4 .  In my opinion, too many conversions are allowed.  For example:     beware: double-precision ﬂoating-point to char conversion  When writing code, you should always aim to avoid undeﬁned behavior and conversions that qui- etly throw away information  ‘‘narrowing conversions’’ .  A compiler can warn about many questionable conversions.  Fortunately, many compilers do. The {}-initializer syntax prevents narrowing  §6.3.5 . For example:  void f double d  {  char c = d;  void f double d  {  char c {d};  }  }     error :double-precision ﬂoating-point to char conversion  If  potentially  narrowing  conversions  are  unavoidable,  consider  using  some  form  of  run-time checked conversion function, such as narrow_cast     §11.5 .  10.5.2.1  Integral Conversions  An integer can be converted to another integer type. A plain enumeration value can be converted to an integer type  §8.4.2  .  If the destination type is unsigned, the resulting value is simply as many bits from the source as will ﬁt in the destination  high-order bits are thrown away if necessary .  More precisely, the result is  the  least  unsigned  integer  congruent  to  the  source  integer  modulo 2 to  the nth,  where n is  the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type. For example:  unsigned char uc = 1023;   binar y1111111111: uc becomes binary11111111, that is,255  If the destination type is signed, the value is unchanged if it can be represented in the destination type; otherwise, the value is implementation-deﬁned:  signed char sc = 1023;     implementation-deﬁned  Plausible results are 127 and −1  §6.2.3 .   §6.2.2, §8.4 .  A Boolean  or  plain  enumeration  value  can  be  implicitly  converted  to  its  integer  equivalent   Section 10.5.2.2  Floating-Point Conversions   269  10.5.2.2  Floating-Point Conversions  A ﬂoating-point value can be converted to another ﬂoating-point type. If the source value can be exactly represented in the destination type, the result is the original numeric value.  If the source value is between two adjacent destination values, the result is one of those values.  Otherwise, the behavior is undeﬁned. For example:  ﬂoat f = FLT_MAX;  double d = f;     largest ﬂoat value    OK: d == f  double d2 = DBL_MAX; ﬂoat f2 = d2;     largest double value    undeﬁned if FLT_MAX<DBL_MAX  long double ld = d2; long double ld2 = numeric_limits ::max  ; double d3 = ld2;     OK: ld = d3     undeﬁned if sizeof long double >sizeof double   DBL_MAX and FLT_MAX are deﬁned in  ; numeric_limits is deﬁned in    §40.2 .  10.5.2.3  Pointer and Reference Conversions Any pointer to an object type can be implicitly converted to a void∗  §7.2.1 .  A pointer  reference  to a derived class can be implicitly converted to a pointer  reference  to an accessible and unam- biguous base  §20.2 . Note that a pointer to function or a pointer to member cannot be implicitly converted to a void∗.  A constant expression  §10.4  that evaluates to 0 can be implicitly converted to a null pointer of any pointer type. Similarly, a constant expression that evaluates to 0 can be implicitly converted to a pointer-to-member type  §20.6 . For example:  A T∗ can  be  implicitly  converted  to  a const  T∗  §7.5 .  Similarly, a T& can  be  implicitly  con-  int∗ p =  1+2 ∗ 2∗ 1−1  ;      OK, but weird  Prefer nullptr  §7.2.2 .  verted to a const T&.  10.5.2.4  Pointer-to-Member Conversions  Pointers and references to members can be implicitly converted as described in §20.6.3.  10.5.2.5  Boolean Conversions  Pointer, integral, and ﬂoating-point values can be implicitly converted to bool  §6.2.2 .  A nonzero value converts to true; a zero value converts to false. For example:  void f int∗ p, int i  {  bool is_not_zero = p; bool b2 = i;    ...  }     trueif p!=0    trueif i!=0   270  Expressions   Chapter 10  The pointer-to-bool conversion is useful in conditions, but confusing elsewhere:  void ﬁ int ; void fb bool ;  void ff int∗ p, int∗ q  {  if  p  do_something ∗p ;  if  q!=nullptr  do_something ∗q ;     ... ﬁ p ;  fb p ;      OK    OK, but verbose     error :no pointer to int conversion    OK: pointer to bool conversion  surpr ise!?   Hope for a compiler warning for fb p .  10.5.2.6  Floating-Integral Conversions  When  a  ﬂoating-point  value  is  converted  to  an  integer  value,  the  fractional  part  is  discarded. In other words, conversion from a ﬂoating-point type to an integer type truncates. For example, the value of int 1.6  is 1. The behavior is undeﬁned if the truncated value cannot be represented in the destination type. For example:  int i = 2.7; char b = 2000.7;     ibecomes 2    undeﬁned for 8-bit chars: 2000 cannot be represented as an 8-bit char  Conversions  from  integer  to  ﬂoating  types  are  as  mathematically  correct  as  the  hardware  allows. Loss of precision occurs if an integral value cannot be represented exactly as a value of the ﬂoating type.  For example:  int i = ﬂoat 1234567890 ;  On a machine where both ints and ﬂoats are represented using 32 bits, the value of i is 1234567936.  Clearly, it is best to avoid potentially value-destroying implicit conversions.  In fact, compilers can detect and warn against some obviously dangerous conversions, such as ﬂoating to integral and long  int to char. Howev er, general compile-time detection is impractical, so the programmer must be  careful. When  ‘‘being  careful’’ isn’t enough,  the  programmer  can  insert  explicit  checks. For example:  char checked_cast int i  {     warning: not portable  §10.5.2.1   char c = i; if  i != c  throw std::runtime_error{"int−to−char check failed"}; return c;  void my_code int i  {  char c = checked_cast i ;    ...  }  }  }   Section 10.5.2.6  Floating-Integral Conversions   271  A more general technique for expressing checked conversions is presented in §25.2.5.1.  To truncate in a way that is guaranteed to be portable requires the use of numeric_limits  §40.2 .  In initializations, truncation can be avoided by using the {}-initializer notation  §6.3.5 .  10.5.3  Usual Arithmetic Conversions These conversions are performed on the operands of a binary operator to bring them to a common type, which is then used as the type of the result:  [1]   If either operand is of type long double, the other is converted to long double.  cid:129  Otherwise, if either operand is double, the other is converted to double.  cid:129  Otherwise, if either operand is ﬂoat, the other is converted to ﬂoat.  cid:129  Otherwise, integral promotions  §10.5.1  are performed on both operands.  [2]  Otherwise, if either operand is unsigned long long, the other is converted to unsigned long  long.  cid:129  Otherwise, if one operand is a long long int and the other is an unsigned long int, then if a long long int can represent all the values of an unsigned long int, the unsigned long int is converted to a long long int; otherwise, both operands are converted to unsigned long long int. Otherwise, if either operand is unsigned long long, the other is converted to unsigned long long.   cid:129  Otherwise, if one operand is a long int and the other is an unsigned int, then if a long int can represent all the values of an unsigned  int, the unsigned  int is converted to a long int; otherwise, both operands are converted to unsigned long int.   cid:129  Otherwise, if either operand is long, the other is converted to long.  cid:129  Otherwise, if either operand is unsigned, the other is converted to unsigned.  cid:129  Otherwise, both operands are int.  These rules make the result of converting an unsigned integer to a signed one of possibly larger size implementation-deﬁned.  That is yet another reason to avoid mixing unsigned and signed integers.  10.6  Advice [1]  Prefer the standard library to other libraries and to ‘‘handcrafted code’’; §10.2.8.

For example:  while  p && !whitespace ∗p   ++p;  Here, p is not dereferenced if it is the nullptr.  11.1.2  Bitwise Logical Operators The bitwise logical operators &  and ,   or , ˆ  exclusive or,  xor , ˜  complement , >>  right shift , and <<  left shift  are applied to objects of integral types – that is, char, short, int, long, long  long and their unsigned counterparts, and bool, wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t. A plain enum  but not an enum class  can be implicitly converted to an integer type and used as an operand to bitwise logical operations.  The usual arithmetic conversions  §10.5.3  determine the type of the result.  A typical use of bitwise logical operators is to implement the notion of a small set  a bit vector . In this case, each bit of an unsigned integer represents one member of the set, and the number of bits limits the number of members. The binary operator & is interpreted as intersection,  as union, ˆ as symmetric difference, and ˜ as complement. An enumeration can be used to name the members of such a set. Here is a small example borrowed from an implementation of ostream:  The implementation of a stream can set and test its state like this:  enum ios_base::iostate {  goodbit=0, eofbit=1, failbit=2, badbit=4  };  state = goodbit;    ... if  state& badbitfailbit      stream not good  The extra parentheses are necessary because & has higher precedence than   §10.3 .  A function that reaches the end-of-input might report it like this:  state = eofbit;  The = operator is used to add to the state. A simple assignment, state=eofbit, would have cleared all other bits.  These stream state ﬂags are observable from outside the stream implementation. For example,  we could see how the states of two streams differ like this:  int old = cin.rdstate  ;     ... use cin ... if  cin.rdstate  ˆold  {     ...  }     rdstate   returns the state     has anything changed?  Computing differences of stream states is not common. For other similar types, computing differ- ences is essential. For example, consider comparing a bit vector that represents the set of interrupts being handled with another that represents the set of interrupts waiting to be handled.   Section 11.1.2  Bitwise Logical Operators  275  Please note that this bit ﬁddling is taken from the implementation of iostreams rather than from the user interface.  Convenient bit manipulation can be very important, but for reliability, maintain- ability, portability, etc., it should be kept at low lev els of a system. For more general notions of a set, see the standard-library set  §31.4.3  and bitset  §34.2.2 .  Bitwise logical operations can be used to extract bit-ﬁelds from a word.  For example, one could  extract the middle 16 bits of a 32-bit int like this:  constexpr unsigned short middle int a  {  static_assert sizeof int ==4,"unexpected int size" ; static_assert sizeof shor t ==2,"unexpected short siz e" ; return  a>>8 &0xFFFF;  int x = 0xFF00FF00;    assume sizeof int ==4 short y = middle x ;    y=0x00FF  Using ﬁelds  §8.2.7  is a convenient shorthand for such shifting and masking.  Do not confuse the bitwise logical operators with the logical operators: &&, , and !. The latter return true or false, and they are primarily useful for writing the test in an if-, while-, or for-statement  §9.4, §9.5 . For example, !0  not zero  is the value true, which converts to 1, whereas ˜0  comple- ment of zero  is the bit pattern all-ones, which in two’s complement representation is the value −1.  11.1.3  Conditional Expressions Some if-statements can conveniently be replaced by conditional-expressions.  For example:  if  a <= b   else  max = b;  max = a;  This is more directly expressed like this:  max =  a<=b  ? b : a;  The parentheses around the condition are not necessary, but I ﬁnd the code easier to read when they are used.  Conditional expressions are important in that they can be used in constant expressions  §10.4 . A pair of expressions e1 and e2 can be used as alternatives in a conditional expression, c?e1:e2, if they are of the same type or if there is a common type T, to which they can both be implicitly converted.  For  arithmetic  types,  the  usual  arithmetic  conversions   §10.5.3   are  used  to  ﬁnd  that common type. For other types, either e1 must be implicitly convertible to e2’s  type or vice versa. In addition, one branch may be a throw-expression  §13.5.1 . For example:  void fct int∗ p  {  int i =  p  ? ∗p : std::runtime_error{"unexpected nullptr};    ...  }  }   276   Select Operations   Chapter 11  11.1.4  Increment and Decrement The ++ operator is used to express incrementing directly, rather than expressing it indirectly using a combination of an addition and an assignment. Provided lvalue has no side effects, ++lvalue means lvalue+=1, which  again  means lvalue=lvalue+1. The  expression  denoting  the  object  to  be  incre- mented is evaluated once  only . Decrementing is similarly expressed by the −− operator.  The operators ++ and −− can be used as both preﬁx and postﬁx operators. The value of ++x is the new  that is, incremented  value of x. For example, y=++x is equivalent to y= x=x+1 . The value of x++, howev er, is the old value of x. For example, y=x++ is equivalent to y= t=x,x=x+1,t , where t is a variable of the same type as x.  Like adding an int to a pointer, or subtracting it, ++ and −− on a pointer operate in terms of ele-  ments of the array into which the pointer points; p++ makes p point to the next element  §7.4.1 .  The ++ and −− operators are particularly useful for incrementing and decrementing variables in  loops.  For example, one can copy a zero-terminated C-style string like this:  Like C, C++ is both loved and hated for enabling such terse, expression-oriented coding. Consider:  This  is  more  than  a  little  obscure  to  non-C  programmers,  but  because  the  style  of  coding  is  not uncommon, it is worth examining more closely. Consider ﬁrst a more traditional way of copying an array of characters:  This is wasteful.  The length of a zero-terminated string is found by reading the string looking for the terminating zero. Thus, we read the string twice: once to ﬁnd its length and once to copy it.  So we try this instead:  void cpy char∗ p, const char∗ q  {  while  ∗p++ = ∗q++  ;  }  while  ∗p++ = ∗q++  ;  int length = strlen q ; for  int i = 0; i<=length; i++   p[i] = q[i];  int i; for  i = 0; q[i]!=0 ; i++   p[i] = q[i];  p[i] = 0;     terminatingzero  while  ∗q != 0  {  ∗p =∗q; p++;  q++;   } ∗p = 0;     point to next character    point to next character     terminatingzero  The variable i used for indexing can be eliminated because p and q are pointers:  Because the post-increment operation allows us ﬁrst to use the value and then to increment it, we can rewrite the loop like this:   Section 11.1.4  Increment and Decrement   277  while  ∗q != 0  {  ∗p++ = ∗q++;  } ∗p = 0;    terminatingzero  while   ∗p++ = ∗q++  != 0  { }  The value of ∗p++ = ∗q++ is ∗q. We can therefore rewrite the example like this:  In this case, we don’t notice that ∗q is zero until we already have copied it into ∗p and incremented p. Consequently, we can eliminate the ﬁnal assignment of the terminating zero. Finally, we can reduce  the  example  further  by  observing  that  we  don’t need  the  empty  block  and  that  the !=0 is redundant because the result of an integral condition is always compared to zero anyway. Thus, we get the version we set out to discover:  while  ∗p++ = ∗q++  ;  Is this version less readable than the previous versions?  Not to an experienced C or C++ program- mer. Is this version more efﬁcient in time or space than the previous versions?  Except for the ﬁrst version that called strlen  , not really; the performance will be equivalent and often identical code will be generated.  The most efﬁcient way of copying a zero-terminated character string is typically the standard C-  style string copy function:  char∗ strcpy char∗, const char∗ ;      from    For more general copying, the standard copy algorithm  §4.5, §32.5  can be used. Whenever possi- ble,  use  standard-library  facilities  in  preference  to  ﬁddling  with  pointers  and  bytes. Standard- library functions may be inlined  §12.1.3  or even implemented using specialized machine instruc- tions.  Therefore, you  should  measure  carefully  before  believing  that  some  piece  of  handcrafted code  outperforms  library  functions. Even  if  it  does,  the  advantage  may  not  exist  on  some  other handware+compiler combination, and your alternative may give a maintainer a headache.  11.2  Free Store A named object has its lifetime determined by its scope  §6.3.4 . However, it is often useful to cre- ate an object that exists independently of the scope in which it was created. For example, it is com- mon to create objects that can be used after returning from the function in which they were created. The operator new creates such objects, and the operator delete can be used to destroy them.  Objects allocated by new are said to be ‘‘on the free store’’  also, ‘‘on the heap’’ or ‘‘in dynamic memory’’ . Consider how we might write a compiler in the style used for the desk calculator  §10.2 . The  syntax analysis functions might build a tree of the expressions for use by the code generator:  struct Enode {  Token_value oper; Enode∗ left; Enode∗ right;    ...  };   278   Select Operations   Chapter 11  Enode∗ expr bool get  {  Enode∗ left = term get ;  for  ;;  {  switch  ts.current  .kind  { case Kind::plus: case Kind::minus:  left = new Enode {ts.current  .kind,left,term true }; break;  default:  return left;     returnnode  }  }  }  In cases Kind::plus and Kind::minus, a new Enode is created on the free store and initialized by the value {ts.current  .kind,left,term true }. The  resulting  pointer  is  assigned  to left and  eventually returned from expr  .  I used  the {}-list  notation  for  specifying  arguments.  Alternatively, I could  have  used  the  old- style   -list notation to specify an initializer. Howev er, trying the = notation for initializing an object created using new results in an error:  int∗ p = new int = 7;    error  If a type has a default constructor, we can leave out the initializer, but built-in types are by default uninitialized.  For example:  auto pc = new complex ;  auto pi = new int;      the complexisinitialized to {0,0}    the int is uninitialized  This can be confusing. To be sure to get default initialization, use {}. For example:  auto pc = new complex {};    the complexisinitialized to {0,0} auto pi = new int{};      the int is initialized to 0  A code generator could use the Enodes created by expr   and delete them:  void generate Enode∗ n  {  switch  n−>oper  { case Kind::plus:     use n delete n;  }  }     delete an Enode from the free store  An object created by new exists until it is explicitly destroyed by delete. Then, the space it occu- pied can be reused by new. A C++ implementation does not guarantee the presence of a ‘‘garbage collector’’ that looks out for unreferenced objects and makes them available to new for reuse. Con- sequently, I will assume that objects created by new are manually freed using delete.   Section 11.2  Free Store  279  The delete operator may be applied only to a pointer returned by new or to the nullptr. Applying  delete to the nullptr has no effect.  If the deleted object is of a class with a destructor  §3.2.1.2, §17.2 , that destructor is called by  delete before the object’s memory is released for reuse.  11.2.1  Memory Management The main problems with free store are:   cid:129  Leaked objects: People use new and then forget to delete the allocated object.  cid:129  Premature deletion: People delete an object that they hav e some other pointer to and later  use that other pointer.   cid:129  Double deletion: An object is deleted twice, invoking its destructor  if any  twice.  Leaked objects are potentially a bad problem because they can cause a program to run out of space. Premature deletion is almost always a nasty problem because the pointer to the ‘‘deleted object’’ no longer points to a valid object  so reading it may give bad results  and may indeed point to memory that has been reused for another object  so writing to it may corrupt an unrelated object . Consider this example of very bad code:  int∗ p1 = new int{99}; int∗ p2 = p1; delete p1; p1 = nullptr;  char∗ p3 = new char{'x'};  ∗p2 = 999; cout << ∗p3 << '\n';     potential trouble    nowp2doesn’t point to a valid object    gives a false sense of safety    p3 maynow point to the memorypointed to byp2    this maycause trouble    maynot print x  Double deletion is a problem because resource managers typically cannot track what code owns a resource.  Consider:  void sloppy    {     very bad code  int∗ p = new int[1000];     ... use *p ... delete[] p;     acquire memory     release memory     ... wait a while ...  delete[] p;     butsloppy   does not own *p  }  By the second delete[], the memory pointed to by ∗p may have been reallocated for some other use and the allocator may get corrupted. Replace int with string in that example, and we’ll see string’s destructor trying to read memory that has been reallocated and maybe overwritten by other code, and using what it read to try to delete memory. In general, a double deletion is undeﬁned behavior and the results are unpredictable and usually disastrous.  The reason people make these mistakes is typically not maliciousness and often not even simple sloppiness; it is genuinely hard to consistently deallocate every allocated object in a large program  once and at exactly the right point in a computation . For starters, analysis of a localized part of a program will not detect these problems because an error usually involves several separate parts.   280   Select Operations   Chapter 11  As alternatives to using ‘‘naked’’ news and deletes, I can recommend two general approaches to  resource management that avoid such problems:  [1]  Don’t put objects on the free store if you don’t hav e to; prefer scoped variables. [2]  When you construct an object on the free store, place its pointer into a manager object  sometimes called a handle  with a destructor that will destroy it.  Examples are string, vector and  all  the  other  standard-library  containers, unique_ptr  §5.2.1,  §34.3.1 ,  and shared_ptr  §5.2.1,  §34.3.2 . Wherever possible,  have  that  manager  object  be  a  scoped variable.  Many classical  uses  of  free  store  can  be  eliminated  by  using  move semantics  §3.3, §17.5.2  to return large objects represented as manager objects from functions.  This rule [2] is often referred to as RAII  ‘‘Resource Acquisition Is Initialization’’; §5.2, §13.3  and is the basic technique for avoiding resource leaks and making error handling using exceptions sim- ple and safe.  The standard-library vector is an example of these techniques:  The vector keeps its elements on the free store, but it handles all allocations and deallocations itself. In this example, push_back   does news to acquire space for its elements and deletes to free space that it no longer needs. However,  the users of vector need not know about those implementation details and will just rely on vector not leaking.  The Token_stream from the calculator example is an even simpler example  §10.2.2 . There, a  user can use new and hand the resulting pointer to a Token_stream to manage:  Token_stream ts{new istringstream{some_string}};  We do not need to use the free store just to get a large object out of a function. For example:  void f const string& s  {  vector  v; for  auto c : s   v.push_back c ;     ...  }  string reverse const string& s  {  string ss; for  int i=s.size  −1; 0<=i; −−i   ss.push_back s[i] ;  return ss;  }  Like vector, a string is really a handle to its elements. So, we simply move the ss out of reverse   rather than copying any elements  §3.3.2 .  The resource management ‘‘smart pointers’’  e.g., unique_ptr and smart_ptr  are a further exam-  ple of these ideas  §5.2.1, §34.3.1 . For example:  void f int n  {  int∗ p1 = new int[n];  unique_ptr  p2 {new int[n]};     potential trouble   Section 11.2.1  Memory Management  281     ... if  n%2  throw runtime_error "odd" ; delete[] p1;     we may nev erget here  For f 3  the memory pointed to by p1 is leaked, but the memory pointed to by p2 is correctly and implicitly deallocated.  My rule of thumb for the use of new and delete is ‘‘no naked news’’; that is, new belongs in con- structors and similar operations, delete belongs in destructors, and together they provide a coherent memory management strategy. In addition, new is often used in arguments to resource handles.  If everything else fails  e.g., if someone has a lot of old code with lots of undisciplined use of  new , C++ offers a standard interface to a garbage collector  §34.5 .  11.2.2  Arrays Arrays of objects can also be created using new. For example:  }  }  }  }  }  char∗ save_string const char∗ p  {  char∗ s = new char[strlen p +1]; strcpy s,p ;  return s;     copyfrom p to s  int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  if  argc < 2  exit 1 ; char∗ p = save_string argv[1] ;    ... delete[] p;  the save_string  :  string save_string const char∗ p  {  return string{p};  int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  if  argc < 2  exit 1 ; string s = save_string argv[1] ;    ...  In particular, the new[] and the delete[] vanished.  The ‘‘plain’’ operator delete is used to delete individual objects; delete[] is used to delete arrays.  Unless you really must use a char∗ directly, the standard-library string can be used to simplify   282   Select Operations   Chapter 11  To  deallocate space allocated by new, delete and delete[] must be able to determine the size of the object allocated. This implies that an object allocated using the standard implementation of new will occupy slightly more space than a static object. At a minimum, space is needed to hold the object’s size.  Usually two or more words per allocation are used for free-store management. Most modern  machines  use  8-byte  words.  This overhead  is  not  signiﬁcant  when  we  allocate  many objects or large objects, but it can matter if we allocate lots of small objects  e.g., ints or Points  on the free store.  Note that a vector  §4.4.1, §31.4  is a proper object and can therefore be allocated and deallo-  cated using plain new and delete. For example:  vector ∗ p = new vector  n ;  int∗ q = new int[n];     ... delete p; delete[] q;     individual object     array  The delete[] operator may be applied only to a pointer to an array returned by new of an array or to the null pointer  §7.2.2 . Applying delete[] to the null pointer has no effect.  However, do not use new to create local objects. For example:  That’s verbose, inefﬁcient, and error-prone  §13.3 . In particular, a return or an exception thrown before the delete will cause a memory leak  unless even more code is added . Instead, use a local variable:  The local variable x is implicitly destroyed upon exit from f2.  11.2.3  Getting Memory Space The free-store operators new, delete, new[], and delete[] are implemented using functions presented in the   header:  void∗ operator new siz e_t ; void operator delete void∗ p ;      allocate space for individual object    if  p  deallocate space allocated using operator new    void f int n  {  }  }  }  void f1   {  X∗ p =new X;    ... use *p ... delete p;  void f2   {  X x;    ... use x ...   Section 11.2.3  Getting Memory Space  283  void∗ operator new[] siz e_t ; void operator delete[] void∗ p ;      allocate space for array    if  p  deallocate space allocated using operator new[]    When operator new needs to allocate space for an object, it calls operator new   to allocate a suitable number of bytes. Similarly, when operator new needs to allocate space for an array, it calls operator new[]  .  The standard implementations of operator new   and operator new[]   do not initialize the mem-  ory returned.  The  allocation  and  deallocation  functions  deal  in  untyped  and  uninitialized  memory   often called ‘‘raw memory’’ , as opposed to typed objects. Consequently, they take arguments or return values of type void∗. The operators new and delete handle the mapping between this untyped-mem- ory layer and the typed-object layer.  What happens when new can ﬁnd no store to allocate? By default, the allocator throws a stan-  dard-library bad_alloc exception  for an alternative, see §11.2.4.1 . For example:  void f   {  vector  v; try {  for  ;;  {  }  } catch bad_alloc  {  cerr << "Memory exhausted!\n";  }  }  char ∗ p = new char[10000];  v.push_back p ;  p[0] = 'x';     acquire some memory    makesure the newmemor yis referenced    use the newmemor y  However much memory we have available, this will eventually invoke the bad_alloc handler. Please be careful: the new operator is not guaranteed to throw when you run out of physical main memory. So, on a system with virtual memory, this program can consume a lot of disk space and take a long time doing so before the exception is thrown.  We can specify what new should do upon memory exhaustion; see §30.4.1.3. In addition to the functions deﬁned in  , a  user can deﬁne operator new  , etc., for a speciﬁc class  §19.2.5 . Class members operator  new  , etc., are found and used in preference to the ones from   according to the usual scope rules.  11.2.4  Overloading new By default, operator new creates its object on the free store. What if we wanted the object allocated elsewhere?  Consider a simple class:  class X { public:  X int ;    ...  };   284   Select Operations   Chapter 11  We  can place objects anywhere by providing an allocator function  §11.2.3  with extra arguments and then supplying such extra arguments when using new:  void∗ operator new siz e_t, void∗ p  { return p; }     explicit placement operator  void∗ buf = reinterpret_cast  0xF00F ;  X∗ p2 = new buf  X;     signiﬁcant address    constructan X at buf;    invokes: operator new sizeof X ,buf   Because  of  this  usage,  the new buf   X syntax  for  supplying  extra  arguments  to operator  new   is known as the placement syntax. Note that every operator new   takes a size as its ﬁrst argument and that the size of the object allocated is implicitly supplied  §19.2.5 . The operator new   used by the new operator is chosen by the usual argument matching rules  §12.3 ; every operator  new   has a size_t as its ﬁrst argument.  The  ‘‘placement’’ operator  new   is  the  simplest  such  allocator. It is deﬁned  in  the  standard  header  :  void∗ operator new  siz e_t sz, void∗ p  noexcept;  void∗ operator new[] siz e_t sz, void∗ p  noexcept;      place object of sizeszatp    place object of sizeszatp  void operator delete  void∗ p, void∗  noexcept;  void operator delete[] void∗ p, void∗  noexcept;      if  p  make*pinvalid    if  p  make*pinvalid  The ‘‘placement delete’’  operators do nothing except possibly inform a garbage collector that the deleted pointer is no longer safely derived  §34.5 .  The placement new construct can also be used to allocate memory from a speciﬁc arena:  class Arena { public:  virtual void∗ alloc size_t  =0; virtual void free void∗  =0;    ...  void∗ operator new siz e_t sz, Arena∗ a  {  return a−>alloc sz ;  extern Arena∗ Persistent; extern Arena∗ Shared;  void g int i  {  X∗ p = new Persistent  X i ; X∗ q = new Shared  X i ;    ...     Xinpersistent storage    Xinshared memory  };  }  }  Now objects of arbitrary types can be allocated from different Arenas as needed.  For example:   Section 11.2.4  Overloading new  285  Placing  an  object  in  an  area  that  is  not   directly   controlled  by  the  standard  free-store  manager implies that some care is required when destroying the object. The basic mechanism for that is an explicit call of a destructor:  void destroy X∗ p, Arena∗ a  {  p−>˜X  ;  a−>free p ;      call destructor    free memory  }  }  Note that explicit calls of destructors should be avoided except in the implementation of resource management classes. Even most resource handles can be written using new and delete. Howev er, it would be hard to implement an efﬁcient general container along the lines of the standard-library vector  §4.4.1, §31.3.3  without using explicit destructor calls. A novice should think thrice before calling a destructor explicitly and also should ask a more experienced colleague before doing so.  See §13.6.1 for an example of how placement new can interact with exception handling. There is no special syntax for placement of arrays. Nor need there be, since arbitrary types can  be allocated by placement new. Howev er, an operator delete   can be deﬁned for arrays  §11.2.3 .  In programs where exceptions must be avoided  §13.1.5 , we can use nothrow versions of new and delete. For example:  11.2.4.1 nothrow new  void f int n  {     allocate n ints on the free store  int∗ p = new nothrow  int[n];  if  p==nullptr  {   no memoryavailable     ... handle allocation error ...  }    ... operator delete nothrow,p ;      deallocate *p  That nothrow is the name of an object of the standard-library type nothrow_t that is used for disam- biguation; nothrow and nothrow_t are declared in  . The functions implementing this are found in  : void∗ operator new siz e_t sz, const nothrow_t&  noexcept;   void operator delete void∗ p, const nothrow_t&  noexcept;      allocate sz bytes;    returnnullptr if allocation failed    deallocate space allocated bynew  void∗ operator new[] siz e_t sz, const nothrow_t&  noexcept;    allocate sz bytes;  void operator delete[] void∗ p, const nothrow_t&  noexcept;     deallocate space allocated bynew     returnnullptr if allocation failed  These operator new functions return nullptr, rather than throwing bad_alloc, if there is not sufﬁcient memory to allocate.   286   Select Operations   Chapter 11  11.3  Lists In addition to their use for initializing named variables  §6.3.5.2 , {}-lists can be used as expressions in many  but not all  places. They can appear in two forms:  [1]  Qualiﬁed by  a  type, T{...}, meaning  ‘‘create  an  object  of  type T initialized  by T{...}’’;  [2]  Unqualiﬁed {...}, for  which  the  the  type  must  be  determined  from  the  context  of  use;  §11.3.2  §11.3.3  For example:  struct S { int a, b; }; struct SS { double a, b; };  void f S ;     f   takes an S     g   is overloaded  void g S ; void g SS ;  void h   {  f {1,2} ;      OK: call f S{1,2}   g {1,2} ;  g S{1,2} ;  g SS{1,2} ;      error :ambiguous    OK: call g S     OK: call g SS   }   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   As in their use for initializing named variables  §6.3.5 , lists can have zero, one, or more elements. A {}-list is used to construct an object of some type, so the number of elements and their types must be what is required to construct an object of that type.  11.3.1  Implementation Model The implementation model for {}-lists comes in three parts:  If the {}-list is used as constructor arguments, the implementation is just as if you had used a   -list.  List elements are not copied except as by-value constructor arguments. If the {}-list is used to initialize the elements of an aggregate  an array or a class without a constructor , each list element initializes an element of the aggregate.  List elements are not copied except as by-value arguments to aggregate element constructors. If the {}-list is used to construct an initializer_list object each list element is used to initialize an element of the underlying array of the initializer_list. Elements are typically copied from the initializer_list to wherever we use them.  Note that this is the general model that we can use to understand the semantics of a {}-list; a com- piler may apply clever optimizations as long as the meaning is preserved.  Consider:  vector  v = {1, 2, 3.14};  The  standard-library vector has  an  initializer-list  constructor   §17.3.4 ,  so  the  initializer  list   Section 11.3.1  Implementation Model  287  {1,2,3.14} is interpreted as a temporary constructed and used like this:  const double temp[] = {double{1}, double{2}, 3.14 } ; const initializer_list  tmp temp,sizeof temp  siz eof double  ; vector  v tmp ;  That  is,  the  compiler  constructs  an  array  containing  the  initializers  converted  to  the  desired  type  here, double .  This array is passed to vectors initializer-list constructor as an initializer_list. The initializer-list constructor then copies the values from the array into its own data structure for ele- ments.  Note that  an initializer_list is  a  small  object   probably  two words ,  so  passing  it  by  value makes sense.  The  underlying  array  is  immutable,  so  there  is  no  way   within  the  standard’s rules   that  the  meaning of a {}-list can change between two uses.  Consider:  void f   {  initializer_list  lst {1,2,3}; cout << ∗lst.begin   << '\n'; ∗lst.begin   = 2; cout << ∗lst.begin   << '\n';     error :lst is immutable  }  }  In particular, having a {}-list be immutable implies that a container taking elements from it must use a copy operation, rather than a move operation.  The lifetime of a {}-list  and its underlying array  is determined by the scope in which it is used  §6.4.2 .  When used  to  initialize  a  variable  of  type initializer_list , the  list  lives as long  as  the variable.  When used in an expression  including as an initializer to a variable of some other type, such as vector  , the list is destroyed at the end of its full expression.  11.3.2  Qualiﬁed Lists The basic idea of initializer lists as expressions is that if you can initialize a variable x using the notation  then you can create an object with the same value as an expression using T{v} or new T{v}. Using new places the object on the free store and returns a pointer to it, whereas ‘‘plain T{v}’’  makes a temporary object in the local scope  §6.4.2 . For example:  T x {v};  struct S { int a, b; };  void f   {  S v {7,8};  v = S{7,8};  S∗ p = new S{7,8};      direct initialization of a var iable    assign using qualiﬁed list    constructon free store using qualiﬁed list  The rules constructing an object using a qualiﬁed list are those of direct initialization  §16.2.6 .   288   Select Operations   Chapter 11  One way of looking at a qualiﬁed initializer list with one element is as a conversion from one  type to another. For example:  template  T square T x  {  return x∗x;  void f int i  {  }  }  }  double d = square double{i} ; complex  z = square complex {i} ;  That idea is explored further in §11.5.1.  11.3.3  Unqualiﬁed Lists A unqualiﬁed list is used where an expected type is unambiguously known.  It can be used as an expression only as:   cid:129  A function argument  cid:129  A return value  cid:129  The right-hand operand of an assignment operator  =, +=, ∗=, etc.   cid:129  A subscript  For example:  int f double d, Matrix& m  {  int v {7}; int v2 = {7}; int v3 = m[{2,3}];     initializer  direct initialization     initializer  copyinitialization     assume m takes value pairs as subscripts  v = {8};  v += {88};  {v} = 9; v = 7+{10};  f {10.0} ;  return {11};     right-hand operand of assignment    right-hand operand of assignment    error :not left-hand operand of assignment    error :not an operand of a non-assignment operator    function argument    returnvalue  The reason that an unqualiﬁed list is not allowed on the left-hand side of assignments is primarily that the C++ grammar allows { in that position for compound statements  blocks , so that readabil- ity would be a problem for humans and ambiguity resolution would be tricky for compilers. This is not an insurmountable problem, but it was decided not to extend C++ in that direction.  When  used  as  the  initializer  for  a  named  object  without  the  use  of  a =  as  for v above ,  an unqualiﬁed {}-list  performs  direct  initialization   §16.2.6 . In  all  other  cases,  it  performs  copy initialization  §16.2.6 . In particular, the otherwise redundant = in an initializer restricts the set of initializations that can be performed with a given {}-list.   Section 11.3.3  Unqualiﬁed Lists  289  The  standard-library  type initializer_list  is  used  to  handle  variable-length {}-lists   §12.2.3 . Its most obvious use is to allow initializer lists for user-deﬁned containers  §3.2.1.3 , but it can also be used directly; for example:  int high_value initializ er_list  val  {  int high = numeric_traits lowest  ; if  val.siz e  ==0  return high;  for  auto x : val   if  x>high  high = x;  return high;  }  int v1 = high_value {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} ; int v2 = high_value {−1,2,v1,4,−9,20,v1} ;  A {}-list  is  the  simplest  way  of  dealing  with  homogeneous  lists  of  varying  lengths. However, beware that zero elements can be a special case. If so, that case should be handled by a default con- structor  §17.3.3 .  The type of a {}-list can be deduced  only  if all elements are of the same type. For example:  Unfortunately, we do not deduce the type of an unqualiﬁed list for a plain template argument.  For example:  auto x0 = {}; auto x1 = {1}; auto x2 = {1,2}; auto x3 = {1,2,3}; auto x4 = {1,2.0};     error  no element type     initializer_list     initializer_list     initializer_list     error :nonhomogeneous list  template  void f T ;  f {} ;  f {1} ;  f {1,2} ;  f {1,2,3} ;      error :type of initializer is unknown    error :an unqualiﬁed list does not match ‘‘plain T’’    error :an unqualiﬁed list does not match ‘‘plain T’’    error :an unqualiﬁed list does not match ‘‘plain T’’  I say  ‘‘unfortunately’’ because  this  is  a  language  restriction,  rather  than  a  fundamental  rule. It would be technically possible to deduce the type of those {}-lists as initializer_list , just like we do for auto initializers.  Similarly, we do not  deduce  the  element  type  of  a  container  represented  as  a  template. For  example:  template  void f2 const vector & ;  f2 {1,2,3} ;  f2 {"Kona","Sidney"} ;      error :cannot deduce T    error :cannot deduce T   290   Select Operations   Chapter 11  This too is unfortunate, but it is a bit more understandable from a language-technical point of view: nowhere in those calls does it say vector. To deduce T the compiler would ﬁrst have to decide that the user really wanted a vector and then look into the deﬁnition of vector to see if it has a construc- tor that accepts {1,2,3}. In general, that would require an instantiation of vector  §26.2 .  It would be possible to handle that, but it could be costly in compile time, and the opportunities for ambiguities and confusion if there were many overloaded versions of f2   are reasons for caution. To call f2  , be more speciﬁc:  f2 vector {1,2,3} ;  f2 vector {"Kona","Sidney"} ;      OK    OK  11.4  Lambda Expressions A lambda expression, sometimes also referred to as a lambda function or  strictly speaking incor- rectly, but colloquially  as a lambda, is a simpliﬁed notation for deﬁning and using an anonymous function object. Instead of deﬁning a named class with an operator  , later making an object of that class, and ﬁnally invoking it, we can use a shorthand. This is particularly useful when we want to pass an operation as an argument to an algorithm. In the context of graphical user interfaces  and elsewhere ,  such  operations  are  often  referred  to  as callbacks. This  section  focuses  on  technical aspects  of  lambdas;  examples  and  techniques  for  the  use  of  lambdas  can  be  found  elsewhere  §3.4.3, §32.4, §33.5.2 .  A lambda expression consists of a sequence of parts:  cid:129  A possibly empty capture list, specifying what names from the deﬁnition environment can be used in the lambda expression’s body, and whether those are copied or accessed by refer- ence.  The capture list is delimited by []  §11.4.3 .   cid:129  An optional parameter list, specifying what arguments the lambda expression requires. The  parameter list is delimited by     §11.4.4 .   cid:129  An optional mutable speciﬁer, indicating that the lambda expression’s body may modify the state  of  the  lambda   i.e.,  change  the  lambda’s copies  of  variables  captured  by  value   §11.4.3.4 .   cid:129  An optional noexcept speciﬁer.  cid:129  An optional return type declaration of the form −> type  §11.4.4 .  cid:129  A body, specifying the code to be executed.  The body is delimited by {}  §11.4.3 .  The details of passing arguments, returning results, and specifying the body are those of functions and  are  presented  in  Chapter  12. The  notion  of  ‘‘capture’’ of local  variables  is  not  provided  for functions.  This implies that a lambda can act as a local function even though a function cannot.  11.4.1  Implementation Model Lambda expressions can be implemented in a variety of ways, and there are some rather effective ways  of  optimizing  them. However,  I  ﬁnd  it  useful  to  understand  the  semantics  of  a  lambda  by considering  it  a  shorthand  for  deﬁning  and  using  a  function  object. Consider  a  relatively  simple example:   Section 11.4.1  Implementation Model  291  {  }  };  {  }  void print_modulo const vector & v, ostream& os, int m      output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0  for_each begin v ,end v ,  [&os,m] int x  { if  x%m==0  os << x << '\n'; }   ;  To see what this means, we can deﬁne the equivalent function object:  class Modulo_print {  ostream& os; int m;  public:     members to hold the capture list  Modulo_print ostream& s, int mm  :os s , m mm  {} void operator   int x  const     capture  { if  x%m==0  os << x << '\n'; }  The capture list, [&os,m], becomes two member variables and a constructor to initialize them. The & before os means that we should store a reference, and the absence of a & for m means that we should store a copy.  This use of & mirrors its use in function argument declarations.  The body of the lambda simply becomes the body of the operator    . Since the lambda doesn’t return  a  value,  the operator     is void. By default, operator     is const, so that  the  lambda  body doesn’t modify the captured variables.  That’s by far the most common case. Should you want to modify the state of a lambda from its body, the lambda can be declared mutable  §11.4.3.4 .  This corresponds to an operator     not being declared const.  An object of a class generated from a lambda is called a closure object  or simply a closure .  We can now write the original function like this:  void print_modulo const vector & v, ostream& os, int m      output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0  for_each begin v ,end v ,Modulo_print{os,m} ;  If  a  lambda  potentially  captures  every  local  variable  by  reference   using  the  capture  list [&] ,  the closure may be optimized to simply contain a pointer to the enclosing stack frame.  11.4.2  Alternatives to Lambdas That ﬁnal version of print_modulo   is actually quite attractive, and naming nontrivial operations is generally a good idea. A separately deﬁned class also leaves more room for comments than does a lambda embedded in some argument list.  However,  many lambdas are small and used only once. For such uses, the realistic equivalent  involves a local class deﬁned immediately before its  only  use. For example:   292   Select Operations   Chapter 11  {  }  {  }  {  }  {  }  void print_modulo const vector & v, ostream& os, int m      output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0     members to hold the capture list  class Modulo_print {  ostream& os; int m;  public:  };  Modulo_print  ostream& s, int mm  :os s , m mm  {} void operator   int x  const     capture  { if  x%m==0  os << x << '\n'; }  for_each begin v ,end v ,Modulo_print{os,m} ;  Compared to that, the version using the lambda is a clear winner. If we really want a name, we can just name the lambda:  void print_modulo const vector & v, ostream& os, int m      output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0  auto Modulo_print = [&os,m]  int x  { if  x%m==0  os << x << '\n'; };  for_each begin v ,end v ,Modulo_print ;  Naming the lambda is often a good idea. Doing so forces us to consider the design of the operation a bit more carefully. It also simpliﬁes code layout and allows for recursion  §11.4.5 . Writing a for-loop is an alternative to using a lambda with a for_each  . Consider:  void print_modulo const vector & v, ostream& os, int m      output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0  for  auto x : v   if  x%m==0  os << x << '\n';  Many would ﬁnd this version much clearer than any of the lambda versions.  However, for_each is a rather  special  algorithm,  and vector  is  a  very  speciﬁc  container. Consider  generalizing print_modulo   to handle arbitrary containers:  template  void print_modulo const C& v, ostream& os, int m      output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0  for  auto x : v   if  x%m==0  os << x << '\n';  This version works nicely for a map. The C++ range-for-statement speciﬁcally caters to the special case  of  traversing  a  sequence  from  its  beginning  to  its  end. The  STL  containers  make such   Section 11.4.2  Alternatives to Lambdas   293  traversals easy and general. For example, using a for-statement to traverse a map gives a depth-ﬁrst traversal.  How would we do a breadth-ﬁrst traversal?  The for-loop version of print_modulo   is not amenable to change, so we have to rewrite it to an algorithm. For example:  template  void print_modulo const C& v, ostream& os, int m      output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0  breadth_ﬁrst begin v ,end v ,  [&os,m] int x  { if  x%m==0  os << x << '\n'; }  Thus, a lambda can be used as ‘‘the body’’ for a generalized loop traversal construct represented as an algorithm. Using for_each rather than breadth_ﬁrst would give depth-ﬁrst traversal.  The performance of a lambda as an argument to a traversal algorithm is equivalent  typically identical  to that of the equivalent loop. I hav e found that to be quite consistent across implementa- tions and platforms. The implication is that we have to base our choice between ‘‘algorithm plus lambda’’ and ‘‘for-statement with body’’ on stylistic grounds and on estimates of extensibility and maintainability.  11.4.3  Capture The main use of lambdas is for specifying code to be passed as arguments.  Lambdas allow that to be  done  ‘‘inline’’ without  having  to  name  a  function   or  function  object   and  use  it  elsewhere. Some  lambdas  require  no  access  to  their  local  environment.  Such lambdas  are  deﬁned  with  the empty lambda introducer []. For example:  void algo vector & v  {  sort v.begin  ,v.end   ;     ... sort v.begin  ,v.end  ,[] int x, int y  { return abs x <abs y ; } ;    ...     sor tvalues     sor tabsolute values  If we want to access local names, we have to say so or get an error:  void f vector & v  {  bool sensitive = true;    ... sort v.begin  ,v.end  ,  [] int x, int y  { return sensitive ? x<y : abs x <abs y ; }     error :can’t access sensitive  I used  the lambda  introducer []. This  is  the  simplest  lambda  introducer  and  does  not  allow the lambda to refer to names in the calling environment.  The ﬁrst character of a lambda expression is always [. A lambda introducer can take various forms:  {  }  }  }   ;   ;   294   Select Operations   Chapter 11   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   []: an empty capture list. This implies that no local names from the surrounding context can be used in the lambda body. For such lambda expressions, data is obtained from arguments or from nonlocal variables. [&]: implicitly  capture  by  reference. All  local  names  can  be  used. All  local  variables  are accessed by reference. [=]: implicitly capture by value.  All local names can be used. All names refer to copies of the local variables taken at the point of call of the lambda expression. [capture-list]: explicit  capture;  the capture-list is  the  list  of  names  of  local  variables  to  be captured  i.e., stored in the object  by reference or by value.  Variables with names preceded by & are captured by reference. Other variables are captured by value.  A capture list can also contain this and names followed by ... as elements. [&, capture-list]: implicitly  capture  by  reference  all  local  variables  with  names  not  men- tioned in the list. The capture list can contain this. Listed names cannot be preceded by &. Variables named in the capture list are captured by value. [=, capture-list]: implicitly capture by value all local variables with names not mentioned in the list. The capture list cannot contain this. The listed names must be preceded by &. Vari- ables named in the capture list are captured by reference.  Note that a local name preceded by & is always captured by reference and a local name not pre- ceded by & is always captured by value.  Only capture by reference allows modiﬁcation of variables in the calling environment.  The capture-list cases are used for ﬁne-grained control over what names from the call environ-  ment are used and how.  For example:  void f vector & v  {  bool sensitive = true;    ... sort v.begin  ,v.end     ;  }  [sensitive] int x, int y  { return sensitive ? x<y : abs x <abs y ; }  By mentioning sensitive in the capture list, we make it accessible from within the lambda. By not specifying otherwise, we ensure that the capture of sensitive is done ‘‘by value’’; just as for argu- ment passing, passing a copy is the default.  Had we wanted to capture sensitive ‘‘by reference,’’ we could have said so by adding a & before sensitive in the capture list: [&sensitive].  The choice between capturing by value and by reference is basically the same as the choice for function arguments  §12.2 . We use a reference if we need to write to the captured object or if it is large.  However,  for  lambdas,  there  is  the  added  concern  that  a  lambda  might  outlive  its  caller  §11.4.3.1 .  When passing  a  lambda  to  another  thread,  capturing  by  value   [=]  is typically  best: accessing another thread’s stack through a reference or a pointer can be most disruptive  to perfor- mance or correctness , and trying to access the stack of a terminated thread can lead to extremely difﬁcult-to-ﬁnd errors.  If you need to capture a variadic template  §28.6  argument, use .... For example:   Section 11.4.3  Capture  295  template  void algo int s, Var... v  {  auto helper = [&s,&v...] { return s∗ h1 v... +h2 v...  ; }    ...  }  }  }  Beware that is it easy to get too clever about capture. Often, there is a choice between capture and argument  passing. When  that’s the  case,  capture  is  usually  the  least  typing  but  has  the  greatest potential for confusion.  11.4.3.1  Lambda and Lifetime  A lambda might outlive its caller. This can happen if we pass a lambda to a different thread or if the callee stores away the lambda for later use. For example:  void setup Menu& m  {     ... Point p1, p2, p3;    compute positions of p1, p2, and p3 m.add "draw triangle",[&]{ m.draw p1,p2,p3 ; } ;    ...     probable disaster  Assuming  that add   is  an  operation  that  adds  a   name,action   pair  to  a  menu  and  that  the draw   operation makes sense, we are left with a time bomb: the setup   completes and later – maybe min- utes later – a user presses the draw triangle button and the lambda tries to access the long-gone local variables.  A lambda that wrote to a variable caught by reference would be even worse in that situa- tion.  If  a  lambda  might  outlive  its  caller, we must  make sure  that  all  local  information   if  any   is copied into the closure object and that values are returned through the return mechanism  §12.1.4  or through suitable arguments.  For the setup   example, that is easily done:  m.add "draw triangle",[=]{ m.draw p1,p2,p3 ; } ;  Think of the capture list as the initializer list for the closure object and [=] and [&] as short-hand notation  §11.4.1 .  11.4.3.2  Namespace Names  We  don’t need  to  ‘‘capture’’ namespace  variables   including  global  variables   because  they are always accessible  provided they are in scope . For example:  template  ostream& operator & p  {  return os << '{' << p.ﬁrst << ',' << p.second << '}';   296   Select Operations   Chapter 11  void print_all const map & m, const string& label  {  cout << label << ":\n{\n"; for_each m.begin  ,m.end  ,  [] const pair & p  { cout << p << '\n'; }   ; cout << "}\n";  }  Here, we don’t need to capture cout or the output operator for pair.  11.4.3.3  Lambda and this  How do we access members of a class object from a lambda used in a member function? We  can include class members in the set of names potentially captured by adding this to the capture list. This  is  used  when  we  want  to  use  a  lambda  in  the  implementation  of  a  member  function. For example, we might have a class for building up requests and retrieving results:  function  const map & > oper; map  values;  map  results;     arguments    targets     operation  Request const string& s ;     parse and store request  [this]   { results=oper values ; }     do oper to values yielding results  class Request {  public:  }  };  void execute   {  Members  are  always  captured  by  reference. That  is, [this] implies  that  members  are  accessed through this rather than copied into the lambda. Unfortunately, [this] and [=] are incompatible. This implies that incautious use can lead to race conditions in multi-threaded programs  §42.4.6 .  11.4.3.4 mutable Lambdas  Usually, we don’t want to modify the state of the function object  the closure , so by default we can’t.  That is, the operator     for the generated function object  §11.4.1  is a const member func- tion.  In the unlikely event that we want to modify the state  as opposed to modifying the state of some variable captured by reference; §11.4.3 , we can declare the lambda mutable. For example:  void algo vector & v  {  int count = v.siz e  ; std::generate v.begin  ,v.end  ,  [count]  mutable{ return −−count; }   ;  }  The −−count decrements the copy of v’s size stored in the closure.   Section 11.4.4  Call and Return  297  11.4.4  Call and Return The rules for passing arguments to a lambda are the same as for a function  §12.2 , and so are the rules for returning results  §12.1.4 . In fact, with the exception of the rules for capture  §11.4.3  most rules for lambdas are borrowed from the rules for functions and classes. However, two irregu- larities should be noted:  [1]   If a lambda  expression  does  not  take any  arguments,  the  argument  list  can  be  omitted. Thus, the minimal lambda expression is []{}.  [2]  A lambda expression’s return type can be deduced from its body. Unfortunately, that is  not also done for a function.  If a lambda body does not have  a return-statement, the lambda’s return type is void. If a lambda body consists of just a single return-statement, the lambda’s return type is the type of the return’s expression.  If neither is the case, we have to explicitly supply a return type. For example:  void g double y  {  [&]{ f y ; } auto z1 = [=] int x { return x+y; } auto z2 = [=,y]{ if  y  return 1; else return 2; }  auto z3 =[y]   { return 1 : 2; } auto z4 = [=,y]  −>int { if  y  return 1; else return 2; }  }     returntype is void    returntype is double    error :body too complicated    forretur ntype deduction    returntype is int    OK: explicit returntype  When the sufﬁx return type notation is used, we cannot omit the argument list.  11.4.5  The Type of a Lambda To  allow for  optimized  versions  of  lambda  expressions,  the  type  of  a  lambda  expression  is  not deﬁned.  However, it is deﬁned to be the type of a function object in the style presented in §11.4.1. This type, called the closure type, is unique to the lambda, so no two lambdas have the same type. Had two lambdas had the same type, the template instantiation mechanism might have gotten con- fused.  A lambda  is  of  a  local  class  type  with  a  constructor  and  a const member  function opera- tor    . In addition to using a lambda as an argument, we can use it to initialize a variable declared auto or std::function  where R is the lambda’s return type and AL is its argument list of types  §33.5.3 .  For example, I might try to write a lambda to reverse the characters in a C-style string: auto rev = [&rev] char∗ b, char∗ e   { if  1<e−b  { swap ∗b,∗−−e ; rev ++b,e ; } };     error  However, that’s not possible because I cannot use an auto variable before its type has been deduced. Instead, I can introduce a name and then use it:  void f string& s1, string& s2  {  function  rev =  [&] char∗ b, char∗ e  { if  1<e−b  { swap ∗b,∗−−e ; rev ++b,e ; } };   298   Select Operations   Chapter 11  Now, the type of rev is speciﬁed before it is used.  If we just want to name a lambda, rather than using it recursively, auto can simplify things:  void g vector & vs1, vector & vs2  {  auto rev = [&] char∗ b, char∗ e  { while  1<e−b  swap ∗b++,∗−−e ; };  rev &s1[0],&s1[0]+s1.siz e   ; rev &s2[0],&s2[0]+s2.siz e   ;  rev &s1[0],&s1[0]+s1.siz e   ; rev &s2[0],&s2[0]+s2.siz e   ;  }  }  A lambda that captures nothing can be assigned to a pointer to function of an appropriate type. For example:  double  ∗p1  double  = [] double a  { return sqrt a ; }; double  ∗p2  double  = [&] double a  { return sqrt a ; }; double  ∗p3  int  = [] int a  { return sqrt a ; };     error :the lambda captures    error :argument types do not match  11.5  Explicit Type Conversion Sometimes, we have  to convert a value of one type into a value of another. Many  arguably too many   such  conversions  are  done  implicitly  according  to  the  language  rules   §2.2.2,  §10.5 . For example:  double d = 1234567890; int i = d;     integer to ﬂoating-point    ﬂoating-point to integer  In other cases, we have to be explicit.  convenience and safety:  For logical  and  historical  reasons,  C++  offers  explicit  type  conversion  operations  of  varying   cid:129  Construction, using the {} notation, providing type-safe construction of new values  §11.5.1   cid:129  Named conversions, providing conversions of various degrees of nastiness:   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   const_cast for getting write access to something declared const  §7.5  static_cast for reversing a well-deﬁned implicit conversion  §11.5.2  reinterpret_cast for changing the meaning of bit patterns  §11.5.2  dynamic_cast for dynamically checked class hierarchy navigation  §22.2.1    cid:129  C-style  casts,  providing  any of the  named  conversions  and  some  combinations  of  those   §11.5.3    cid:129  Functional notation, providing a different notation for C-style casts  §11.5.4   I hav e ordered these conversions in my order of preference and safety of use.  Except for the {} construction notation, I can’t say I like any of those, but at least dynamic_cast is run-time checked.  For conversion between two scalar numeric types, I tend to use a homemade explicit conversion function, narrow_cast, where a value might be narrowed:   Section 11.5  Explicit Type Conversion   299  template  Targ et narrow_cast Source v  {  auto r = static_cast  v ;  if  static_cast  r !=v   return r;  }  throw runtime_error "narrow_cast    failed" ;     convert the value to the target type  That is, if I can convert a value to the target type, convert the result back to the source type, and get back the original value, I’m happy with the result. That is a generalization of the rule the language applies to values in {} initialization  §6.3.5.2 . For example:  void test double d, int i, char∗ p  {  auto c1 = narrow_cast  64 ; auto c2 = narrow_cast  −64 ;  auto c3 = narrow_cast  264 ;      will throwifchars are unsigned    will throwifchars are 8-bit and signed  auto d1 = narrow_cast  1 3.0F ;    OK auto f1 = narrow_cast  1 3.0 ;      will probably throw  auto c4 = narrow_cast  i ;  auto f2 = narrow_cast  d ;      maythrow    maythrow  auto p1 = narrow_cast  i ;  auto i1 = narrow_cast  p ;      compile-time error    compile-time error  auto d2 = narrow_cast  i ;  auto i2 = narrow_cast  d ;      maythrow butprobably will not     maythrow  }  Depending  on  your  use  of  ﬂoating-point  numbers,  it  may  be  worthwhile  to  use  a  range  test  for ﬂoating-point conversions, rather than !=. That is easily done using specializations  §25.3.4.1  or type traits  §35.4.1 .  11.5.1  Construction The  construction  of  a  value  of  type T from  a  value e can  be  expressed  by  the  notation T{e}  §iso.8.5.4 .  For example:  auto d1 = double{2};  double d2 {double{2} 4};      d1==2.0    d1==0.5  Part of the attraction of the T{v} notation is that it will perform only ‘‘well-behaved’’ conversions. For example:   300   Select Operations   Chapter 11  void f int ; void f double ;  void g int i, double d  {  f i ;  f double{i} ;      call f int     error :{} doesn’t do int to ﬂoating conversion  f d ;  f int{d} ;  f static_cast  d  ;      call f double     error :{} doesn’t truncate    call f int  with a truncated value  f round d  ;  f static_cast  lround d   ;     call f int  with a rounded value     call f double  with a rounded value     if the d is overﬂows the int, this still truncates  }  }  I don’t consider truncation of ﬂoating-point numbers  e.g., 7.9 to 7  ‘‘well behaved,’’  so having to be  explicit  when  you  want  it  is  a  good  thing. If  rounding  is  desirable,  we  can  use  the  standard- library function round  ; it performs ‘‘conventional 4 5 rounding,’’ such as 7.9 to 8 and 7.4 to 7.  It sometimes comes as a surprise that {}-construction doesn’t allow int to double conversion, but if  as is not uncommon  the size of an int is the same as the size of a double, then some such conver- sions must lose information. Consider:  static_assert sizeof int ==siz eof double ,"unexpected sizes" ;  int x = numeric_limits ::max  ;     largest possible integer double d = x; int y = x;  We  will not get x==y. Howev er,  we can still initialize a double with an integer literal that can be represented exactly. For example:  Explicit qualiﬁcation with the desired type does not enable ill-behaved conversions.  For example:  double d { 1234 };     ﬁne  void g2 char∗ p  {  int x = int{p}; using Pint = int∗; int∗ p2 = Pint{p};    ...     error :no char* to int conversion     error :no char* to int* conversion  For T{v}, ‘‘reasonably well behaved’’ is deﬁned as having a ‘‘non-narrowing’’  §10.5  conversion from v to T or having an appropriate constructor for T  §17.3 .  The constructor notation T{} is used to express the default value of type T. For example:   Section 11.5.1  Construction   301  template  void f const T& ;  void g3   {  f int{} ;  f complex {} ;     ...     default int value    default complexvalue  }  }   cid:129   The value of an explicit use of the constructor for a built-in type is 0 converted to that type  §6.3.5 . Thus, int{} is another way of writing 0. For a user-deﬁned type T, T{} is deﬁned by the default con- structor  §3.2.1.1, §17.6 , if any, otherwise by default construction, MT{}, of each member.  Explicitly constructed unnamed objects are temporary objects, and  unless bound to a reference  their lifetime is limited to the full expression in which they are used  §6.4.2 . In this, they differ from unnamed objects created using new  §11.2 .  11.5.2  Named Casts Some type conversions are not well behaved or easy to type check; they are not simple construc- tions of values from a well-deﬁned set of argument values.  For example: IO_device∗ d1 = reinterpret_cast  0Xff00 ;     device at 0Xff00  There is no way a compiler can know whether the integer 0Xff00 is a valid address  of an I O device register .  Consequently, the correctness of the conversions is completely in the hands of the pro- grammer. Explicit type conversion, often called casting, is occasionally essential. However, tradi- tionally it is seriously overused and a major source of errors.  Another classical example of the need for explicit type conversion is dealing with ‘‘raw mem- ory,’’ that  is,  memory  that  holds  or  will  hold  objects  of  a  type  not  known  to  the  compiler. For example, a memory allocator  such as operator new  ; §11.2.3  may return a void∗ pointing to newly allocated memory:  void∗ my_allocator siz e_t ;  void f   {  int∗ p = static_cast  my_allocator 100  ;     ...     newallocation used as ints  A compiler does not know the type of the object pointed to by the void∗.  The fundamental idea behind the named casts is to make type conversion more visible and to  allow the programmer to express the intent of a cast:  static_cast converts between related types such as one pointer type to another in the same class  hierarchy,  an integral  type  to  an  enumeration,  or  a  ﬂoating-point  type  to  an  integral type.  It also  does  conversions  deﬁned  by  constructors   §16.2.6,  §18.3.3,  §iso.5.2.9   and conversion operators  §18.4 .   302   Select Operations   Chapter 11   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   reinterpret_cast handles conversions between unrelated types such as an integer to a pointer or a pointer to an unrelated pointer type  §iso.5.2.10 . const_cast converts  between  types  that  differ  only  in const and volatile qualiﬁers  §iso.5.2.11 . dynamic_cast does run-time checked conversion of pointers and references into a class hier- archy  §22.2.1, §iso.5.2.7 .  These distinctions among the named casts allow the compiler to apply some minimal type checking and make it easier for a programmer to ﬁnd the more dangerous conversions represented as reinter- pret_casts.  Some static_casts are portable, but few reinterpret_casts are.  Hardly any guarantees are made for reinterpret_cast, but generally it produces a value of a new type that has the same bit pat- tern  as  its  argument.  If the  target  has  at  least  as  many bits  as  the  original  value,  we  can reinter- pret_cast the result back to its original type and use it. The result of a reinterpret_cast is guaranteed to be usable only if its result is converted back to the exact original type. Note that reinterpret_cast is the kind of conversion that must be used for pointers to functions  §12.5 . Consider:  char x = 'a'; int∗ p1 = &x; int∗ p2 = static_cast  &x ;  int∗ p3 = reinterpret_cast  &x ;      error :no implicit char* to int* conversion    error :no implicit char* to int* conversion    OK: on your head be it  struct B {  * ...*  }; struct D : B {  * ...*  };  B∗ pb = new D; D∗ pd = pb; D∗ pd = static_cast  pb ;      see §3.2.2 and §20.5.2     OK: implicit conversion from D* to B*    error :no implicit conversion from B* to D*    OK  Conversions among class pointers and among class reference types are discussed in §22.2.  If you feel tempted to use an explicit type conversion, take the time to consider if it is really necessary. In C++, explicit type conversion is unnecessary in most cases when C needs it  §1.3.3  and also in many cases in which earlier versions of C++ needed it  §1.3.2, §44.2.3 . In many pro- grams, explicit type conversion can be completely avoided; in others, its use can be localized to a few routines.  11.5.3  C-Style Cast From C, C++ inherited the notation  T e, which performs any conversion that can be expressed as a combination  of static_casts, reinterpret_casts, const_casts to make a value  of  type T from  the expression e  §44.2.3 .  Unfortunately, the C-style cast can also cast from a pointer to a class to a pointer to a private base of that class. Never do that, and hope for a warning from the compiler if you do it by mistake.  This C-style cast is far more dangerous than the named conversion operators because the notation is harder to spot in a large program and the kind of conversion intended by the programmer  is  not  explicit.  That is,  T e might  be  doing  a  portable  conversion  between  related types,  a  nonportable  conversion  between  unrelated  types,  or  removing  the const modiﬁer  from  a pointer type. Without knowing the exact types of T and e, you cannot tell.   Section 11.5.4  Function-Style Cast  303  11.5.4  Function-Style Cast The construction of a value of type T from a value e can be expressed by the functional notation T e . For example:  The T e  construct  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  a function-style  cast. Unfortunately, for  a  built-in type T, T e  is equivalent to  T e  §11.5.3 .  This implies that for many built-in types T e  is not safe.  void f double d  {  int i = int d ; complex z = complex d ;    makeacomplexfrom d    ...     truncated  }  }  void f double d, char∗ p  {  int a = int d ; int b = int p ;    ...     truncates    not portable  Even explicit conversion of a longer integer type to a shorter  such as long to char  can result in nonportable implementation-deﬁned behavior.  Prefer T{v} conversions for well-behaved construction and the named casts  e.g., static_cast  for  other conversions.  11.6  Advice [1]  Prefer preﬁx ++ over sufﬁx ++; §11.1.4.

Deﬁning a function is the way you specify how an operation is to be done. A function cannot be called unless it has been previously declared.  A function declaration gives the name of the function, the type of the value returned  if any ,  and the number and types of the arguments that must be supplied in a call. For example:  Elem∗ next_elem  ;  void exit int ;  double sqrt double ;      no argument; returnanElem*    int argument; returnnothing    double argument; returnadouble   306   Functions  Chapter 12  The semantics of argument passing are identical to the semantics of copy initialization  §16.2.6 . Argument  types  are  checked  and  implicit  argument  type  conversion  takes  place  when  necessary. For example:  double s2 = sqrt 2 ;  double s3 = sqrt "three" ;      call sqrt   with the argument double{2}    error :sqr t  requires an argument of type double  The value of such checking and type conversion should not be underestimated.  A function declaration may contain argument names. This can be a help to the reader of a pro- gram,  but  unless  the  declaration  is  also  a  function  deﬁnition,  the  compiler  simply  ignores  such names.  As a return type, void means that the function does not return a value  §6.2.7 .  The type of a function consists of the return type and the argument types. For class member  functions  §2.3.2, §16.2 , the name of the class is also part of the function type. For example:  double f int i, const Info& ;  char& String::operator[] int ;     type: double int,const Info&     type: char& String:: int   12.1.1  Why Functions? There is a long and disreputable tradition of writing very long functions – hundreds of lines long. I once encountered a single  handwritten  function with more than 32,768 lines of code. Writers of such functions seem to fail to appreciate one of the primary purposes of functions: to break up com- plicated computations into meaningful chunks and name them. We  want our code to be compre- hensible, because that is the ﬁrst step on the way to maintainability. The ﬁrst step to comprehensi- bility  is  to  break  computational  tasks  into  comprehensible  chunks   represented  as  functions  and classes  and name those. Such functions then provide the basic vocabulary of computation, just as the types  built-in and user-deﬁned  provide the basic vocabulary of data. The C++ standard algo- rithms  e.g., ﬁnd, sort, and iota  provide a good start  Chapter 32 . Next, we can compose functions representing common or specialized tasks into larger computations.  The number of errors in code correlates strongly with the amount of code and the complexity of the code. Both problems can be addressed by using more and shorter functions. Using a function to do a speciﬁc task often saves us from writing a speciﬁc piece of code in the middle of other code; making it a function forces us to name the activity and document its dependencies. Also, function call and return saves us from using error-prone control structures, such as gotos  §9.6  and contin- ues  §9.5.5 .  Unless they are  very  regular  in  structure,  nested  loops  are  an  avoidable  source  of errors  e.g., use a dot product to express a matrix algorithm rather than nesting loops; §40.6 .  The  most  basic  advice  is  to  keep  a  function  of  a  size  so  that  you  can  look  at  it  in  total  on  a screen.  Bugs tend to creep in when we can view only part of an algorithm at a time. For many pro- grammers that puts a limit of about 40 lines on a function. My ideal is a much smaller size still, maybe an average of 7 lines.  In essentially all cases, the cost of a function call is not a signiﬁcant factor. Where that cost could be signiﬁcant  e.g., for frequently used access functions, such as vector subscripting  inlining can eliminate it  §12.1.5 . Use functions as a structuring mechanism.   Section 12.1.2  Parts of a Function Declaration  307  12.1.2  Parts of a Function Declaration In addition to specifying a name, a set of arguments, and a return type, a function declaration can contain a variety of speciﬁers and modiﬁers. In all we can have:   cid:129  The name of the function; required  cid:129  The argument list, which may be empty   ; required  cid:129  The return type, which may be void and which may be preﬁx or sufﬁx  using auto ; required inline, indicating a desire to have function calls implemented by inlining the function body  cid:129   §12.1.5  constexpr, indicating  that  it  should  be  possible  to  evaluate  the  function  at  compile  time  if given constant expressions as arguments  §12.1.6  noexcept, indicating that the function may not throw an exception  §13.5.1.1    cid:129    cid:129   cid:129  A linkage speciﬁcation, for example, static  §15.2   cid:129   [[noreturn]], indicating that the function will not return using the normal call return mecha- nism  §12.1.4   In addition, a member function may be speciﬁed as:   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   virtual, indicating that it can be overridden in a derived class  §20.3.2  override, indicating that it must be overriding a virtual function from a base class  §20.3.4.1  ﬁnal, indicating that it cannot be overriden in a derived class  §20.3.4.2  static, indicating that it is not associated with a particular object  §16.2.12  const, indicating that it may not modify its object  §3.2.1.1, §16.2.9.1  If you feel inclined to give readers a headache, you may write something like:  struct S {  };  [[noreturn]] virtual inline auto f const unsigned long int ∗const  −> void const noexcept;  12.1.3  Function Deﬁnitions Every function that is called must be deﬁned somewhere  once only; §15.2.3 . A function deﬁni- tion is a function declaration in which the body of the function is presented. For example:  void swap int∗, int∗ ;      adeclaration  void swap int∗ p, int∗ q   {     adeﬁnition  int t = ∗p; ∗p =∗q; ∗q = t;  }  The deﬁnition and all declarations for a function must specify the same type. Unfortunately, to pre- serve C compatibility, a const is ignored at the highest level of an argument type. For example, this is two declarations of the same function:  void f int ; void f const int ;     type is void int     type is void int    308   Functions  Chapter 12  That function, f  , could be deﬁned as:  void f int x  {  *we can modify x here*  }  Alternatively, we could deﬁne f   as:  void f const int x  {  *we cannot modify x here*  }  In either case, the argument that f   can or cannot modify is a copy of what a caller provided, so there is no danger of an obscure modiﬁcation of the calling context.  Function argument names are not part of the function type and need not be identical in different  declarations.  For example:  int& max int& a, int& b, int& c ;    returnareference to the larger of a, b,and c  int& max int& x1, int& x2, int& x3  {  return  x1>x2 ?   x1>x3 ?x1:x3  :   x2>x3 ?x2:x3 ;  }  }  Naming arguments in declarations that are not deﬁnitions is optional and commonly used to sim- plify documentation. Conversely, we can indicate that an argument is unused in a function deﬁni- tion by not naming it. For example:  void search table∗ t, const char∗ key, const char∗  {     no use of the third argument  Typically, unnamed  arguments  arise  from  the  simpliﬁcation  of  code  or  from  planning  ahead  for extensions.  In both cases, leaving the argument in place, although unused, ensures that callers are not affected by the change.  In addition to functions, there are a few other things that we can call; these follow most rules  deﬁned for functions, such as the rules for argument passing  §12.2 :   cid:129  Constructors  §2.3.2, §16.2.5  are technicallly not functions; in particular, they don’t return  a value, can initialize bases and members  §17.4 , and can’t hav e their address taken.  cid:129  Destructors  §3.2.1.2, §17.2  can’t be overloaded and can’t hav e their address taken.  cid:129  Function  objects  §3.4.3,  §19.2.2   are  not  functions   they are  objects   and  can’t be over-  loaded, but their operator  s are functions.   cid:129  Lambda expressions  §3.4.3, §11.4  are basically a shorthand for deﬁning function objects.  12.1.4  Returning Values Every  function  declaration  contains  a  speciﬁcation  of  the  function’s return  type  except  for  con- structors and type conversion functions . Traditionally, in C and C++, the return type comes ﬁrst in a function declaration  before the name of the function . However, a function declaration can also be written using a syntax that places the return type after the argument list. For example, the fol- lowing two declarations are equivalent:  string to_string int a ; auto to_string int a  −> string;     preﬁx returntype    sufﬁx returntype   Section 12.1.4  Returning Values   309  That  is,  a  preﬁx auto indicates  that  the  return  type  is  placed  after  the  argument  list. The  sufﬁx return type is preceded by −>.  The essential use for a sufﬁx return type comes in function template declarations in which the  return type depends on the arguments.  For example:  template  auto product const vector & x, const vector & y  −> decltype x∗y ;  However,  the  sufﬁx  return  syntax  can  be  used  for  any function.  There is  an  obvious  similarity between the sufﬁx return syntax for a function and the lambda expression syntax  §3.4.3, §11.4 ; it is a pity those two constructs are not identical.  A function that does not return a value has a ‘‘return type’’ of void. A value must be returned from a function that is not declared void  however, main   is special;  see §2.2.1 . Conversely, a value cannot be returned from a void function.  For example:  int f1   { } void f2   { }     error :no value returned    OK  int f3   { return 1; } void f4   { return 1; }     OK    error :retur nvalue in void function  int f5   { return; } void f6   { return; }     error :retur nvalue missing    OK  A return value is speciﬁed by a return-statement.  For example:  int fac int n  {  return  n>1  ? n∗fac n−1  : 1;  A function that calls itself is said to be recursive.  There can be more than one return-statement in a function:  }  }  int fac2 int n  {  if  n > 1   return 1;  return n∗fac2 n−1 ;  Like the semantics of argument passing, the semantics of function value return are identical to the semantics of copy initialization  §16.2.6 . A return-statement initializes a variable of the returned type.  The type of a return expression is checked against the type of the returned type, and all stan- dard and user-deﬁned type conversions are performed. For example:  double f   { return 1; }     1isimplicitly converted to double{1}  Each time a function is called, a new copy of its arguments and local  automatic  variables is cre- ated.  The store is reused after the function returns, so a pointer to a local non-static variable should never be returned.  The contents of the location pointed to will change unpredictably:   310   Functions  Chapter 12  int∗ fp   {  int& fr   {  int local = 1;    ... return &local;     bad  int local = 1;    ... return local;     bad  An equivalent error can occur when using references:  void g int∗ p ;  void h int∗ p  {     ... return g p ;     OK: equivalent to ‘‘g p ; return;’’  Fortunately, a compiler can easily warn about returning references to local variables  and most do . There are no void values.  However, a call of a void function may be used as the return value of a  void function.  For example:  This  form  of  return  is  useful  to  avoid  special  cases  when  writing  template  functions  where  the return type is a template parameter.  A return-statement is one of ﬁve ways of exiting a function:  cid:129  Executing a return-statement.  cid:129   ‘‘Falling off the end’’ of a function; that is, simply reaching the end of the function body. This is allowed only in functions that are not declared to return a value  i.e., void functions  and in main  , where falling off the end indicates successful completion  §12.1.4 .   cid:129  Throwing an exception that isn’t caught locally  §13.5 .  cid:129  Terminating because an exception was thrown and not caught locally in a noexcept function   §13.5.1.1 .   cid:129  Directly or indirectly invoking a system function that doesn’t return  e.g., exit  ; §15.4 .  A function  that  does  not  return  normally   i.e.,  through  a return or  ‘‘falling  off the  end’’   can  be marked [[noreturn]]  §12.1.7 .  12.1.5 inline Functions A function can be deﬁned to be inline. For example:  inline int fac int n  {  return  n<2  ? 1 : n∗fac n−1 ;  }  }  }  }   Section 12.1.5  inline Functions   311  The inline speciﬁer is a hint to the compiler that it should attempt to generate code for a call of fac   inline  rather  than  laying  down  the  code  for  the  function  once  and  then  calling  through  the  usual function  call  mechanism. A clever compiler  can  generate  the  constant 720 for  a  call fac 6 . The possibility of mutually recursive inline functions, inline functions that recurse or not depending on input, etc., makes it impossible to guarantee that every call of an inline function is actually inlined. The degree of cleverness of a compiler cannot be legislated, so one compiler might generate 720, another 6∗fac 5 , and yet another an un-inlined call fac 6 . If you want a guarantee that a value is computed at compile time, declare it constexpr and make sure that all functions used in its evalua- tion are constexpr  §12.1.6 .  To  make inlining possible in the absence of unusually clever compilation and linking facilities, the deﬁnition – and not just the declaration – of an inline function must be in scope  §15.2 . An inline speciﬁer does not affect the semantics of a function. In particular, an inline function still has a unique address, and so do static variables  §12.1.8  of an inline function.  If an inline function is deﬁned in more than one translation unit  e.g., typically because it was deﬁned  in  a  header;  §15.2.2 ,  its  deﬁnition  in  the  different  translation  units  must  be  identical  §15.2.3 .  12.1.6 constexpr Functions In general, a function cannot be evaluated at compile time and therefore cannot be called in a con- stant expression  §2.2.3, §10.4 . By specifying a function constexpr, we indicate that we want it to be usable in constant expressions if given constant expressions as arguments.  For example:  constexpr int fac int n  {  return  n>1  ? n∗fac n−1  : 1;  }  constexpr int f9 = fac 9 ;     must be evaluated at compile time  When constexpr is used in a function deﬁnition, it means ‘‘should be usable in a constant expres- sion when given constant expressions as arguments.’’  When used in an object deﬁnition, it means ‘‘evaluate the initializer at compile time.’’  For example:  void f int n  {  int f5 = fac 5 ; int fn = fac n ;     maybeevaluated at compile time    evaluated at run time  n is a var iable   constexpr int f6 = fac 6 ; constexpr int fnn = fac n ;     must be evaluated at compile time    error :can’t guarantee compile-time evaluation  n is a var iable   char a[fac 4 ]; char a2[fac n ];     OK: array bounds must be constants and fac   is constexpr    error :array bounds must be constants and n is a var iable     ...  }  To  be evaluated  at  compile  time,  a  function  must  be  suitably  simple:  a constexpr function  must   312   Functions  Chapter 12  consist of a single return-statement; no loops and no local variables are allowed.  Also, a constexpr function may not have side effects.  That is, a constexpr function is a pure function. For example:     error :constexpr function cannot be void  glob = a;     error :side effect in constexpr function  int glob;  constexpr void bad1 int a  {  constexpr int bad2 int a  {  if  a>=0  return a; else return −a;     error :if-statement in constexpr function  constexpr int bad3 int a  {  sum = 0; for  int i=0; i<a; +=i  sum +=fac i ; return sum;     error :local var iable in constexpr function    error :loop in constexpr function  The  rules  for  a constexpr constructor  are  suitably  different   §10.4.3 ;  there,  only  simple  initial- ization of members is allowed.  A constexpr function allows recursion and conditional expressions.  This implies that you can express just about anything as a constexpr function if you really want to. However, you’ll ﬁnd the debugging  gets  unnecessarily  difﬁcult  and  compile  times  longer  than  you  would  like unless  you restrict the use of constexpr functions to the relatively simple tasks for which they are intended. By using literal types  §10.4.3 , constexpr functions can be deﬁned to use user-deﬁned types. Like inline functions, constexpr functions obey the ODR  ‘‘one-deﬁnition rule’’ , so that deﬁni- tions in the different translation units must be identical  §15.2.3 . You can think of constexpr func- tions as a restricted form of inline functions  §12.1.5 .  12.1.6.1 constexpr and References  A constexpr function cannot have side effects, so writing to nonlocal objects is not possible. How- ev er, a constexpr function can refer to nonlocal objects as long as it does not write to them.  constexpr int ftbl[] { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 };  constexpr int ﬁb int n  {  return  n<sizeof ftbl  siz eof ∗ftbl   ? ftbl[n] : ﬁb n ;  A constexpr function can take reference arguments.  Of course, it cannot write through such refer- ences,  but const reference  parameters  are  as  useful  as  ever.  For  example,  in  the  standard  library  §40.4  we ﬁnd:  }  }  }  }   Section 12.1.6.1  constexpr and References   313  template  class complex  { public:    ...  explicit constexpr complex const complex & ;    ...  };  This allows us to write:  constexpr complex  z {2.0};  The  temporary  variable  that  is  logically  constructed  to  hold  the const reference  argument  simply becomes a value internal to the compiler.  It is possible for a constexpr function to return a reference or a pointer. For example: constexpr const int∗ addr const int& r  { return &r; }     OK  However, doing so brings us away from the fundamental role of constexpr functions as parts of con- stant expression evaluation.  In particular, it can be quite tricky to determine whether the result of such a function is a constant expression.  Consider:  static const int x = 5; constexpr const int∗ p1 = addr x ;  constexpr int xx = ∗p1;      OK    OK  static int y; constexpr const int∗ p2 = addr y ;  constexpr int yy = ∗y;      OK    error :attempt to read a var iable  constexpr const int∗ tp = addr 5 ;      error :address of temporar y  12.1.6.2  Conditional Evaluation  A branch of a conditional expression that is not taken in a constexpr function is not evaluated.  This implies that a branch not taken can require run-time evaluation.  For example:  return  low<=i && i<high  ? i : throw out_of_rang e  ;  constexpr int check int i  {  }  constexpr int low = 0; constexpr int high = 99;     ... constexpr int val = check f x,y,z  ;  You might imagine low and high to be conﬁguration parameters that are known at compile time, but not at design time, and that f x,y,z  computes some implementation-dependent value.   314   Functions  Chapter 12  12.1.7 [[noreturn]] Functions A construct [[...]] is called an attribute and can be placed just about anywhere in the C++ syntax. In  general,  an  attribute  speciﬁes  some  implementation-dependent  property  about  the  syntactic entity that precedes it. In addition, an attribute can be placed in front of a declaration. There are only two standard attributes  §iso.7.6 , and [[noreturn]] is one of them. The other is [[carries_depen- dency]]  §41.3 .  Placing [[noreturn]] at  the  start  of  a  function  declaration  indicates  that  the  function  is  not  expected to return. For example:  [[noreturn]] void exit int ;      exit will neverretur n  Knowing  that  a  function  does  not  return  is  useful  for  both  comprehension  and  code  generation. What happens if the function returns despite a [[noreturn]] attribute is undeﬁned.  12.1.8  Local Variables A name deﬁned in a function is commonly referred to as a local name. A local variable or constant is initialized when a thread of execution reaches its deﬁnition. Unless declared static, each invoca- tion of the function has its own copy of the variable.  If a local variable is declared static, a single, statically allocated object  §6.4.2  will be used to represent that variable in all calls of the function. It will be initialized only the ﬁrst time a thread of execution reaches its deﬁnition. For example:  static int n = 0; int x = 0;     initialized once    initialized ’a’ times in each call of f    cout << "n == " << n++ << ", x == " << x++ << '\n';  void f int a  {  while  a−−  {  }  }  }  int main   {  f 3 ;  This prints:  n == 0, x == 0 n == 1, x == 0 n == 2, x == 0  A static local variable allows the function to preserve information between calls without introduc- ing a global variable that might be accessed and corrupted by other functions  see also §16.2.12 .  Initialization of a static local variable does not lead to a data race  §5.3.1  unless you enter the function containing it recursively or a deadlock occurs  §iso.6.7 . That is, the C++ implementation must guard the initialization of a local static variable with some kind of lock-free construct  e.g., a call_once; §42.3.3 .  The effect of initializing a local static recursively is undeﬁned. For example:   Section 12.1.8  int fn int n  {  static int n1 = n; static int n2 = fn n−1 +1; return n;     OK    undeﬁned  Local Variables   315  A static local  variable  is  useful  for  avoiding  order  dependencies  among  nonlocal  variables  §15.4.1 .  There are no local functions; if you feel you need one, use a function object or a lambda expres-  sion  §3.4.3, §11.4 .  The scope of a label  §9.6 , should you be foolhardy enough to use one, is the complete func-  tion, independent of which nested scope it may be in.  12.2  Argument Passing When a function is called  using the sufﬁx   , known as the call operator or application operator , store is set aside for its formal arguments  also known as its parameters , and each formal argu- ment is initialized by its corresponding actual argument.  The semantics of argument passing are identical to the semantics of initialization  copy initialization, to be precise; §16.2.6 . In particular, the type of an actual argument is checked against the type of the corresponding formal argument, and  all  standard  and  user-deﬁned  type  conversions  are  performed. Unless  a  formal  argument  parameter  is a reference, a copy of the actual argument is passed to the function. For example:  int∗ ﬁnd int∗ ﬁrst, int∗ last, int v  {  while  ﬁrst!=last && ∗ﬁrst!=v   ++ﬁrst; return ﬁrst;     ﬁnd x in [ﬁrst:last   void g int∗ p, int∗ q  {  int∗ pp = ﬁnd p,q,'x' ;    ...  }  }  }  Here, the caller’s copy of the argument, p, is not modiﬁed by the operations on ﬁnd  ’s copy, called ﬁrst. The pointer is passed by value.  There are special rules for passing arrays  §12.2.2 , a facility for passing unchecked arguments  §12.2.4 ,  and  a  facility  for  specifying  default  arguments   §12.2.5 . The  use  of  initializer  lists  is described  in  §12.2.3  and  the  ways  of  passing  arguments  to  template  functions  in  §23.5.2  and §28.6.2.   316   Functions  Chapter 12  When f   is called, ++val increments a local copy of the ﬁrst actual argument, whereas ++ref incre- ments the second actual argument.  Consider:  12.2.1  Reference Arguments Consider:  void f int val, int& ref  {  ++val; ++ref;  void g   {  int i = 1; int j = 1; f i,j ;  }  }  }  The call f i,j  will increment j but not i. The ﬁrst argument, i, is passed by value; the second argu- ment, j, is passed by reference. As mentioned in §7.7, functions that modify call-by-reference argu- ments can make programs hard to read and should most often be avoided  but see §18.2.5 . It can, however, be noticeably more efﬁcient to pass a large object by reference than to pass it by value.  In that case, the argument might be declared a const reference to indicate that the reference is used for efﬁciency reasons only and not to enable the called function to change the value of the object:  void f const Large& arg  {     the value of ‘‘arg’’cannot be changed     except byusing explicit type conversion; §11.5   The absence of const in the declaration of a reference argument is taken as a statement of intent to modify the variable:  void g Large& arg ;      assume that g   modiﬁes arg  Similarly, declaring a pointer argument const tells readers that the value of an object pointed to by that argument is not changed by the function. For example:  int strlen const char∗ ;  char∗ strcpy char∗ to, const char∗ from ;  int strcmp const char∗, const char∗ ;      number of characters in a C-style string    copyaC-style string    compare C-style strings  The importance of using const arguments increases with the size of a program.  Note  that  the  semantics  of  argument  passing  are  different  from  the  semantics  of  assignment. This  is  important  for const arguments,  reference  arguments,  and  arguments  of  some  user-deﬁned types.  Following  the  rules  for  reference  initialization,  a  literal,  a  constant,  and  an  argument  that requires conversion can be passed as a const T& argument, but not as a plain  non-const  T& argu- ment.  Allowing conversions for a const  T& argument ensures that such an argument can be given   Section 12.2.1  Reference Arguments   317  exactly the same set of values as a T argument by passing the value in a temporary, if necessary. For example:  ﬂoat fsqrt const ﬂoat& ;    Fortran-style sqrttaking a reference argument  void g double d  {  ﬂoat r = fsqrt 2.0f ;  r = fsqr t r ; r = fsqr t d ;     pass reference to temp holding 2.0f    pass reference to r    pass reference to temp holding static_cast  d   Disallowing  conversions  for  non-const reference  arguments   §7.7   avoids  the  possibility  of  silly mistakes arising from the introduction of temporaries. For example:  void update ﬂoat& i ;  void g double d, ﬂoat r  {  update 2.0f ;  update r ;  update d ;      error :const argument    pass reference to r    error :type conversion required  Had  these  calls  been  allowed, update   would  quietly  have  updated  temporaries  that  immediately were deleted. Usually, that would come as an unpleasant surprise to the programmer.  If  we  wanted  to  be  precise,  pass-by-reference  would  be  pass-by-lvalue-reference  because  a function can also take rvalue references. As described in §7.7, an rvalue can be bound to an rvalue reference  but not to an lvalue reference  and an lvalue can be bound to an lvalue reference  but not to an rvalue reference . For example:  void f vector & ; void f const vector & ; void f vector && ;      non-const  lvalue reference argument    const lvalue reference argument    rvalue reference argument  void g vector & vi, const vector & cvi  {  f vi ;  f vci ;  f vector {1,2,3,4} ;      call f vector &     call f const vector &     call f vector && ;  We  must  assume  that  a  function  will  modify  an  rvalue  argument,  leaving  it  good  only  for  de- struction  or  reassignment   §17.5 . The  most  obvious  use  of  rvalue  references  is  to  deﬁne  move constructors and move assignments  §3.3.2, §17.5.2 . I’m sure someone will ﬁnd a clever use for const-rvalue-reference arguments, but so far, I hav e not seen a genuine use case.  Please note that for a template argument T, the template argument type deduction rules give T&& a signiﬁcantly  different  meaning  from X&& for  a  type X  §23.5.2.1 .  For  template  arguments,  an rvalue reference is most often used to implement ‘‘perfect forwarding’’  §23.5.2.1, §28.6.3 .  }  }  }   318   Functions  Chapter 12  How do we choose among the ways of passing arguments? My rules of thumb are: [1]  Use pass-by-value for small objects. [2]  Use pass-by-const-reference to pass large values that you don’t need to modify. [3]  Return a result as a return value rather than modifying an object through an argument. [4]  Use rvalue references to implement move  §3.3.2, §17.5.2  and forwarding  §23.5.2.1 . [5]  Pass a pointer if ‘‘no object’’ is a valid alternative  and represent ‘‘no object’’ by nullptr . [6]  Use pass-by-reference only if you have to.  The ‘‘when you have to’’ in the last rule of thumb refers to the observation that passing pointers is often  a  less  obscure  mechanism  for  dealing  with  objects  that  need  modiﬁcation   §7.7.1,  §7.7.4  than using references.  12.2.2  Array Arguments If an array is used as a function argument, a pointer to its initial element is passed. For example:  int strlen const char∗ ;  void f   {  }  char v[] = "Annemarie"; int i = strlen v ; int j = strlen "Nicholas" ;  That is, an argument of type T[] will be converted to a T∗ when passed as an argument.  This implies that an assignment to an element of an array argument changes the value of an element of the argu- ment array. In other words, arrays differ from other types in that an array is not passed by value. Instead, a pointer is passed  by value .  A parameter of array type is equivalent to a parameter of pointer type. For example: void odd int∗ p ; void odd int a[] ; void odd int buf[1020] ;  These  three  declarations  are  equivalent  and  declare  the  same  function. As  usual,  the  argument names do not affect the type of the function  §12.1.3 . The rules and techniques for passing multi- dimensional arrays can be found in §7.4.3.  The size of an array is not available to the called function. This is a major source of errors, but there are several ways of circumventing this problem. C-style strings are zero-terminated, so their size can be computed  e.g., by a potentially expensive call of strlen  ; §43.4 .  For other arrays, a second argument specifying the size can be passed. For example:  void compute1 int∗ vec_ptr, int vec_size ;      one way  At best, this is a workaround.  It is usually preferable to pass a reference to some container, such as vector  §4.4.1, §31.4 , array  §34.2.1 , or map  §4.4.3, §31.4.3 .  If you really want to pass an array, rather than a container or a pointer to the ﬁrst element of an  array, you can declare a parameter of type reference to array. For example:   Section 12.2.2  Array Arguments   319  Note that the number of elements is part of a reference-to-array type. That makes such references far less ﬂexible than pointers and containers  such as vector .  The main use of references to arrays is in templates, where the number of elements is then deduced. For example:  void f int &r [4] ;  void g   {  int a1[] = {1,2,3,4}; int a2[] = {1,2};  f a1 ;  f a2 ;      OK    error : wrong number of elements  template  void f T &r [N]  {     ...  int a1[10]; double a2[100];  void g   {  f a1 ;  f a2 ;      Tisint; N is 10    Tisdouble; N is 100  }  }  }  };  This typically gives rise to as many function deﬁnitions as there are calls to f   with distinct array types.  Multidimensional arrays are tricky  see §7.3 , but often arrays of pointers can be used instead,  and they need no special treatment. For example:  const char∗ day[] = {  "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun"  As ever, vector and similar types are alternatives to the built-in, low-level arrays and pointers.  12.2.3  List Arguments A {}-delimited list can be used as an argument to a parameter of:  [1]  Type std::initializer_list , where the values of the list can be implicitly converted to T [2]  A type that can be initialized with the values provided in the list [3]  A reference to an array of T, where the values of the list can be implicitly converted to T  Technically, case [2] covers all examples, but I ﬁnd it easier to think of the three cases separately. Consider:   320   Functions  Chapter 12  template  void f1 initializer_list  ;  struct S { int a; string s;  }; void f2 S ;  void f4 int ;  void g   {  template  void f3 T  &r [N] ;  template  void f initializer_list  ;  struct S { int a; string s;  }; void f S ;  void f int ;  void g   {  template  void f T  &r [N] ;  }  }     Tisint and the initializer_list has size   4  f1 {1,2,3,4} ;  f2 {1,"MKS"} ;     f2 S{1,"MKS"}  f3 {1,2,3,4} ;  f4 {1} ;      Tisint and N is 4    f4 int{1} ;  If there is a possible ambiguity, an initializer_list parameter takes priority. For example:  f {1,2,3,4} ;  f {1,"MKS"} ;  f {1} ;      Tisint and the initializer_list has size   4    calls f S     Tisint and the initializer_list has size   1  The reason that a function with an initializer_list argument take priority is that it could be very con- fusing if different functions were chosen based on the number of elements of a list. It is not possi- ble to eliminate every form of confusion in overload resolution  for example, see §4.4, §17.3.4.1 , but giving initializer_list parameters priority for {}-list arguments seems to minimize confusion.   Section 12.2.3  List Arguments   321  If  there  is  a  function  with  an  initializer-list  argument  in  scope,  but  the  argument  list  isn’t a  match for that, another function can be chosen. The call f {1,"MKS"}  was an example of that.  Note that these rules apply to std::initializer_list  arguments only. There are no special rules for std::initializer_list & or  for  other  types  that  just  happen  to  be  called initializer_list  in  some other scope .  12.2.4  Unspeciﬁed Number of Arguments For some functions, it is not possible to specify the number and type of all arguments expected in a call.  To implement such interfaces, we have three choices:  [1]  Use a variadic template  §28.6 : this allows us to handle an arbitrary number of arbitrary types in a type-safe manner by writing a small template metaprogram that interprets the argument list to determine its meaning and take appropriate actions.  [2]  Use an initializer_list as the argument type  §12.2.3 . This allows us to handle an arbitrary In many contexts,  such  number  of  arguments  of  a  single  type  in  a  type-safe  manner. homogeneous lists are the most common and important case.  [3]  Terminate the argument list with the ellipsis  ... , which means ‘‘and maybe some more arguments.’’  This allows us to handle an arbitrary number of  almost  arbitrary types by using some macros from  . This solution is not inherently type-safe and can be hard  to  use  with  sophisticated  user-deﬁned  types. However,  this  mechanism  has  been used from the earliest days of C.  The ﬁrst two mechanisms are described elsewhere, so I describe only the third mechanism  even though I consider it inferior to the others for most uses . For example:  int printf const char∗ ... ;  This speciﬁes that a call of the standard-library function printf    §43.3  must have at least one argu- ment, a C-style string, but may or may not have others.  For example:  printf "Hello, world!\n" ; printf "My name is %s %s\n", ﬁrst_name , second_name ; printf "%d + %d = %d\n",2,3,5 ;  Such a function must rely on information not available to the compiler when interpreting its argu- ment list. In the case of printf  , the ﬁrst argument is a format string containing special character sequences that allow printf   to handle other arguments correctly; %s means ‘‘expect a char∗ argu- ment’’ and %d means ‘‘expect an int argument.’’  Howev er,  the compiler cannot in general ensure that the expected arguments are really provided in a call or that an argument is of the expected type. For example:  include    int main   {  }  std::printf "My name is %s %s\n",2 ;  This is not valid code, but most compilers will not catch this error. At best, it will produce some strange-looking output  try it! .   322   Functions  Chapter 12  Clearly, if an argument  has  not  been  declared,  the  compiler  does  not  have  the  information needed to perform the standard type checking and type conversion for it. In that case, a char or a short is passed as an int and a ﬂoat is passed as a double. This is not necessarily what the program- mer expects.  A well-designed program needs at most a few functions for which the argument types are not completely  speciﬁed. Overloaded  functions,  functions  using  default  arguments,  functions  taking initializer_list arguments, and variadic templates can be used to take care of type checking in most cases when one would otherwise consider leaving argument types unspeciﬁed. Only when both the number of arguments and the types of arguments vary and a variadic template solution is deemed undesirable is the ellipsis necessary.  The most common use of the ellipsis is to specify an interface to C library functions that were  deﬁned before C++ provided alternatives:  int fprintf FILE∗, const char∗ ... ;  int execl const char∗ ... ;      from      from UNIX header  A standard set of macros for accessing the unspeciﬁed arguments in such functions can be found in  . Consider writing an error function that takes one integer argument indicating the sever- ity of the error followed by an arbitrary number of strings. The idea is to compose the error mes- sage  by  passing  each  word  as  a  separate  C-style  string  argument.  The list  of  string  arguments should be terminated by the null pointer:  extern void error int ... ; extern char∗ itoa int, char[] ;      int to alpha  int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  switch  argc  { case 1:  error 0,argv[0],nullptr ; break;  case 2:  default:  error 0,argv[0],argv[1],nullptr ; break;  }    ...  }  char buffer[8]; error 1,argv[0],"with",itoa argc−1,buffer ,"arguments",nullptr ;  The function itoa   returns a C-style string representing its int argument.  It is popular in C, but not part of the C standard.  I always pass argv[0] because that, conventionally, is the name of the program. Note that using the integer 0 as the terminator would not have been portable: on some imple- mentations, the integer 0 and the null pointer do not have  the same representation  §6.2.8 . This illustrates the subtleties and extra work that face the programmer once type checking has been sup- pressed using the ellipsis.   Section 12.2.4  Unspeciﬁed Number of Arguments   323  The error   function could be deﬁned like this:  include    void error int severity ...     ‘‘severity’’followedbyazero-ter minatedlist of char*s {  va_list ap; va_star t ap,severity ;      arg startup  for  ;;  {  }  char∗ p = va_arg ap,char∗ ; if  p == nullptr  break; cerr << p << ' ';  va_end ap ;      arg cleanup  cerr << '\n'; if  severity  exit severity ;  }  }  First, a va_list is deﬁned and initialized by a call of va_star t  . The macro va_star t takes the name of the va_list and the name of the last formal argument as arguments.  The macro va_arg   is used to pick the unnamed arguments in order. In each call, the programmer must supply a type; va_arg   assumes that an actual argument of that type has been passed, but it typically has no way of ensur- ing  that. Before  returning  from  a  function  in  which va_star t   has  been  used, va_end   must  be called.  The reason is that va_star t   may modify the stack in such a way that a return cannot suc- cessfully be done; va_end   undoes any such modiﬁcations.  Alternatively, error   could have been deﬁned using a standard-library initializer_list:  void error int severity, initializ er_list  err  {  for  auto& s : err   cerr << s << ' ';  cerr << '\n'; if  severity  exit severity ;  It would then have to be called using the list notation. For example:  switch  argc  { case 1:  error 0,{argv[0]} ; break;  error 0,{argv[0],argv[1]} ; break;  case 2:  default:  }  error 1,{argv[0],"with",to_string argc−1 ,"arguments"} ;   324   Functions  Chapter 12  The int-to-string conversion function to_string   is provided by the standard library  §36.3.5 .  If I didn’t hav e to mimic C style, I would further simplify the code by passing a container as a  single argument:  void error int severity, const vector & err  {     almost as before  vector  arguments int argc, char∗ argv[]     package arguments {  for  auto& s : err   cerr << s << ' ';  cerr << '\n'; if  severity  exit severity ;  }  }  }  vector  res; for  int i = 0; i!=argc; ++i   res.push_back argv[i] ;  return res  int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  auto args = arguments argc,argv ; error  args.siz e  <2 ?0:1,args ;    ...  The helper function, arguments  , is trivial, and main   and error   are simple. The interface between main   and error   is  more  general  in  that  it  now passes  all  arguments.  That would  allow later improvements  of error  . The  use  of  the vector  is  far  less  error-prone  than  any use  of  an unspeciﬁed number of arguments.  12.2.5  Default Arguments A general function often needs more arguments than are necessary to handle simple cases. In par- ticular, functions that construct objects  §16.2.5  often provide several options for ﬂexibility. Con- sider class complex from §3.2.1.1:  class complex {  double re, im;  public:     default complex: {0,0}     ...  };  complex double r, double i  :re{r}, im{i} {} complex double r  :re{r}, im{0} {} complex   :re{0}, im{0} {}     constructcomplexfrom twoscalars    constructcomplexfrom one scalar  The actions of complex’s  constructors are quite trivial, but logically there is something odd about having three functions  here, constructors  doing essentially the same task. Also, for many classes,   Section 12.2.5  Default Arguments   325  constructors do more work and the repetitiveness is common. We could deal with the repetitiveness by considering one of the constructors ‘‘the real one’’ and forward to that  §17.4.3 :  complex double r, double i  :re{r}, im{i} {} complex double r  :complex{2,0} {} complex   :complex{0,0} {}     constructcomplexfrom twoscalars    constructcomplexfrom one scalar    default complex: {0,0}  Say  we  wanted  to  add  some  debugging,  tracing,  or  statistics-gathering  code  to complex; we now have a single place to do so. However, this can be abbreviated further:  complex double r ={}, double i ={}  :re{r}, im{i} {}     constructcomplexfrom twoscalars  This makes it clear that if a user supplies fewer than the two arguments needed, the default is used. The intent of having a single constructor plus some shorthand notation is now explicit.  A default argument is type checked at the time of the function declaration and evaluated at the  time of the call. For example:  class X { public:  static int def_arg; void f int =def_arg ;    ...  };  }  int X::def_arg = 7;  void g X& a  {     maybe f 7   a.f  ;  a.def_arg = 9; a.f  ;      f 9   Default arguments that can change value are most often best avoided because they introduce subtle context dependencies.  Default arguments may be provided for trailing arguments only. For example: int f int, int =0, char∗ =nullptr ;    OK int g int =0, int =0, char∗ ;  int h int =0, int, char∗ =nullptr ;      error    error  Note that the space between the ∗ and the = is signiﬁcant  ∗= is an assignment operator; §10.3 :  int nasty char∗=nullptr ;      syntax error  A default argument cannot be repeated or changed in a subsequent declaration in the same scope. For example:  void f int x = 7 ; void f int = 7 ; void f int = 8 ;     error :cannot repeat default argument    error :different default arguments   326   Functions  Chapter 12  void g   {  }  void f int x = 9 ;    ...     OK: this declaration hides the outer one  Declaring a name in a nested scope so that the name hides a declaration of the same name in an outer scope is error-prone.  12.3  Overloaded Functions Most often, it is a good idea to give different functions different names, but when different func- tions conceptually perform the same task on objects of different types, it can be more convenient to give them the same name. Using the same name for operations on different types is called over- loading. The technique is already used for the basic operations in C++. That is, there is only one name for addition, +, yet it can be used to add values of integer and ﬂoating-point types and combi- nations of such types. This idea is easily extended to functions deﬁned by the programmer. For example:  void print int ; void print const char∗ ;      printan int    printaC-style string  As far as the compiler is concerned, the only thing functions of the same name have in common is that name. Presumably, the functions are in some sense similar, but the language does not constrain or aid the programmer. Thus, overloaded function names are primarily a notational convenience. This convenience is signiﬁcant for functions with conventional names such as sqrt, print, and open. When  a  name  is  semantically  signiﬁcant,  this  convenience  becomes  essential. This  happens,  for example, with operators such as +, ∗, and <<, in the case of constructors  §16.2.5, §17.1 , and in generic programming  §4.5, Chapter 32 .  Templates provide a systematic way of deﬁning sets of overloaded functions  §23.5 .  12.3.1  Automatic Overload Resolution When  a  function fct is  called,  the  compiler  must  determine  which  of  the  functions  named fct to invoke. This is done by comparing the types of the actual arguments with the types of the parame- ters of all functions in scope called fct. The idea is to invoke the function that is the best match to the arguments and give a compile-time error if no function is the best match. For example:  void print double ; void print long ;  void f   {  }  print 1L ;  print 1.0 ;  print 1 ;      print long     print double     error,ambiguous: print long 1   or print double 1  ?   Section 12.3.1  Automatic Overload Resolution  327  To approximate our notions of what is reasonable, a series of criteria are tried in order:  [1]  Exact match; that is, match using no or only trivial conversions  for example, array name  to pointer, function name to pointer to function, and T to const T   [2]  Match using promotions; that is, integral promotions  bool to int, char to int, short to int,  and their unsigned counterparts; §10.5.1  and ﬂoat to double  [3]  Match using standard conversions  e.g., int to double, double to int, double to long double ,  Derived∗ to Base∗  §20.2 , T∗ to void∗  §7.2.1 , int to unsigned int  §10.5    [4]  Match using user-deﬁned conversions  e.g., double to complex ; §18.4  [5]  Match using the ellipsis ... in a function declaration  §12.2.4   If two matches are found at the highest level where a match is found, the call is rejected as ambigu- ous.  The resolution rules are this elaborate primarily to take into account the elaborate C and C++ rules for built-in numeric types  §10.5 . For example:  void print int ; void print const char∗ ; void print double ; void print long ; void print char ;  void h char c, int i, short s, ﬂoat f  {  print c ;  print i ;  print s ;  print f ;      exact match: invoke print char     exact match: invoke print int     integralpromotion: invoke print int     ﬂoat to double promotion: print double   print 'a' ;  print 49 ;  print 0 ;  print "a" ;  print nullptr ;      exact match: invoke print char     exact match: invoke print int     exact match: invoke print int     exact match: invoke print const char*     nullptr_t to const char* promotion: invoke print cost char*   }  The call print 0  invokes print int  because 0 is an int. The call print 'a'  invokes print char  because 'a' is a char  §6.2.3.2 .  The reason to distinguish between conversions and promotions is that we want to prefer safe promotions, such as char to int, over unsafe conversions, such as int to char. See also §12.3.5.  Overload resolution is independent of the order of declaration of the functions considered. Function templates are handled by applying the overload resolution rules to the result of spe- cialization based on a set of arguments  §23.5.3 . There are separate rules for overloading when a {}-list  is  used   initializer  lists  take priority;  §12.2.3,  §17.3.4.1   and  for  rvalue  reference  template arguments  §23.5.2.1 .  Overloading relies on a relatively complicated set of rules, and occasionally a programmer will be  surprised  which  function  is  called. So,  why bother?  Consider the  alternative  to overloading. Often, we need similar operations performed on objects of several types. Without overloading, we must deﬁne several functions with different names:   328   Functions  Chapter 12  void print_int int ; void print_char char ; void print_string const char∗ ;      C-style string  void g int i, char c, const char∗ p, double d  {  print_int i ;  print_char c ;  print_string p ;      OK    OK    OK  print_int c ;  print_char i ;  print_string i ;  print_int d ;      OK? calls print_int int c  , prints a number    OK? calls print_char char i  , narrowing    error    OK? calls print_int int d  , narrowing  }  }  Compared to the overloaded print  , we hav e to remember several names and remember to use those correctly. This can be tedious, defeats attempts to do generic programming  §4.5 , and generally encourages the programmer to focus on relatively low-level type issues. Because there is no over- loading, all standard conversions apply to arguments to these functions. It can also lead to errors. In  the  previous  example,  this  implies  that  only  one  of  the  four  calls  with  doubtful  semantics  is caught  by  the  compiler. In particular, two  calls  rely  on  error-prone  narrowing   §2.2.2,  §10.5 . Thus,  overloading  can  increase  the  chances  that  an  unsuitable  argument  will  be  rejected  by  the compiler.  12.3.2  Overloading and Return Type Return types are not considered in overload resolution. The reason is to keep resolution for an indi- vidual operator  §18.2.1, §18.2.5  or function call context-independent.  Consider:  ﬂoat sqrt ﬂoat ; double sqrt double ;  void f double da, ﬂoat ﬂa  {  ﬂoat ﬂ = sqrt da ;     call sqrt double  double d = sqrt da ;    call sqrt double  ﬂ = sqr t ﬂa ; d = sqr t ﬂa ;     call sqrt ﬂoat     call sqrt ﬂoat   If the return type were taken into account, it would no longer be possible to look at a call of sqrt   in isolation and determine which function was called.  12.3.3  Overloading and Scope Overloading takes place among the members of an overload set. By default, that means the func- tions of a single scope; functions declared in different non-namespace scopes do not overload.  For example:   Section 12.3.3  Overloading and Scope  329  Clearly, f int  would have been the best match for f 1 , but only f double  is in scope. In such cases, local  declarations  can  be  added  or  subtracted  to  get  the  desired  behavior. As always,  intentional hiding can be a useful technique, but unintentional hiding is a source of surprises.  A base  class  and  a  derived class  provide  different  scopes  so  that  overloading  between  a  base  class function and a derived class function doesn’t happen by default.  For example:  void f int ;  void g   {  void f double ; f 1 ;      call f double   struct Base {  void f int ;  struct Derived : Base {  void f double ;  void g Derived& d  {  d.f 1 ;      call Derived::f double ;  }  };  };  }  }  When overloading across class scopes  §20.3.5  or namespace scopes  §14.4.5  is wanted, using- declarations or using-directives can be used  §14.2.2 . Argument-dependent lookup  §14.2.4  can also lead to overloading across namespaces.  12.3.4  Resolution for Multiple Arguments We can use the overload resolution rules to select the most appropriate function when the efﬁciency or precision of computations differs signiﬁcantly among types. For example:  int pow int, int ; double pow double , double ; complex pow double , complex ; complex pow complex, int ; complex pow complex, complex ;  void k complex z  {  int i = pow 2,2 ;  double d = pow 2.0,2.0 ;  complex z2 = pow 2,z ;  complex z3 = pow z,2 ;  complex z4 = pow z,z ;      invoke pow int,int     invoke pow double,double     invoke pow double,complex     invoke pow complex,int     invoke pow complex,complex    330   Functions  Chapter 12  In the process of choosing among overloaded functions with two or more arguments, a best match is found for each argument using the rules from §12.3. A function that is the best match for one argument and a better or equal match for all other arguments is called. If no such function exists, the call is rejected as ambiguous. For example:  double d = pow 2.0,2 ;      error :pow int 2.0 ,2  or pow 2.0,double 2  ?  The call is ambiguous because 2.0 is the best match for the ﬁrst argument of pow double ,double  and 2 is the best match for the second argument of pow int,int .  12.3.5  Manual Overload Resolution Declaring  too  few  or  too  many   overloaded  versions  of  a  function  can  lead  to  ambiguities. For example:  void g   {  }  void f1 char ; void f1 long ;  void f2 char∗ ; void f2 int∗ ;  void k int i  {  }  f1 i ;  f2 0 ;      ambiguous: f1 char  or f1 long ?    ambiguous: f2 char*  or f2 int* ?  Where possible, consider the set of overloaded versions of a function as a whole and see if it makes sense according to the semantics of the function. Often the problem can be solved by adding a ver- sion that resolves ambiguities. For example, adding  inline void f1 int n  { f1 long n  ; }  would resolve all ambiguities similar to f1 i  in favor of the larger type long int.  One can also add an explicit type conversion to resolve a speciﬁc call. For example: f2 static_cast  0  ;  However,  this is most often simply an ugly stopgap.  Soon another similar call will be made and have to be dealt with.  Some C++ novices get irritated by the ambiguity errors reported by the compiler. More experi-  enced programmers appreciate these error messages as useful indicators of design errors.  12.4  Pre- and Postconditions Every function has some expectations on its arguments.  Some of these expectations are expressed in the argument types, but others depend on the actual values passed and on relationships among   Section 12.4  Pre- and Postconditions   331  argument values.  The compiler and linker can ensure that arguments are of the right types, but it is up to the programmer to decide what to do about ‘‘bad’’ argument values.  We call logical criteria that are supposed to hold when a function is called preconditions, and logical criteria that are sup- posed to hold when a function returns its postconditions. For example:  int area int len, int wid   *  calculate the area of a rectangle  precondition: len and wid are positive  postcondition: the returnvalue is positive  *  {  }  return len∗wid;  postcondition: the returnvalue is the area of a rectange with sides len and wid  Here, the statements of the pre- and postconditions are longer than the function body. This may seem  excessive, but  the  information  provided  is  useful  to  the  implementer, to the  users  of area  , and to testers. For example, we learn that 0 and −12 are not considered valid arguments.  Further- more, we note that we could pass a couple of huge values without violating the precondition, but if len∗wid overﬂows either or both of the postconditions are not met.  What should we do about a call area numeric_limits ::max  ,2 ? [1]  [2]   Is it the caller’s task to avoid it? Yes, but what if the caller doesn’t? Is it the implementer’s task to avoid it? If so, how is an error to be handled?  There are several possible answers to these questions. It is easy for a caller to make a mistake and fail  to  establish  a  precondition. It  is  also  difﬁcult  for  an  implementer  to  cheaply, efﬁciently, and completely check preconditions. We  would like to rely on the caller to get the preconditions right, but we need a way to test for correctness. For now, just note that some pre- and postconditions are easy to check  e.g., len is positive and len∗wid is positive .  Others are semantic in nature and hard to test directly. For example, how do we test ‘‘the return value is the area of a rectangle with sides len and wid’’? This is a semantic constraint because we have to know the meaning of ‘‘area of a rectangle,’’  and just trying to multiply len and wid again with a precision that precluded overﬂow could be costly.  It seems that writing out the pre- and postconditions for area   uncovered a subtle problem with this very simple function. This is not uncommon. Writing out pre- and postconditions is a great design tool and provides good documentation. Mechanisms for documenting and enforcing condi- tions are discussed in §13.4.  If a function depends only on its arguments, its preconditions are on its arguments only. How- ev er, we hav e to be careful about functions that depend on non-local values  e.g., a member func- tion that depends on the state of its object . In essence, we have to consider every nonlocal value read as an implicit argument to a function. Similarly, the postcondition of a function without side effects simply states that a value is correctly computed, but if a function writes to nonlocal objects, its effect must be considered and documented.   332   Functions  Chapter 12  The writer of a function has several alternatives, including: [1]  Make sure that every input has a valid result  so that we don’t hav e a precondition . [2]  Assume that the precondition holds  rely on the caller not to make mistakes . [3]  Check that the precondition holds and throw an exception if it does not. [4]  Check that the precondition holds and terminate the program if it does not.  If a postconditon fails, there was either an unchecked precondition or a programming error. §13.4 discusses ways to represent alternative strategies for checking.  12.5  Pointer to Function Like a  data  object, the code generated for a function body is placed in memory somewhere, so it has  an  address. We  can  have  a  pointer  to  a  function  just  as  we  can  have  a  pointer  to  an  object. However,  for  a  variety  of  reasons  –  some  related  to  machine  architecture  and  others  to  system design – a pointer to function does not allow the code to be modiﬁed. There are only two things one can do to a function: call it and take its address. The pointer obtained by taking the address of a function can then be used to call the function. For example:  void error string s  {  * ...*  }  void  ∗efct  string ;      pointer to function taking a string argument and returning nothing  void f   {  }  }  void g   {  efct = &error;  efct "error" ;      efct points to error    call error through efct  The compiler will discover that efct is a pointer and call the function pointed to. That is, derefer- encing a pointer to function using ∗ is optional. Similarly, using & to get the address of a function is optional:  void  ∗f1  string  = &error;  void  ∗f2  string  = error;      OK: same as = error    OK: same as = &error  f1 "Vasa" ;   ∗f1  "Mary Rose" ;      OK: same as  *f1  "Vasa"     OK: as f1 "MaryRose"   Pointers to functions have  argument types declared just like the functions themselves.  In pointer assignments, the complete function type must match exactly. For example:  void  ∗pf  string ;  void f1 string ; int f2 string ; void f3 int∗ ;      pointer to void str ing     void str ing     int string     void int*    Pointer to Function  333  Section 12.5  void f   {  pf = &f1; pf = &f2; pf = &f3;     OK    error :bad returntype    error :bad argument type  pf "Hera" ;  pf 1 ;      OK    error :bad argument type  int i = pf "Zeus" ;     error :void assigned to int  }  }  The rules for argument passing are the same for calls directly to a function and for calls to a func- tion through a pointer.  You can convert a pointer to function to a different pointer-to-function type, but you must cast  the resulting pointer back to its original type or strange things may happen:  using P1 = int ∗  int∗ ; using P2 = void ∗  void ;  void f P1 pf  {  P2 pf2 = reinterpret_cast  pf  pf2  ;  P1 pf1 = reinterpret_cast  pf2 ; int x = 7; int y = pf1 &x ;    ...     likely serious problem    convert pf2 ‘‘backagain’’     OK  We  need the nastiest of casts, reinterpret_cast, to do conversion of pointer-to-function types. The reason is that the result of using a pointer to function of the wrong type is so unpredictable and sys- tem-dependent.  For  example,  in  the  example  above, the  called  function  may  write  to  the  object pointed to by its argument, but the call pf2   didn’t supply any argument!  Pointers  to  functions  provide  a  way  of  parameterizing  algorithms. Because  C  does  not  have function  objects   §3.4.3   or  lambda  expressions   §11.4 ,  pointers  to  functions  are  widely  used  as function arguments in C-style code. For example, we can provide the comparison operation needed by a sorting function as a pointer to function:  using CFT = int const void∗, const void∗ ;  void ssort void∗ base, siz e_t n, size_t sz, CFT cmp   *  Sor tthe "n" elements of vector "base" into increasing order using the comparison function pointed to by"cmp". The elements are of size"sz".  Shell sort Knuth, Vol3, pg84   *    {  }  };  };  }  334   Functions  Chapter 12  for  int gap=n 2; 0<gap; gap =2   for  int i=gap; i!=n; i++   for  int j=i−gap; 0<=j; j−=gap  {  char∗ b = static_cast  base ;  char∗ pj = b+j∗sz;  char∗ pjg = b+ j+gap ∗sz;  if  cmp pjg,pj <0  {  for  int k=0; k!=sz; k++  {     necessar ycast     &base[j]    &base[j+gap]     swapbase[j] and base[j+gap]:  char temp = pj[k]; pj[k] = pjg[k]; pjg[k] = temp;  }  }  }  The ssort   routine does not know the type of the objects it sorts, only the number of elements  the array size , the size of each element, and the function to call to perform a comparison. The type of ssort   was chosen to be the same as the type of the standard C library sort routine, qsort  . Real programs use qsort  , the C++ standard-library algorithm sort  §32.6 , or a specialized sort routine. This style of code is common in C, but it is not the most elegant way of expressing this algorithm in C++  see §23.5, §25.3.4.1 .  Such a sort function could be used to sort a table such as this:  struct User {  const char∗ name; const char∗ id; int dept;  vector  heads = {  "dmr", "Ritchie D.M.",  "ravi",  "Sethi R.", "Szymanski T.G.",  "tgs", "nls",  "Schr yer N.L.", "Schr yer N.L.", "nls",  "Kernighan B.W.",  "bwk",  11271, 11272, 11273, 11274, 11275, 11276  void print_id vector & v  {  for  auto& x : v   cout << x.name << '\t' << x.id << '\t' << x.dept << '\n';  To  be able to sort, we must ﬁrst deﬁne appropriate comparison functions. A comparison function must return a negative value if its ﬁrst argument is less than the second, zero if the arguments are equal, and a positive number otherwise:   Section 12.5  Pointer to Function  335  int cmp1 const void∗ p, const void∗ q   {     Compare name strings  return strcmp static_cast  p −>name,static_cast  q −>name ;  int cmp2 const void∗ p, const void∗ q   {     Compare dept numbers  return static_cast  p −>dept − static_cast  q −>dept;  There is no implicit conversion of argument or return types when pointers to functions are assigned or initialized. This means that you cannot avoid the ugly and error-prone casts by writing:  int cmp3 const User∗ p, const User∗ q      Compare ids {  return strcmp p−>id,q−>id ;  The reason is that accepting cmp3 as an argument to ssort   would violate the guarantee that cmp3 will be called with arguments of type const User∗  see also §15.2.6 .  This program sorts and prints:  int main   {  cout << "Heads in alphabetical order:\n"; ssort heads,6,sizeof User ,cmp1 ; print_id heads ; cout << '\n';  cout << "Heads in order of department number:\n"; ssort heads,6,sizeof User ,cmp2 ; print_id heads ;  To compare, we can equivalently write:  int main   {  cout << "Heads in alphabetical order:\n"; sort heads.begin  , head.end  ,  [] const User& x, const User& y  { return x.name<y.name; }   ; print_id heads ; cout << '\n';   ; print_id heads ;  cout << "Heads in order of department number:\n"; sort heads.begin  , head.end  ,  [] const User& x, const User& y  { return x.dept<y.dept; }  }  }  }  }  }   336   Functions  Chapter 12  No mention of sizes is needed nor any helper functions. If the explicit use of begin   and end   is annoying, it can be eliminated by using a version of sort   that takes a container  §14.4.5 :  sort heads,[] const User& x, const User& y  { return x.name<y.name; } ;  You can take the address of an overloaded function by assigning to or initializing a pointer to func- tion.  In that case, the type of the target is used to select from the set of overloaded functions. For example:  void f int ; int f char ;  void  ∗pf1  int  = &f; int  ∗pf2  char  = &f; void  ∗pf3  char  = &f;     void f int     int f char     error :no void f char   It is also possible to take the address of member functions  §20.6 , but a pointer to member func- tion is quite different from a pointer to  nonmember  function.  A pointer to a noexcept function can be declared noexcept. For example:  void f int  noexcept; void g int ;  void  ∗p1  int  = f; void  ∗p2  int  noexcept = f; void  ∗p3  int  noexcept = g;     OK: but wethrowawayuseful infor mation    OK: wepreser vethe noexcept infor mation    error :we don’t knowthat g doesn’t throw  A pointer to function must reﬂect the linkage of a function  §15.2.6 . Neither linkage speciﬁcation nor noexcept may appear in type aliases:  using Pc = extern "C" void int ;  using Pn = void int  noexcept;      error :linkage speciﬁcation in alias    error :noexcept in alias  12.6  Macros Macros  are  very  important  in  C  but  have  far  fewer  uses  in  C++. The  ﬁrst  rule  about  macros  is: don’t use them unless you have to.  Almost ev ery macro demonstrates a ﬂaw in the programming language, in the program, or in the programmer. Because they rearrange the program text before the compiler proper sees it, macros are also a major problem for many programming support tools. So when you use macros, you should expect inferior service from tools such as debuggers, cross- reference tools, and proﬁlers. If you must use macros, please read the reference manual for your own implementation of the C++ preprocessor carefully and try not to be too clever.  Also, to warn readers, follow the convention to name macros using lots of capital letters. The syntax of macros is presented in §iso.16.3.  I recommend  using  macros  only  for  conditional  compilation   §12.6.1   and  in  particular  for  include guards  §15.3.3 .  A simple macro is deﬁned like this:  deﬁne NAME rest of line   Section 12.6  Macros   337  Where NAME is encountered as a token, it is replaced by rest of line. For example:  named = NAME  will expand into  named = rest of line  A macro can also be deﬁned to take arguments.  For example:  deﬁne MAC x,y  argument1: x argument2: y  When MAC is used, two argument strings must be presented. They will replace x and y when MAC   is expanded.  For example:  expanded = MAC foo bar, yuk yuk   will be expanded into  expanded = argument1: foo bar argument2: yuk yuk  Macro names cannot be overloaded, and the macro preprocessor cannot handle recursive calls:  deﬁne PRINT a,b  cout<< a << b  deﬁne PRINT a,b,c  cout<< a << b << c    * trouble?: redeﬁnes,does not overload*   deﬁne FAC n   n>1 ?n∗FA C n−1 :1    * trouble: recursivemacro*   Macros  manipulate  character  strings  and  know little  about  C++  syntax  and  nothing  about  C++ types or scope rules. Only the expanded form of a macro is seen by the compiler, so an error in a macro  will  be  reported  when  the  macro  is  expanded,  not  when  it  is  deﬁned. This  leads  to  very obscure error messages.  Here are some plausible macros:  deﬁne CASE break;case deﬁne FOREVER for ;;   Here are some completely unnecessary macros:  deﬁne PI 3.141593 deﬁne BEGIN { deﬁne END }  Here are some dangerous macros:  deﬁne SQUARE a  a∗a deﬁne INCR_xx  xx ++  To see why they are dangerous, try expanding this:  int xx = 0;     global counter  void f int xx  {  }  int y = SQUARE xx+2 ;  INCR_xx;      y=xx+2*xx+2; that is,y=xx+ 2*xx +2    increments argument xx  not the global xx    338   Functions  Chapter 12  If  you  must  use  a  macro,  use  the  scope  resolution  operator, ::, when  referring  to  global  names  §6.3.4  and enclose occurrences of a macro argument name in parentheses whenever possible.  For example:  deﬁne MIN a,b     a < b  ? a : b    This handles the simpler syntax problems  which are often caught by compilers , but not the prob- lems with side effects.  For example:  int x = 1; int y = 10; int z = MIN x++,y++ ;     xbecomes 3; y becomes 11  If you must write macros complicated enough to require comments, it is wise to use  ∗ ∗  comments because old C preprocessors that do not know about    comments are sometimes used as part of C++ tools.  For example:  deﬁne M2 a  something a    * thoughtful comment*   Using macros, you can design your own private language. Even if you prefer this ‘‘enhanced lan- guage’’ to plain C++, it will be incomprehensible to most C++ programmers. Furthermore, the pre- processor is a very simple-minded macro processor. When you try to do something nontrivial, you are  likely  to  ﬁnd  it  either  impossible  or  unnecessarily  hard  to  do. The auto, constexpr, const, decltype, enum,  inline, lambda  expressions, namespace, and template mechanisms  can  be  used  as better-behaved alternatives to many traditional uses of preprocessor constructs. For example:  const int answer = 42;  template  inline const T& min const T& a, const T& b  {  return  a<b ?a:b;  }  deﬁne NAME2 a,b  ab  int NAME2 hack,cah   ;  will produce  int hackcah  ;  deﬁne printx x  cout << x " = " << x << '\n';  int a = 7; string str = "asdf";  When writing a macro, it is not unusual to need a new name for something. A string can be created by concatenating two strings using the  macro operator. For example:  A single  before a parameter name in a replacement string means a string containing the macro argument.  For example:   Macros   339  Section 12.6  void f   {  }  The directive  undef X  printx a ;  printx str ;      cout << "a" << " = " << a << '\n';    cout << "str" << " = " << str << '\n';  Writing x " = " rather than x << " = " is obscure ‘‘clever code’’ rather than an error. Adjacent string literals are concatenated  §7.3.2 .  ensures  that  no  macro  called X is  deﬁned  –  whether  or  not  one  was  before  the  directive. This affords some protection against undesired macros. However, it is not always easy to know what the effects of X on a piece of code were supposed to be.  The argument list  ‘‘replacement list’’  of a macro can be empty:  deﬁne EMPTY   std::cout<<"empty\n" EMPTY  ;  EMPTY;     print"empty\n"    error :macro replacement list missing  I hav e a hard  time  thinking  of  uses  of  an  empty  macro  argument  list  that  are  not  error-prone  or malicious.  Macros can even be variadic.  For example:  deﬁne err_print ...  fprintf stderr,"error: %s %d\n", __VA_ARGS__  err_print "The answer",54 ;  The ellipsis  ...  means that __VA_ARGS__ represents the arguments actually passed as a string, so the output is:  error: The answer 54  12.6.1  Conditional Compilation One use of macros is almost impossible to avoid.  The directive  ifdef IDENTIFIER  does nothing if IDENTIFIER is deﬁned, but if it is not, the directive  causes all input to be ignored until a endif directive is seen.  For example:  int f int a ifdef arg_two ,int b endif  ;  int f int a  ;  Unless a macro called arg_two has been deﬁned , this produces:  This example confuses tools that assume sane behavior from the programmer.   340   Functions  Chapter 12  Most uses of ifdef are less bizarre, and when used with restraint, ifdef and its complement ifn-  def do little harm. See also §15.3.3.  with ordinary identiﬁers. For example:  Names of the macros used to control ifdef should be chosen carefully so that they don’t clash  struct Call_info {  Node∗ arg_one; Node∗ arg_two;    ...  };  deﬁne arg_two x  This innocent-looking source text will cause some confusion should someone write:  Unfortunately, common and unavoidable headers contain many dangerous and unnecessary macros.  12.6.2  Predeﬁned Macros A few macros are predeﬁned by the compiler  §iso.16.8, §iso.8.4.1 :   cid:129    cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   __cplusplus: deﬁned in a C++ compilation  and not in a C compilation . Its value is 201103L in a C++11 program; previous C++ standards have lower values. __DATE__: date in ‘‘yyyy:mm:dd’’ format. __TIME__: time in ‘‘hh:mm:ss’’ format. __FILE__: name of current source ﬁle. __LINE__: source line number within the current source ﬁle. __FUNC__: an implementation-deﬁned C-style string naming the current function. __STDC_HOSTED__: 1 if the implementation is hosted  §6.1.1 ; otherwise 0.  In addition, a few macros are conditionally deﬁned by the implementation:  __STDC__: deﬁned in a C compilation  and not in a C++ compilation  __STDC_MB_MIGHT_NEQ_WC__: 1 if,  in  the  encoding  for wchar_t, a member  of  the  basic character set  §6.1  might have a code value that differs from its value as an ordinary charac- ter literal __STDCPP_STRICT_POINTER_SAFETY__: 1 if  the  implementation  has  strict  pointer  safety  §34.5 ; otherwise undeﬁned. __STDCPP_THREADS__: 1 if a program can have more than one thread of execution; other- wise undeﬁned.  For example:  cout << __FUNC__ << "   in ﬁle " << __FILE__ << " on line " << __LINE__ << "\n";  In  addition,  most  C++  implementations  allow a user  to  deﬁne  arbitrary  macros  on  the  command line or in some other form of compile-time environment.  For example, NDEBUG is deﬁned unless the  compilation  is  done  in   some  implementation-speciﬁc   ‘‘debug  mode’’ and  is  used  by  the assert   macro  §13.4 . This can be useful, but it does imply that you can’t be sure of the meaning of a program just by reading its source text.   Section 12.6.3  Pragmas   341  12.6.3  Pragmas Implementations  often  provide  facilities  that  differ  from  or  go  beyond  what  the  standard  offers. Obviously, the standard cannot specify how such facilities are provided, but one standard syntax is a line of tokens preﬁxed with the preprocessor directive pragma. For example:  pragma foo bar 666 foobar  If possible, pragmas are best avoided.  ‘‘Package’’ meaningful operations as carefully named functions; §12.1.  12.7  Advice [1]  [2]  A function should perform a single logical operation; §12.1.

For effective  error handling, the language mechanisms must be used based on a strategy. Consequently, this chapter presents the exception- safety guarantees that are central to recovery from run-time errors and the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization  RAII  technique for resource management using constructors and destructors. Both the exception-safety guarantees and RAII depend on the speciﬁcation of invariants, so mechanisms for enforcement of assertions are presented.  The language facilities and techniques presented here address problems related to the handling  of errors in software; the handling of asynchronous events is a different topic.   344  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  The discussion of errors focuses on errors that cannot be handled locally  within a single small function , so that they require separation of error-handling activities into different parts of a pro- gram.  Such parts of a program are often separately developed.  Consequently, I often refer to a part of a program that is invoked to perform a task as ‘‘a library.’’ A library is just ordinary code, but in the context of a discussion of error handling it is worth remembering that a library designer often cannot even know what kind of programs the library will become part of:   cid:129  The  author  of  a  library  can  detect  a  run-time  error  but  does  not  in  general  have  any  idea  what to do about it.   cid:129  The user of a library may know how to cope with a run-time error but cannot easily detect it   or else it would have been handled in the user’s code and not left for the library to ﬁnd .  The discussion of exceptions focuses on problems that need to be handled in long-running systems, systems with stringent reliability requirements, and libraries. Different kinds of programs have dif- ferent requirements, and the amount of care and effort we expend should reﬂect that. For example, I would  not  apply  every  technique  recommended  here  to  a  two-page  program  written  just  for myself.  However, many of the techniques presented here simplify code, so I would use those.  13.1.1  Exceptions The  notion  of  an exception is  provided  to  help  get  information  from  the  point  where  an  error  is detected to a point where it can be handled. A function that cannot cope with a problem throws an exception, hoping that its  direct or indirect  caller can handle the problem. A function that wants to handle a kind of problem indicates that by catching the corresponding exception  §2.4.3.1 :   cid:129  A calling component indicates the kinds of failures that it is willing to handle by specifying  those exceptions in a catch-clause of a try-block.   cid:129  A called  component  that  cannot  complete  its  assigned  task  reports  its  failure  to  do  so  by  throwing an exception using a throw-expression.  Consider a simpliﬁed and stylized example:  void taskmaster   {  try {  auto result = do_task  ;    use result  } catch  Some_error  {     failure to do_task: handle problem  }  int do_task   {  }  }     ... if   * could perfor mthe task*    return result;  else  throw Some_error{};   Section 13.1.1  Exceptions   345  The taskmaster   asks do_task   to do a job. If do_task   can do that job and return a correct result, all is ﬁne. Otherwise, do_task   must report a failure by throwing some exception.  The taskmaster   is prepared to handle a Some_error, but some other kind of exception may be thrown.  For example, do_task   may call other functions to do a lot of subtasks, and one of those may throw because it can’t do its  assigned  subtask. An  exception  different  from Some_error indicates  a  failure  of taskmaster   to do its job and must be handled by whatever code invoked taskmaster  .  A called function cannot just return with an indication that an error happened. If the program is to continue working  and not just print an error message and terminate , the returning function must leave the program in a good state and not leak any resources.  The exception-handling mechanism is integrated with the constructor destructor mechanisms and the concurrency mechanisms to help ensure that  §5.2 . The exception-handling mechanism:   cid:129   Is an alternative to the traditional techniques when they are insufﬁcient, inelegant, or error- prone Is complete; it can be used to handle all errors detected by ordinary code   cid:129   cid:129  Allows  the  programmer  to  explicitly  separate  error-handling  code  from  ‘‘ordinary  code,’’  thus making the program more readable and more amenable to tools   cid:129  Supports a more regular style of error handling, thus simplifying cooperation between sepa-  rately written program fragments  An exception is an object thrown to represent the occurrence of an error. It can be of any type that can be copied, but it is strongly recommended to use only user-deﬁned types speciﬁcally deﬁned for  that  purpose. That  way, we minimize  the  chances  of  two unrelated  libraries  using  the  same value, say 17, to represent different errors, thereby throwing our recovery code into chaos.  An  exception  is  caught  by  code  that  has  expressed  interest  in  handling  a  particular  type  of exception   a catch-clause .  Thus, the  simplest  way  of  deﬁning  an  exception  is  to  deﬁne  a  class speciﬁcally for a kind of error and throw that.  For example:  struct Range_error {};  void f int n  {  }  if  n<0  max<n  throw Rang e_error {};    ...  If that gets tedious, the standard library deﬁnes a small hierarchy of exception classes  §13.5.2 .  An exception can carry information about the error it represents. Its type represents the kind of error, and whatever data it holds represents the particular occurrence of that error. For example, the standard-library exceptions contain a string value, which can be used to transmit information such as the location of the throw  §13.5.2 .  13.1.2  Traditional Error Handling Consider the alternatives to exceptions for a function detecting a problem that cannot be handled locally   e.g.,  an  out-of-range  access   so  that  an  error  must  be  reported  to  a  caller. Each  conven- tional approach has problems, and none are general:   346  Exception Handling   Chapter 13   cid:129  Terminate the program. This is a pretty drastic approach. For example:  if  something_wrong  exit 1 ;  For most errors, we can and must do better. For example, in most situations we should at least write out a decent error message or log the error before terminating. In particular, a library that doesn’t know about the purpose and general strategy of the program in which it is embedded cannot simply exit   or abort  . A library that unconditionally terminates cannot be used in a program that cannot afford to crash.   cid:129  Return  an  error  value. This  is  not  always  feasible  because  there  is  often  no  acceptable  ‘‘error value.’’  For example:  int get_int  ;      get next integer from input  For this input function, every int is a possible result, so there can be no integer value repre- senting an input failure.  At a minimum, we would have to modify get_int   to return a pair of values.  Even where this approach is feasible, it is often inconvenient because every call must be checked for the error value.  This can easily double the size of a program  §13.1.7 . Also,  callers  often  ignore  the  possibility  of  errors  or  simply  forget  to  test  a  return  value. Consequently, this  approach  is  rarely  used  systematically  enough  to  detect  all  errors. For example, printf    §43.3  returns a negative value if an output or encoding error occurred, but programmers  essentially  never test  for  that. Finally, some  operations  simply  do  not  have return values; a constructor is the obvious example.   cid:129  Return a legal value and leave the program in an ‘‘error state.’ ’ This has the problem that the  calling  function  may  not  notice  that  the  program  has  been  put  in  an  error  state. For example,  many standard  C  library  functions  set  the  nonlocal  variable errno to  indicate  an error  §43.4, §40.3 :  double d = sqrt −1.0 ;  Here, the value of d is meaningless and errno is set to indicate that −1.0 isn’t an acceptable argument for a ﬂoating-point square root function. However,  programs typically fail to set and test errno and similar nonlocal state consistently enough to avoid consequential errors caused by values returned from failed calls. Furthermore, the use of nonlocal variables for recording error conditions doesn’t work well in the presence of concurrency.   cid:129  Call an error-handler function. For example:  if  something_wrong  something_handler  ;     and possibly continue here  This must be some other approach in disguise because the problem immediately becomes ‘‘What does the error-handling function do?’’ Unless the error-handling function can com- pletely  resolve the  problem,  the  error-handling  function  must  in  turn  either  terminate  the program, return with some indication that an error had occurred, set an error state, or throw an exception.  Also, if the error-handling function can handle the problem without bothering the ultimate caller, why do we consider it an error?  Traditionally, an unsystematic combination of these approached co-exists in a program.   Section 13.1.3  Muddling Through   347  13.1.3  Muddling Through One aspect of the exception-handling scheme that will appear novel to some programmers is that the ultimate response to an unhandled error  an uncaught exception  is to terminate the program. The traditional response has been to muddle through and hope for the best. Thus, exception han- dling makes programs more ‘‘brittle’’ in the sense that more care and effort must be taken to get a program to run acceptably. This is preferable, though, to getting wrong results later in the develop- ment process – or after the development process is considered complete and the program is handed over to innocent users. Where termination is unacceptable, we can catch all exceptions  §13.5.2.2 . Thus, an exception terminates a program only if a programmer allows it to terminate. Typically, this  is  preferable  to  the  unconditional  termination  that  happens  when  a  traditional  incomplete recovery leads to a catastrophic error. Where termination is an acceptable response, an uncaught exception will achieve that because it turns into a call of terminate    §13.5.2.5 .  Also, a noexcept speciﬁer  §13.5.1.1  can make that desire explicit.  Sometimes, people try to alleviate the unattractive  aspects of ‘‘muddling through’’ by writing out error messages, putting up dialog boxes asking the user for help, etc. Such approaches are pri- marily useful in debugging situations in which the user is a programmer familiar with the structure of the program. In the hands of nondevelopers, a library that asks the  possibly absent  user opera- tor  for  help  is  unacceptable. A good  library  doesn’t ‘‘blabber’’ in this  way. If a user  has  to  be informed, an exception handler can compose a suitable message  e.g., in Finnish for Finnish users or in XML for an error-logging system . Exceptions provide a way for code that detects a problem from which it cannot recover to pass the problem on to a part of the system that might be able to recover.  Only a part of the system that has some idea of the context in which the program runs has any chance of composing a meaningful error message.  Please recognize that error handling will remain a difﬁcult task and that the exception-handling mechanism – although more formalized than the techniques it replaces – is still relatively unstruc- tured compared with language features involving only local control ﬂow.  The C++ exception-han- dling mechanism provides the programmer with a way of handling errors where they are most natu- rally handled, given the structure of a system. Exceptions make the complexity of error handling visible.  However,  exceptions  are  not  the  cause  of  that  complexity. Be careful  not  to  blame  the messenger for bad news.  13.1.4  Alternative Views of Exceptions ‘‘Exception’’ is one of those words that means different things to different people. The C++ excep- tion-handling mechanism is designed to support handling of errors that cannot be handled locally  ‘‘exceptional conditions’’ .  In particular, it is intended to support error handling in programs com- posed of independently developed components. Given that there is nothing particularly exceptional about  a  part  of  a  program  being  unable  to  perform  its  given task,  the  word  ‘‘exception’’ may  be considered a bit misleading. Can an event that happens most times a program is run be considered exceptional?  Can an event that is planned for and handled be considered an error? The answer to both questions is ‘‘yes.’’  ‘‘Exceptional’’ does not mean ‘‘almost never happens’’ or ‘‘disastrous.’’   348  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  13.1.4.1  Asynchronous Events  The mechanism is designed to handle only synchronous exceptions, such as array range checks and I O errors. Asynchronous events, such as keyboard interrupts and power failures, are not necessar- ily  exceptional  and  are  not  handled  directly  by  this  mechanism. Asynchronous  events  require mechanisms fundamentally different from exceptions  as deﬁned here  to handle them cleanly and efﬁciently. Many systems offer mechanisms, such as signals, to deal with asynchrony, but because these tend to be system-dependent, they are not described here.  13.1.4.2  Exceptions That Are Not Errors  Think of an exception as meaning ‘‘some part of the system couldn’t do what it was asked to do’’  §13.1.1, §13.2 .  Exception throws should be infrequent compared to function calls or the structure of the system has  been  obscured. However,  we should  expect  most  large  programs  to throw and catch at  least some exceptions in the course of a normal and successful run.  If an exception is expected and caught so that it has no bad effects on the behavior of the pro- gram, then how can it be an error? Only because the programmer thinks of it as an error and of the exception-handling mechanisms as tools for handling errors. Alternatively, one might think of the exception-handling mechanisms as simply another control structure, an alternative way of returning a value to a caller. Consider a binary tree search function:  void fnd Tree∗ p, const string& s  {  if  s == p−>str  throw p; if  p−>left  fnd p−>left,s ; if  p−>right  fnd p−>right,s ;     found s  }  }  Tree∗ ﬁnd Tree∗ p, const string& s  {  try {  fnd p,s ;  } catch  Tree∗ q  {  return q;  } return 0;     q->str==s  This actually has some charm, but it should be avoided because it is likely to cause confusion and inefﬁciencies.  When at  all  possible,  stick  to  the  ‘‘exception  handling  is  error  handling’’ view. When this is done, code is clearly separated into two categories: ordinary code and error-handling code.  This makes code more comprehensible. Furthermore, the implementations of the exception mechanisms  are  optimized  based  on  the  assumption  that  this  simple  model  underlies  the  use  of exceptions.  Error handling is inherently difﬁcult.  Anything that helps preserve a clear model of what is an  error and how it is handled should be treasured.   Section 13.1.5  When You Can’t Use Exceptions  349  13.1.5  When You Can’t Use Exceptions Use of exceptions is the only fully general and systematic way of dealing with errors in a C++ pro- gram.  However, we must reluctantly conclude that there are programs that for practical and histori- cal reasons cannot use exceptions.  For example:   cid:129  A time-critical component of an embedded system where an operation must be guaranteed to complete in a speciﬁc maximum time. In the absence of tools that can accurately esti- mate the maximum time for an exception to propagate from a throw to a catch, alternative error-handling methods must be used.   cid:129  A large  old  program  in  which  resource  management  is  an  ad  hoc  mess   e.g.,  free  store  is unsystematically ‘‘managed’’ using ‘‘naked’’ pointers, news, and deletes , rather than relying on some systematic scheme, such as resource handles  e.g., string and vector; §4.2, §4.4 .  In  such  cases,  we  are  thrown  back  onto  ‘‘traditional’’  pre-exception   techniques. Because  such programs arise in a great variety of historical contexts and in response to a variety of constraints, I cannot give a general recommendation for how to handle them. However, I can point to two popu- lar techniques:   cid:129  To mimic RAII, give every class with a constructor an invalid   operation that returns some error_code. A useful convention is for error_code==0 to represent success. If the constructor fails to establish the class invariant, it ensures that no resource is leaked and invalid   returns a nonzero error_code. This solves the problem of how to get an error condition out of a con- structor. A user can then systematically test invalid   after each construction of an object and engage in suitable error handling in case of failure.  For example:   cid:129  To mimic a function either returning a value or throwing an exception, a function can return a pair   §5.4.3 .  A user  can  then  systematically  test  the error_code after each function call and engage in suitable error handling in case of failure.  For example:  void f int n  {  my_vector  x n ; if  x.invalid    {     ... deal with error ...  }    ...  }  }  void g int n  {  auto v = make_vector n ;    returnapair if  v.second  {     ... deal with error ...  } auto val = v.ﬁrst;    ...  Variations of this scheme have been reasonably successful, but they are clumsy compared to using exceptions in a systematic manner.   350  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  13.1.6  Hierarchical Error Handling The purpose of the exception-handling mechanisms is to provide a means for one part of a program to inform another part that a requested task could not be performed  that an ‘‘exceptional circum- stance’’ has been detected . The assumption is that the two parts of the program are written inde- pendently and that the part of the program that handles the exception often can do something sensi- ble about the error.  To  use handlers effectively in a program, we need an overall strategy. That is, the various parts of the program must agree on how exceptions are used and where errors are dealt with. The excep- tion-handling mechanisms are inherently nonlocal, so adherence to an overall strategy is essential. This implies that the error-handling strategy is best considered in the earliest phases of a design. It also implies that the strategy must be simple  relative to the complexity of the total program  and explicit.  Something complicated  would  not  be  consistently  adhered  to  in  an  area  as  inherently tricky as error recovery.  Successful fault-tolerant systems are multilevel.  Each level copes with as many errors as it can without  getting  too  contorted  and  leaves the  rest  to  higher  levels.  Exceptions support  that  view. Furthermore, terminate   supports this view by providing an escape if the exception-handling mech- anism  itself  is  corrupted  or  if  it  has  been  incompletely  used,  thus  leaving  exceptions  uncaught. Similarly, noexcept provides a simple escape for errors where trying to recover seems infeasible.  Not every function should be a ﬁrewall.  That is, not every function can test its preconditions well enough to ensure that no errors could possibly stop it from meeting its postcondition. The rea- sons that this will not work vary from program to program and from programmer to programmer. However, for larger programs:  [1]  The amount of work needed to ensure this notion of ‘‘reliability’’ is too great to be done  consistently.  [2]  The overhead in time and space is too great for the system to run acceptably  there will be  a tendency to check for the same errors, such as invalid arguments, over and over again .  [3]  Functions written in other languages won’t obey the rules. [4]  This purely local notion of ‘‘reliability’’ leads to complexities that actually become a bur-  den to overall system reliability.  However,  separating the program into distinct subsystems that either complete successfully or fail in well-deﬁned ways is essential, feasible, and economical. Thus, major libraries, subsystems, and key interface functions should be designed in this way. Furthermore, in most systems, it is feasible to  design  every  function  to  ensure  that  it  always  either  completes  successfully  or  fails  in  a  well- deﬁned manner.  Usually, we don’t hav e the luxury of designing all of the code of a system from scratch. There- fore,  to  impose  a  general  error-handling  strategy  on  all  parts  of  a  program,  we  must  take into account program fragments implemented using strategies different from ours. To  do this we must address a variety of concerns relating to the way a program fragment manages resources and the state in which it leaves the system after an error. The aim is to have the program fragment appear to follow the general error-handling strategy even if it internally follows a different strategy.  Occasionally, it is necessary to convert from one style of error reporting to another. For exam- ple, we might check errno and possibly throw an exception after a call to a C library or, conversely, catch an exception and set errno before returning to a C program from a C++ library:   Section 13.1.6  Hierarchical Error Handling  351     Call a C function from C++; convert err noto a throw  void callC   {  errno = 0; c_function  ; if  errno  {     ... local cleanup,ifpossible and necessary... throw C_blewit errno ;     Call a C++ function from C; convert a throwtoerr no  extern "C" void call_from_C   noexcept  {  c_plus_plus_function  ;  try {  } catch  ...  {     ... local cleanup,ifpossible and necessary... errno = E_CPLPLFCTBLEWIT;  In such cases, it is important to be systematic enough to ensure that the conversion of error-report- ing styles is complete. Unfortunately, such conversions are often most desirable in ‘‘messy code’’ without a clear error-handling strategy and therefore difﬁcult to be systematic about.  Error  handling  should  be  –  as  far  as  possible  –  hierarchical. If  a  function  detects  a  run-time error, it should not ask its caller for help with recovery or resource acquisition. Such requests set up  cycles  in  the  system  dependencies. That  in  turn  makes  the  program  hard  to  understand  and introduces the possibility of inﬁnite loops in the error-handling and recovery code.  13.1.7  Exceptions and Efﬁciency In principle, exception handling can be implemented so that there is no run-time overhead when no exception is thrown.  In addition, this can be done so that throwing an exception isn’t all that expen- sive compared to calling a function. Doing so without adding signiﬁcant memory overhead while maintaining  compatibility  with  C  calling  sequences,  debugger  conventions,  etc.,  is  possible,  but hard.  However,  please  remember  that  the  alternatives to exceptions  are  not  free  either. It is not unusual to ﬁnd traditional systems in which half of the code is devoted to error handling.  Consider a simple function f   that appears to have nothing to do with exception handling:  }  }  }  }  }  void f   {  string buf; cin>>buf;    ... g 1 ; h buf ;   352  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  However, g   or h   may throw an exception, so f   must contain code ensuring that buf is destroyed correctly in case of an exception.  Had g   not thrown an exception, it would have had to report its error some other way. Conse- quently, the comparable code using ordinary code to handle errors instead of exceptions isn’t the plain code above, but something like:  bool g int ; bool h const char∗ ; char∗ read_long_string  ;  bool f   {  char∗ s = read_long_string  ;    ... if  g 1   {  if  h s   {  free s ; return true;  } else {  free s ; return false;  }  } else {  free s ; return false;  }  }  Using a local buffer for s would simplify the code by eliminating the calls to free  , but then we’d have range-checking code instead. Complexity tends to move around rather than just disappear.  People don’t usually handle errors this systematically, though, and it is not always critical to do so.  However,  when  careful  and  systematic  handling  of  errors  is  necessary, such  housekeeping  is best left to a computer, that is, to the exception-handling mechanisms.  The noexcept speciﬁer  §13.5.1.1  can be most helpful in improving generated code. Consider:  void g int  noexcept; void h const string&  noexcept;  Now, the code generated for f   can possibly be improved.  No traditional C function throws an exception, so most C functions can be declared noexcept. In  particular, a standard-library  implementer  knows  that  only  a  few standard  C  library  functions  such as atexit   and qsort    can throw, and can take advantage of that fact to generate better code.  Before declaring a ‘‘C function’’ noexcept, take a minute to consider if it could possibly throw an exception.  For example, it might have been converted to use the C++ operator new, which can throw bad_alloc, or it might call a C++ library that throws an exception.  As ever, discussions about efﬁciency are meaningless in the absence of measurements.   Section 13.2  Exception Guarantees  353  13.2  Exception Guarantees To  recover from an error – that is, to catch an exception and continue executing a program – we need to know what can be assumed about the state of the program before and after the attempted recovery action. Only then can recovery be meaningful. Therefore, we call an operation exception- safe if that operation leaves the program in a valid state when the operation is terminated by throw- ing an exception.  However, for that to be meaningful and useful, we have to be precise about what we  mean  by  ‘‘valid  state.’’  For  practical  design  using  exceptions,  we  must  also  break  down  the overly general ‘‘exception-safe’’ notion into a few speciﬁc guarantees.  When reasoning about objects, we assume that a class has a class invariant  §2.4.3.2, §17.2.1 . We  assume that this invariant is established by its constructor and maintained by all functions with access to the object’s representation until the object is destroyed.  So, by valid state we mean that a constructor  has  completed  and  the  destructor  has  not  yet  been  entered. For data  that  isn’t easily viewed as an object, we must reason similarly. That is, if two pieces of nonlocal data are assumed to have a speciﬁc relationship, we must consider that an invariant and our recovery action must pre- serve it.  For example:  namespace Points { vector  vx; vector  vy;  };      vx[i],vy[i]  is a point for all i  Here it is assumed that vx.size  ==vy.siz e   is  always  true. However, that was only stated in a com- ment, and compilers do not read comments. Such implicit invariants can be very hard to discover and maintain.  Before a throw, a function must place all constructed objects in valid states. However,  such a valid state may be one that doesn’t suit the caller. For example, a string may be left as the empty string or a container may be left unsorted. Thus, for complete recovery, an error handler may have to produce values that are more appropriate desirable for the application than the  valid  ones exist- ing at the entry to a catch-clause.  The  C++  standard  library  provides  a  generally  useful  conceptual  framework  for  design  for exception-safe  program  components. The  library  provides  one  of  the  following  guarantees  for ev ery library operation:   cid:129  The basic  guarantee for all operations: The basic invariants of all objects are maintained, and no resources, such as memory, are leaked.  In particular, the basic invariants of every built-in  and  standard-library  type  guarantee  that  you  can  destroy an object  or  assign  to  it after every standard-library operation  §iso.17.6.3.1 .   cid:129  The strong guarantee for key operations: in addition to providing the basic guarantee, either the  operation  succeeds,  or  it  has  no  effect.  This  guarantee  is  provided  for  key  operations, such as push_back  , single-element insert   on a list, and uninitialized_copy  .   cid:129  The nothrow  guarantee for  some  operations:  in  addition  to  providing  the  basic  guarantee, some operations are guaranteed not to throw an exception. This guarantee is provided for a few simple operations, such as swap   of two containers and pop_back  .   354  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  Both the basic guarantee and the strong guarantee are provided on the condition that   cid:129    cid:129   cid:129   user-supplied operations  such as assignments and swap   functions  do not leave container elements in invalid states, user-supplied operations do not leak resources, and destructors do not throw exceptions  §iso.17.6.5.12 .  Violating a standard-library requirement, such as having a destructor exit by throwing an exception, is  logically  equivalent  to  violating  a  fundamental  language  rule,  such  as  dereferencing  a  null pointer. The practical effects are also equivalent and often disastrous.  Both the basic guarantee and the strong guarantee require the absence of resource leaks. This is necessary for every system that cannot afford resource leaks. In particular, an operation that throws an exception must not only leave its operands in well-deﬁned states but must also ensure that every resource that it acquired is  eventually  released. For example, at the point where an exception is thrown, all memory allocated must be either deallocated or owned by some object, which in turn must ensure that the memory is properly deallocated. For example:  void f int i  {  int∗ p = new int[10];    ... if  i<0  {  delete[] p; throw Bad  ;  }    ...  }     delete before the throworleak  Remember that memory isn’t the only kind of resource that can leak. I consider anything that has to  be  acquired  from  another  part  of  the  system  and   explicitly  or  implicitly   given back  to  be  a resource.  Files, locks,  network  connections,  and  threads  are  examples  of  system  resources. A function may have to release those or hand them over to some resource handler before throwing an exception.  The C++ language rules for partial construction and destruction ensure that exceptions thrown while  constructing  subobjects  and  members  will  be  handled  correctly  without  special  attention from standard-library code  §17.2.3 . This rule is an essential underpinning for all techniques deal- ing with exceptions.  In  general,  we  must  assume  that  every  function  that  can  throw an exception  will  throw one. This implies that we must structure our code so that we don’t get lost in a rat’s nest of complicated control  structures  and  brittle  data  structures. When  analyzing  code  for  potential  errors,  simple, highly structured, ‘‘stylized’’ code is the ideal; §13.6 includes a realistic example of such code.  13.3  Resource Management When a function acquires a resource – that is, it opens a ﬁle, allocates some memory from the free store,  acquires  a  mutex,  etc.  –  it  is  often  essential  for  the  future  running  of  the  system  that  the resource be properly released. Often that ‘‘proper release’’ is achieved by having the function that acquired it release it before returning to its caller. For example:   Section 13.3  Resource Management  355  void use_ﬁle const char∗ fn   {  FILE∗ f = fopen fn,"r" ;     naivecode     ... use f ...  fclose f ;  This  looks  plausible  until  you  realize  that  if  something  goes  wrong  after  the  call  of fopen   and before  the  call  of fclose  , an exception  may  cause use_ﬁle   to  be  exited  without fclose   being called.  Exactly the same problem can occur in languages that do not support exception handling. For example, the standard C library function longjmp   can cause the same problem. Even an ordi- nary return-statement could exit use_ﬁle without closing f.  A ﬁrst attempt to make use_ﬁle   fault-tolerant looks like this: void use_ﬁle const char∗ fn   {     clumsy code  FILE∗ f = fopen fn,"r" ; try {     ... use f ...  } catch  ...  {  fclose f ; throw;  } fclose f ;     catch every possible exception  The code using the ﬁle is enclosed in a try-block that catches every exception, closes the ﬁle, and rethrows the exception.  The problem with this solution is that it is verbose, tedious, and potentially expensive. Worse still, such code becomes signiﬁcantly more complex when several resources must be acquired and released.  Fortunately, there is a more elegant solution. The general form of the problem looks like this:  }  }  }  void acquire   {     acquire resource 1    ...    acquire resource n     ... use resources ...     release resource n    ...    release resource 1  It is typically important that resources are released in the reverse order of their acquisition. This   356  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  strongly resembles the behavior of local objects created by constructors and destroyed by destruc- tors.  Thus, we can handle such resource acquisition and release problems using objects of classes with constructors and destructors. For example, we can deﬁne a class File_ptr that acts like a FILE∗:  class File_ptr { FILE∗ p;  public:  File_ptr const char∗ n, const char∗ a       open ﬁle n  : p{fopen n,a }  if  p==nullptr  throw runtime_error{"File_ptr: Can't open ﬁle"};  File_ptr const string& n, const char∗ a      open ﬁle n  :File_ptr{n.c_str  ,a}  explicit File_ptr FILE∗ pp    :p{pp}     assume ownership of pp  if  p==nullptr  throw runtime_error "File_ptr: nullptr"};  {  }  {  }  { }     ... suitable move and copyoperations ...  ˜File_ptr   { fclose p ; }  operator FILE∗   { return p; }  };  }  void use_ﬁle const char∗ fn  {  File_ptr f fn,"r" ;    ... use f ...  We can construct a File_ptr given either a FILE∗ or the arguments required for fopen  . In either case, a File_ptr will  be  destroyed  at  the  end  of  its  scope  and  its  destructor  will  close  the  ﬁle. File_ptr throws an exception if it cannot open a ﬁle because otherwise every operation on the ﬁle handle would have to test for nullptr. Our function now shrinks to this minimum:  The  destructor  will  be  called  independently  of  whether  the  function  is  exited  normally  or  exited because an exception is thrown.  That is, the exception-handling mechanisms enable us to remove the  error-handling  code  from  the  main  algorithm. The  resulting  code  is  simpler  and  less  error- prone than its traditional counterpart.  This technique for managing resources using local objects is usually referred to as ‘‘Resource Acquisition Is Initialization’’  RAII; §5.2 . This is a general technique that relies on the properties of constructors and destructors and their interaction with exception handling.   Section 13.3  Resource Management  357  It is often suggested that writing a ‘‘handle class’’  a RAII class  is tedious so that providing a nicer  syntax  for  the catch ...  action  would  provide  a  better  solution. The  problem  with  that approach is that you need to remember to ‘‘catch and correct’’ the problem wherever a resource is acquired  in  an  undisciplined  way   typically  dozens  or  hundreds  of  places  in  a  large  program , whereas the handler class need be written only once.  An object is not considered constructed until its constructor has completed. Then and only then will stack unwinding  §13.5.1  call the destructor for the object. An object composed of subobjects is constructed to the extent that its subobjects have been constructed. An array is constructed to the extent that its elements have been constructed  and only fully constructed elements are destroyed during unwinding .  A constructor tries to ensure that its object is completely and correctly constructed. When that cannot be achieved, a well-written constructor restores – as far as possible – the state of the system to what it was before creation. Ideally, a well-designed constructor always achieves one of these alternatives and  doesn’t leave  its  object  in  some  ‘‘half-constructed’’ state.  This can  be  simply achieved by applying the RAII technique to the members.  Consider a class X for which a constructor needs to acquire two resources: a ﬁle x and a mutex y  §5.3.4 .  This acquisition  might  fail  and  throw an exception.  Class X’s  constructor  must  never complete having acquired the ﬁle but not the mutex  or the mutex and not the ﬁle, or neither . Fur- thermore,  this  should  be  achieved without  imposing  a  burden  of  complexity  on  the  programmer. We  use  objects  of  two classes, File_ptr and std::unique_lock  §5.3.4 ,  to  represent  the  acquired resources.  The acquisition of a resource is represented by the initialization of the local object that represents the resource:  class Locked_ﬁle_handle {  File_ptr p; unique_lock  lck;  public:  X const char∗ ﬁle, mutex& m   : p{ﬁle ,"rw"}, lck{m}      acquire ‘‘ﬁle’’    acquire ‘‘m’’  {}    ...  };  Now, as in the local object case, the implementation takes care of all of the bookkeeping.  The user doesn’t hav e to keep track at all. For example, if an exception occurs after p has been constructed but before lck has been, then the destructor for p but not for lck will be invoked.  This implies that where this simple model for acquisition of resources is adhered to, the author  of the constructor need not write explicit exception-handling code.  The most common resource is memory, and string, vector, and the other standard containers use RAII  to  implicitly  manage  acquisition  and  release. Compared  to  ad  hoc  memory  management using new  and possibly also delete , this saves lots of work and avoids lots of errors.  When a pointer to an object, rather than a local object, is needed, consider using the standard-  library types unique_ptr and shared_ptr  §5.2.1, §34.3  to avoid leaks.   358  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  13.3.1  Finally The discipline required to represent a resource as an object of a class with a destructor have both- ered some. Again and again, people have inv ented ‘‘ﬁnally’’ language constructs for writing arbi- trary code to clean up after an exception.  Such techniques are generally inferior to RAII because they are ad hoc, but if you really want ad hoc, RAII can supply that also. First, we deﬁne a class that will execute an arbitrary action from its destructor.  The ‘‘ﬁnally action’’ is provided as an argument to the constructor.  Next, we deﬁne a function that conveniently deduces the type of an action:  template  struct Final_action {  Final_action F f : clean{f} {} ˜Final_action   { clean  ; } F clean;  template  Final_action  ﬁnally F f  {  return Final_action  f ;  Finally, we can test ﬁnally  :  void test    };  }  {     handle undiciplined resource acquisition    demonstrate that arbitrar yactions are possible  int∗ p = new int{7};  int∗ buf =  int∗ malloc 100∗sizeof int  ;     probably should use a unique_ptr  §5.2     C-style allocation  auto act1 = ﬁnally [&]{  delete p; free buf ;  cout<< "Goodby, Cruel world!\n";     C-style deallocation  }   ;  int var = 0; cout << "var = " << var << '\n';     nested block: {  var = 1; auto act2 = ﬁnally [&]{ cout<< "ﬁnally!\n"; var=7; } ; cout << "var = " << var << '\n';  }    act2 is invokedhere  cout << "var = " << var << '\n';  }    act1 is invokedhere   Section 13.3.1  This produced:  var = 0 var = 1 ﬁnally! var = 7 Goodby, Cruel world!  Finally   359  In addition, the memory allocated and pointed to by p and buf is appropriately deleted and free  d.  It is generally a good idea to place a guard close to the deﬁnition of whatever it is guarding. That way, we can at a glance see what is considered a resource  even if ad hoc  and what is to be done at the end of its scope. The connection between ﬁnally   actions and the resources they manip- ulate is still ad hoc and implicit compared to the use of RAII for resource handles, but using ﬁnally   is far better than scattering cleanup code around in a block.  Basically, ﬁnally   does for a block what the increment part of a for-statement does for the for- statement  §9.5.2 : it speciﬁes the ﬁnal action at the top of a block where it is easy to be seen and where it logically belongs from a speciﬁcation point of view.  It says what is to be done upon exit from  a  scope,  saving  the  programmer  from  trying  to  write  code  at  each  of  the  potentially  many places from which the thread of control might exit the scope.  13.4  Enforcing Invariants When a precondition for a function  §12.4  isn’t met, the function cannot correctly perform its task. Similarly, when a constructor cannot establish its class invariant  §2.4.3.2, §17.2.1 , the object is not usable. In those cases, I typically throw exceptions.  However,  there are programs for which throwing an exception is not an option  §13.1.5 , and there are people with different views of how to deal with the failure of a precondition  and similar conditions :   cid:129   Just don’t do that: It is the caller’s job to meet preconditions, and if the caller doesn’t do that,  let  bad  results  occur  –  eventually  those  errors  will  be  eliminated  from  the  system through improved design, debugging, and testing.   cid:129  Terminate the program: Violating a precondition is a serious design error, and the program must  not  proceed  in  the  presence  of  such  errors. Hopefully, the  total  system  can  recover from the failure of one component  that program  – eventually such failures may be elimi- nated from the system through improved design, debugging, and testing.  Why would anyone choose one of these alternatives?  The ﬁrst approach often relates to the need for  performance:  systematically  checking  preconditions  can  lead  to  repeated  tests  of  logically unnecessary  conditions   for  example,  if  a  caller  has  correctly  validated  data,  millions  of  tests  in thousands of called functions may be logically redundant . The cost in performance can be signiﬁ- cant.  It may  be  worthwhile  to  suffer  repeated  crashes  during  testing  to  gain  that  performance. Obviously, this assumes that you eventually get all critical precondition violations out of the sys- tem.  For  some  systems,  typically  systems  completely  under  the  control  of  a  single  organization, that can be a realistic aim.  The second approach tends to be used in systems where complete and timely recovery from a precondition  failure  is  considered  infeasible. That  is,  making  sure  that  recovery  is  complete imposes  unacceptable  complexity  on  the  system  design  and  implementation. On  the  other  hand,   360  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  termination of a program is considered acceptable. For example, it is not unreasonable to consider program termination acceptable if it is easy to rerun the program with inputs and parameters that make repeated failure unlikely. Some distributed systems are like this  as long as the program that terminates is only a part of the complete system , and so are many of the small programs we write for our own consumption.  Realistically, many systems use a mix of exceptions and these two alternative approaches.  All three share a common view that preconditions should be deﬁned and obeyed; what differs is how enforcement is done and whether recovery is considered feasible. Program structure can be radi- cally different depending on whether  localized  recovery is an aim. In most systems, some excep- tions are thrown without real expectation of recovery. For example, I often throw an exception to ensure some error logging or to produce a decent error message before terminating or re-initializing a process  e.g., from a catch ...  in main   .  A variety of techniques are used to express checks of desired conditions and invariants.  When we want to be neutral about the logical reason for the check, we typically use the word assertion, often abbreviated to an assert. An assertion is simply a logical expression that is assumed to be true. Howev er, for an assertion to be more than a comment, we need a way of expressing what hap- pens  if  it  is false. Looking  at  a  variety  of  systems,  I  see  a  variety  of  needs  when  it  comes  to expressing assertions:   cid:129  We need to choose between compile-time asserts  evaluated by the compiler  and run-time  asserts  evaluated at run time .   cid:129  For run-time asserts we need a choice of throw, terminate, or ignore.  cid:129  No code should be generated unless some logical condition is true. For example, some run- time asserts should not be evaluated unless the logical condition is true. Usually, the logical condition  is  something  like a debug  ﬂag,  a  level of checking,  or  a  mask  to  select  among asserts to enforce.   cid:129  Asserts should not be verbose or complicated to write  because they can be very common .  Not every system has a need for or supports every alternative.  The standard offers two simple mechanisms:  cid:129   In  , the standard library provides the assert A  macro, which checks its assertion, A, at run time if and only if the macro NDEBUG  ‘‘not debugging’’  is not deﬁned  §12.6.2 . If the assertion fails, the compiler writes out an error message containing the  failed  assertion, the source ﬁle name, and the source ﬁle line number and terminates the program.   cid:129  The language provides static_assert A,message , which unconditionally checks its assertion, A, at compile time  §2.4.3.3 . If the assertion fails, the compiler writes out the message and the compilation fails.  Where assert   and static_assert   are  insufﬁcient,  we  could  use  ordinary  code  for  checking. For example:  void f int n      nshould be in [1:max   {  }     ...  if  2<debug_level &&  n<=0  max<n   throw Asser t_error "rang e problem" ;   Section 13.4  Enforcing Invariants   361  However, using such ‘‘ordinary code’’ tends to obscure what is being tested. Are we:  cid:129  Evaluating the conditions under which we test?  Yes, the 2<debug_level part.   cid:129  Evaluating a condition that is expected to be true for some calls and not for others?  No, because we are throwing an exception – unless someone is trying to use exceptions as sim- ply another return mechanism; §13.1.4.2.    cid:129  Checking a precondition which should never fail?   Yes, the exception is simply our chosen  response.   Worse, the precondition testing  or invariant testing  can easily get dispersed in other code and thus be harder to spot and easier to get wrong. What we would like is a recognizable mechanism for checking  assertions. What  follows  here  is  a   possibly  slightly  overelaborate   mechanism  for expressing a variety of assertions and a variety of responses to failures.  First, I deﬁne mechanisms for deciding when to test and deciding what to do if an assertion fails:  namespace Assert {  enum class Mode { throw_, terminate_, ignore_ }; constexpr Mode current_mode = CURRENT_MODE; constexpr int current_level = CURRENT_LEVEL; constexpr int default_level = 1;  constexpr bool level int n   { return n<=current_level; }  struct Error : runtime_error {  Error const string& p  :runtime_error p  {}  };     ...  }  The idea is to test whenever an assertion has a ‘‘level’’ lower than or equal to current_level. If an assertion fails, current_mode is used to choose among three alternatives.  The current_level and cur- rent_mode are constants because the idea is to generate no code whatsoever for an assertion unless we have made a decision to do so. Imagine CURRENT_MODE and CURRENT_LEVEL to be set in the build environment for a program, possibly as compiler options.  The programmer will use Assert::dynamic   to make assertions:  namespace Assert {     ...  string compose const char∗ ﬁle, int line, const string& message      compose message including ﬁle name and line number  {  }  ostringstream os  " " ; os << ﬁle << "," << line << " :" << message; return os.str  ;   362  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  template  void dynamic bool assertion, const string& message ="Asser t::dynamic failed"  {  if  assertion  return;  if  current_mode == Assert_mode::throw_   throw Except{message};  if  current_mode == Assert_mode::terminate_   std::terminate  ;  template  void dynamic  bool, const string&  { }     do nothing  void dynamic bool b, const string& s  {  dynamic  b,s ;     default action  void dynamic bool b  {  dynamic  b ;     default message  I chose the name Assert::dynamic  meaning ‘‘evaluate at run time’’  to contrast with static_assert  meaning ‘‘evaluate at compile time’’; §2.4.3.3 .  Further  implementation  trickery  could  be  used  to  minimize  the  amount  of  code  generated. Alternatively, we could do more of the testing at run time if more ﬂexibility is needed. This Assert is  not  part  of  the  standard  and  is  presented  primarily  as  an  illustration  of  the  problems  and  the implementation techniques. I suspect that the demands on an assertion mechanism vary too much for a single one to be used everywhere.  We can use Assert::dynamic like this:  void f int n      nshould be in [1:max   Assert::dynamic     n<=0  max<n , Assert::compose __FILE__,__LINE__,"rang e problem" ;     ...  The __FILE__ and __LINE__ are macros that expand at their point of appearance in the source code  §12.6.2 .  I can’t hide  them  from  the  user’s view by placing  them  inside  the  implementation  of Assert where they belong.  Assert::Error is the default exception, so we need not mention it explicitly. Similarly, if we are  willing to use the default assertion level, we don’t need to mention the level explicitly:  }  }  }  }  {  }   Section 13.4  Enforcing Invariants   363  Assert::dynamic  n<=0  max<n ,Assert::compose __FILE__,__LINE__,"rang e problem" ;    ...  I do not  recommend  obsessing  about  the  amount  of  text  needed  to  express  an  assertion,  but  by using a namespace directive  §14.2.3  and the default message, we can get to a minimum:  void f int n      nshould be in [1:max   void f int n      nshould be in [1:max   dynamic n<=0max<n ;    ...  {  }  {  }  It is possible to control the testing done and the response to testing through build options  e.g., con- trolling conditional compilation  and or through options in the program code. That way, you can have a debug version of a system that tests extensively and enters the debugger and a production version that does hardly any testing.  I personally favor leaving at least some tests in the ﬁnal  shipping  version of a program. For example, with Assert the obvious convention is that assertions marked as level zero will always be checked.  We nev er ﬁnd the last bug in a large program under continuous development and mainte- nance.  Also, ev en if all else works perfectly, having a few ‘‘sanity checks’’ left to deal with hard- ware failures can be wise.  Only the builder of the ﬁnal complete system can decide whether a failure is acceptable or not. The  writer  of  a  library  or  reusable  component  usually  does  not  have  the  luxury  of  terminating unconditionally. I interpret that to mean that for general library code, reporting an error – prefer- ably by throwing an exception – is essential.  As usual, destructors should not throw, so don’t use a throwing Assert   in a destructor.  13.5  Throwing and Catching Exceptions This section presents exceptions from a language-technical point of view.  13.5.1  Throwing Exceptions We can throw an exception of any type that can be copied or moved.  For example:  No_copy const No_copy&  = delete;     prohibit copying  §17.6.4   class No_copy {  };  };  class My_error {     ...   364  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  throw My_error{};  throw No_copy{};  throw My_error;      OK    error :can’t copyaNo_copy    error :My_error is a type,rather than an object  The exception object caught  §13.5.2  is in principle a copy of the one thrown  though an optimizer is allowed to minimize copying ; that is, a throw x; initializes a temporary variable of x’s type with x. This temporary may be further copied several times before it is caught: the exception is passed  back  from called function to calling function until a suitable handler is found. The type of the exception is used to select a handler in the catch-clause of some try-block.  The data in the excep- tion object – if any – is typically used to produce error messages or to help recovery. The process of passing the exception ‘‘up the stack’’ from the point of throw to a handler is called stack unwind- ing. In each scope exited, the destructors are invoked so that every fully constructed object is prop- erly destroyed.  For example:  void f int n  {  switch  n  { case 0: case 1: case 2: }  }  }  }  }  void f   {  void g   {  }  }  string name {"Byron"}; try {  string s = "in"; g  ;  } catch  My_error  {     ...  string s = "excess"; {  string s = "or"; h  ;  void h   {  string s = "not"; throw My_error{}; string s2 = "at all";  After the throw in h  , all the strings that were constructed are destroyed in the reverse order of their construction: "not", "or", "excess", "in", but not "at all", which the thread of control never reached, and not "Byron", which was unaffected.   Section 13.5.1  Throwing Exceptions  365  Because an exception is potentially copied several times before it is caught, we don’t usually put huge amounts of data in it. Exceptions containing a few words are very common. The seman- tics of exception propagation are those of initialization, so objects of types with move semantics  e.g., strings  are not expensive to throw.  Some of the most common exceptions carry no informa- tion; the name of the type is sufﬁcient to report the error. For example:  There  is  a  small  standard-library  hierarchy of exception  types   §13.5.2   that  can  be  used  either directly or as base classes. For example:  struct My_error2 : std::runtime_error {  const char∗ what   const noexcept { return "My_error2"; }  The standard-library exception classes, such as runtime_error and out_of_range, take a string argu- ment as a constructor argument and have a virtual function what   that will regurgitate that string. For example:  struct Some_error { };  void fct   {     ... if  something_wrong   throw Some_error{};  }  };  }  }     throwsome exception  throw std::runtime_error{"I give up!"};  throw My_error2{};     see what exception g   throws  void g int n  {  if  n   else  void f int n  {  try {  void g n ;  } catch  std::exception& e  {  cerr << e.what   << '\n';  }  13.5.1.1 noexcept Functions  Some functions don’t throw exceptions and some really shouldn’t.  To indicate that, we can declare such a function noexcept. For example:  double compute double  noexcept;    maynot throwanexception   366  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  Now no exception will come out of compute  .  Declaring a function noexcept can be most valuable for a programmer reasoning about a pro- gram and for a compiler optimizing a program. The programmer need not worry about providing try-clauses  for dealing with failures in a noexcept function  and an optimizer need not worry about control paths from exception handling.  However, noexcept is not completely checked by the compiler and linker. What happens if the programmer ‘‘lied’’ so that a noexcept function deliberately or accidentally threw an exception that wasn’t caught before leaving the noexcept function?  Consider:  double compute double x  noexcept; {  string s = "Courtney and Anya"; vector  tmp 10 ;    ...  }  }  The vector constructor may fail to acquire memory for its ten doubles and throw a std::bad_alloc. In that  case,  the  program  terminates. It  terminates  unconditionally  by  invoking std::terminate    §30.4.1.3 .  It does  not  invoke  destructors  from  calling  functions. It  is  implementation-deﬁned whether destructors from scopes between the throw and the noexcept  e.g., for s in compute    are invoked.  The program is just about to terminate, so we should not depend on any object anyway. By adding a noexcept speciﬁer, we indicate that our code was not written to cope with a throw.  13.5.1.2  The noexcept Operator  It is possible to declare a function to be conditionally noexcept. For example:  template  void my_fct T& x  noexcept Is_pod    ;  The noexcept Is_pod     means that My_fct may not throw if the predicate Is_pod    is true but may throw if it is false. I may want to write this if my_fct   copies its argument.  I know that copy- ing a POD does not throw, whereas other types  e.g., a string or a vector  may.  The predicate in a noexcept   speciﬁcation must be a constant expression.  Plain noexcept means  noexcept true .  The standard library provides many type predicates that can be useful for expressing the condi-  tions under which a function may throw an exception  §35.4 .  What  if  the  predicate  we  want  to  use  isn’t easily  expressed  using  type  predicates  only?  For example, what if the critical operation that may or may not throw is a function call f x ? The noex- cept   operator takes an expression as its argument and returns true if the compiler ‘‘knows’’ that it cannot throw and false otherwise.  For example:  template  void call_f vector & v  noexcept noexcept f v[0]   {  for  auto x : v   f x ;   Section 13.5.1.2  The noexcept Operator   367  The double mention of noexcept looks a bit odd, but noexcept is not a common operator.  The operand of noexcept   is not evaluated, so in the example we do not get a run-time error if  we pass call_f   with an empty vector.  A noexcept expr  operator does not go to heroic lengths to determine whether expr can throw; it simply looks at every operation in expr and if they all have noexcept speciﬁcations that evaluate to true, it returns true. A noexcept expr  does not look inside deﬁnitions of operations used in expr.  Conditional noexcept speciﬁcations  and  the noexcept   operator  are  common  and  important  in  standard-library operations that apply to containers. For example  §iso.20.2.2 :  template  void swap T  &a [N], T  &b [N]  noexcept noexcept swap ∗a, ∗b   ;  13.5.1.3  Exception Speciﬁcations  In older C++ code, you may ﬁnd exception speciﬁcations. For example:  void f int  throw Bad,Worse ;     mayonly throwBad or Worse exceptions void g int  throw  ;      maynot throw  An empty exception speciﬁcation throw   is deﬁned to be equivalent to noexcept  §13.5.1.1 .  That is, if an exception is thrown, the program terminates.  The  meaning  of  a  nonempty  exception  speciﬁcation,  such  as throw Bad,Worse , is that  if  the function  here f    throws any exception that is not mentioned in the list or publicly derived from an exception mentioned there, an unexpected handler is called. The default effect of an unexpected exception is to terminate the program  §30.4.1.3 . A nonempty throw speciﬁcation is hard to use well  and  implies  potentially  expensive  run-time  checks  to  determine  if  the  right  exception  is thrown.  This feature has not been a success and is deprecated. Don’t use it.  If you want to dynamically check which exceptions are thrown, use a try-block.  13.5.2  Catching Exceptions Consider:  throw E{};  } catch H  {     when do weget here?  void f   {  try {  }  }  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]   The handler is invoked:  If H is the same type as E If H is an unambiguous public base of E If H and E are pointer types and [1] or [2] holds for the types to which they refer If H is a reference and [1] or [2] holds for the type to which H refers  In addition, we can add const to the type used to catch an exception in the same way that we can   368  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  add  it  to  a  function  parameter. This  doesn’t change  the  set  of  exceptions  we  can  catch;  it  only restricts us from modifying the exception caught.  In principle, an exception is copied when it is thrown  §13.5 . The implementation may apply a wide variety of strategies for storing and transmitting exceptions.  It is guaranteed, however,  that there is sufﬁcient memory to allow new to throw the standard out-of-memory exception, bad_alloc  §11.2.3 .  Note the possibility of catching an exception by reference. Exception types are often deﬁned as part of class hierarchies to reﬂect relationships among the kinds of errors they represent.  For exam- ples, see §13.5.2.3 and §30.4.1.1. The technique of organizing exception classes into hierarchies is common enough for some programmers to prefer to catch every exception by reference.  The {} in both the try-part and a catch-clause of a try-block are real scopes. Consequently, if a name is to be used in both parts of a try-block or outside it, that name must be declared outside the try-block.  For example:  void g   {  int x1;  try {  int x2 = x1;    ...  } catch  Error  {  ++x1;  ++x2;  int x3 = 7;    ...  } catch ...  { ++x3;     ...  }     OK    error :x2 not in scope     error :x3 not in scope  ++x1;  ++x2;  ++x3;   }     OK    error :x2 not in scope    error :x3 not in scope  The ‘‘catch everything’’ clause, catch ... , is explained in §13.5.2.2.  13.5.2.1  Rethrow  Having caught an exception, it is common for a handler to decide that it can’t completely handle the  error. In that  case,  the  handler  typically  does  what  can  be  done  locally  and  then  throws  the exception again.  Thus, an error can be handled where it is most appropriate. This is the case even when the information needed to best handle the error is not available in a single place, so that the recovery action is best distributed over sev eral handlers. For example:   Rethrow   369  Section 13.5.2.1  void h   {  try {     ... code that might throwanexception ...  } catch  std::exception& err  {  if  can_handle_it_completely  {     ... handle it ... return;  } else {     ... do what can be done here ... throw;    rethrowthe exception  }  }  }  A rethrow is indicated by a throw without an operand. A rethrow may occur in a catch-clause or in a function  called  from  a catch-clause.  If a rethrow is attempted  when  there  is  no  exception  to rethrow, std::terminate    §13.5.2.5  will be called. A compiler can detect and warn about some, but not all, such cases.  The  exception  rethrown  is  the  original  exception  caught  and  not  just  the  part  of  it  that  was accessible as an exception. For example, had an out_of_range been thrown, h   would catch it as a plain exception, but throw; would still rethrow it as an out_of_range. Had I written throw err; instead of the simpler throw;, the exception would have  been sliced  §17.5.1.4  and h  ’s  caller could not have caught it as an out_of_range.  13.5.2.2  Catch Every Exception  In  , the standard library provides a small hierarchy of exception classes with a common base exception  §30.4.1.1 .  For example:  void m   {  try {  }  }     ... do something ...  } catch  std::exception& err  {     ... cleanup ... throw;     handle every standard-librar yexception  This  catches  every  standard-library  exception.  However,  the  standard-library  exceptions  are  just one set of exception types. Consequently, you cannot catch every exception by catching std::excep- tion. If someone  unwisely  threw an int or an exception from some application-speciﬁc hierarchy, it would not be caught by the handler for std::exception&.  However, we often need to deal with every kind of exception.  For example, if m   is supposed to leave some pointers in the state in which it found them, then we can write code in the handler to   370  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  give them acceptable values.  As for functions, the ellipsis, ..., indicates ‘‘any argument’’  §12.2.4 , so catch ...  means ‘‘catch any exception.’’  For example:  A try-block may have multiple catch-clauses  handlers . Because a derived exception can be caught by handlers for more than one exception type, the order in which the handlers are written in a try- statement is signiﬁcant. The handlers are tried in order. For example:  void m   {  try {  }  }     ... something ...  } catch  ...  {     ... cleanup ... throw;  13.5.2.3  Multiple Handlers     handle every exception  void f   {  try {     ...  } catch  ...  {  }  }  void g   {  try {     ...  } catch  ...  {  }  } catch  std::ios_base::failure  {  } catch  std::exception& e  {     ... handle anyiostream error  §30.4.1.1  ...     ... handle anystandard-librar yexception  §30.4.1.1  ...     ... handle anyother exception  §13.5.2.2  ...     ... handle every exception  §13.5.2.2  ...  } catch  std::exception& e  {     ...handle anystandard librar yexception  §30.4.1.1  ...  The compiler knows the class hierarchy, so it can warn about many logical mistakes.  For example:   Section 13.5.2.3  Multiple Handlers  371  catch  std::bad_cast  {     ... handle dynamic_cast failure  §22.2.1  ...  }  }  Here,  the exception is  never considered.  Even  if  we  removed the  ‘‘catch-all’’ handler, bad_cast wouldn’t be considered because it is derived from exception. Matching exception types to catch- clauses is a  fast  run-time operation and is not as general as  compile-time  overload resolution.  13.5.2.4  Function try-Blocks  The body of a function can be a try-block.  For example:  For most functions, all we gain from using a function try-block is a bit of notational convenience. However,  a try-block  allows  us  to  deal  with  exceptions  thrown  by  base-or-member  initializers  in constructors   §17.4 . By  default,  if  an  exception  is  thrown  in  a  base-or-member  initializer, the exception is passed on to whatever inv oked the constructor for the member’s class.  However,  the constructor itself can catch such exceptions by enclosing the complete function body – including the member initializer list – in a try-block.  For example:  int main   try {  } catch  ...} {  }     ... do something ...     ... handle exception ...  class X {  vector  vi; vector  vs;     ...  public:  X int,int ;    ...  };  {  }     ...     ...  X::X int sz1, int sz2  try  :vi sz1 ,  vs sz2 ,      constructvi with sz1 ints    constructvs with sz2 strings  } catch  std::exception& err  {    exceptions thrown for vi and vs are caught here   372  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  So, we can catch exceptions thrown by member constructors. Similarly, we can catch exceptions thrown by member destructors in a destructor  though a destructor should never throw .  However, we cannot ‘‘repair’’ the object and return normally as if the exception had not happened: an excep- tion from a member constructor means that the member may not be in a valid state. Also, other member objects will either not be constructed or already have had their destructors invoked as part of the stack unwinding.  The best we can do in a catch-clause of a function try-block for a constructor or destructor is to throw an exception.  The default action is to rethrow the original exception when we ‘‘fall off the end’’ of the catch-clause  §iso.15.3 .  There are no such restrictions for the try-block of an ordinary function.  13.5.2.5  Termination  There are cases where exception handling must be abandoned for less subtle error-handling tech- niques.  The guiding principles are:   cid:129  Don’t throw an exception while handling an exception.  cid:129  Don’t throw an exception that can’t be caught.  If the exception-handling implementation catches you doing either, it will terminate your program. If you managed to have two exceptions active at one time  in the same thread, which you can’t , the system would have no idea which of the exceptions to try to handle: your new one or the one it was already trying to handle. Note that an exception is considered handled immediately upon entry into a catch-clause.  Rethrowing an exception  §13.5.2.1  or throwing a new exception from within a catch-clause is considered a new throw done after the original exception has been handled. You can  throw an exception  from  within  a  destructor   even during  stack  unwinding   as  long  as  you catch it before it leaves the destructor.  The speciﬁc rules for calling terminate   are  §iso.15.5.1   cid:129  When no suitable handler was found for a thrown exception  cid:129  When a noexcept function tries to exit with a throw  cid:129  When a destructor invoked during stack unwinding tries to exit with a throw  cid:129  When code invoked to propagate an exception  e.g., a copy constructor  tries to exit with a  throw   cid:129  When someone tries to rethrow  throw;  when there is no current exception being handled  cid:129  When a destructor for a statically allocated or thread-local object tries to exit with a throw  cid:129  When an initializer for a statically allocated or thread-local object tries to exit with a throw  cid:129  When a function invoked as an atexit   function tries to exit with a throw  In such cases, the function std::terminate   is called. In addition, a user can call terminate   if less drastic approaches are infeasible.  By ‘‘tries to exit with a throw,’’ I mean that an exception is thrown somewhere and not caught so  that the run-time system tries to propagate it from a function to its caller.  By  default, terminate   will  call abort    §15.4.3 .  This default  is  the  correct  choice  for  most users  –  especially  during  debugging.  If that  is  not  acceptable,  the  user  can  provide  a terminate handler function by a call std::set_terminate   from  :   Section 13.5.2.5  Termination   373  using terminate_handler = void ∗   ;      from    [[noreturn]] void my_handler    {     handle termination myway     ater minatehandler cannot return  void dangerous    {     very!  terminate_handler old = set_terminate my_handler ;    ... set_terminate old ;     restore the old terminate handler  The return value is the previous function given to set_terminate  .  For example, a terminate handler could be used to abort a process or maybe to re-initialize a system.  The intent is for terminate   to be a drastic measure to be applied when the error recovery strategy  implemented  by  the  exception-handling  mechanism  has  failed  and  it  is  time  to  go  to another level of a fault tolerance strategy. If a terminate handler is entered, essentially nothing can be assumed about a program’s data structures; they must be assumed to be corrupted. Even writing an  error  message  using cerr must  be  assumed  to  be  hazardous. Also,  note  that  as dangerous   is written,  it  is  not  exception-safe.  A throw or  even a return before set_terminate old  will  leave my_handler in  place  when  it  wasn’t meant  to  be. If  you  must  mess  with terminate  , at least  use RAII  §13.3 .  A terminate handler cannot return to its caller. If it tries to, terminate   will call abort  . Note that abort   indicates abnormal exit from the program. The function exit   can be used to exit a program with a return value that indicates to the surrounding system whether the exit is nor- mal or abnormal  §15.4.3 .  It  is  implementation-deﬁned  whether  destructors  are  invoked when  a  program  is  terminated because  of  an  uncaught  exception.  On some  systems,  it  is  essential  that  the  destructors  are  not called  so  that  the  program  can  be  resumed  from  the  debugger. On other  systems,  it  is  architec- turally close to impossible not to invoke the destructors while searching for a handler.  If you want to ensure cleanup when an otherwise uncaught exception happens, you can add a catch-all handler  §13.5.2.2  to main   in addition to handlers for exceptions you really care about. For example:  int main   try {     ...  } catch  const My_error& err  {     ... handle myerror ...  } catch  const std::range_error&  {  cerr << "range error: Not again!\n";  }  }  }   374  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  catch  const std::bad_alloc&  {  cerr << "new ran out of memory\n";  } catch  ...  {     ...  }  This will catch every exception, except those thrown by construction and destruction of namespace and thread-local variables  §13.5.3 . There is no way of catching exceptions thrown during initial- ization  or  destruction  of  namespace  and  thread-local  variables.  This is  another  reason  to  avoid global variables whenever possible.  When an exception is caught, the exact point where it was thrown is generally not known.  This represents a loss of information compared to what a debugger might know about the state of a pro- gram.  In some C++ development environments, for some programs, and for some people, it might therefore be preferable not to catch exceptions from which the program isn’t designed to recover.  See Assert  §13.4   for  an  example  of  how one  might  encode  the  location  of  a throw into  the  thrown exception.  13.5.3  Exceptions and Threads If an exception is not caught on a thread  §5.3.1, §42.2 , std::terminate    §13.5.2.5  is called. So, if we don’t want an error in a thread to stop the whole program, we must catch all errors from which we would like to recover and somehow report them to a part of the program that is interested in the results of the thread. The ‘‘catch-all’’ construct catch ...   §13.5.2.2  comes in handy for that.  We  can  transfer  an  exception  thrown  on  one  thread  to  a  handler  on  another  thread  using  the  standard-library function current_exception    §30.4.1.2 .  For example:     ... do the wor k...  try {  } catch ...  {  }  prom.set_exception current_exception   ;  This is the basic technique used by packaged_task to handle exceptions from user code  §5.3.5.2 .  13.6  A vector Implementation The standard vector provides splendid examples of techniques for writing exception-safe code: its implementation illustrates problems that occur in many contexts and solutions that apply widely.  Obviously, a vector implementation relies on many language facilities provided to support the implementation and use of classes. If you are not  yet  comfortable with C++’s classes and tem- plates, you may prefer to delay studying this example until you have read Chapter 16, Chapter 25, and Chapter 26. However,  a  good understanding of the use of exceptions in C++ requires a more extensive example than the code fragments so far in this chapter.   Section 13.6  A vector Implementation   375  The basic tools available for writing exception-safe code are:  cid:129  The tr y-block  §13.5 .  cid:129  The support for the ‘‘Resource Acquisition Is Initialization’’ technique  §13.3 .  The general principles to follow are to   cid:129  Nev er let go of a piece of information before its replacement is ready for use.  cid:129  Always leave objects in valid states when throwing or rethrowing an exception.  That way, we can always back out of an error situation. The practical difﬁculty in following these principles  is  that  innocent-looking  operations   such  as <, =, and sor t    might  throw exceptions. Knowing what to look for in an application takes experience.  When  you  are  writing  a  library, the  ideal  is  to  aim  at  the  strong  exception-safety  guarantee  §13.2  and always to provide the basic guarantee. When writing a speciﬁc program, there may be less concern for exception safety. For example, if I write a simple data analysis program for my own use, I’m usually quite willing to have the program terminate in the unlikely event of memory exhaustion.  Correctness and basic exception safety are closely related. In particular, the techniques for pro- viding basic exception safety, such as deﬁning and checking invariants  §13.4 , are similar to the techniques that are useful to get a program small and correct. It follows that the overhead of pro- viding the basic exception-safety guarantee  §13.2  – or even the strong guarantee – can be minimal or even insigniﬁcant.  13.6.1  A Simple vector A typical implementation of vector  §4.4.1, §31.4  will consist of a handle holding pointers to the ﬁrst  element,  one-past-the-last  element,  and  one-past-the-last  allocated  space   §31.2.1    or  the equivalent information represented as a pointer plus offsets :  vector:  elem space last alloc  elements  extra space  In addition, it holds an allocator  here, alloc , from which the vector can acquire memory for its ele- ments.  The default allocator  §34.4.1  uses new and delete to acquire and release memory.  Here is a declaration of vector simpliﬁed to present only what is needed to discuss exception  safety and avoidance of resource leaks:  template > class vector { private:  T∗ elem;  T∗ space;  T∗ last;  A alloc;      star tof allocation    end of element sequence,star tof space allocated for possible expansion    end of allocated space    allocator   376  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  public:  using size_type = unsigned int;     type used for vector sizes  explicit vector size_type n, const T& val = T  , const A& = A   ;  vector const vector& a ; vector& operator= const vector& a ;     copyconstr uctor    copyassignment  vector vector&& a ; vector& operator= vector&& a ;     move constr uctor    move assignment  ˜vector  ;  size_type siz e   const { return space−elem; } size_type capacity   const { return last−elem; } void reserve siz e_type n ;      increase capacity to n  void resize siz e_type n, const T& = {} ; void push_back const T& ;     increase sizeton    add an element at the end     ...  };  {  }  Consider ﬁrst a naive implementation of the constructor that initializes a vector to n elements ini- tialized to val:  template  vector ::vector siz e_type n, const T& val, const A& a     warning: naiveimplementation  :alloc{a}      copythe allocator  elem = alloc.allocate n ; space = last = elem+n; for  T∗ p = elem; p!=last; ++p      get memoryfor elements  §34.4   a.construct p,val ;      constructcopyofval in *p  §34.4   There are two potential sources of exceptions here:  [1] [2]  allocate   may throw an exception if no memory is available. T’s copy constructor may throw an exception if it can’t copy val.  What about the copy of the allocator? We  can imagine that it throws, but the standard speciﬁcally requires that it does not do that  §iso.17.6.3.5 . Anyway, I hav e written the code so that it wouldn’t matter if it did.  In both cases of a throw, no vector object is created, so vector’s destructor is not called  §13.3 . When allocate   fails, the throw will exit before any resources are acquired, so all is well. When T’s  copy constructor fails, we have  acquired some memory that must be freed to avoid memory leaks. Worse still, the copy constructor for T might throw an exception after correctly con- structing a few elements but before constructing them all. These T objects may own resources that then would be leaked.   Section 13.6.1  A Simple vector  377  To  handle  this  problem,  we  could  keep  track  of  which  elements  have  been  constructed  and  destroy those  and only those  in case of an error:  template  vector ::vector siz e_type n, const T& val, const A& a     copythe allocator  :alloc{a}   {  elem = alloc.allocate n ;     get memoryfor elements     elaborate implementation  iterator p;  try {  iterator end = elem+n; for  p=elem; p!=end; ++p   last = space = p;  } catch  ...  {  alloc.construct p,val ;      constructelement  §34.4   for  iterator q = elem; q!=p; ++q   alloc.destroy q ;   alloc.deallocate elem,n ;  throw;     destroyconstr uctedelements    free memory    rethrow  }  }  Note that the declaration of p is outside the try-block; otherwise, we would not be able to access it in both the try-part and the catch-clause.  The overhead here is the overhead of the try-block.  In a good C++ implementation, this over- head is negligible compared to the cost of allocating memory and initializing elements. For imple- mentations where entering a try-block incurs a cost, it may be worthwhile to add a test if  n  before the try to explicitly handle the  very common  empty vector case.  The main part of this constructor is a repeat of the implementation of std::uninitialized_ﬁll  :  template  void uninitialized_ﬁll For beg, For end, const T& x  {  For p; try {  } catch  ...  {  }  }  for  p=beg; p!=end; ++p   ::new static_cast  &∗p   T x ;     constructcopyofxin*p §11.2.4   for  For q = beg; q!=p; ++q    &∗q −>˜T  ;   throw;     destroyelement  §11.2.4     rethrow §13.5.2.1   The curious construct &∗p takes care of iterators that are not pointers. In that case, we need to take the address of the element obtained by dereference to get a pointer. Together with the explicitly   378  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  global ::new, the explicit cast to void∗ ensures that the standard-library placement function  §17.2.4  is  used  to  invoke  the  constructor, and  not  some  user-deﬁned operator  new   for T∗s.  The calls  to alloc.construct   in the vector constructors are simply syntactic sugar for this placement new. Simi- larly, the alloc.destroy   call simply hides explicit destruction  like  &∗q −>˜T   .  This code is operat- ing at a rather low lev el where writing truly general code can be difﬁcult.  Fortunately, we don’t hav e to invent or implement uninitialized_ﬁll  , because the standard library provides it  §32.5.6 . It is often essential to have initialization operations that either complete suc- cessfully, having initialized every element, or fail, leaving no constructed elements behind. Conse- quently, the standard library provides uninitialized_ﬁll  , uninitialized_ﬁll_n  , and uninitialized_copy    §32.5.6 , which offer the strong guarantee  §13.2 .  The uninitialized_ﬁll   algorithm does not protect against exceptions thrown by element destruc- tors  or  iterator  operations   §32.5.6 . Doing  so  would  be  prohibitively  expensive  and  probably impossible.  The uninitialized_ﬁll   algorithm  can  be  applied  to  many kinds  of  sequences. Consequently, it takes a forward iterator  §33.1.2  and cannot guarantee to destroy elements in the reverse order of their construction.  Using uninitialized_ﬁll  , we can simplify our constructor:  template  vector ::vector siz e_type n, const T& val, const A& a   :alloc a       copythe allocator     still a bit messy  elem = alloc.allocate n ; try {     get memoryfor elements  uninitialized_ﬁll elem,elem+n,val ;     copyelements space = last = elem+n;  alloc.deallocate elem,n ;  throw;     free memory    rethrow  {  }  } catch  ...  {  }  This  is  a  signiﬁcant  improvement  on  the  ﬁrst  version  of  this  constructor, but  the  next  section demonstrates how to further simplify it.  The constructor rethrows a caught exception.  The intent is to make vector transparent to excep- tions so that the user can determine the exact cause of a problem. All standard-library containers have this property. Exception transparency is often the best policy for templates and other ‘‘thin’’ layers of software.  This is in contrast to major parts of a system  ‘‘modules’’  that generally need to take responsibility for all exceptions thrown.  That is, the implementer of such a module must be able to list every exception that the module can throw.  Achieving this may involve grouping excep- tions into hierarchies  §13.5.2  and using catch ...   §13.5.2.2 .  13.6.2  Representing Memory Explicitly Experience shows that writing correct exception-safe code using explicit try-blocks is more difﬁcult than most people expect.  In fact, it is unnecessarily difﬁcult because there is an alternative: The   Section 13.6.2  Representing Memory Explicitly  379  ‘‘Resource  Acquisition  Is  Initialization’’ technique   §13.3   can  be  used  to  reduce  the  amount  of code  that  must  be  written  and  to  make the  code  more  stylized. In  this  case,  the  key  resource required by the vector is memory to hold its elements. By providing an auxiliary class to represent the notion of memory used by a vector, we can simplify the code and decrease the chances of acci- dentally forgetting to release it:  template  > struct vector_base {     memor ystr uctureforvector  A alloc;  T∗ elem;  T∗ space;  T∗ last;      allocator    star tof allocation    end of element sequence,star tof space allocated for possible expansion    end of allocated space  vector_base const A& a, typename A::size_type n   : alloc{a}, elem{alloc.allocate n }, space{elem+n}, last{elem+n} { }  ˜vector_base   { alloc.deallocate elem,last−elem ; }  vector_base const vector_base&  = delete; vector_base& operator= const vector_base&  = delete;     no copyoperations  vector_base vector_base&& ;  vector_base& operator= vector_base&& ;     move operations  As long as elem and last are correct, vector_base can be destroyed.  Class vector_base deals with memory for a type T, not objects of type T. Consequently, a user of vector_base must construct all objects explicitly in the allocated space and later destroy all constructed objects in a vector_base before the vector_base itself is destroyed.  The vector_base is designed exclusively to be part of the implementation of vector. It is always hard  to  predict  where  and  how a class  will  be  used,  so  I  made  sure  that  a vector_base can’t be copied and also that a move of a vector_base properly transfers ownership of the memory allocated for elements:  template  vector_base ::vector_base vector_base&& a   : alloc{a.alloc}, elem{a.elem}, space{a.space}, last{a.space}  a.elem = a.space = a.last = nullptr;     no longer owns anymemor y  template  vector_base ::& vector_base ::operator= vector_base&& a  {  swap ∗this,a ; return ∗this;  };  {  }  }   380  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  This deﬁnition of the move assignment uses swap   to transfer ownership of any memory allocated for elements. There are no objects of type T to destroy: vector_base deals with memory and leaves concerns about objects of type T to vector.  Given vector_base, vector can be deﬁned like this:  template  > class vector {  vector_base  vb; void destroy_elements  ;  public:  using size_type = unsigned int;     the data is here  explicit vector size_type n, const T& val = T  , const A& = A   ;  vector const vector& a ; vector& operator= const vector& a ;     copyconstr uctor    copyassignment  vector vector&& a ; vector& operator= vector&& a ;     move constr uctor    move assignment  ˜vector   { destroy_elements  ; }  size_type siz e   const { return vb.space−vb.elem; } size_type capacity   const { return vb.last−vb.elem; }  void reserve siz e_type ;     increase capacity  void resize siz e_type, T = {} ;  void clear   { resize 0 ; } void push_back const T& ;     change the number of elements    makethe vector empty    add an element at the end     ...  };  }  template  void vector ::destroy_elements   {  for  T∗ p = vb.elem; p!=vb.space; ++p   p−>˜T  ;   vb.space=vb.elem;     destroyelement  §17.2.4   The vector destructor explicitly invokes the T destructor for every element. This implies that if an element destructor throws an exception, the vector destruction fails.  This can be a disaster if it hap- pens during stack unwinding caused by an exception and terminate   is called  §13.5.2.5 . In the case  of  normal  destruction,  throwing  an  exception  from  a  destructor  typically  leads  to  resource leaks  and  unpredictable  behavior  of  code  relying  on  reasonable  behavior  of  objects. There  is  no really  good  way  to  protect  against  exceptions  thrown  from  destructors,  so  the  library  makes  no guarantees if an element destructor throws  §13.2 .   Section 13.6.2  Representing Memory Explicitly  381  Now the constructor can be simply deﬁned:  template  vector ::vector siz e_type n, const T& val, const A& a   :vb{a,n}      allocate space for n elements  uninitialized_ﬁll vb.elem,vb.elem+n,val ;    makencopies of val  {  }  {  }  { }  }  The  simpliﬁcation  achieved for  this  constructor  carries  over to every vector operation  that  deals with initialization or allocation. For example, the copy constructor differs mostly by using uninitial- ized_copy   instead of uninitialized_ﬁll  :  template  vector ::vector const vector & a   :vb{a.alloc,a.size  }  uninitialized_copy a.begin  ,a.end  ,vb.elem ;  This style of constructor relies on the fundamental language rule that when an exception is thrown from a constructor, subobjects  including bases  that have already been completely constructed will be properly destroyed  §13.3 . The uninitialized_ﬁll   algorithm and its cousins  §13.6.1  provide the equivalent guarantee for partially constructed sequences.  The move operations are even simpler:  template  vector ::vector vector&& a   :vb{move a.vb }      transfer ownership     move constr uctor  The vector_base move constructor will set the argument’s representation to ‘‘empty.’’  For the move assignment, we must take care of the old value of the target:  template  vector ::& vector ::operator= vector&& a  {  clear  ;  swap ∗this,a ;      destroyelements    transfer ownership     move assignment  The clear   is  strictly  speaking  redundant  because  I  could  assume  that  the  rvalue a would  be destroyed immediately after the assignment. However, I don’t know if some programmer has been playing games with std::move  .  13.6.3  Assignment As  usual,  assignment  differs  from  construction  in  that  an  old  value  must  be  taken  care  of. First consider a straightforward implementation:   382  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  template  vector & vector ::operator= const vector& a  {     offers the strong guarantee  §13.2   vector_base  b alloc,a.size   ;  uninitialized_copy a.begin  ,a.end  ,b.elem ;     copyelements destroy_elements  ;  swap vb,b ;  return ∗this;      destroyold elements    transfer ownership    implicitly destroythe old value     get memory  }  }  This vector assignment provides the strong guarantee, but it repeats a lot of code from constructors and destructors. We can avoid repetition:  template  vector & vector ::operator= const vector& a  {  vector temp {a}; std::swap ∗this,temp ;  return ∗this;     copyallocator    swaprepresentations     offers the strong guarantee  §13.2   The old elements are destroyed by temp’s destructor, and the memory used to hold them is deallo- cated by temp’s vector_base’s destructor.  The reason that the standard-library swap    §35.5.2  works for vector_bases is that we deﬁned  vector_base move operations for swap   to use.  The performance of the two versions ought to be equivalent.  Essentially, they are just two dif- ferent  ways  of  specifying  the  same  set  of  operations. However,  the  second  implementation  is shorter and doesn’t replicate code from related vector functions, so writing the assignment that way ought to be less error-prone and lead to simpler maintenance.  Note  that  I  did  not  test  for  self-assignment,  such  as v=v. This  implementation  of = works  by ﬁrst  constructing  a  copy and  then  swapping  representations. This  obviously  handles  self-assign- ment correctly. I decided that the efﬁciency gained from the test in the rare case of self-assignment was more than offset by its cost in the common case where a different vector is assigned.  In either case, two potentially signiﬁcant optimizations are missing: [1]   If the capacity of the vector assigned to is large enough to hold the assigned vector, we don’t need to allocate new memory.  [2]  An element assignment may be more efﬁcient than an element destruction followed by an  element construction.  Implementing these optimizations, we get:  template  vector & vector ::operator= const vector& a  {  if  capacity   < a.size    {    allocate newvector representation:  vector temp {a}; swap ∗this,temp ;  return ∗this;      copyallocator    swaprepresentations    implicitly destroythe old value  }     optimized, basic guarantee  §13.2  only   Section 13.6.3  Assignment   383  if  this == &a  return ∗this;      optimizeself assignment  copy a.begin  ,a.begin  +asz,vb.elem ; for  T∗ p = vb.elem+asz; p!=vb.space; ++p      destroysur pluselements  §16.2.6      copythe allocator  copy a.begin  ,a.begin  +sz,vb.elem ; uninitialized_copy a.begin  +sz,a.end  ,vb.space ;     constructextraelements  size_type sz = size  ; size_type asz = a.size  ; vb.alloc = a.vb.alloc; if  asz<=sz  {  p−>˜T  ;  } else {  } vb.space = vb.elem+asz; return ∗this;  }  }  }  These optimizations are not free. Obviously, the complexity of the code is far higher. Here, I also test for self-assignment. However, I do so mostly to show how it is done because here it is only an optimization.  The copy   algorithm   §32.5.1   does not offer  the  strong  exception-safety  guarantee. Thus,  if T::operator=   throws an exception during copy  , the vector being assigned to need not be a copy of the vector being assigned, and it need not be unchanged. For example, the ﬁrst ﬁve elements might be copies of elements of the assigned vector and the rest unchanged. It is also plausible that an ele- ment – the element that was being copied when T::operator=   threw an exception – ends up with a value  that  is  neither  the  old  value  nor  a  copy of the  corresponding  element  in  the vector being assigned.  However,  if T::operator=   leaves its  operands  in  valid  states  before  it  throws   as  it should , the vector is still in a valid state – even if it wasn’t the state we would have preferred.  The standard-library vector assignment offers the  weaker  basic exception-safety guarantee of this  last  implementation  –  and  its  potential  performance  advantages.  If you  need  an  assignment that leaves the vector unchanged if an exception is thrown, you must either use a library implemen- tation that provides the strong guarantee or provide your own assignment operation. For example:  template  void safe_assign vector & a, const vector & b  {     simple a = b     copythe elements of b into a temporar y  vector  temp{b}; swap a,temp ;  Alternatively, we could simply use call-by-value  §12.2 :  template  void safe_assign vector & a, vector  b  {  swap a,b ;     simple a = b  note: b is passed byvalue   I nev er can decide if this last version is simply beautiful or too clever for real  maintainable  code.   384  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  13.6.4  Changing Size One of the most useful aspects of vector is that we can change its size to suit our needs. The most popular  functions  for  changing  size  are v.push_back x , which  adds  an x at  the  end  of v, and v.resiz e s , which makes s the number of elements in v.  13.6.4.1 reserve    The key to a simple implementation of such functions is reserve  , which adds free space at the end for the vector to grow into.  In other words, reserve   increases the capacity   of a vector. If the new allocation is larger than the old, reserve   needs to allocate new memory and move the elements into it.  We could try the trick from the unoptimized assignment  §13.6.3 :  template  void vector ::reser ve size_type newalloc   {     ﬂawedﬁrst attempt  if  newalloc<=capacity    return; vector  v capacity   ; copy elem,elem+siz e  ,v.begin     swap ∗this,v ;      neverdecrease allocation    makeavector with the newcapacity    copyelements    install newvalue  }    implicitly release old value  This has the nice property of providing the strong guarantee. However, not all types have a default value,  so  this  implementation  is  ﬂawed.  Furthermore, looping  over the  elements  twice,  ﬁrst  to default construct and then to copy, is a bit odd. So let us optimize:  template  void vector ::reser ve size_type newalloc  {  if  newalloc<=capacity    return; vector_base  b {vb.alloc,newalloc};  uninitialized_move elem,elem+siz e  ,b.elem ; swap vb,b ;      neverdecrease allocation    get newspace    move elements    install newbase  }    implicitly release old space  The problem is that the standard library doesn’t offer uninitialized_move  , so we hav e to write it:  template  Out uninitialized_move In b, In e, Out oo  {  for  ; b!=e; ++b,++oo  {  new static_cast  &∗oo   T{move ∗b };     move constr uct b−>˜T  ;      destroy  } return b;  }  In general, there is no way of recovering the original state from a failed move, so I don’t try to. This uninitialized_move   offers  only  the  basic  guarantee. However,  it is simple  and  for  the  vast majority of cases it is fast.  Also, the standard-library reserve   only offers the basic guarantee.   Section 13.6.4.1  reserve    385  Whenever reserve   may have moved the elements, any iterators into the vector may have been  invalidated  §31.3.3 .  Remember that a move operation should not throw.  In the rare cases where the obvious imple- mentation of a move might throw,  we typically go out of our way to avoid that. A throw from a move operation is rare, unexpected, and damaging to normal reasoning about code. If at all possi- ble avoid it. The standard-library move_if_noexcept   operations may be of help here  §35.5.1 .  The explicit use of move   is needed because the compiler doesn’t know that elem[i] is just about  to be destroyed.  13.6.4.2 resize    The vector member function resize   changes the number of elements. Given reserve  , the imple- mentation resize   is fairly simple. If the number of elements increases, we must construct the new elements.  Conversely, if the number of elements decrease, we must destroy the surplus elements:  template  void vector ::resiz e size_type newsiz e, const T& val  {  reserve newsiz e ; if  size  <newsiz e   else  uninitialized_ﬁll elem+size  ,elem+newsiz e,val ;      constructnewelements: [size  :newsize   destroy elem.siz e  ,elem+newsiz e ;  vb.space = vb.last = vb.elem+newsiz e;     destroysur pluselements: [newsize:size     There is no standard destroy  , but that easily written:  template  void destroy In b, In e  {  for  ; b!=e; ++b      destroy[b:e   b−>˜T  ;  13.6.4.3 push_back    From an exception-safety point of view, push_back   is similar to assignment in that we must take care that the vector remains unchanged if we fail to add a new element:  template  void vector ::push_back const T& x  {  if  capacity  ==size      reserve sz?2∗sz:8 ;   vb.alloc.construct &vb.elem[size  ],val ;  ++vb.space;      no more free space; relocate:    grow orstar twith 8    add val at end    increment size  Naturally, the copy constructor used to initialize ∗space might throw an exception.  If that happens,  }  }  }   386  Exception Handling   Chapter 13  the value of the vector remains unchanged, with space left unincremented. However, reserve   may already have reallocated the existing elements.  This deﬁnition of push_back   contains two ‘‘magic numbers’’  2 and 8 .  An industrial-strength implementation would not do that, but it would still have values determining the size of the initial allocation  here, 8  and the rate of growth  here, 2, indicating a doubling in size each time the vector would otherwise overﬂow .  As it happens, these are not unreasonable or uncommon values.  The assumption  is  that  once  we  have  seen  one push_back   for  a vector, we will  almost  certainly  see many more.  The factor two is larger than the mathematically optimal factor to minimize average memory use  1.618 , so as to give better run-time performance for systems where memories are not tiny.  13.6.4.4  Final Thoughts  Note the absence of try-blocks in the vector implementation  except for the one hidden inside unini- tialized_copy   .  The changes in state were done by carefully ordering the operations so that if an exception is thrown, the vector remains unchanged or at least valid.  The  approach  of  gaining  exception  safety  through  ordering  and  the  RAII  technique   §13.3  tends to be more elegant and more efﬁcient than explicitly handling errors using try-blocks.  More problems with exception safety arise from a programmer ordering code in unfortunate ways than from lack of speciﬁc exception-handling code. The basic rule of ordering is not to destroy informa- tion before its replacement has been constructed and can be assigned without the possibility of an exception.  Exceptions introduce possibilities for surprises in the form of unexpected control ﬂows.  For a piece of code with a simple local control ﬂow,  such as the reserve  , safe_assign  , and push_back   examples, the opportunities for surprises are limited. It is relatively simple to look at such code and ask, ‘‘Can this line of code throw an exception, and what happens if it does?’’ For large functions with complicated control structures, such as complicated conditional statements and nested loops, this can be hard. Adding try-blocks increases this local control structure complexity and can there- fore be a source of confusion and errors  §13.3 . I conjecture that the effectiveness of the ordering approach and the RAII approach compared to more extensive use of try-blocks stems from the sim- pliﬁcation  of  the  local  control  ﬂow.  Simple,  stylized  code  is  easier  to  understand,  easier  to  get right, and easier to generate good code for.  This vector implementation is presented as an example of the problems that exceptions can pose and of techniques for addressing those problems. The standard does not require an implementation to be exactly like the one presented here. However, the standard does require the exception-safety guarantees as provided by the example.  13.7  Advice [1]  Develop an error-handling strategy early in a design; §13.1.

Functions  §2.2.1, Chapter 12  and classes   §3.2,  Chapter  16   provide  relatively  ﬁne-grained  separation  of  concerns,  whereas ‘‘libraries,’’ source ﬁles, and translation units  §2.4, Chapter 15  provide coarser grain. The logical ideal is modularity, that is, to keep separate things separate and to allow access to a ‘‘module’’ only through a well-speciﬁed interface.  C++ does not provide a single language feature supporting the notion of a module; there is no module construct. Instead, modularity is expressed through combi- nations  of  other  language  facilities,  such  as  functions,  classes,  and  namespaces,  and  source  code organization.  This chapter and the next deal with the coarse structure of a program and its physical represen- tation  as  source  ﬁles. That  is,  these  two chapters  are  more  concerned  with  programming  in  the   390  Namespaces  Chapter 14  large than with the elegant expression of individual types, algorithms, and data structures.  Consider some of the problems that can arise when people fail to design for modularity. For example, a graphics library may provide different kinds of graphical Shapes and functions to help use them:     Graph_lib:  class Shape {  * ...*  }; class Line : public Shape {  * ...*  }; class Poly_line: public Shape {  * ...*  }; class Text : public Shape {  * ...*  };     connected sequence of lines    text label  Shape operator+ const Shape&, const Shape& ;     compose  Graph_reader open const char∗ ;      open ﬁle of Shapes  Now someone comes along with another library, providing facilities for text manipulation:     Te xt_lib:  class Glyph {  * ...*  }; class Word {  * ...*  }; class Line {  * ...*  }; class Text {  * ...*  };     sequence of Glyphs    sequence of Words    sequence of Lines  File∗ open const char∗ ;      open text ﬁle  Word operator+ const Line&, const Line& ;     concatenate  For the moment, let us ignore the speciﬁc design issues for graphics and text manipulation and just consider the problems of using Graph_lib and Te xt_lib together in a program.  Assume   realistically  enough   that  the  facilities  of Graph_lib are  deﬁned  in  a  header   §2.4.1 , Graph_lib.h, and the facilities of Te xt_lib are deﬁned in another header, Te xt_lib.h. Now, I can ‘‘inno- cently’’ include both and try to use facilities from the two libraries:  include "Graph_lib.h" include "Text_lib.h"    ...  Just includeing those headers causes a slurry of error messages: Line, Te xt, and open   are deﬁned twice in ways that a compiler cannot disambiguate. Trying to use the libraries would give further error messages.  There are many techniques for dealing with such name clashes. For example, some such prob- lems can be addressed by placing all the facilities of a library inside a few classes, by using suppos- edly  uncommon  names   e.g., Te xt_box rather  than Te xt ,  or  by  systematically  using  a  preﬁx  for names from a library  e.g., gl_shape and gl_line .  Each of these techniques  also known as ‘‘work- arounds’’ and ‘‘hacks’’  works in some cases, but they are not general and can be inconvenient to use.  For  example,  names  tend  to  become  long,  and  the  use  of  many different  names  inhibits generic programming  §3.4 .   Section 14.2  Namespaces   391  14.2  Namespaces The  notion  of  a namespace is  provided  to  directly  represent  the  notion  of  a  set  of  facilities  that directly belong together, for example, the code of a library. The members of a namespace are in the same scope and can refer to each other without special notation, whereas access from outside the namespace requires explicit notation. In particular, we can avoid name clashes by separating sets of  declarations   e.g.,  library  interfaces   into  namespaces. For example,  we  might  call  the  graph library Graph_lib:  namespace Graph_lib {  class Shape {  * ...*  }; class Line : public Shape {  * ...*  }; class Poly_line: public Shape {  * ...*  }; class Text : public Shape {  * ...*  };     connected sequence of lines    text label  Shape operator+ const Shape&, const Shape& ;     compose  Graph_reader open const char∗ ;      open ﬁle of Shapes  }  }  Similarly, the obvious name for our text library is Te xt_lib:  namespace Text_lib {  class Glyph {  * ...*  }; class Word {  * ...*  }; class Line {  * ...*  }; class Text {  * ...*  };     sequence of Glyphs    sequence of Words    sequence of Lines  File∗ open const char∗ ;      open text ﬁle  Word operator+ const Line&, const Line& ;     concatenate  As long as we manage to pick distinct namespace names, such as Graph_lib and Te xt_lib  §14.4.2 , we can now compile the two sets of declarations together without name clashes.  A namespace should express some logical structure: the declarations within a namespace should together  provide  facilities  that  unite  them  in  the  eyes  of  their  users  and  reﬂect  a  common  set  of design  decisions. They should  be  seen  as  a  logical  unit,  for  example,  ‘‘the  graphics  library’’ or ‘‘the text manipulation library,’’ similar to the way we consider the members of a class. In fact, the entities declared in a namespace are referred to as the members of the namespace.  A namespace is a  named  scope. You can access members deﬁned earlier in a namespace from later declarations, but you cannot  without special effort  refer to members from outside the name- space.  For example:  class Glyph {  * ...*  }; class Line {  * ...*  };  namespace Text_lib {  class Glyph {  * ...*  }; class Word {  * ...*  };     sequence of Glyphs   392  Namespaces  Chapter 14  class Line {  * ...*  };   sequence of Words class Text {  * ...*  };    sequence of Lines  File∗ open const char∗ ;      open text ﬁle  Word operator+ const Line&, const Line& ;     concatenate  Glyph glyph Line& ln, int i ;     ln[i]  Here,  the Word and Line in  the  declaration  of Te xt_lib::operator+   refer  to Te xt_lib::Word and Te xt_lib::Line. That local name lookup is not affected by the global Line. Conversely, the Glyph and Line in the declaration of the global glyph   refer to the global ::Glyph and ::Line. That  nonlocal  lookup is not affected by Te xt_lib’s Glyph and Line.  To  refer to members of a namespace, we can use its fully qualiﬁed name. For example, if we  want a glyph   that uses deﬁnitions from Te xt_lib, we can write:  Te xt_lib::Glyph glyph Text_lib::Line& ln, int i ;     ln[i]  Other ways of referring to members from outside their namespace are using-declarations  §14.2.2 , using-directives  §14.2.3 , and argument-dependent lookup  §14.2.4 .  14.2.1  Explicit Qualiﬁcation A member can be declared within a namespace deﬁnition and deﬁned later using the namespace- name :: member-name notation.  Members of a namespace must be introduced using this notation:  }  }  }  }  namespace namespace−name {    declaration and deﬁnitions  For example:  namespace Parser {  double expr bool ;  double term bool ; double prim bool ;     declaration  double val = Parser::expr  ;      use  double Parser::expr bool b  {     deﬁnition     ...  We cannot declare a new member of a namespace outside a namespace deﬁnition using the qualiﬁer syntax   §iso.7.3.1.2 . The  idea  is  to  catch  errors  such  as  misspellings  and  type  mismatches,  and also to make it reasonably easy to ﬁnd all names in a namespace declaration. For example:   Section 14.2.1  Explicit Qualiﬁcation  393  void Parser::logical bool ;  double Parser::trem bool ;  double Parser::prim int ;      error :no logical   in Parser    error :no trem   in Parser  misspelling     error :Parser ::prim   takes a bool argument  wrong type   A namespace is a scope. The usual scope rules hold for namespaces. Thus, ‘‘namespace’’ is a very fundamental and relatively simple concept. The larger a program is, the more useful namespaces are to express logical separations of its parts. The global scope is a namespace and can be explic- itly referred to using ::. For example:  14.2.2 using-Declarations When a name is frequently used outside its namespace, it can be a bother to repeatedly qualify it with its namespace name. Consider:     global function  int f  ;  int g   {  int f; f  ;  ::f  ;      local var iable; hides the global function    error :we can’t call an int    OK: call the global function  Classes are namespaces  §16.2 .  }  {  }  {  include  include  include   std::vector  split const std::string& s     split s into its whitespace-separated substrings  std::vector  res; std::istringstream iss s ; for  std::string buf; iss>>buf;   res.push_back buf ;  return res;  using std::string;     use ‘‘str ing’’tomean ‘‘std::str ing’’  std::vector  split const string& s      split s into its whitespace-separated substrings  std::vector  res; std::istringstream iss s ;  The  repeated  qualiﬁcation std is  tedious  and  distracting. In  particular, we repeat std::string four times in this small example.  To alleviate that we can use a using-declaration to say that in this code string means std::string:   394  Namespaces  Chapter 14  A using-declaration introduces a synonym into a scope. It is usually a good idea to keep local syn- onyms as local as possible to avoid confusion.  When used for an overloaded name, a using-declaration applies to all the overloaded versions.  for  string buf; iss>>buf;  res.push_back buf ;  return res;  For example:  namespace N { void f int ; void f string ;  void g   {  using N::f; f 789 ;  f "Bruce" ;      N::f int     N::f string   For the use of using-declarations within class hierarchies, see §20.3.5.  14.2.3 using-Directives In the split   example  §14.2.2 , we still had three uses of std:: left after introducing a synonym for std::string. Often, we like to use every name from a namespace without qualiﬁcation. That can be achieved by providing  a using-declaration  for  each  name  from  the  namespace,  but  that’s tedious and requires extra work each time a new name is added to or removed from the namespace. Alter- natively, we can use a using-directive to request that every name from a namespace be accessible in our scope without qualiﬁcation. For example:  using namespace std;     makeevery name from std accessible  vector  split const string& s      split s into its whitespace-separated substrings  vector  res; istringstream iss s ; for  string buf; iss>>buf;  res.push_back buf ;  return res;  A using-directive  makes  names  from  a  namespace  available  almost  as  if  they had  been  declared outside their namespace  see also §14.4 . Using a using-directive to make names from a frequently used and well-known library available without qualiﬁcation is a popular technique for simplifying code.  This is  the  technique  used  to  access  standard-library  facilities  throughout  this  book. The standard-library facilities are deﬁned in namespace std.  }  };  }  {  }   Section 14.2.3  using-Directives  395  Within  a  function,  a using-directive  can  be  safely  used  as  a  notational  convenience,  but  care should be taken with global using-directives because overuse can lead to exactly the name clashes that namespaces were introduced to avoid.  For example:  namespace Graph_lib {  class Shape {  * ...*  }; class Line : Shape {  * ...*  }; class Poly_line: Shape {  * ...*  }; class Text : Shape {  * ...*  };     connected sequence of lines    text label  Shape operator+ const Shape&, const Shape& ;     compose  Graph_reader open const char∗ ;      open ﬁle of Shapes  }  }  namespace Text_lib {  class Glyph {  * ...*  }; class Word {  * ...*  }; class Line {  * ...*  }; class Text {  * ...*  };     sequence of Glyphs    sequence of Words    sequence of Lines  File∗ open const char∗ ;     open text ﬁle  Word operator+ const Line&, const Line& ;     concatenate  using namespace Graph_lib; using namespace Text_lib;  Glyph gl; vector  vs;      Te xt_lib::Glyph    Graph_lib::Shape  So far, so good.  In particular, we can use names that do not clash, such as Glyph and Shape. How- ev er, name clashes now occur as soon as we use one of the names that clash – exactly as if we had not used namespaces. For example:  Te xt txt;  File∗ fp = open "my_precious_data" ;      error :ambiguous    error :ambiguous  Consequently, we must  be  careful  with using-directives in the  global  scope. In  particular, don’t place a using-directive in the global scope in a header ﬁle except in very specialized circumstances  e.g., to aid transition  because you never know where a header might be included.  14.2.4  Argument-Dependent Lookup A function taking an argument of user-deﬁned type X is more often than not deﬁned in the same namespace as X. Consequently, if a function isn’t found in the context of its use, we look in the namespaces of its arguments.  For example:   396  Namespaces  Chapter 14  namespace Chrono {  class Date {  * ...*  };  bool operator== const Date&, const std::string& ;  std::string format const Date& ;    ...     makestr ingrepresentation  void f Chrono::Date d, int i  {  std::string s = format d ;  std::string t = format i ;      Chrono::for mat      error :no for mat  in scope  }  }  This lookup rule  called argument-dependent lookup or simply ADL  saves the programmer a lot of typing  compared  to  using  explicit  qualiﬁcation,  yet  it  doesn’t pollute  the  namespace  the  way  a using-directive  §14.2.3  can. It is especially useful for operator operands  §18.2.5  and template arguments  §26.3.5 , where explicit qualiﬁcation can be quite cumbersome.  Note that the namespace itself needs to be in scope and the function must be declared before it  can be found and used.  Naturally, a function can take arguments from more than one namespace. For example:  void f Chrono::Date d, std::string s  {  if  d == s  {     ...  } else if  d == "August 4, 1914"  {     ...  }  }  namespace N {  struct S { int i }; void f S ; void g S ; void h int ;  }  In such cases, we look for the function in the scope of the call  as ever  and in the namespaces of ev ery argument  including each argument’s class and base classes  and do the usual overload reso- lution  §12.3  of all functions we ﬁnd. In particular, for the call d==s, we look for operator== in the scope  surrounding f  , in the std namespace   where == is  deﬁned  for string ,  and  in  the Chrono namespace.  There is  a std::operator==  , but  it  doesn’t take a Date argument,  so  we  use Chrono::operator==  , which does. See also §18.2.5.  When a class member invokes a named function, other members of the same class and its base classes are preferred over functions potentially found based on the argument types  operators fol- low a different rule; §18.2.1, §18.2.5 . For example:   Section 14.2.4  Argument-Dependent Lookup  397  In the standard, the rules for argument-dependent lookup are phrased in terms of associated name- spaces  §iso.3.4.2 .  Basically:  If an argument is a class member, the associated namespaces are the class itself  including its base classes  and the class’s enclosing namespaces. If an argument is a member of a namespace, the associated namespaces are the enclosing namespaces. If an argument is a built-in type, there are no associated namespaces.  Argument-dependent lookup can save a lot of tedious and distracting typing, but occasionally it can give surprising results. For example, the search for a declaration of a function f   does not have a preference for functions in a namespace in which f   is called  the way it does for functions in a class in which f   is called :  struct Base {  void f N::S ;  struct D : Base {  void mf  ;  void g N::S x  {  f x ;  mf x ;  h 1 ;      call Base::f      call D::mf      error :no h int  available  }  namespace N {  template  void f T, int ;   class X { };     N::f    namespace N2 {  N::X x;  void f N::X, unsigned ;  void g   {  }  f x,1 ;      calls N::f X,int   };  };   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   }  }  It may seem obvious to choose N2::f  , but that is not done. Overload resolution is applied and the best match is found: N::f   is the best match for f x,1  because 1 is an int rather than an unsigned. Conversely, examples have been seen where a function in the caller’s namespace is chosen but the programmer expected a better function from a known namespace to be used  e.g., a standard-library function from std .  This can be most confusing. See also §26.3.6.   398  Namespaces  Chapter 14  14.2.5  Namespaces Are Open A namespace is open; that is, you can add names to it from several separate namespace declara- tions.  For example:  That way, the members of a namespace need not be placed contiguously in a single ﬁle. This can be important when converting older programs to use namespaces. For example, consider a header ﬁle written without the use of namespaces:  namespace A {  int f  ;     nowAhas member f    namespace A {  int g  ;     nowAhas twomembers,f   and g    }  }     my header :  void mf  ; void yf  ; int mg  ;    ...     my function    your function    my function     my header :  namespace Mine {  void mf  ;    ...     my function  Here, we have  unwisely  just added the declarations needed without concerns of modularity. This can be rewritten without reordering the declarations:  }  }  void yf  ;     your function  not yet put into a namespace   namespace Mine {  int mg  ;    ...     my function  When writing new code, I prefer to use many smaller namespaces  see §14.4  rather than putting really major pieces of code into a single namespace. However, that is often impractical when con- verting major pieces of software to use namespaces.  Another reason to deﬁne the members of a namespace in several separate namespace declara- tions is that sometimes we want to distinguish parts of a namespace used as an interface from parts used to support easy implementation; §14.3 provides an example.  A namespace alias  §14.4.2  cannot be used to re-open a namespace.   Section 14.3  Modularization and Interfaces  399  14.3  Modularization and Interfaces Any realistic program consists of a number of separate parts. For example, even the simple ‘‘Hello, world!’’ program involves at least two parts: the user code requests Hello, world! to be printed, and the I O system does the printing.  Consider the desk calculator example from §10.2. It can be viewed as composed of ﬁve parts: [1]  The parser, doing syntax analysis: expr  , term  , and prim   [2]  The lexer, composing tokens out of characters: Kind, Token, Token_stream, and ts [3]  The symbol table, holding  string,value  pairs: table [4]  The driver: main   and calculate   [5]  The error handler: error   and number_of_errors  This can be represented graphically:  error handler  driver  parser  lexer  symbol table  where an arrow means ‘‘using.’’  To simplify the picture, I have not represented the fact that every part relies on error handling. In fact, the calculator was conceived as three parts, with the driver and error handler added for completeness.  When one module uses another, it doesn’t need to know everything about the module used. Ide- ally, most of the details of a module are unknown to its users. Consequently, we make a distinction between a module and its interface.  For example, the parser directly relies on the lexer’s interface  only , rather than on the complete lexer.  The lexer simply implements the services advertised in its interface.  This can be presented graphically like this:  driver  error handler  parser interface  parser implementation  lexer interface  lexer implementation  symbol table interface  symbol table implementation  A dashed line means ‘‘implements.’’  I consider this to be the real structure of the program, and our job as programmers is to represent this faithfully in code. That done, the code will be simple, efﬁ- cient, comprehensible, maintainable, etc., because it will directly reﬂect our fundamental design.   400  Namespaces  Chapter 14  The following subsections show how the logical structure of the desk calculator program can be made  clear, and  §15.3  shows  how the  program  source  text  can  be  physically  organized  to  take advantage of it. The calculator is a tiny program, so in ‘‘real life’’ I wouldn’t bother using name- spaces and separate compilation  §2.4.1, §15.1  to the extent done here. Making the structure of the  calculator  explicit  is  simply  an  illustration  of  techniques  useful  for  larger  programs  without drowning  in  code. In  real  programs,  each  ‘‘module’’ represented  by  a  separate  namespace  will often have hundreds of functions, classes, templates, etc.  Error handling permeates the structure of a program. When breaking up a program into mod- ules  or   conversely   when  composing  a  program  out  of  modules,  we  must  take care  to  minimize dependencies between modules caused by error handling. C++ provides exceptions to decouple the detection and reporting of errors from the handling of errors  §2.4.3.1, Chapter 13 .  There are many more notions of modularity than the ones discussed in this chapter and the next. For example, we might use concurrently executing and communicating tasks  §5.3, Chapter 41  or processes to represent important aspects of modularity. Similarly, the use of separate address spa- ces  and  the  communication  of  information  between  address  spaces  are  important  topics  not  dis- cussed here. I consider these notions of modularity largely independent and orthogonal. Interest- ingly, in each case, separating a system into modules is easy. The hard problem is to provide safe, convenient, and efﬁcient communication across module boundaries.  14.3.1  Namespaces as Modules A namespace is a mechanism for expressing logical grouping. That is, if some declarations logi- cally  belong  together  according  to  some  criteria,  they can  be  put  in  a  common  namespace  to express that fact.  So we can use namespaces to express the logical structure of our calculator. For example, the declarations of the parser from the desk calculator  §10.2.1  may be placed in a name- space Parser:  The  function expr   must  be  declared  ﬁrst  and  then  later  deﬁned  to  break  the  dependency loop described in §10.2.1.  The input part of the desk calculator could also be placed in its own namespace:  namespace Parser {  double expr bool ; double prim bool get  {  * ...*  } double term bool get  {  * ...*  } double expr bool get  {  * ...*  }  }  }  namespace Lexer {  enum class Kind : char {  * ...*  }; class Token {  * ...*  }; class Token_stream {  * ...*  };  Token_stream ts;  The symbol table is extremely simple:   }  }  }  }  Section 14.3.1  Namespaces as Modules  401  The driver cannot be completely put into a namespace because the language rules require main   to be a global function:  namespace Table {  map  table;  namespace Driver {  void calculate   {  * ...*  }  int main   {  * ...*  }  The error handler is also trivial:  namespace Error {  int no_of_errors; double error const string& s  {  * ...*  }  This  use  of  namespaces  makes  explicit  what  the  lexer and  the  parser  provide  to  a  user. Had  I included  the  source  code  for  the  functions,  this  structure  would  have  been  obscured. If  function bodies are included in the declaration of a realistically sized namespace, you typically have to wade through screenfuls of information to ﬁnd what services are offered, that is, to ﬁnd the interface.  An alternative to relying on separately speciﬁed interfaces is to provide a tool that extracts an interface from a module that includes implementation details. I don’t consider that a good solution. Specifying interfaces is a fundamental design activity, a  module can provide different interfaces to different users, and often an interface is designed long before the implementation details are made concrete.  Here is a version of the Parser with the interface separated from the implementation:  namespace Parser {  double prim bool ; double term bool ; double expr bool ;  double Parser::prim bool get  {  * ...*  } double Parser::term bool get  {  * ...*  } double Parser::expr bool get  {  * ...*  }  Note  that  as  a  result  of  separating  the  implementation  from  the  interface,  each  function  now has exactly  one  declaration  and  one  deﬁnition. Users  will  see  only  the  interface  containing  declara- tions.  The implementation – in this case, the function bodies – will be placed ‘‘somewhere else’’ where a user need not look.  Ideally, every  entity  in  a  program  belongs  to  some  recognizable  logical  unit   ‘‘module’’ . Therefore, every declaration in a nontrivial program should ideally be in some namespace named to indicate its logical role in the program. The exception is main  , which must be global in order for the compiler to recognize it as special  §2.2.1, §15.4 .   402  Namespaces  Chapter 14  14.3.2  Implementations What will the code look like once it has been modularized? That depends on how we decide to access  code  in  other  namespaces. We  can  always  access  names  from  ‘‘our  own’’ namespace exactly as we did before we introduced namespaces. However, for names in other namespaces, we have to choose among explicit qualiﬁcation, using-declarations, and using-directives.  Parser::prim   provides a good test case for the use of namespaces in an implementation because  it uses each of the other namespaces  except Driver .  If we use explicit qualiﬁcation, we get:  double Parser::prim bool get   {  if  get  Lexer::ts.g et  ;     handle primar ies  switch  Lexer::ts.current  .kind  { case Lexer::Kind::number:  {  double v = Lexer::ts.current  .number_value; Lexer::ts.g et  ; return v;     ﬂoating-point constant  } case Lexer::Kind::name: {  } case Lexer::Kind::minus:   return −prim true ;  case Lexer::Kind::lp: {  double& v = Table::table[Lexer::ts.current  .string_value]; if  Lexer::ts.g et  .kind == Lexer::Kind::assign  v = expr true ;     ’=’ seen: assignment return v;     unar yminus  double e = expr true ; if  Lexer::ts.current  .kind != Lexer::Kind::rp  return Error::error " ' ' expected" ; Lexer::ts.g et  ; return e;     eat ’ ’  } default:  }  }  return Error::error "primar y expected" ;  I count  14  occurrences  of Lexer::, and   despite  theories  to  the  contrary   I  don’t think  the  more explicit  use  of  modularity  has  improved readability. I didn’t use Parser:: because  that  would  be redundant within namespace Parser.  If we use using-declarations, we get:  using Lexer::ts;  using Lexer::Kind;  using Error::error;  using Table::table;      saveseight occurrences of ‘‘Lexer::’’    savessix occurrences of ‘‘Lexer::’’    savestwo occurrences of ‘‘Error ::’’    savesone occurrence of ‘‘Table::’’   Section 14.3.2  Implementations   403  double prim bool get   {  if  get  ts.get  ;     handle primar ies  switch  ts.current  .kind  { case Kind::number:  {  double v = ts.current  .number_value; ts.get  ; return v;     ﬂoating-point constant  } case Kind::name: {  double& v = table[ts.current  .string_value]; if  ts.get  .kind == Kind::assign  v = expr true ;  return v;     ’=’ seen: assignment  } case Kind::minus:   return −prim true ;  case Kind::lp: {     unar yminus  double e = expr true ; if  ts.current  .kind != Kind::rp  return error "' ' expected" ; ts.get  ; return e;     eat ’ ’  } default:  }  return error "primar y expected" ;  My guess is that the using-declarations for Lexer:: were worth it, but that the value of the others was marginal.  }  }  If we use using-directives, we get:  using namespace Lexer;  using namespace Error;  using namespace Table;      savesfour teenoccurrences of ‘‘Lexer::’’    savestwo occurrences of ‘‘Error ::’’    savesone occurrence of ‘‘Table::’’  double prim bool get   {     as before     handle primar ies  The using-declarations for Error and Table don’t buy much notationally, and it can be argued that they obscure the origins of the formerly qualiﬁed names.  So,  the  tradeoff among  explicit  qualiﬁcation, using-declarations,  and using-directives must  be  made on a case-by-case basis. The rules of thumb are:  [1]   [2]   If some qualiﬁcation is really common for several names, use a using-directive  for that namespace. If some qualiﬁcation is common for a particular name from a namespace, use a using-de- claration for that name.   404  Namespaces  Chapter 14  [3]   If a qualiﬁcation for a name is uncommon, use explicit qualiﬁcation to make it clear from where the name comes.  [4]  Don’t use explicit qualiﬁcation for names in the same namespace as the user.  14.3.3  Interfaces and Implementations It  should  be  clear  that  the  namespace  deﬁnition  we  used  for Parser is  not  the  ideal  interface  for Parser to present to its users. Instead, that Parser declares the set of declarations that is needed to write the individual parser functions conveniently. The Parser’s interface to its users should be far simpler:  namespace Parser {    user interface  double expr bool ;  We see the namespace Parser used to provide two things:  [1]  The common environment for the functions implementing the parser [2]  The external interface offered by the parser to its users Thus, the driver code, main  , should see only the user interface.  The functions implementing the parser should see whichever interface we decided on as the best  for expressing those functions’ shared environment.  That is:  namespace Parser {     implementer interface  }  }  double prim bool ; double term bool ; double expr bool ;  using namespace Lexer;  using Error::error; using Table::table;  or graphically:     use all facilities offered bylexer  Parser  user interface   Parser  implementer interface   Driver code  Parser code  The arrows represent ‘‘relies on the interface provided by’’ relations.  We could give the user’s interface and the implementer’s interface different names, but  because namespaces are open; §14.2.5  we don’t hav e to.  The lack of separate names need not lead to con- fusion because the physical layout of the program  see §15.3.2  naturally provides separate  ﬁle  names.  Had we decided to use a separate implementation namespace, the design would not have looked different to users:   Section 14.3.3  Interfaces and Implementations  405  namespace Parser {    user interface  double expr bool ;  }  }  namespace Parser_impl {  using namespace Parser;     implementer interface  double prim bool ; double term bool ; double expr bool ;  using namespace Lexer;    use all facilities offered byLexer using Error::error; using Table::table;  or graphically:  Parser  user interface   Parser_impl  implementer interface   Driver code  Parser code  For larger programs, I lean toward introducing _impl interfaces.  The  interface  offered  to  implementers  is  larger  than  the  interface  offered  to  users. Had  this interface been for a realistically sized module in a real system, it would change more often than the interface seen by users. It is important that the users of a module  in this case, Driver using Parser  be insulated from such changes.  14.4  Composition Using Namespaces In larger programs, we tend to use many namespaces.  This section examines technical aspects of composing code out of namespaces.  14.4.1  Convenience vs. Safety A using-declaration  adds  a  name  to  a  local  scope. A using-directive  does  not;  it  simply  renders names accessible in the scope in which they were declared. For example:  namespace X {  int i, j, k;  }   406  Namespaces  Chapter 14  int k;  void f1   {  }  }  void f2   {  int i = 0; using X::i; using X::j; using X::k;  i++; j++;  k++;   int i = 0; using namespace X; i++;  j++;  k++;  ::k++;  X::k++;      makenames from X accessible    local i    X::j    error :X’skorthe global k?    the global k    X’sk     error :ideclared twice in f2       hides global k     X::j    X::k  A locally declared name  declared either by an ordinary declaration or by a using-declaration  hides nonlocal declarations of the same name, and any illegal overloading of the name is detected at the point of declaration.  Note  the  ambiguity  error  for k++ in f1  . Global  names  are  not  given preference  over names from namespaces made accessible in the global scope. This provides signiﬁcant protection against accidental name clashes, and – importantly – ensures that there are no advantages to be gained from polluting the global namespace.  When libraries declaring many names are made accessible through using-directives, it is a sig-  niﬁcant advantage that clashes of unused names are not considered errors.  14.4.2  Namespace Aliases If users give their namespaces short names, the names of different namespaces will clash:  namespace A {   shor tname,will clash  eventually      ...  }  A::String s1 = "Grieg"; A::String s2 = "Nielsen";  However, long namespace names can be impractical in real code:   Section 14.4.2  Namespace Aliases  407  namespace American_Telephone_and_Telegraph {     too long     ...  }  American_Telephone_and_Telegraph::String s3 = "Grieg"; American_Telephone_and_Telegraph::String s4 = "Nielsen";  This dilemma can be resolved by providing a short alias for a longer namespace name:  Namespace aliases also allow a user to refer to ‘‘the library’’ and have a single declaration deﬁning what library that really is. For example:     use namespace alias to shorten names:  namespace ATT = American_Telephone_and_Telegraph;  ATT::String s3 = "Grieg"; ATT::String s4 = "Nielsen";  namespace Lib = Foundation_library_v2r11;     ...  Lib::set s; Lib::String s5 = "Sibelius";  This can immensely simplify the task of replacing one version of a library with another. By using Lib rather than Foundation_library_v2r11 directly, you can update to version ‘‘v3r02’’ by changing the initialization of the alias Lib and recompiling. The recompile will catch source-level incompati- bilities.  On the other hand, overuse of aliases  of any kind  can lead to confusion.  14.4.3  Namespace Composition Often, we want to compose an interface out of existing interfaces.  For example:  namespace His_string {  class String {  * ...*  }; String operator+ const String&, const String& ; String operator+ const String&, const char∗ ; void ﬁll char ;    ...  }  }  namespace Her_vector { template   class Vector {  * ...*  };     ...   408  Namespaces  Chapter 14  }  }  }  }  }  }     ...     ...     ...  namespace My_lib {  using namespace His_string; using namespace Her_vector; void my_fct String& ;  Given this, we can now write the program in terms of My_lib:  void f   {  My_lib::String s = "Byron";     ...     ﬁnds My_lib::His_string::Str ing  using namespace My_lib;  void g Vector & vs  {     ... my_fct vs[5] ;    ...  If an explicitly qualiﬁed name  such as My_lib::String  isn’t declared in the namespace mentioned, the compiler looks in namespaces mentioned in using-directives  such as His_string .  Only if we need to deﬁne something do we need to know the real namespace of an entity:  void My_lib::ﬁll char c  {     error :no ﬁll   declared in My_lib  void His_string::ﬁll char c  {     OK: ﬁll   declared in His_string  void My_lib::my_fct String& v    OK: String is My_lib::String, meaning His_string::Str ing {  Ideally, a namespace should  [1]  [2]  [3]   express a logically coherent set of features, not give users access to unrelated features, and not impose a signiﬁcant notational burden on users.  Together with the include mechanism  §15.2.2 , the composition techniques presented here and in the following subsections provide strong support for this.   Section 14.4.4  Composition and Selection  409  14.4.4  Composition and Selection Combining composition  by using-directives  with selection  by using-declarations  yields the ﬂexi- bility needed for most real-world examples.  With these mechanisms, we can provide access to a variety of facilities in such a way that we resolve name clashes and ambiguities arising from their composition.  For example:  namespace His_lib {  class String {  * ...*  }; template   class Vector {  * ...*  };     ...  namespace Her_lib {  template   class Vector {  * ...*  };  class String {  * ...*  };    ...  }  }  }  namespace My_lib {  using namespace His_lib; using namespace Her_lib;     everything from His_lib    everything from Her_lib  using His_lib::String; using Her_lib::Vector;      resolvepotential clash in favor of His_lib    resolvepotential clash in favor of Her_lib  template      ...  class List {  * ...*  };     additional stuff  When  looking  into  a  namespace,  names  explicitly  declared  there   including  names  declared  by using-declarations  take priority over names made accessible in another scope by a using-directive  see also §14.4.1 . Consequently, a user of My_lib will see the name clashes for String and Vector resolved  in  favor of His_lib::String and Her_lib::Vector. Also, My_lib::List will  be  used  by  default independently of whether His_lib or Her_lib is providing a List.  Usually, I prefer to leave a name unchanged when including it into a new namespace.  Then, I don’t hav e to remember two different names for the same entity. Howev er, sometimes a new name is needed or simply nice to have. For example:  namespace Lib2 {  using namespace His_lib; using namespace Her_lib;     everything from His_lib    everything from Her_lib  using His_lib::String; using Her_lib::Vector;      resolvepotential clash in favor of His_lib    resolvepotential clash in favor of Her_lib   410  Namespaces  Chapter 14  using Her_string = Her_lib::String; template      rename  using His_vec = His_lib::Vector ;      rename  template   class List {  * ...*  };     additional stuff     ...  }  There is no general language mechanism for renaming, but for types and templates, we can intro- duce aliases with using  §3.4.5, §6.5 .  14.4.5  Namespaces and Overloading Function  overloading   §12.3   works  across  namespaces. This  is  essential  to  allow us to migrate existing libraries to use namespaces with minimal source code changes. For example:  f 'a' ;    calls the f   from B.h  This program can be upgraded to a version using namespaces without changing the actual code:     old A.h:  void f int ;    ...     old B.h:  void f char ;    ...     old user.c:  include "A.h" include "B.h"  void g   {  }  }  }     newA.h:  namespace A { void f int ;    ...     newB.h:  namespace B {  void f char ;    ...   Namespaces and Overloading   411  Section 14.4.5     newuser.c:  include "A.h" include "B.h"  using namespace A; using namespace B;  void g   {  }  f 'a' ;      calls the f   from B.h  Had we wanted to keep user.c completely unchanged, we would have placed the using-directives in the  header  ﬁles. However,  it is usually  best  to  avoid using-directives in header  ﬁles,  because putting them there greatly increases the chances of name clashes.  This overloading rule also provides a mechanism for extending libraries. For example, people often  wonder  why they hav e to  explicitly  mention  a  sequence  to  manipulate  a  container  using  a standard-library algorithm. For example:  The reason is the need for generality  §32.2 , but manipulating a container is by far the most com- mon case. We can accommodate that case like this:  void sort C& c  { std::sort c.begin  ,c.end   ; }  template   void sort C& c, P p  { std::sort c.begin  ,c.end  ,p ; }  Estd  my ‘‘extended std’’  provides the frequently wanted container versions of sort  . Those are of course implemented using std::sort   from  . We can use it like this:  sort v.begin  ,v.end   ;  Why not write:  sort v ;  include   namespace Estd {  using namespace std; template   }  }  using namespace Estd;  template  void print const vector & v  {  for  auto& x : v   cout << v << ' ';  cout << '\n';   412  Namespaces  Chapter 14  void f   {  std::vector  v {7, 3, 9, 4, 0, 1};  sort v ; print v ; sort v,[] int x, int y  { return x>y; } ; print v ; sort v.begin  ,v.end   ; print v ; sort v.begin  ,v.end  ,[] int x, int y  { return x>y; } ; print v ;  }  0 1 3 4 7 9 9 7 4 3 1 0 0 1 3 4 7 9 9 7 4 3 1 0  The namespace lookup rules and the overloading rules for templates ensure that we ﬁnd and invoke the correct variants of sort   and get the expected output:  If  we  removed the using  namespace  std; from Estd, this  example  would  still  work  because std’s sort  s would be found by argument-dependent lookup  §14.2.4 . However, we would then not ﬁnd the standard sort  s for our own containers deﬁned outside std.  14.4.6  Versioning The toughest test for many kinds of interfaces is to cope with a sequence of new releases  versions . Consider a widely used interface, say, an ISO C++ standard header. After some time, a new ver- sion  is  deﬁned,  say, the  C++11  version  of  the  C++98  header. Functions  may  have  been  added, classes  renamed,  proprietary  extensions   that  should  never hav e been  there   removed,  types changed, templates modiﬁed. To make life ‘‘interesting’’ for the implementer, hundreds of millions of lines of code are ‘‘out there’’ using the old header, and the implementer of the new version can- not ever see or modify them. Needless to say, breaking such code will cause howls of outrage, as will the absence of a new and better version.  The namespace facilities described so far can be used to handle this problem with very minor exceptions, but when large amounts of code are involved, ‘‘very minor’’ still means a lot of code. Consequently, there is a way of selecting between two ver- sions that simply and obviously guarantees that a user sees exactly one particular version.  This is called an inline namespace:  inline namespace V3_2 {    V3_2 provides the default meaning of Popular  namespace Popular {  double f double ; int f int ; template   class C {  * ...*  };  }   Section 14.4.6  Versioning   413  Here, Popular contains three subnamespaces, each deﬁning a version.  The inline speciﬁes that V3_2 is the default meaning of Popular. So we can write:  using namespace Popular;  f 1 ;  V3_0::f 1 ;  V2_4_2::f 1 ;      Popular ::V3_2::f int      Popular ::V3_0::f double      Popular ::V2_4_2::f double   template  Popular::C  {  * ...*  };  This inline namespace solution is intrusive; that is, to change which version  subnamespace  is the default requires modiﬁcation of the header source code. Also, naively using this way of handling versioning would involve a lot of replication  of common code in the different versions .  However, that replication can be minimized using include tricks.  For example:  namespace V3_2 {     V3_2 provides the default meaning of Popular  namespace V3_0 {     ...  } namespace V2_4_2 {  double f double ; template   class C {  * ...*  };  }  }  void f   {  }  }  }     ﬁle V3_common:     ... lots of declarations ...     ﬁle V3_2:  double f double ; int f int ; template   class C {  * ...*  };  include "V3_common"     ﬁle V3_0.h:  namespace V3_0 {  include "V3_common"   414  Namespaces     ﬁle Popular.h:  namespace Popular {  inline include "V3_2.h" include "V3_0.h" include "V2_4_2.h"  }  Chapter 14  I do not recommend such intricate use of header ﬁles unless it is really necessary. The example above  repeatedly  violates  the  rules  against  including  into  a  nonlocal  scope  and  against  having  a syntactic construct span ﬁle boundaries  the use of inline ; see §15.2.2. Sadly, I hav e seen worse.  In most cases, we can achieve versioning by less intrusive means.  The only example I can think of that is completely impossible to do by other means is the specialization of a template explicitly using  the  namespace  name   e.g., Popular::C  .  However,  in many important  cases  ‘‘in  most cases’’ isn’t good enough. Also, a solution based on a combination of other techniques is less obvi- ously completely right.  14.4.7  Nested Namespaces One obvious use of namespaces is to wrap a complete set of declarations and deﬁnitions in a sepa- rate namespace:  namespace X {     ... all mydeclarations ...  The list of declarations will, in general, contain namespaces. Thus, nested namespaces are allowed. This is allowed for practical reasons, as well as for the simple reason that constructs ought to nest unless there is a strong reason for them not to. For example:  }  }  }  void h  ;  namespace X {  void g  ;    ... namespace Y {  void f  ; void ff  ;    ...  }  void X::Y::ff   {  f  ; g  ; h  ;  The usual scope and qualiﬁcation rules apply:   Nested Namespaces  415  Section 14.4.7  void X::g   {  void h   {  f  ;  Y::f  ;      error :no f   in X    OK  f  ;  Y::f  ;  X::f  ;  X::Y::f  ;      error :no global f      error :no global Y    error :no f   in X    OK  }  }  }  }  include "header.h" namespace Mine {  int a; void f   {  * ...*  } int g   {  * ...*  }  include "header.h" namespace {  int a; void f   {  * ...*  } int g   {  * ...*  }  namespace $$$ {  int a; void f   {  * ...*  } int g   {  * ...*  }  } using namespace $$$;  For examples  of  nested  namespaces  in  the  standard  library, see chrono  §35.2   and rel_ops  §35.5.3 .  14.4.8  Unnamed Namespaces It is sometimes useful to wrap a set of declarations in a namespace simply to protect against the possibility of name clashes. That is, the aim is to preserve locality of code rather than to present an interface to users. For example:  Since we don’t want the name Mine to be known outside a local context, it simply becomes a bother to invent a redundant global name that might accidentally clash with someone else’s names.  In that case, we can simply leave the namespace without a name:  Clearly, there has to be some way of accessing members of an unnamed namespace from outside the  unnamed  namespace. Consequently, an unnamed  namespace  has  an  implied using-directive. The previous declaration is equivalent to   416  Namespaces  Chapter 14  where $$$ is  some  name  unique  to  the  scope  in  which  the  namespace  is  deﬁned. In  particular, unnamed  namespaces  in  different  translation  units  are  different.  As desired,  there  is  no  way  of naming a member of an unnamed namespace from another translation unit.  14.4.9  C Headers Consider the canonical ﬁrst C program:  include    int main   {  }  printf "Hello, world!\n" ;  namespace std {  int printf const char∗ ...  ;    ...     cstdio:  }     stdio.h:  include  using namespace std;  Breaking  this  program  wouldn’t be a good  idea. Making  standard  libraries  special  cases  isn’t a good  idea  either. Consequently, the  language  rules  for  namespaces  are  designed  to  make it rela- tively easy to take a program written without namespaces and turn it into a more explicitly struc- tured one using namespaces. In fact, the calculator program  §10.2  is an example of this.  One way to provide the standard C I O facilities in a namespace would be to place the declara-  tions from the C header stdio.h in a namespace std:  Given this  , we could provide backward compatibility by adding a using-directive:  This   makes the Hello, world! program compile. Unfortunately, the using-directive makes ev ery name from namespace std accessible in the global namespace. For example:  include   vector v1; include   vector v2;     carefully avoids polluting the global namespace    error :no ‘‘vector’’inglobal scope    contains a ‘‘using namespace std;’’    oops: this nowwor ks  So the standard requires that   place only names from   in the global scope. This can be done by providing a using-declaration for each declaration in  :     stdio.h:  include  using std::printf;    ...   Section 14.4.9  C Headers   417  Another  advantage  is  that  the using-declaration  for printf   prevents  a  user  from   accidentally  or deliberately   deﬁning  a  nonstandard printf   in  the  global  scope. I consider  nonlocal using-direc- tives primarily a transition tool. I also use them for essential foundation libraries, such as the ISO C++ standard library  std .  Most code referring to names from other namespaces can be expressed more clearly with explicit qualiﬁcation and using-declarations.  The relationship between namespaces and linkage is described in §15.2.5.  14.5  Advice [1]  Use namespaces to express logical structure; §14.3.1.

To better manage these components, we can represent the program as a set of  source code  ﬁles  where  each  ﬁle  contains  one  or  more  logical  components. Our  task  is  to  devise  a  physical structure  set of ﬁles  for the program that represents the logical components in a consistent, com- prehensible,  and  ﬂexible  manner. In particular, we aim  for  a  clean  separation  of  interfaces   e.g., function declarations  and implementations  e.g., function deﬁnitions . A ﬁle is the traditional unit of storage  in a ﬁle system  and the traditional unit of compilation. There are systems that do not store, compile, and present C++ programs to the programmer as sets of ﬁles. However, the discus- sion here will concentrate on systems that employ the traditional use of ﬁles.  Having  a  complete  program  in  one  ﬁle  is  usually  impossible. In  particular, the  code  for  the standard  libraries  and  the  operating  system  is  typically  not  supplied  in  source  form  as  part  of  a   420   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  user’s program.  For realistically sized applications, even having all of the user’s own code in a sin- gle ﬁle is both impractical and inconvenient.  The way a program is organized into ﬁles can help emphasize its logical structure, help a human reader understand the program, and help the compiler enforce that logical structure. Where the unit of compilation is a ﬁle, all of the ﬁle must be recom- piled whenever a  change  however small  has been made to it or to something on which it depends. For even a moderately sized program, the amount of time spent recompiling can be signiﬁcantly reduced by partitioning the program into ﬁles of suitable size.  A user presents a source ﬁle to the compiler. The ﬁle is then preprocessed; that is, macro pro- cessing  §12.6  is done and include directives bring in headers  §2.4.1, §15.2.2 . The result of pre- processing is called a translation unit. This unit is what the compiler proper works on and what the C++ language rules describe. In this book, I differentiate between source ﬁle and translation unit only where necessary to distinguish what the programmer sees from what the compiler considers.  To  enable  separate  compilation,  the  programmer  must  supply  declarations  providing  the  type information needed to analyze a translation unit in isolation from the rest of the program. The dec- larations in a program consisting of many separately compiled parts must be consistent in exactly the same way the declarations in a program consisting of a single source ﬁle must be. Your system has tools to help ensure this. In particular, the linker can detect many kinds of inconsistencies. The linker is the program that binds together the separately compiled parts. A linker is sometimes  con- fusingly  called a loader. Linking can be done completely before a program starts to run. Alterna- tively, new code can be added to the running program  ‘‘dynamically linked’’  later.  The organization of a program into source ﬁles is commonly called the physical structure of a program.  The physical separation of a program into separate ﬁles should be guided by the logical structure of the program. The same dependency concerns that guide the composition of programs out of namespaces guide its composition into source ﬁles. However, the logical and physical struc- tures of a program need not be identical. For example, it can be helpful to use several source ﬁles to store the functions from a single namespace, to store a collection of namespace deﬁnitions in a single ﬁle, or to scatter the deﬁnition of a namespace over sev eral ﬁles  §14.3.3 .  Here, we will ﬁrst consider some technicalities relating to linking and then discuss two ways of  breaking the desk calculator  §10.2, §14.3.1  into ﬁles.  15.2  Linkage Names  of  functions,  classes,  templates,  variables,  namespaces,  enumerations,  and  enumerators must be used consistently across all translation units unless they are explicitly speciﬁed to be local. It  is  the  programmer’s task  to  ensure  that  every  namespace,  class,  function,  etc.,  is  properly declared in every translation unit in which it appears and that all declarations referring to the same entity are consistent. For example, consider two ﬁles:     ﬁle1.cpp:  int x = 1; int f   {  * do something*  }   Section 15.2  Linkage   421     ﬁle2.cpp:  extern int x; int f  ; void g   { x = f  ; }     ﬁle1.cpp:  int x = 1; int b = 1; extern int c;     ﬁle2.cpp: int x; extern double b; extern int c;  The x and f   used by g   in ﬁle2.cpp are the ones deﬁned in ﬁle1.cpp. The keyword extern indicates that the declaration of x in ﬁle2.cpp is  just  a declaration and not a deﬁnition  §6.3 . Had x been initialized, extern would simply be ignored because a declaration with an initializer is always a deﬁ- nition.  An object must be deﬁned exactly once in a program. It may be declared many times, but the types must agree exactly. For example:     means ‘‘int x = 0;’’  There  are  three  errors  here: x is  deﬁned  twice, b is  declared  twice  with  different  types,  and c is declared twice but not deﬁned. These kinds of errors  linkage errors  cannot be detected by a com- piler that looks at only one ﬁle at a time. Many,  howev er, are detectable by the linker. For exam- ple,  all  implementations  I  know of correctly  diagnose  the  double  deﬁnition  of x. Howev er,  the inconsistent declarations of b are uncaught on popular implementations, and the missing deﬁnition of c is typically only caught if c is used.  Note that a variable deﬁned without an initializer in the global or a namespace scope is initial- ized by default  §6.3.5.1 . This is not the case for non-static local variables or objects created on the free store  §11.2 .  Outside a class body, an entity must be declared before it is used  §6.3.4 . For example:     ﬁle1.cpp:  int g   { return f  +7; } int f   { return x; } int x;     error :f   not  yet  declared    error :xnot  yet  declared  A name that can be used in translation units different from the one in which it was deﬁned is said to have external linkage. All the names in the previous examples have external linkage. A name that can be referred to only in the translation unit in which it is deﬁned is said to have internal linkage. For example:  static int x1 = 1; const char x2 = 'a';     internallinkage: not accessible from other translation units    internallinkage: not accessible from other translation units  When  used  in  namespace  scope   including  the  global  scope;  §14.2.1 ,  the  keyword static  some- what  illogically   means  ‘‘not  accessible  from  other  source  ﬁles’’  i.e.,  internal  linkage . If  you wanted x1 to be accessible from other source ﬁles  ‘‘have  external linkage’’ , you should remove the static. The keyword const implies default internal linkage, so if you wanted x2 to have external linkage, you need to precede its deﬁnitions with extern:   422   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  int x1 = 1; extern const char x2 = 'a';     exter nallinkage: accessible from other translation units    exter nallinkage: accessible from other translation units  Names that a linker does not see, such as the names of local variables, are said to have no linkage.  An inline function   §12.1.3,  §16.2.8   must  be  deﬁned  identically  in  every  translation  unit  in  which it is used  §15.2.3 . Consequently, the following example isn’t just bad taste; it is illegal:  Unfortunately, this error is hard for an implementation to catch, and the following – otherwise per- fectly  logical  –  combination  of  external  linkage  and  inlining  is  banned  to  make life  simpler  for compiler writers:     error :g   undeﬁned in this translation unit  We keep inline function deﬁnitions consistent by using header ﬁles §15.2.2 . For example:  inline int f int i  { return i; }     ﬁle1.cpp:     ﬁle2.cpp:  inline int f int i  { return i+1; }     ﬁle1.cpp:  extern inline int g int i ; int h int i  { return g i ; }     ﬁle2.cpp:  extern inline int g int i  { return i+1; }    ...  inline int next int i  { return i+1; }     h.h:     ﬁle1.cpp:  include "h.h" int h int i  { return next i ; }     ﬁne     ﬁle2.cpp:  include "h.h"    ...     ﬁle1.cpp:  using T = int; const int x = 7; constexpr T c2 = x+1;     ﬁle2.cpp:  using T = double; const int x = 8; constexpr T c2 = x+9;  By  default, const objects   §7.5 , constexpr objects   §10.4 ,  type  aliases   §6.5 ,  and  anything declared static  §6.3.4  in a namespace scope have internal linkage. Consequently, this example is legal  although potentially confusing :   Section 15.2  Linkage   423  To ensure consistency, place aliases, consts, constexprs, and inlines in header ﬁles  §15.2.2 .  A const can be given external linkage by an explicit declaration:  The techniques for managing template deﬁnitions are described in §23.7.  15.2.1  File-Local Names Global variables are in general best avoided because they cause maintenance problems. In particu- lar, it is hard to know where in a program they are used, and they can be a source of data races in multi-threaded programs  §41.2.4 , leading to very obscure bugs.  Placing variables in a namespace helps a bit, but such variables are still subject to data races. If you must use global variables, at least restrict their use to a single source ﬁle. This restriction  can be achieved in one of two ways:  [1]  Place declarations in an unnamed namespace. [2]  Declare an entity static.  An  unnamed  namespace   §14.4.8   can  be  used  to  make names  local  to  a  compilation  unit. The effect of an unnamed namespace is very similar to that of internal linkage. For example:     ﬁle1.cpp:  extern const int a = 77;     ﬁle2.cpp:  extern const int a;  void g   {  }  cout << a << '\n';  Here, g   will print 77.     ﬁle 1.cpp:  namespace {  class X {  * ...*  }; void f  ; int i;    ...  }     ﬁle2.cpp:  class X {  * ...*  }; void f  ; int i;    ...  The function f   in ﬁle1.cpp is not the same function as the f   in ﬁle2.cpp. Having a name local to a translation unit and also using that same name elsewhere for an entity with external linkage is ask- ing for trouble.  The  keyword static  confusingly   means  ‘‘use  internal  linkage’’  §44.2.3 .  That’s an unfortu-  nate leftover from the earliest days of C.   424   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  15.2.2  Header Files The types in all declarations of the same object, function, class, etc., must be consistent. Conse- quently, the  source  code  submitted  to  the  compiler  and  later  linked  together  must  be  consistent. One imperfect but simple method of achieving consistency for declarations in different translation units  is  to include header  ﬁles containing  interface  information  in  source  ﬁles  containing executable code and or data deﬁnitions.  The include mechanism is a text manipulation facility for gathering source program fragments  together into a single unit  ﬁle  for compilation. Consider:  include "to_be_included"  The include-directive replaces the line in which the include appears with the contents of the ﬁle to_be_included. The content of to_be_included should be C++ source text because the compiler will proceed to read it.  To include standard-library headers, use the angle brackets,  , around the name instead of  quotes.  For example:  include   include "myheader.h"      from standard include directory    from current directory  Unfortunately, spaces are signiﬁcant within the   or " " of an include directive:  include       will not ﬁnd    It seems extravagant to recompile a source ﬁle each time it is included somewhere, but the text can be a reasonably dense encoding for program interface information, and the compiler need only ana- lyze details actually used  e.g., template bodies are often not completely analyzed until instantiation time; §26.3 . Furthermore, most modern C++ implementations provide some form of  implicit or explicit  precompiling of header ﬁles to minimize the work needed to handle repeated compilation of the same header.  As a rule of thumb, a header may contain:  Named namespaces inline namespaces Type deﬁnitions Template declarations Template deﬁnitions Function declarations inline function deﬁnitions constexpr function deﬁnitions Data declarations const deﬁnitions constexpr deﬁnitions Enumerations Name declarations Type aliases  namespace N {  ∗ ... ∗  } inline namespace N {  ∗ ... ∗  } struct  Point { int x, y; }; template  class Z; template  class V {  ∗ ... ∗  }; extern int strlen const char∗ ; inline char get char∗ p  {  ∗ ... ∗  } constexpr int fac int n  { return  n<2  ? 1 : fac n−1 ; } extern int a; const ﬂoat pi = 3.141593; constexpr ﬂoat pi2 = pi∗pi; enum class Light { red, yellow, green }; class  Matrix; using value_type = long;   Section 15.2.2  Header Files  425  Compile-time assertions Include directives Macro deﬁnitions Conditional compilation directives Comments  static_assert 4<=sizeof int ,"small ints" ; include  deﬁne VERSION 12.03 ifdef __cplusplus  ∗ check for end of ﬁle ∗   This rule of thumb for what may be placed in a header is not a language requirement. It is simply a reasonable  way  of  using  the include mechanism  to  express  the  physical  structure  of  a  program. Conversely, a header should never contain:  Ordinary function deﬁnitions Data deﬁnitions Aggregate deﬁnitions Unnamed namespaces using-directives  char get char∗ p  {return ∗p++; } int a; short tbl[] = { 1, 2, 3 }; namespace {  ∗ ... ∗  } using namespace Foo;  Including a header containing such deﬁnitions will lead to errors or  in the case of the using-direc- tive  to confusion.  Header ﬁles are conventionally sufﬁxed by .h, and ﬁles containing function or data deﬁnitions are sufﬁxed by .cpp. They are therefore often referred to as ‘‘.h ﬁles’’ and ‘‘.cpp ﬁles,’’  respectively. Other conventions, such as .c, .C, .cxx, .cc, .hh, and hpp are also found. The manual for your compiler will be quite speciﬁc about this issue.  The reason for recommending that the deﬁnition of simple constants, but not the deﬁnition of aggregates, be placed in header ﬁles is that it is hard for implementations to avoid replication of aggregates presented in several translation units. Furthermore, the simple cases are far more com- mon and therefore more important for generating good code.  It is wise not to be too clever about the use of include. My recommendations are:  cid:129   include only  as  headers   don’t include ‘‘ordinary  source  code  containing  variable  deﬁni- tions and non-inline functions’’ . include only complete declarations and deﬁnitions. include only in the global scope, in linkage speciﬁcation blocks, and in namespace deﬁni- tions when converting old code  §15.2.4 .   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129  Place all includes before other code to minimize unintended dependencies.  cid:129  Avoid macro magic.  cid:129  Minimize the use of names  especially aliases  not local to a header in a header.  One of my least favorite activities is tracking down an error caused by a name being macro-substi- tuted into something completely different by a macro deﬁned in an indirectly included header that I hav e never even heard of.  15.2.3  The One-Deﬁnition Rule A giv en class, enumeration, and template, etc., must be deﬁned exactly once in a program.  From a practical point of view,  this means that there must be exactly one deﬁnition of, say, a class residing in a single ﬁle somewhere.  Unfortunately, the language rule cannot be that simple. For example, the deﬁnition of a class may be composed through macro expansion  ugh! , and a def- inition  of  a  class  may  be  textually  included  in  two source  ﬁles  by include directives  §15.2.2 .   426   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  Worse, a ‘‘ﬁle’’ isn’t a concept that is part of the C++ language deﬁnition; there exist implementa- tions that do not store programs in source ﬁles.  Consequently, the rule in the standard that says that there must be a unique deﬁnition of a class, template, etc., is phrased in a somewhat more complicated and subtle manner. This rule is com- monly referred to as the one-deﬁnition rule  ‘‘the ODR’’ .  That is, two deﬁnitions of a class, tem- plate, or inline function are accepted as examples of the same unique deﬁnition if and only if  [1]  [2]  [3]   they appear in different translation units, and they are token-for-token identical, and the meanings of those tokens are the same in both translation units.  The ODR says that this example is valid and that S refers to the same class in both source ﬁles. However, it is unwise to write out a deﬁnition twice like that.  Someone maintaining ﬁle2.cpp will naturally assume that the deﬁnition of S in ﬁle2.cpp is the only deﬁnition of S and so feel free to change it. This could introduce a hard-to-detect error.  The  intent  of  the  ODR  is  to  allow inclusion  of  a  class  deﬁnition  in  different  translation  units  For example:     ﬁle1.cpp:  struct S { int a; char b; }; void f S∗ ;     ﬁle2.cpp:  struct S { int a; char b; }; void f S∗ p  {  * ...*  }  from a common source ﬁle. For example:     s.h:  struct S { int a; char b; }; void f S∗ ;     ﬁle1.cpp:  include "s.h"    use f   here     ﬁle2.cpp:  include "s.h" void f S∗ p  {  * ...*  }  or graphically:  s.h:  struct S { int a; char b; };  void f S∗ ;  ﬁle1.cpp:  include "s.h"    use f   here  ﬁle2.cpp:  include "s.h"  void f S∗ p  {  ∗ ... ∗  }   Section 15.2.3  The One-Deﬁnition Rule  427  Here are examples of the three ways of violating the ODR:     ﬁle1.cpp:  struct S1 { int a; char b; };  struct S1 { int a; char b; };     error :double deﬁnition  This is an error because a struct may not be deﬁned twice in a single translation unit.  This is an error because S2 is used to name classes that differ in a member name.  Here the two deﬁnitions of S3 are token-for-token identical, but the example is an error because the meaning of the name X has sneakily been made to differ in the two ﬁles.  Checking against inconsistent class deﬁnitions in separate translation units is beyond the ability of most C++ implementations. Consequently, declarations that violate the ODR can be a source of subtle errors. Unfortunately, the technique of placing shared deﬁnitions in headers and includeing them doesn’t protect against this last form of ODR violation. Local type aliases and macros can change the meaning of included declarations:  struct S2 { int a; char b; };     ﬁle1.cpp:     ﬁle2.cpp:  struct S2 { int a; char bb; };     error     ﬁle1.cpp:  typedef int X; struct S3 { X a; char b; };     ﬁle2.cpp:  typedef char X; struct S3 { X a; char b; };    error     s.h:  struct S { Point a; char b; };     ﬁle1.cpp:  deﬁne Point int include "s.h"    ...     ﬁle2.cpp:  class Point {  * ...*  }; include "s.h"    ...  The best defense against this kind of hackery is to make headers as self-contained as possible. For example, if class Point had been declared in the s.h header, the error would have been detected.  A template deﬁnition can be included in sev eral translation units as long as the ODR is adhered to.  This applies  even to function  template  deﬁnitions  and  to  class  templates  containing  member function deﬁnitions.   428   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  15.2.4  Standard-Library Headers The facilities of the standard library are presented through a set of standard headers  §4.1.2, §30.2 . No  sufﬁx  is  needed  for  standard-library  headers;  they are  known  to  be  headers  because  they are included using the include  syntax rather than include"...". The absence of a .h sufﬁx does not imply anything about how the header is stored. A header such as   is usually stored as a text ﬁle called map.h in some standard directory. On the other hand, standard headers are not required to be stored in a conventional manner. An implementation is allowed to take advantage of knowl- edge of the standard-library deﬁnition to optimize the standard-library implementation and the way standard headers are handled. For example, an implementation might have knowledge of the stan- dard  math  library   §40.3   built  in  and  treat include  as  a  switch  that  makes  the  standard math functions available without actually reading any ﬁle.  For each C standard-library header  , there is a corresponding standard C++ header  . For example, include  provides  what include  does.  A typical stdio.h will  look something like this:     forC++ compilers only  §15.2.5     the standard librar yis deﬁned in namespace std  §4.1.2     stdio functions have C linkage  §15.2.5    * ...*  int printf const char∗, ... ;  * ...*   ifdef __cplusplus namespace std { extern "C" { endif  ifdef __cplusplus } }    ... using std::printf;    ... endif     makeprintf available in global namespace  That is, the actual declarations are  most likely  shared, but linkage and namespace issues must be addressed  to  allow C and  C++  to  share  a  header. The  macro __cplusplus is  deﬁned  by  the  C++ compiler  §12.6.2  and can be used to distinguish C++ code from code intended for a C compiler.  15.2.5  Linkage to Non-C++ Code Typically, a C++ program contains parts written in other languages  e.g., C or Fortran .  Similarly, it is common for C++ code fragments to be used as parts of programs written mainly in some other language  e.g., Python or Matlab . Cooperation can be difﬁcult between program fragments written in different languages and even between fragments written in the same language but compiled with different  compilers. For example,  different  languages  and  different  implementations  of  the  same language may differ in their use of machine registers to hold arguments, the layout of arguments put on a stack, the layout of built-in types such as strings and integers, the form of names passed by the compiler to the linker, and the amount of type checking required from the linker. To help, one can specify a linkage convention to be used in an extern declaration.  For example, this declares the C and C++ standard-library function strcpy   and speciﬁes that it should be linked according to the  system-speciﬁc  C linkage conventions:   Section 15.2.5  Linkage to Non-C++ Code  429  extern "C" char∗ strcpy char∗, const char∗ ;  The effect of this declaration differs from the effect of the ‘‘plain’’ declaration  extern char∗ strcpy char∗, const char∗ ;  only in the linkage convention used for calling strcpy  .  The extern "C" directive is particularly useful because of the close relationship between C and C++.  Note that the C in extern "C" names a linkage convention and not a language. Often, extern "C" is used to link to Fortran and assembler routines that happen to conform to the conventions of a C implementation.  An extern "C" directive speciﬁes the linkage convention  only  and does not affect the semantics of calls to the function. In particular, a function declared extern "C" still obeys the C++ type-check- ing and argument conversion rules and not the weaker C rules. For example:  extern "C" int f  ;  int g   {  return f 1 ;     error :no argument expected  Adding extern "C" to a lot of declarations can be a nuisance. Consequently, there is a mechanism to specify linkage to a group of declarations. For example:  This construct, commonly called a linkage block, can be used to enclose a complete C header to make a header suitable for C++ use. For example:  This technique is commonly used to produce a C++ header from a C header. Alternatively, condi- tional compilation  §12.6.1  can be used to create a common C and C++ header:  }  }  extern "C" {  char∗ strcpy char∗, const char∗ ; int strcmp const char∗, const char∗ ; int strlen const char∗ ;    ...  extern "C" { include   }  ifdef __cplusplus extern "C" { endif  ifdef __cplusplus } endif  char∗ strcpy char∗, const char∗ ; int strcmp const char∗, const char∗ ; int strlen const char∗ ;    ...   430   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  The  predeﬁned  macro  name __cplusplus  §12.6.2   is  used  to  ensure  that  the  C++  constructs  are edited out when the ﬁle is used as a C header.  Any declaration can appear within a linkage block:  extern "C" { int g1; extern int g2;     anydeclaration here,for example:    deﬁnition    declaration, not deﬁnition  In particular, the scope and storage class  §6.3.4, §6.4.2  of variables are not affected, so g1 is still a global variable – and is still deﬁned rather than just declared. To  declare but not deﬁne a variable, you must apply the keyword extern directly in the declaration. For example:  extern "C" int g3; extern "C" { int g4; }     declaration, not deﬁnition    deﬁnition  This  looks  odd  at  ﬁrst  glance. However,  it is a simple  consequence  of  keeping  the  meaning unchanged  when  adding "C" to  an extern-declaration  and  the  meaning  of  a  ﬁle  unchanged  when enclosing it in a linkage block.  A name with C linkage can be declared in a namespace. The namespace will affect the way the name is accessed in the C++ program, but not the way a linker sees it. The printf   from std is a typ- ical example:  include   void f   {  std::printf "Hello, " ; printf "world!\n" ;      OK    error :no global printf    }  }  Even when called std::printf, it is still the same old C printf    §43.3 .  Note that this allows us to include libraries with C linkage into a namespace of our choice rather than polluting the global namespace. Unfortunately, the same ﬂexibility is not available to us for headers deﬁning functions with C++ linkage in the global namespace. The reason is that linkage of C++ entities must take namespaces into account so that the object ﬁles generated will reﬂect the use or lack of use of namespaces.  15.2.6  Linkage and Pointers to Functions When mixing C and C++ code fragments in one program, we sometimes want to pass pointers to functions deﬁned in one language to functions deﬁned in the other. If the two implementations of the two languages share linkage conventions and function call mechanisms, such passing of point- ers to functions is trivial.  However, such commonality cannot in general be assumed, so care must be taken to ensure that a function is called the way it expects to be called.  When linkage is speciﬁed for a declaration, the speciﬁed linkage applies to all function types, function  names,  and  variable  names  introduced  by  the  declaration s . This  makes  all  kinds  of strange – and occasionally essential – combinations of linkage possible. For example:   Section 15.2.6  Linkage and Pointers to Functions  431  typedef int  ∗FT  const void∗, const void∗ ;      FT has C++ linkage  extern "C" {  typedef int  ∗CFT  const void∗, const void∗ ;  void qsort void∗ p, size_t n, size_t sz, CFT cmp ;     CFT has C linkage    cmp has C linkage  void isort void∗ p, size_t n, size_t sz, FT cmp ; void xsort void∗ p, size_t n, size_t sz, CFT cmp ; extern "C" void ysort void∗ p, size_t n, size_t sz, FT cmp ;     cmp has C++ linkage    cmp has C linkage    cmp has C++ linkage  int compare const void∗, const void∗ ;  extern "C" int ccmp const void∗, const void∗ ;      compare   has C++ linkage    ccmp   has C linkage  }  }  void f char∗ v, int sz  {  qsort v,sz,1,&compare ;     error qsort v,sz,1,&ccmp ;      OK  isort v,sz,1,&compare ;  isort v,sz,1,&ccmp ;      OK    error  An implementation in which C and C++ use the same calling conventions might accept the declara- tions marked error as a language extension.  However, even for compatible C and C++ implementa- tions, std::function  §33.5.3  or lambdas with any form of capture  §11.4.3  cannot cross the lan- guage barrier.  15.3  Using Header Files To illustrate the use of headers, I present a few alternative ways of expressing the physical structure of the calculator program  §10.2, §14.3.1 .  15.3.1  Single-Header Organization The simplest solution to the problem of partitioning a program into several ﬁles is to put the deﬁni- tions in a suitable number of .cpp ﬁles and to declare the types, functions, classes, etc., needed for them to cooperate in a single .h ﬁle that each .cpp ﬁle includes.  That’s the initial organization I would  use  for  a  simple  program  for  my  own  use;  if  something  more  elaborate  turned  out  to  be needed, I would reorganize later.  For the  calculator  program,  we  might  use  ﬁve .cpp ﬁles  – lexer.cpp, parser.cpp, table .cpp, error.cpp, and main.cpp – to hold function and data deﬁnitions. The header dc.h holds the declara- tions of every name used in more than one .cpp ﬁle:   432   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15     dc.h:  include   include  include   namespace Parser {  double expr bool ; double term bool ; double prim bool ;  }  namespace Lexer {  };  };  struct Token {  Kind kind; string string_value; double number_value;  class Token_stream { public:  enum class Kind : char { name, number, end, plus='+', minus='−', mul='∗', div=' ’, print=';', assign='=', lp=' ', rp=' '  Token istream& s  : ip{&s}, owns false}, ct{Kind::end} { } Token istream∗ p  : ip{p}, owns{true}, ct{Kind::end} { }  ˜Token   { close  ; }  Token get  ;  Token& current  ;     read and returnnexttoken    most recently read token  void set_input istream& s  { close  ; ip = &s; owns=false; } void set_input istream∗ p  { close  ; ip = p; owns = true; }  private:  void close   { if  owns  delete ip; }  istream∗ ip;  bool owns;  Token ct {Kind::end};     pointer to an input stream     does the Token_stream own the istream?    current_token  };  }  extern Token_stream ts;   Section 15.3.1  Single-Header Organization   433  namespace Table {  extern map  table;  namespace Error {  extern int no_of_errors; double error const string& s ;  namespace Driver {  void calculate  ;  }  }  }  The keyword extern is used for every variable declaration to ensure that multiple deﬁnitions do not occur as we include  dc.h in the various .cpp ﬁles.  The corresponding deﬁnitions are found in the appropriate .cpp ﬁles.  I added standard-library headers as needed for the declarations in dc.h, but I did not add decla-  rations  such as using-declarations  needed only for the convenience of an individual .cpp ﬁle.  Leaving out the actual code, lexer.cpp will look something like this:     lexer.cpp:  include "dc.h" include   include    Lexer::Token_stream ts;     redundant: in dc.h  Lexer::Token Lexer::Token_stream::g et   {  * ...*  } Lexer::Token& Lexer::Token_stream::current   {  * ...*  }  I used explicit qualiﬁcation, Lexer::, for the deﬁnitions rather that simply enclosing them all in  namespace Lexer {  * ...*  }  That avoids the possibility of accidentally adding new members to Lexer. On the other hand, had I wanted to add members to Lexer that were not part of its interface, I would have had to reopen the namespace  §14.2.5 .  Using headers in this manner ensures that every declaration in a header will at some point be included in the ﬁle containing its deﬁnition. For example, when compiling lexer.cpp the compiler will be presented with:  namespace Lexer {     from dc.h     ... class Token_stream { public:  Token get  ;    ...  };  }   434   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15     ...  Lexer::Token Lexer::Token_stream::g et   {  * ...*  }  This ensures that the compiler will detect any inconsistencies in the types speciﬁed for a name. For example, had get   been declared to return a Token, but deﬁned to return an int, the compilation of lexer.cpp would have  failed with a type-mismatch error. If a deﬁnition is missing, the linker will catch the problem. If a declaration is missing, some .cpp ﬁles will fail to compile.  File parser.cpp will look like this:     parser.cpp:  include "dc.h"  double Parser::prim bool get  {  * ...*  } double Parser::term bool get  {  * ...*  } double Parser::expr bool get  {  * ...*  }  File table .cpp will look like this:     table.cpp:  include "dc.h"  std::map  Table::table;  The symbol table is a standard-library map.  File error.cpp becomes:     error.cpp:  include "dg.h"    anymore includes or declarations  int Error::no_of_errors; double Error::error const string& s  {  * ...*  }  Finally, ﬁle main.cpp will look like this:     main.cpp:  include "dc.h" include   include       redundant: in dc.h  void Driver::calculate   {  * ...*  }  int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  * ...*  }  To  be recognized as the main   of the program, main   must be a global function  §2.2.1, §15.4 , so no namespace is used here.   Section 15.3.1  Single-Header Organization   435  The physical structure of the system can be presented like this:                 dc.h  table .cpp  parser.cpp  main.cpp  lexer.cpp  error.cpp  The headers on the top are all headers for standard-library facilities.  For many forms of program analysis, these libraries can be ignored because they are well known and stable. For tiny programs, the structure can be simpliﬁed by moving all include directives to the common header. Similarly, for a small program, separating out error.cpp and table .cpp from main.cpp would often be excessive. This single-header style of physical partitioning is most useful when the program is small and its parts are not intended to be used separately. Note that when namespaces are used, the logical structure of the program is still represented within dc.h. If namespaces are not used, the structure is obscured, although comments can be a help.  For larger programs, the single-header-ﬁle approach is unworkable in a conventional ﬁle-based development environment.  A change to the common header forces recompilation of the whole pro- gram,  and  updates  of  that  single  header  by  several  programmers  are  error-prone.  Unless strong emphasis is placed on programming styles relying heavily on namespaces and classes, the logical structure deteriorates as the program grows.  15.3.2  Multiple-Header Organization An alternative physical organization lets each logical module have its own header deﬁning the facil- ities  it  provides.  Each .cpp ﬁle  then  has  a  corresponding .h ﬁle  specifying  what  it  provides   its interface .  Each .cpp ﬁle includes its own .h ﬁle and usually also other .h ﬁles that specify what it needs from other modules in order to implement the services advertised in the interface.  This phys- ical organization corresponds to the logical organization of a module. The interface for users is put into its .h ﬁle, the interface for implementers is put into a ﬁle sufﬁxed _impl.h, and the module’s def- initions of functions, variables, etc., are placed in .cpp ﬁles.  In this way, the parser is represented by three ﬁles. The parser’s user interface is provided by parser.h:     parser.h:  }  namespace Parser {     interface for users  double expr bool get ;  The shared environment for the functions expr  , prim  , and term  , implementing the parser is pre- sented by parser_impl.h:   436   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15     parser_impl.h:  include "parser.h" include "error.h" include "lexer.h"  using Error::error; using namespace Lexer;  double prim bool get ; double term bool get ; double expr bool get ;  }     parser.cpp:  include "parser_impl.h" include "table .h"  using Table::table;  namespace Parser {     interface for implementers  The distinction between the user interface and the interface for implementers would be even clearer had we used a Parser_impl namespace  §14.3.3 .  The user’s interface in header parser.h is included to giv e the compiler a chance to check con-  sistency  §15.3.1 .  The functions implementing the parser are stored in parser.cpp together with include directives  for the headers that the Parser functions need:  double Parser::prim bool get  {  * ...*  } double Parser::term bool get  {  * ...*  } double Parser::expr bool get  {  * ...*  }  Graphically, the parser and the driver’s use of it look like this:  parser.h  lexer.h  error.h  table .h  parser_impl.h  main.cpp  parser.cpp  As intended, this is a rather close match to the logical structure described in §14.3.1. To  simplify this structure, we could have included table .h in parser_impl.h rather than in parser.cpp. Howev er, table .h is an example of something that is not necessary to express the shared context of the parser functions; it is needed only by their implementation. In fact, it is used by just one function, prim  ,   Section 15.3.2  Multiple-Header Organization   437  so if we were really keen on minimizing dependencies we could place prim   in its own .cpp ﬁle and include table .h there only:  parser.h  lexer.h  error.h  table .h  parser_impl.h  parser.cpp  prim.cpp  Such elaboration is not appropriate except for larger modules. For realistically sized modules, it is common  to include extra  ﬁles  where  needed  for  individual  functions. Furthermore,  it  is  not uncommon to have  more than one _impl.h, since different subsets of the module’s functions need different shared contexts.  Please note that the _impl.h notation is not a standard or even a common convention; it is simply  the way I like to name things.  Why bother with this more complicated scheme of multiple header ﬁles? It clearly requires far  less thought simply to throw every declaration into a single header, as was done for dc.h.  The  multiple-header  organization  scales  to  modules  several  magnitudes  larger  than  our  toy parser and to programs several magnitudes larger than our calculator. The fundamental reason for using this type of organization is that it provides a better localization of concerns. When analyzing and modifying a large program, it is essential for a programmer to focus on a relatively small chunk of code. The multiple-header organization makes it easy to determine exactly what the parser code depends on and to ignore the rest of the program. The single-header approach forces us to look at ev ery declaration used by any module and decide if it is relevant.  The simple fact is that mainte- nance of code is invariably done with incomplete information and from a local perspective. The multiple-header organization allows us to work successfully ‘‘from the inside out’’ with only a local perspective. The single-header approach – like every other organization centered around a global repository  of  information  –  requires  a  top-down  approach  and  will  forever leave  us wondering exactly what depends on what.  The better localization leads to less information needed to compile a module, and thus to faster compiles.  The effect can be dramatic. I hav e seen compile times drop by a factor of 1000 as the result of a simple dependency analysis leading to a better use of headers.  15.3.2.1  Other Calculator Modules  The remaining calculator modules can be organized similarly to the parser. Howev er,  those mod- ules are so small that they don’t require their own _impl.h ﬁles.  Such ﬁles are needed only where the implementation of a logical module consists of many functions that need a shared context  in addition to what is provided to users .  The error handler provides its interface in error.h:   438   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  int Error::number_of_errors; double Error::error const std::string& ;  The implementation is found in error.cpp:  int Error::number_of_errors; double Error::error const std::string&  {  * ...*  }  The lexer provides a rather large and messy interface:     error.h:  include   namespace Error {     error.cpp:  include "error.h"     lexer.h:  include  include   namespace Lexer {  }  }  enum class Kind : char { * ...*  };  class Token {  * ...*  }; class Token_stream {  * ...*  };  extern Token_stream is;     lexer.cpp:  include "lexer.h" include "error.h" include   include       redundant: in lexer.h  Lexer::Token_stream is;    defaults to ‘‘read from cin’’  Lexer::Token Lexer::Token_stream::g et   {  * ...*  }; Lexer::Token& Lexer::Token_stream::current   {  * ...*  };  In addition to lexer.h, the implementation of the lexer depends on error.h and on the character-classi- ﬁcation functions in    §36.2 :  We  could have factored out the include directive for error.h as the Lexer’s _impl.h ﬁle.  However, I considered that excessive for this tiny program.   Section 15.3.2.1  Other Calculator Modules  439  As usual, we include the interface offered by the module – in this case, lexer.h – in the mod-  ule’s implementation to give the compiler a chance to check consistency.  The  symbol  table  is  essentially  self-contained,  although  the  standard-library  header    could drag in all kinds of interesting stuff to implement an efﬁcient map template class:     table.h:  include   include    namespace Table {     table.cpp:  include "table .h"  }  }  extern std::map  table;  Because we assume that every header may be included in sev eral .cpp ﬁles, we must separate the declaration of table from its deﬁnition:  std::map  Table::table;  I just stuck the driver into main.cpp:     main.cpp:  include "parser.h" include "lexer.h"  include "error.h" include "table .h" include      to be able to put main  ’sarguments into a string stream     to be able to predeﬁne names     to be able to set ts  namespace Driver {  void calculate   {  * ...*  }  int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  * ...*  }  For a larger system, it is usually worthwhile to separate out the driver and minimize what is done in main  . That way main   calls a driver function placed in a separate source ﬁle. This is particularly important for code intended to be used as a library. Then, we cannot rely on code in main   and must be prepared for the driver to be called from a variety of functions.  15.3.2.2  Use of Headers  The number of headers to use for a program is a function of many factors.  Many of these factors have  more  to  do  with  the  way  ﬁles  are  handled  on  your  system  than  with  C++. For example,  if your  editor IDE  does  not  make it convenient  to  look  at  several  ﬁles  simultaneously, then  using many headers becomes less attractive.   440   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  A word of caution: a few dozen headers plus the standard headers for the program’s execution environment   which  can  often  be  counted  in  the  hundreds   are  usually  manageable. However,  if you partition the declarations of a large program into the logically minimal-size headers  putting each structure declaration in its own ﬁle, etc. , you can easily get an unmanageable mess of hun- dreds of ﬁles even for minor projects. I ﬁnd that excessive.  For large  projects,  multiple  headers  are  unavoidable.  In such  projects,  hundreds  of  ﬁles   not counting standard headers  are the norm. The real confusion starts when they begin to be counted in the thousands. At that scale, the basic techniques discussed here still apply, but their manage- ment  becomes  a  Herculean  task. Tools,  such  as  dependency analysers,  can  be  of  great  help,  but there  is  little  they can  do  for  compiler  and  linker  performance  if  the  program  is  an  unstructured mess.  Remember that  for  realistically  sized  programs,  the  single-header  style  is  not  an  option. Such  programs  will  have  multiple  headers. The  choice  between  the  two styles  of  organization occurs  repeatedly  for the parts that make up the program.  The single-header style and the multiple-header style are not really alternatives.  They are com- plementary techniques that must be considered whenever a signiﬁcant module is designed and must be reconsidered as a system evolves.  It’s crucial to remember that one interface doesn’t serve all equally well. It is usually worthwhile to distinguish between the implementers’ interface and the users’ interface.  In addition, many larger systems are structured so that providing a simple inter- face for the majority of users and a more extensive interface for expert users is a good idea. The expert users’ interfaces  ‘‘complete interfaces’’  tend to include many more features than the aver- age user would ever want to know about.  In fact, the average users’ interface can often be identi- ﬁed by eliminating features that require the inclusion of headers that deﬁne facilities that would be unknown to the average user. The term ‘‘average user’’ is not derogatory. In the ﬁelds in which I don’t have to be an expert, I strongly prefer to be an average user. In that way, I minimize hassles.  15.3.3  Include Guards The idea of the multiple-header approach is to represent each logical module as a consistent, self- contained  unit. Viewed  from  the  program  as  a  whole,  many of the  declarations  needed  to  make each  logical  module  complete  are  redundant. For larger  programs,  such  redundancy can  lead  to errors, as a header containing class deﬁnitions or inline functions gets included twice in the same compilation unit  §15.2.3 .  We hav e two choices.  We can [1]  reorganize our program to remove the redundancy, or [2]  ﬁnd a way to allow repeated inclusion of headers.  The ﬁrst approach – which led to the ﬁnal version of the calculator – is tedious and impractical for realistically sized programs. We also need that redundancy to make the individual parts of the pro- gram comprehensible in isolation.  The beneﬁts of an analysis of redundant includes and the resulting simpliﬁcations of the pro- gram can be signiﬁcant both from a logical point of view and by reducing compile times. However, it can rarely be complete, so some method of allowing redundant includes must be applied. Prefer- ably, it must be applied systematically, since there is no way of knowing how thorough an analysis a user will ﬁnd worthwhile.   Section 15.3.3  Include Guards  441  The traditional solution is to insert include guards in headers. For example:     error.h:  ifndef CALC_ERROR_H deﬁne CALC_ERROR_H  namespace Error {     ...  }  endif      CALC_ERROR_H  The  contents  of  the  ﬁle  between  the ifndef and endif are  ignored  by  the  compiler  if CALC_ERROR_H is deﬁned. Thus, the ﬁrst time error.h is seen during a compilation, its contents are read and CALC_ERROR_H is given a value.  Should the compiler be presented with error.h again dur- ing the compilation, the contents are ignored. This is a piece of macro hackery, but it works and it is pervasive in the C and C++ worlds.  The standard headers all have include guards.  Header ﬁles are included in essentially arbitrary contexts, and there is no namespace protection against macro name clashes. Consequently, I choose rather long and ugly names for my include guards.  Once people get used to headers and include guards, they tend to include lots of headers directly and indirectly. Even with C++ implementations that optimize the processing of headers, this can be undesirable.  It can cause unnecessarily long compile time, and it can bring lots of declarations and macros  into  scope. The  latter  might  affect  the  meaning  of  the  program  in  unpredictable  and adverse ways.  Headers should be included only when necessary.  15.4  Programs A program  is  a  collection  of  separately  compiled  units  combined  by  a  linker. Every  function, object, type, etc., used in this collection must have a unique deﬁnition  §6.3, §15.2.3 . A program must contain exactly one function called main    §2.2.1 .  The main computation performed by the program starts with the invocation of the global function main   and ends with a return from main  . The return type of main   is int, and the following two versions of main   are supported by all imple- mentations:  int main   {  * ...*  } int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  * ...*  }  A program  can  only  provide  one  of  those  two alternatives.  In addition,  an  implementation  can allow other versions of main  . The argc, argv version is used to transmit arguments from the pro- gram’s environment; see §10.2.7.  The int returned by main   is passed to whatever system invoked main   as the result of the pro-  gram.  A nonzero return value from main   indicates an error.  This simple story must be elaborated on for programs that contain global variables  §15.4.1  or  that throw an uncaught exception  §13.5.2.5 .   442   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  15.4.1  Initialization of Nonlocal Variables In  principle,  a  variable  deﬁned  outside  any function   that  is,  global,  namespace,  and  class static variables  is initialized before main   is invoked.  Such nonlocal variables in a translation unit are initialized in their deﬁnition order. If such a variable has no explicit initializer, it is by default ini- tialized to the default for its type  §17.3.3 . The default initializer value for built-in types and enu- merations is 0. For example:  double x = 2; double y; double sqx = sqrt x+y ;     nonlocal var iables  Here, x and y are initialized before sqx, so sqrt 2  is called.  There is no guaranteed order of initialization of global variables in different translation units. Consequently, it is unwise to create order dependencies between initializers of global variables in different compilation units. In addition, it is not possible to catch an exception thrown by the ini- tializer of a global variable  §13.5.2.5 . It is generally best to minimize the use of global variables and in particular to limit the use of global variables requiring complicated initialization.  Several techniques exist for enforcing an order of initialization of global variables in different translation units. However, none are both portable and efﬁcient.  In particular, dynamically linked libraries do not coexist happily with global variables that have complicated dependencies.  Often, a function returning a reference is a good alternative to a global variable.  For example:  int& use_count   {  static int uc = 0; return uc;  }  }  void f   {  A call use_count   now acts as a global variable except that it is initialized at its ﬁrst use  §7.7 . For example:  cout << ++use_count  ;    ...     read and increment  Like other  uses  of static, this  technique  is  not  thread-safe. The  initialization  of  a  local static is thread-safe  §42.3.3 . In this case, the initialization is even with a constant expression  §10.4 , so that it is done at link time and not subject to data races  §42.3.3 . However,  the ++ can lead to a data race.  The initialization of nonlocal  statically allocated  variables is controlled by whatever mecha- nism an implementation uses to start up a C++ program. This mechanism is guaranteed to work properly only if main   is executed.  Consequently, one should avoid nonlocal variables that require run-time initialization in C++ code intended for execution as a fragment of a non-C++ program.  Note  that  variables  initialized  by  constant  expressions   §10.4   cannot  depend  on  the  value  of objects from other translation units and do not require run-time initialization. Such variables are therefore safe to use in all cases.   Section 15.4.2  Initialization and Concurrency   443  15.4.2  Initialization and Concurrency Consider:  int x = 3; int y = sqrt ++x ;  What could be the values of x and y? The obvious answer is ‘‘3 and 2!’’ Why? The initialization of a statically allocated object with a constant expression is done at link time, so x becomes 3. How- ev er, y’s  initializer is not a constant expression  sqrt   is no constexpr , so y is not initialized until run time. However,  the order of initialization of statically allocated objects in a single translation unit is well deﬁned: they are initialized in deﬁnition order  §15.4.1 . So, y becomes 2.  The ﬂaw in this argument is that if multiple threads are used  §5.3.1, §42.2 , each will do the run-time  initialization. No  mutual  exclusion  is  implicitly  provided  to  prevent  a  data  race. Then, sqrt ++x  in one thread may happen before or after the other thread manages to increment x. So, the value of y may be sqrt 4  or sqrt 5 .  To avoid such problems, we should  as usual :  cid:129  Minimize  the  use  of  statically  allocated  objects  and  keep  their  initialization  as  simple  as  possible.   cid:129  Avoid dependencies on dynamically initialized objects in other translation units  §15.4.1 .  In addition, to avoid data races in initialization, try these techniques in order:  [1]   Initialize using constant expressions  note that built-in types without initializers are ini- tialized to zero and that standard containers and strings are initialized to empty by link- time initialization . Initialize using expressions without side effects. Initialize in a known single-threaded ‘‘startup phase’’ of computation.  [2]  [3]  [4]  Use some form of mutual exclusion  §5.3.4, §42.3 .  15.4.3  Program Termination A program can terminate in several ways:  [1]  By returning from main   [2]  By calling exit   [3]  By calling abort   [4]  By throwing an uncaught exception [5]  By violating noexcept [6]  By calling quick_exit    In addition, there are a variety of ill-behaved and implementation-dependent ways of making a pro- gram crash  e.g., dividing a double by zero .  If  a  program  is  terminated  using  the  standard-library  function exit  , the  destructors  for  con- structed static objects are called  §15.4.1, §16.2.12 . However,  if the program is terminated using the standard-library function abort  , they are not. Note that this implies that exit   does not termi- nate  a  program  immediately. Calling exit   in  a  destructor  may  cause  an  inﬁnite  recursion. The type of exit   is:  void exit int ;   444   Source Files and Programs   Chapter 15  Like the return value of main    §2.2.1 , exit  ’s argument is returned to ‘‘the system’’ as the value of the program. Zero indicates successful completion.  Calling exit   means that the local variables of the calling function and its callers will not have their  destructors  invoked.  Throwing  an  exception  and  catching  it  ensures  that  local  objects  are properly destroyed  §13.5.1 . Also, a call of exit   terminates the program without giving the caller of the function that called exit   a chance to deal with the problem. It is therefore often best to leave a context  by  throwing  an  exception  and  letting  a  handler  decide  what  to  do  next.  For  example, main   may catch every exception  §13.5.2.2 .  The C  and C++  standard-library function atexit   offers the possibility to have code executed at  program termination. For example:  void my_cleanup  ;  void somewhere   {  } else {  }  }  if  atexit &my_cleanup ==0  {     my_cleanup will be called at normal termination     oops: too manyatexit functions  This strongly resembles the automatic invocation of destructors for global variables at program ter- mination  §15.4.1, §16.2.12 . An argument to atexit   cannot take arguments or return a result, and there  is  an  implementation-deﬁned  limit  to  the  number  of  atexit  functions. A nonzero  value returned  by atexit   indicates  that  the  limit  is  reached. These  limitations  make atexit   less  useful than it appears at ﬁrst glance. Basically, atexit   is a C workaround for the lack of destructors.  The  destructor  of  a  constructed  statically  allocated  object   §6.4.2   created  before  a  call  of atexit f  will be invoked after f is invoked.  The destructor of such an object created after a call of atexit f  will be invoked before f is invoked.  The quick_exit   function is like exit   except that it does not invoke any destructors.  You register  functions to be invoked by quick_exit   using at_quick_exit  .  The exit  , abort  , quick_exit  , atexit  , and at_quick_exit   functions are declared in  .  15.5  Advice [1]  Use header ﬁles to represent interfaces and to emphasize logical structure; §15.1, §15.3.2.

In  addition,  derived classes   §3.2.4,  Chapter  20   and  templates   §3.4,  Chapter  23   allow the  pro- grammer to express  hierachical and parametric  relationships among classes and to take advantage of such relationships.  A type is a concrete representation of a concept  an idea, a notion, etc. . For example, the C++ built-in type ﬂoat with its operations +, −, ∗, etc., provides a concrete approximation of the mathe- matical concept of a real number. A class is a user-deﬁned type. We  design a new type to provide a deﬁnition of a concept that has no direct counterpart among the built-in types. For example, we might provide a type Trunk_line in a program dealing with telephony,  a  type Explosion for a video game, or a type list  for a text-processing program. A program that provides types that closely  match  the  concepts  of  the  application  tends  to  be  easier  to  understand,  easier  to  reason about, and easier to modify than a program that does not. A well-chosen set of user-deﬁned types   450  Classes  Chapter 16  also makes a program more concise. In addition, it makes many sorts of code analysis feasible. In particular, it enables the compiler to detect illegal uses of objects that would otherwise be found only through exhaustive testing.  The fundamental idea in deﬁning a new type is to separate the incidental details of the imple- mentation  e.g., the layout of the data used to store an object of the type  from the properties essen- tial to the correct use of it  e.g., the complete list of functions that can access the data . Such a sep- aration is best expressed by channeling all uses of the data structure and its internal housekeeping routines through a speciﬁc interface.  This chapter focuses on relatively simple ‘‘concrete’’ user-deﬁned types that logically don’t dif-  fer much from built-in types:  §16.2  Class Basics introduces the basic facilities for deﬁning a class and its members. §16.3  Concrete Classes discusses the design of elegant and efﬁcient concrete classes.  The following chapters go into greater detail and presents abstract classes and class hierarchies:  Chapter 17  Chapter 18  Chapter 19  Chapter 20  Chapter 21  Chapter 22  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move presents the variety of ways to control initialization  of  objects  of  a  class,  how to copy and  move objects,  and  how to provide  ‘‘cleanup  actions’’ to be performed  when  an  object  is  destroyed   e.g., goes out of scope . Operator Overloading explains how to deﬁne unary and binary operators  such as +, ∗, and !  for user-deﬁned types and how to use them. Special Operators considers how to deﬁne and use operators  such as [],   , −>, new  that are ‘‘special’’ in that they are commonly used in ways that differ from arithmetic and logical operators. In particular, this chapter shows how to deﬁne a string class. Derived  Classes introduces  the  basic  language  features  supporting  object-ori- ented programming. Base and derived classes, virtual functions, and access con- trol are covered. Class Hierarchies focuses on the use of base and derived classes to effectively organize  code  around  the  notion  of  class  hierarchies. Most  of  this  chapter  is devoted to discussion of programming techniques, but technical aspects of multi- ple inheritance  classes with more than one base class  are also covered. Run-Time  Type  Information describes  the  techniques  for  explicitly  navigating class hierarchies. In particular, the type conversion operations dynamic_cast and static_cast are presented, as is the operation for determining the type of an object given one of its base classes  typeid .  16.2  Class Basics Here is a very brief summary of classes:   cid:129  A class is a user-deﬁned type.  cid:129  A class consists of a set of members. The most common kinds of members are data mem-   cid:129  Member  functions  can  deﬁne  the  meaning  of  initialization   creation ,  copy,  move, and  bers and member functions.  cleanup  destruction .   Section 16.2  Class Basics  451   cid:129  Members are accessed using .  dot  for objects and −>  arrow  for pointers.  cid:129  Operators, such as +, !, and [], can be deﬁned for a class.  cid:129  A class is a namespace containing its members.  cid:129  The public members  provide  the  class’s interface  and  the private members  provide  imple-  mentation details.   cid:129  A struct is a class where members are by default public.  For example:  class X { private:   int m;  public:      the representation  implementation  is private  X int i =0  :m{i} { }     the user interface is public    aconstr uctor initializethe data member m   int mf int i  {  int old = m; m = i; return old;     amember function     set a newvalue    returnthe old value  X var {7};    avar iable of type X, initialized to 7  }  };  int user X var, X∗ ptr  {  int x = var.mf 7 ;  int y = ptr−>mf 9 ; int z = var.m;      access using .  dot     access using ->  arrow     error :cannot access private member  }  };  The following sections expand on this and give rationale.  The style is tutorial: a gradual develop- ment of ideas, with details postponed until later.  16.2.1  Member Functions Consider implementing the concept of a date using a struct  §2.3.1, §8.2  to deﬁne the representa- tion of a Date and a set of functions for manipulating variables of this type:  struct Date {     representation  int d, m, y;  void init_date Date& d, int, int, int ; void add_year Date& d, int n ; void add_month Date& d, int n ; void add_day Date& d, int n ;     initialized    add n years to d    add n months to d    add n days to d  There is no explicit connection between the data type, Date, and these functions. Such a connection can be established by declaring the functions as members:   452  Classes  struct Date {  int d, m, y;  void init int dd, int mm, int yy ; void add_year int n ; void add_month int n ; void add_day int n ;     initialize    add n years    add n months    add n days  Chapter 16  Functions declared within a class deﬁnition  a struct is a kind of class; §16.2.4  are called member functions and can be invoked only for a speciﬁc variable of the appropriate type using the standard syntax for structure member access  §8.2 . For example:  };  }  }  Date my_bir thday;  void f   {  Date today;  today.init 16,10,1996 ; my_bir thday.init 30,12,1950 ;  Date tomorrow = today; tomorrow.add_day 1 ;    ...  void Date::init int dd, int mm, int yy  {  d = dd; m = mm; y = yy;  Because different structures can have member functions with the same name, we must specify the structure name when deﬁning a member function:  In a member function, member names can be used without explicit reference to an object. In that case, the name refers to that member of the object for which the function was invoked.  For exam- ple,  when Date::init   is  invoked for today, m=mm assigns  to today.m. On the  other  hand,  when Date::init   is  invoked for my_bir thday, m=mm assigns  to my_bir thday.m. A class  member  function ‘‘knows’’ for which object it was invoked.  But see §16.2.12 for the notion of a static member.  16.2.2  Default Copying By default, objects can be copied. In particular, a  class object can be initialized with a copy of an object of its class. For example:  Date d1 = my_bir thday;  Date d2 {my_bir thday};      initialization bycopy    initialization bycopy   Section 16.2.2  Default Copying  453  By default, the copy of a class object is a copy of each member. If that default is not the behavior wanted for a class X, a more appropriate behavior can be provided  §3.3, §17.5 .  Similarly, class objects can by default be copied by assignment. For example:  void f Date& d  {  d = my_bir thday;  }  Again, the default semantics is memberwise copy.  If that is not the right choice for a class X, the user can deﬁne an appropriate assignment operator  §3.3, §17.5 .  16.2.3  Access Control The declaration of Date in the previous subsection provides a set of functions for manipulating a Date. Howev er, it does not specify that those functions should be the only ones to depend directly on Date’s representation and the only ones to directly access objects of class Date. This restriction can be expressed by using a class instead of a struct:  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:  void init int dd, int mm, int yy ;     initialize  void add_year int n ; void add_month int n ; void add_day int n ;     add n years    add n months    add n days  };  }  }  The public label separates the class body into two parts.  The names in the ﬁrst, private, part can be used only by member functions. The second, public, part constitutes the public interface to objects of the class. A struct is simply a class whose members are public by default  §16.2.4 ; member functions can be deﬁned and used exactly as before. For example:  void Date::add_year int n  {  y += n;  However, nonmember functions are barred from using private members. For example:  void timewarp Date& d  {  d.y −= 200;     error :Date::y is private  The init   function is now essential because making the data private forces us to provide a way of initializing members. For example:  Date dx; dx.m = 3; dx.init 25,3,2011 ;      error :misprivate    OK   454  Classes  Chapter 16  There are several beneﬁts to be obtained from restricting access to a data structure to an explicitly declared  list  of  functions. For example,  any error  causing  a Date to  take on an illegal value   for example, December 36, 2016  must be caused by code in a member function. This implies that the ﬁrst stage of debugging – localization – is completed before the program is even run.  This is a spe- cial case of the general observation that any change to the behavior of the type Date can and must be effected by changes to its members. In particular, if we change the representation of a class, we need  only  change  the  member  functions  to  take advantage  of  the  new representation.  User code directly depends only on the public interface and need not be rewritten  although it may need to be recompiled .  Another advantage is that a potential user need examine only the deﬁnitions of the member functions in order to learn to use a class. A more subtle, but most signiﬁcant, advantage is that focusing on the design of a good interface simply leads to better code because thoughts and time otherwise devoted to debugging are expended on concerns related to proper use.  The protection of private data relies on restriction of the use of the class member names. It can therefore be circumvented by address manipulation  §7.4.1  and explicit type conversion  §11.5 . But this, of course, is cheating. C++ protects against accident rather than deliberate circumvention  fraud .  Only hardware can offer perfect protection against malicious use of a general-purpose lan- guage, and even that is hard to do in realistic systems.  16.2.4 class and struct The construct  class X { ... };  struct S {  * ...*  };  is simply shorthand for  class S { public:  * ...*  };  is  called  a class  deﬁnition; it deﬁnes  a  type  called X. For  historical  reasons,  a  class  deﬁnition  is often referred to as a class declaration. Also, like declarations that are not deﬁnitions, a class deﬁ- nition can be replicated in different source ﬁles using include without violating the one-deﬁnition rule  §15.2.3 .  By deﬁnition, a struct is a class in which members are by default public; that is,  These  two deﬁnitions  of S are  interchangeable,  though  it  is  usually  wise  to  stick  to  one  style. Which style you use depends on circumstances and taste. I tend to use struct for classes that I think of as ‘‘just simple data structures.’’  If I think of a class as ‘‘a proper type with an invariant,’’  I  use class. Constructors  and  access  functions  can  be  quite  useful  even for structs,  but  as  a  shorthand rather than guarantors of invariants  §2.4.3.2, §13.4 .  By default, members of a class are private:  class Date1 {  int d, m, y;  public:  };     private bydefault  Date1 int dd, int mm, int yy ; void add_year int n ;     add n years   Section 16.2.4  class and struct  455  However, we can also use the access speciﬁer private: to say that the members following are private, just as public: says that the members following are public:  Except for the different name, Date1 and Date2 are equivalent.  It is not a requirement to declare data ﬁrst in a class. In fact, it often makes sense to place data  members last to emphasize the functions providing the public user interface.  For example:  In  real  code,  where  both  the  public  interface  and  the  implementation  details  typically  are  more extensive than in tutorial examples, I usually prefer the style used for Date3.  Access speciﬁers can be used many times in a single class declaration. For example:  struct Date2 { private:  int d, m, y;  public:  };  class Date3 { public:  private:  int d, m, y;  };  class Date4 { public:  int d, m, y;  private:  public:  };  Date2 int dd, int mm, int yy ; void add_year int n ;     add n years  Date3 int dd, int mm, int yy ; void add_year int n ;     add n years  Date4 int dd, int mm, int yy ;  void add_year int n ;     add n years  Having more than one public section, as in Date4, tends to be messy, though, and might affect the object  layout   §20.5 . So  does  having  more  than  one  private  section. However,  allowing  many access speciﬁers in a class is useful for machine-generated code.  16.2.5  Constructors The use of functions such as init   to provide initialization for class objects is inelegant and error- prone.  Because it is nowhere stated that an object must be initialized, a programmer can forget to do so – or do so twice  often with equally disastrous results . A better approach is to allow the pro- grammer  to  declare  a  function  with  the  explicit  purpose  of  initializing  objects. Because  such  a function constructs values of a given type, it is called a constructor. A constructor is recognized by having the same name as the class itself. For example:   };  };  456  Classes  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:  Chapter 16  Date int dd, int mm, int yy ;    ...     constructor  When a class has a constructor, all objects of that class will be initialized by a constructor call. If the constructor requires arguments, these arguments must be supplied:  Date today = Date 23,6,1983 ; Date xmas 25,12,1990 ; Date my_bir thday;  Date release1_0 10,12 ;     abbreviated for m    error :initializer missing    error :third argument missing  Date today = Date {23,6,1983}; Date xmas {25,12,1990}; Date release1_0 {10,12};     abbreviated for m    error :third argument missing  Since a constructor deﬁnes initialization for a class, we can use the {}-initializer notation:  I recommend the {} notation over the    notation for initialization because it is explicit about what is being  done   initialization ,  avoids  some  potential  mistakes,  and  can  be  used  consistently   §2.2.2, §6.3.5 .  There are cases where    notation must be used  §4.4.1, §17.3.2.1 , but they are rare.  By providing several constructors, we can provide a variety of ways of initializing objects of a  type.  For example:  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:     ...  Date int, int, int ; Date int, int ; Date int ;  Date  ;  Date const char∗ ;      day, month, year    day, month, today’syear    day, today’smonth and year    default Date: today    date in string representation  Date today {4};  Date july4 {"July 4, 1983"}; Date guy {5,11}; Date now;  Date start {};      4, today.m, today.y     5, November,today.y    default initialized as today    default initialized as today  Constructors obey the same overloading rules as do ordinary functions  §12.3 . As long as the con- structors differ sufﬁciently in their argument types, the compiler can select the correct one for a use:  The  proliferation  of  constructors  in  the Date example  is  typical. When  designing  a  class,  a  pro- grammer is always tempted to add features just because somebody might want them. It takes more thought  to  carefully  decide  what  features  are  really  needed  and  to  include  only  those. However, that  extra  thought  typically  leads  to  smaller  and  more  comprehensible  programs. One  way  of   Section 16.2.5  Constructors   457  reducing the number of related functions is to use default arguments  §12.2.5 . For Date, each argu- ment can be given a default value interpreted as ‘‘pick the default: today.’’  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:  Date int dd =0, int mm =0, int yy =0 ;    ...  Date::Date int dd, int mm, int yy  {  d = dd ? dd : today.d; m = mm ? mm : today.m; y = yy ? yy : today.y;     checkthat the Date is valid  };  }  };  }  When an argument value is used to indicate ‘‘pick the default,’’  the value chosen must be outside the set of possible values for the argument.  For day and month, this is clearly so, but for year, zero may not be an obvious choice. Fortunately, there is no year zero on the European calendar; 1AD  year==1  comes immediately after 1BC  year==−1 .  Alternatively, we could use the default values directly as default arguments:  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:  Date int dd =today.d, int mm =today.m, int yy =today.y ;    ...  Date::Date int dd, int mm, int yy  {     checkthat the Date is valid  However, I chose to use 0 to avoid building actual values into Date’s interface.  That way,  we hav e the option to later improve the implementation of the default.  Note that by guaranteeing proper initialization of objects, the constructors greatly simplify the implementation of member functions. Given constructors, other member functions no longer have to deal with the possibility of uninitialized data  §16.3.1 .  16.2.6 explicit Constructors By default, a constructor invoked by a single argument acts as an implicit conversion from its argu- ment type to its type. For example:  complex  d {1};     d=={1,0}  §5.6.2    458  Classes  Chapter 16  Such implicit conversions can be extremely useful. Complex numbers are an example: if we leave out the imaginary part, we get a complex number on the real axis. That’s exactly what mathematics requires.  However,  in many cases, such conversions can be a signiﬁcant source of confusion and errors.  Consider Date:  void my_fct Date d ;  void f   {  Date d {15};    ... my_fct 15 ;  d = 15;     ...     obscure    obscure     plausible: x becomes {15,today.m,today.y}  At  best,  this  is  obscure. There  is  no  clear  logical  connection  between  the  number 15 and  a Date independently of the intricacies of our code.  Fortunately, we can specify that a constructor is not used as an implicit conversion.  A construc- tor declared with the keyword explicit can only be used for initialization and explicit conversions. For example:  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:  explicit Date int dd =0, int mm =0, int yy =0 ;    ...  Date d1 {15}; Date d2 = Date{15}; Date d3 = {15}; Date d4 = 15;     OK: considered explicit    OK: explicit    error :=initialization does not do implicit conversions    error :=initialization does not do implicit conversions  void f   {  my_fct 15 ;  my_fct {15} ;  my_fct Date{15} ;     ...     error :argument passing does not do implicit conversions    error :argument passing does not do implicit conversions    OK: explicit  }  };  }  An initialization with an = is considered a copy initialization. In principle, a copy of the initializer is placed into the initialized object. However, such a copy may be optimized away  elided , and a move operation  §3.3.2, §17.5.2  may be used if the initializer is an rvalue  §6.4.1 . Leaving out the = makes the initialization explicit.  Explicit initialization is known as direct initialization.  By default, declare a constructor that can be called with a single argument explicit. You need a good reason not to do so  as for complex .  If you deﬁne an implicit constructor, it is best to docu- ment your reason or a maintainer may suspect that you were forgetful  or ignorant .   Section 16.2.6  explicit Constructors   459  If a constructor is declared explicit and deﬁned outside the class, that explicit cannot be repeated:  Date::Date int dd  {  * ...*  } explicit Date::Date int dd  {  * ...*  }     OK    error  Most examples where explicit is important involve a single constructor argument.  However, explicit can also be useful for constructors with zero or more than one argument.  For example:  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:  explicit Date int dd ;    ...  struct X {  explicit X  ; explicit X int,int ;  X x1 = {};  X x2 = {1,2};      error :implicit    error :implicit  X x3 {};  X x4 {1,2};   int f X ;     OK: explicit    OK: explicit  int i1 = f {} ; int i2 = f {1,2} ;     error :implicit    error :implicit  int i3 = f X{} ; int i4 = f X{1,2} ;     OK: explicit    OK: explicit  };  };  };  The  distinction  between  direct  and  copy initialization  is  maintained  for  list  initialization  §17.3.4.3 .  16.2.7  In-Class Initializers When we use several constructors, member initialization can become repetitive. For example:  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:  Date int, int, int ; Date int, int ; Date int ;  Date  ;  Date const char∗ ;     ...     day, month, year    day, month, today’syear    day, today’smonth and year    default Date: today    date in string representation   460  Classes  Chapter 16  We  can  deal  with  that  by  introducing  default  arguments  to  reduce  the  number  of  constructors  §16.2.5 .  Alternatively, we can add initializers to data members:  Now, each constructor has the d, m, and y initialized unless it does it itself. For example:     day, month, year    day, month, today’syear    day, today’smonth and year    default Date: today    date in string representation  class Date {  int d {today.d}; int m {today.m}; int y {today.y};  public:  Date int, int, int ; Date int, int ; Date int ;  Date  ;  Date const char∗ ;     ...  Date::Date int dd   :d{dd}     checkthat the Date is valid  This is equivalent to:  Date::Date int dd   :d{dd}, m{today.m}, y{today.y}     checkthat the Date is valid  {  }  {  }  16.2.8  In-Class Function Deﬁnitions A member function deﬁned within the class deﬁnition – rather than simply declared there – is taken to be an inline  §12.1.5  member function. That is, in-class deﬁnition of member functions is for small, rarely modiﬁed, frequently used functions. Like the class deﬁnition it is part of, a member function deﬁned in-class can be replicated in several translation units using include. Like the class itself, the member function’s meaning must be the same wherever it is included  §15.2.3 .  A member  can  refer  to  another  member  of  its  class  independently  of  where  that  member  is  deﬁned  §6.3.4 . Consider:  void add_month int n  { m+=n; }    ...     increment the Date’sm  class Date { public:  private:  int d, m, y;  };  That is, function and data member declarations are order independent. I could equivalently have written:   Section 16.2.8  In-Class Function Deﬁnitions  461  void add_month int n  { m+=n; }    ...     increment the Date’sm  class Date { public:  private:  int d, m, y;  };  }  inline void Date::add_month int n     add n months {  m+=n;      increment the Date’sm  This latter style is often used to keep class deﬁnitions simple and easy to read. It also provides a textual separation of a class’s interface and implementation.  Obviously, I simpliﬁed the deﬁnition of Date::add_month; just adding n and hoping to hit a good  date is too naive  §16.3.1 .  16.2.9  Mutability We can deﬁne a named object as a constant or as a variable.  In other words, a name can refer to an object  that  holds  an immutable or  a mutable value.  Since the  precise  terminology  can  be  a  bit clumsy, we end up referring to some variables as being constant or briefer still to const variables. However odd that may sound to a native English speaker, the concept is useful and deeply embed- ded in the C++ type system. Systematic use of immutable objects leads to more comprehensible code,  to  more  errors  being  found  early, and  sometimes  to  improved performance.  In particular, immutability is a most useful property in a multi-threaded program  §5.3, Chapter 41 .  To  be useful  beyond  the  deﬁnition  of  simple  constants  of  built-in  types,  we  must  be  able  to deﬁne functions that operate on const objects of user-deﬁned types. For freestanding functions that means functions that take const T& arguments.  For classes it means that we must be able to deﬁne member functions that work on const objects.  16.2.9.1  Constant Member Functions  The Date as deﬁned so far provides member functions for giving a Date a value.  Unfortunately, we didn’t provide a way of examining the value of a Date. This problem can easily be remedied by adding functions for reading the day, month, and year:  class Date {  int d, m, y;  public:  int day   const { return d; } int month   const { return m; } int year   const;  void add_year int n ;    ...     add n years  };   462  Classes  Chapter 16  The const after the  empty  argument list in the function declarations indicates that these functions do not modify the state of a Date.  Naturally, the compiler will catch accidental attempts to violate this promise. For example:  return ++y;     error :attempt to change member value in const function  When a const member function is deﬁned outside its class, the const sufﬁx is required:     error :const missing in member function type  int Date::year   const {  int Date::year    {  return y;  In other words, const is part of the type of Date::day  , Date::month  , and Date::year  .  A const member function can be invoked for both const and non-const objects, whereas a non-  const member function can be invoked only for non-const objects.  For example:  void f Date& d, const Date& cd  {  int i = d.year  ;  d.add_year 1 ;      OK    OK  int j = cd.year  ;  cd.add_year 1 ;      OK    error :cannot change value of a const Date  16.2.9.2  Physical and Logical Constness  Occasionally, a member function is logically const, but it still needs to change the value of a mem- ber. That is, to a user, the function appears not to change the state of its object, but some detail that the user cannot directly observe is updated.  This is often called logical constness. For example, the Date class might have a function returning a string representation. Constructing this representa- tion could be a relatively expensive operation.  Therefore, it would make sense to keep a copy so that  repeated  requests  would  simply  return  the  copy,  unless  the Date’s  value  had  been  changed. Caching values like that is more common for more complicated data structures, but let’s see how it can be achieved for a Date:  class Date { public:  private:     ... string string_rep   const;     stringrepresentation  bool cache_valid; string cache; void compute_cache_value  ;     ﬁll cache    ...  }  }  }  };   Section 16.2.9.2  Physical and Logical Constness  463  From a user’s point of view, string_rep doesn’t change the state of its Date, so it clearly should be a const member function. On the other hand, the cache and cache_valid members must change occa- sionally for the design to make sense.  Such  problems  could  be  solved  through  brute  force  using  a  cast,  for  example,  a const_cast  §11.5.2 .  However,  there are also reasonably elegant solutions that do not involve messing with type rules.  16.2.9.3 mutable  We  can deﬁne a member of a class to be mutable, meaning that it can be modiﬁed even in a const object:  class Date { public:  private:     ... string string_rep   const;  mutable bool cache_valid; mutable string cache; void compute_cache_value   const;    ...     stringrepresentation     ﬁll  mutable  cache  Now we can deﬁne string_rep   in the obvious way:  };  }  }  string Date::string_rep   const {  if  !cache_valid  {  compute_cache_value  ; cache_valid = true;  } return cache;  void f Date d, const Date cd  {  string s1 = d.string_rep  ; string s2 = cd.string_rep  ;    ...     OK!  We can now use string_rep   for both const and non-const objects.  For example:  16.2.9.4  Mutability through Indirection  Declaring a member mutable is most appropriate when only a small part of a representation of a small object is allowed to change. More complicated cases are often better handled by placing the changing data in a separate object and accessing it indirectly. If that technique is used, the string- with-cache example becomes:   Chapter 16  464  Classes  struct cache {  bool valid; string rep;  class Date { public:  private:     ... string string_rep   const;  cache∗ c;  void compute_cache_value   const;    ...  string Date::string_rep   const {  if  !c−>valid  {  compute_cache_value  ; c−>valid = true;  } return c−>rep;     stringrepresentation     initializeinconstr uctor    ﬁll what cache refers to  The programming techniques that support a cache generalize to various forms of lazy evaluation.  Note that const does not apply  transitively  to objects accessed through pointers or references. The human reader may consider such an object as ‘‘a kind of subobject,’’ but the compiler does not know such pointers or references to be any different from any others.  That is, a member pointer does not have any special semantics that distinguish it from other pointers.  16.2.10  Self-Reference The  state  update  functions add_year  , add_month  , and add_day    §16.2.3   were  deﬁned  not  to return values.  For such a set of related update functions, it is often useful to return a reference to the updated object so that the operations can be chained. For example, we would like to write:  void f Date& d  {     ... d.add_day 1 .add_month 1 .add_year 1 ;    ...  to add a day, a month, and a year to d. To do this, each function must be declared to return a refer- ence to a Date:  class Date {     ...  };  };  }  }   };  }  }  Section 16.2.10  Self-Reference   465  Date& add_year int n ; Date& add_month int n ;    add n months Date& add_day int n ;     add n years     add n days  Each  non-static  member function knows for which object it was invoked and can explicitly refer to it. For example:  Date& Date::add_year int n  {  if  d==29 && m==2 && !leapyear y+n   {    beware of Febr uary29  d = 1; m = 3;  } y += n; return ∗this;  The expression ∗this refers to the object for which a member function is invoked.  In a non-static member function, the keyword this is a pointer to the object for which the func- tion was invoked.  In a non-const member function of class X, the type of this is X∗. Howev er, this is  considered  an  rvalue,  so  it  is  not  possible  to  take the  address  of this or  to  assign  to this. In a const member function of class X, the type of this is const X∗ to prevent modiﬁcation of the object itself  see also §7.5 .  Most uses of this are implicit. In particular, every reference to a non-static member from within a class relies on an implicit use of this to get the member of the appropriate object. For example, the add_year function could equivalently, but tediously, hav e been deﬁned like this:  Date& Date::add_year int n  {  if  this−>d==29 && this−>m==2 && !leapyear this−>y+n   {  One common explicit use of this is in linked-list manipulation. For example:  this−>d = 1; this−>m = 3;  } this−>y += n; return ∗this;  struct Link {  Link∗ pre; Link∗ suc; int data;  Link∗ insert int x   {     inser txbefore this  return pre = new Link{pre ,this,x};  }   466  Classes  Chapter 16  Explicit use of this is required for access to members of base classes from a derived class that is a template  §26.3.7 .  16.2.11  Member Access A member of a class X can be accessed by applying the .  dot  operator to an object of class X or by applying the −>  arrow  operator to a pointer to an object of class X. For example:  void remove       remove and destroythis {  if  pre  pre−>suc = suc; if  suc  suc−>pre = pre; delete this;  }     ...  };  struct X {  void f  ; int m;  };  void user X x, X∗ px  {  m = 1; x.m = 1; x−>m = 1; px−>m = 1; px.m = 1;     error :there is no m in scope    OK    error :xisnot a pointer    OK    error :px is a pointer  }  }  };  Obviously, there is a bit of redundancy here: the compiler knows whether a name refers to an X or to an X∗, so a single operator would have been sufﬁcient.  However,  a  programmer might be con- fused, so from the ﬁrst days of C the rule has been to use separate operators.  From inside a class no operator is needed. For example:  void X::f   {  m = 1;     OK: ‘‘this->m = 1;’’ §16.2.10   struct X {  int f   { return m; } int m;     ﬁne: returnthis X’sm  That is, an unqualiﬁed member name acts as if it had been preﬁxed by this−>. Note that a member function can refer to the name of a member before it has been declared:  If we want to refer to a member in general, rather than to a member of a particular object, we qual- ify by the class name followed by ::. For example:   Section 16.2.11  Member Access  467  struct S {  int m; int f  ; static int sm;  };  int X::f   { return m; } int X::sm {7}; int  S::∗  pmf   {&S::f};     X’sf    X’sstatic member sm  §16.2.12     X’smember f  That last construct  a pointer to member  is fairly rare and esoteric; see §20.6. I mention it here just to emphasize the generality of the rule for ::.  16.2.12  [static] Members The convenience of a default value for Dates was bought at the cost of a signiﬁcant hidden problem. Our Date class became dependent on the global variable today. This Date class can be used only in a context in which today is deﬁned and correctly used by every piece of code. This is the kind of constraint that causes a class to be useless outside the context in which it was ﬁrst written. Users get too many unpleasant surprises trying to use such context-dependent classes, and maintenance becomes  messy. Maybe  ‘‘just  one  little  global  variable’’ isn’t too  unmanageable,  but  that  style leads to code that is useless except to its original programmer. It should be avoided.  Fortunately, we can  get  the  convenience  without  the  encumbrance  of  a  publicly  accessible global variable.  A variable that is part of a class, yet is not part of an object of that class, is called a static member. There is exactly one copy of a static member instead of one copy per object, as for ordinary  non-static members   §6.4.2 . Similarly, a  function  that  needs  access  to  members  of  a class, yet doesn’t need to be invoked for a particular object, is called a static member function.  Here is a redesign that preserves the semantics of default constructor values for Date without the  problems stemming from reliance on a global:  Date int dd =0, int mm =0, int yy =0 ;    ... static void set_default int dd, int mm, int yy ;    set default_date to Date dd,mm,yy   We can now deﬁne the Date constructor to use default_date like this:  class Date {  int d, m, y; static Date default_date;  public:  };  }  Date::Date int dd, int mm, int yy  {  d = dd ? dd : default_date .d; m = mm ? mm : default_date .m; y = yy ? yy : default_date .y;     ... checkthat the Date is valid ...   468  Classes  Chapter 16  Using set_default  , we can  change  the  default  date  when  appropriate. A static member  can  be referred to like any other member. In addition, a static member can be referred to without mention- ing an object. Instead, its name is qualiﬁed by the name of its class. For example:  void f   {  Date::set_default 4,5,1945 ;      call Date’sstatic member set_default    If used, a static member – a function or data member – must be deﬁned somewhere.  The keyword static is not repeated in the deﬁnition of a static member. For example:  Date Date::default_date {16,12,1770};     deﬁnition of Date::default_date  void Date::set_default int d, int m, int y  {     deﬁnition of Date::set_default  default_date = {d,m,y};     assign newvalue to default_date  Now, the default value is Beethoven’s birth date – until someone decides otherwise.  Note that Date{} serves as a notation for the value of Date::default_date. For example:  Date copy_of_default_date = Date{};  Consequently, we don’t need a separate function for reading the default date. Furthermore, where the target type is unambiguously a Date, plain {} is sufﬁcient.  For example:  }  }  }  void f Date ;  void g   {  f Date{} ;  void f1 Date ;  void f2 Date ; void f2 int ;  void g   {  f1 {} ;  f2 {} :  f2 Date{} ;      OK: equivalent to f1 Date{}     error :ambiguous: f2 int  or f2 Date ?    OK  In  multi-threaded  code, static data  members  require  some  kind  of  locking  or  access  discipline  to avoid race conditions  §5.3.4, §41.2.4 . Since multi-threading is now very common, it is unfortu- nate that use of static data members was quite popular in older code. Older code tends to use static members in ways that imply race conditions.   Section 16.2.13  Member Types   469  16.2.13  Member Types Types and type aliases can be members of a class. For example:  using value_type = T; enum Policy { rb, splay, treeps }; class Node {     member alias    member enum    member class  template  class Tree {  Node∗ right; Node∗ left; value_type value;  public:  void f Tree∗ ;  }; Node∗ top;  void g const T& ;    ...  public:  };  template  void Tree::Node::f Tree∗ p  {  template  void Tree::g Tree::Node∗ p  {  }  }  A member class  often called a nested class  can refer to types and static members of its enclosing class.  It can only refer to non-static members when it is given an object of the enclosing class to refer  to. To  avoid  getting  into  the  intricacies  of  binary  trees,  I  use  purely  technical  ‘‘f   and g  ’’-style examples.  A nested class has access to members of its enclosing class, even to private members  just as a  member function has , but has no notion of a current object of the enclosing class. For example:  top = right; p−>top = right; value_type v = left−>value;      error :no object of type Tree speciﬁed    OK    OK: value_type is not associated with an object  A class does not have any special access rights to the members of its nested class. For example:  value_type val = right−>value;  value_type v = p−>right−>value;  p−>f this ;      error :no object of type Tree::Node    error :Node::r ightis private    OK  Member classes are more a notational convenience than a feature of fundamental importance. On the other hand, member aliases are important as the basis of generic programming techniques rely- ing on associated types  §28.2.4, §33.1.3 . Member enums are often an alternative to enum classes when it comes to avoiding polluting an enclosing scope with the names of enumerators  §8.4.1 .   470  Classes  Chapter 16  16.3  Concrete Classes The previous section discussed bits and pieces of the design of a Date class in the context of intro- ducing the basic language features for deﬁning classes. Here, I reverse the emphasis and discuss the  design  of  a  simple  and  efﬁcient Date class  and  show how  the  language  features  support  this design.  Small, heavily used abstractions are common in many applications.  Examples are Latin charac- ters, Chinese characters, integers, ﬂoating-point numbers, complex numbers, points, pointers, coor- dinates,  transforms,   pointer,offset  pairs,  dates,  times,  ranges,  links,  associations,  nodes,  value,unit  pairs,  disk  locations,  source  code  locations,  currency values,  lines,  rectangles,  scaled ﬁxed-point numbers, numbers with fractions, character strings, vectors, and arrays. Every applica- tion uses several of these. Often, a few of these simple concrete types are used heavily. A typical application uses a few directly and many more indirectly from libraries.  C++ directly supports a few of these abstractions as built-in types. However, most are not, and cannot be, directly supported by the language because there are too many of them.  Furthermore, the designer of a general-purpose programming language cannot foresee the detailed needs of every application.  Consequently, mechanisms  must  be  provided  for  the  user  to  deﬁne  small  concrete types.  Such types are called concrete types or concrete classes to distinguish them from abstract classes  §20.4  and classes in class hierarchies  §20.3, §21.2 .  A class is called concrete  or a concrete class  if its representation is part of its deﬁnition. This distinguishes  it  from  abstract  classes   §3.2.2,  §20.4   which  provide  an  interface  to  a  variety  of implementations.  Having the representation available allows us:   cid:129  To place objects on the stack, in statically allocated memory, and in other objects  cid:129  To copy and move objects  §3.3, §17.5   cid:129  To refer directly to named objects  as opposed to accessing through pointers and references  This makes concrete classes simple to reason about and easy for the compiler to generate optimal code  for. Thus,  we  prefer  concrete  classes  for  small,  frequently  used,  and  performance-critical types, such as complex numbers  §5.6.2 , smart pointers  §5.2.1 , and containers  §4.4 .  It  was  an  early  explicit  aim  of  C++  to  support  the  deﬁnition  and  efﬁcient  use  of  such  user- deﬁned types very well. They are a foundation of elegant programming. As usual, the simple and mundane is statistically far more signiﬁcant than the complicated and sophisticated. In this light, let us build a better Date class:  namespace Chrono {  enum class Month { jan=1, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec };  class Date { public:      public interface:  class Bad_date { };     exception class  explicit Date int dd ={}, Month mm ={}, int yy ={} ;     {} means ‘‘pickadefault’’   Section 16.3  Concrete Classes  471     nonmodifying functions for examining the Date:  int day   const; Month month   const; int year   const;  string string_rep   const; void char_rep char s[], in max  const;     stringrepresentation    C-style string representation      modifying  functions for changing the Date:  Date& add_year int n ; Date& add_month int n ; Date& add_day int n ;  private:  };  bool is_valid  ;  int d, m, y;     add n years    add n months    add n days     checkifthis Date represents a date    representation  bool is_date int d, Month m, int y ; bool is_leapyear int y ;     trueforvalid date    trueif y is a leap year  bool operator== const Date& a, const Date& b ; bool operator!= const Date& a, const Date& b ;  const Date& default_date  ;     the default date  ostream& operator<< ostream& os, const Date& d ; istream& operator>> istream& is, Date& d ;     printdtoos    read Date from is into d  }    Chrono  This set of operations is fairly typical for a user-deﬁned type:  [1]  A constructor specifying how objects variables of the type are to be initialized  §16.2.5 . [2]  A set of functions allowing a user to examine a Date. These functions are marked const to  indicate  that  they don’t modify  the  state  of  the  object variable  for  which  they are called.  [3]  A set of functions allowing the user to modify Dates without actually having to know the  details of the representation or ﬁddle with the intricacies of the semantics. Implicitly deﬁned operations that allow Dates to be freely copied  §16.2.2 .  [4]  [5]  A class, Bad_date, to be used for reporting errors as exceptions. [6]  A set  of  useful  helper  functions. The  helper  functions  are  not  members  and  have  no direct access to the representation of a Date, but they are identiﬁed as related by the use of the namespace Chrono.  I deﬁned a Month type to cope with the problem of remembering the month day order, for example, to avoid confusion about whether the 7th of June is written {6,7}  American style  or {7,6}  Euro- pean style .  I considered  introducing  separate  types Day and Year to  cope  with  possible  confusion  of Date{1995,Month::jul,27} and Date{27,Month::jul,1995}. Howev er,  these types would not be as useful as the Month type.  Almost all such errors are caught at run time anyway – the 26th of July year 27   472  Classes  Chapter 16  is not a common date in my work.  Dealing with historical dates before year 1800 or so is a tricky issue best left to expert historians. Furthermore, the day of the month can’t be properly checked in isolation from its month and year.  To  sav e the user from having to explicitly mention year and month even when they are implied by  context,  I  added  a  mechanism  for  providing  a  default.  Note that  for Month the {} gives the  default  value 0 just as for integers even though it is not a valid Month  §8.4 .  However,  in this case, that’s exactly what we want: an otherwise illegal value to represent ‘‘pick the default.’’  Pro- viding a default  e.g., a default value for Date objects  is a tricky design problem. For some types, there is a conventional default  e.g., 0 for integers ; for others, no default makes sense; and ﬁnally, there are some types  such as Date  where the question of whether to provide a default is nontrivial. In such cases, it is best – at least initially – not to provide a default value.  I provide one for Date primarily to be able to discuss how to do so.  I omitted the cache technique from §16.2.9 as unnecessary for a type this simple. If needed, it  can be added as an implementation detail without affecting the user interface.  Here is a small – and contrived – example of how Dates can be used:  void f Date& d  {     ...  }  Date lvb_day {16,Month::dec,d.year  };  if  d.day  ==29 && d.month  ==Month::feb  {  if  midnight    d.add_day 1 ;  cout << "day after:" << d+1 << '\n';  Date dd;     initialized to the default date cin>>dd; if  dd==d  cout << "Hurray!\n";  }  };  This assumes that the addition operator, +, has been declared for Dates.  I do that in §16.3.3.  Note the use of explicit qualiﬁcation of dec and feb by Month. I used an enum  class  §8.4.1  speciﬁcally to be able to use short names for the months, yet also ensure that their use would not be obscure or ambiguous.  Why is it worthwhile to deﬁne a speciﬁc type for something as simple as a date? After all, we  could just deﬁne a simple data structure:  struct Date {  int day, month, year;  Each programmer could then decide what to do with it. If we did that, though, every user would either have to manipulate the components of Dates directly or provide separate functions for doing so.  In effect, the notion of a date would be scattered throughout the system, which would make it hard to understand, document, or change. Inevitably, providing a concept as only a simple structure   Section 16.3  Concrete Classes  473  causes extra work for every user of the structure.  Also, even though the Date type seems simple, it takes some thought to get right. For example, incrementing a Date must deal with leap years, with the fact that months are of different lengths, and so on. Also, the day-month-and-year representation is rather poor for many applications.  If we decided to change it, we would need to modify only a designated set of functions. For example, to represent a Date as the number of days before or after January 1, 1970, we would need to change only Date’s member functions.  To simplify, I decided to eliminate the notion of changing the default date. Doing so eliminates some opportunities for confusion and the likelihood of race conditions in a multi-threaded program  §5.3.1 .  I seriously  considered  eliminating  the  notion  of  a  default  date  altogether. That  would have forced users to consistently explicitly initialize their Dates.  However, that can be inconvenient and surprising, and more importantly common interfaces used for generic code require default con- struction   §17.3.3 . That  means  that  I,  as  the  designer  of Date, hav e to  pick  the  default  date. I chose January 1, 1970, because that is the starting point for the C and C++ standard-library time routines  §35.2, §43.6 . Obviously, eliminating set_default_date   caused some loss of generality of Date. Howev er, design – including class design – is about making decisions, rather than just decid- ing to postpone them or to leave all options open for users.  To preserve an opportunity for future reﬁnement, I declared default_date   as a helper function:  const Date& Chrono::default_date  ;  That doesn’t say anything about how the default date is actually set.  16.3.1  Member Functions Naturally, an implementation for each member function must be provided somewhere.  For exam- ple:  Date::Date int dd, Month mm, int yy   :d{dd}, m{mm}, y{yy}  if  y == 0  y = default_date  .year  ; if  m == Month{}  m = default_date  .month  ; if  d == 0  d = default_date  .day  ;  if  !is_valid    throw Bad_date  ;  {  }  The  constructor  checks  that  the  data  supplied  denotes  a  valid Date. for {30,Month::feb,1994}, it throws an exception  §2.4.3.1, Chapter 13 , which indicates that something went wrong. If the data supplied is acceptable, the obvious initialization is done. Initialization is a relatively complicated operation because it involves data validation.  This is fairly typical. On the other hand, once a Date has been created, it can be used and copied without further checking. In other  words,  the  constructor  establishes  the  invariant  for  the  class   in  this  case,  that  it  denotes  a valid date . Other member functions can rely on that invariant and must maintain it. This design technique can simplify code immensely  see §2.4.3.2, §13.4 .  If not,  say,  I’m using the value Month{} – which doesn’t represent a month and has the integer value 0 – to represent ‘‘pick the default month.’’  I could have  deﬁned an enumerator in Month speciﬁcally to   474  Classes  Chapter 16  represent that. But I decided that it was better to use an obviously anomalous value to represent ‘‘pick the default month’’ rather than give the appearance that there were 13 months in a year. Note that Month{}, meaning 0, can be used because it is within the range guaranteed for the enumeration Month  §8.4 .  I use the member initializer syntax  §17.4  to initialize the members. After that, I check for 0 and modify the values as needed. This clearly does not provide optimal performance in the  hope- fully rare  case of an error, but the use of member initializers leaves the structure of the code obvi- ous.  This makes the style less error-prone and easier to maintain than alternatives.  Had I aimed at optimal performance, I would have used three separate constructors rather than a single constructor with default arguments.  I considered  making  the  validation  function is_valid   public.  However,  I  found  the  resulting  user code more complicated and less robust than code relying on catching the exception:  void ﬁll vector & aa  {  while  cin  { Date d; try {  cin >> d;  } catch  Date::Bad_date  {     ... myerror handling ... continue;  } aa.push_back d ;      see §4.4.2  }  bool Date::is_valid   {  return is_date d,m,y ;  }  }  }  However, checking that a {d,m,y} set of values is a valid date is not a computation that depends on the representation of a Date, so I implemented is_valid   in terms of a helper function:  Why hav e both is_valid   and is_date  ? In this simple example, we could manage with just one, but I can imagine systems where is_date    as here  checks that a  d,m,y -tuple represents a valid date and where is_valid   does an additional check on whether that date can be reasonably represented. For example, is_valid   might reject dates from before the modern calendar became commonly used. As is common for such simple concrete types, the deﬁnitions of Date’s  member functions vary  between the trivial and the not-too-complicated. For example:  inline int Date::day   const {  return d;   Section 16.3.1  Member Functions  475  int delta_y = n 12; int mm = static_cast  m +n%12; if  12 < mm  {     number of whole years    number of months ahead    note: dec is represented by12     ... handle the cases where the month mm doesn’t have day d ...  Date& Date::add_month int n  {  if  n==0  return ∗this;  if  n>0  {  ++delta_y; mm −= 12;  }  y += delta_y; m = static_cast  mm ; return ∗this;  }     ... handle negativen...  return ∗this;  }  I wouldn’t call  the  code  for add_month   pretty. In fact,  if  I  added  all  the  details,  it  might  even approach the complexity of relatively simple real-world code. This points to a problem: adding a month is conceptually simple, so why is our code getting complicated? In this case, the reason is that the d,m,y representation isn’t as convenient for the computer as it is for us. A better representa- tion  for many purposes  would be simply a number of days since a deﬁned ‘‘day zero’’  e.g., Jan- uary 1, 1970 . That would make computation on Dates simple at the expense of complexity in pro- viding output ﬁt for humans.  Note  that  assignment  and  copy initialization  are  provided  by  default   §16.2.2 . Also, Date doesn’t need a destructor because a Date owns no resources and requires no cleanup when it goes out of scope  §3.2.1.2 .  16.3.2  Helper Functions Typically, a class has a number of functions associated with it that need not be deﬁned in the class itself because they don’t need direct access to the representation. For example:  int diff Date a, Date b ;     number of days in the range [a,b  or [b,a   bool is_leapyear int y ; bool is_date int d, Month m, int y ;  const Date& default_date  ; Date next_weekday Date d ; Date next_saturday Date d ;   476  Classes  Chapter 16  Deﬁning  such  functions  in  the  class  itself  would  complicate  the  class  interface  and  increase  the number of functions that would potentially need to be examined when a change to the representa- tion was considered.  How are such functions ‘‘associated’’ with class Date? In early C++, as in C, their declarations were simply placed in the same ﬁle as the declaration of class Date. Users who needed Dates would make them all available by including the ﬁle that deﬁned the interface  §15.2.2 . For example:  include "Date.h"  In addition  or alternatively , we can make the association explicit by enclosing the class and its helper functions in a namespace  §14.3.1 :  namespace Chrono {     facilities for dealing with time  class Date {  * ...* };  int diff Date a, Date b ; bool is_leapyear int y ; bool is_date int d, Month m, int y ; const Date& default_date  ; Date next_weekday Date d ; Date next_saturday Date d ;    ...  }  }  The Chrono namespace would naturally also contain related classes, such as Time and Stopwatch, and their helper functions. Using a namespace to hold a single class is usually an overelaboration that leads to inconvenience.  Naturally, the helper function must be deﬁned somewhere:  bool Chrono::is_date int d, Month m, int y  {  ndays = 28+is_leapyear y ; break;  case Month::apr: case Month::jun: case Month::sep: case Month::nov:  case Month::jan: case Month::mar: case Month::may: case Month::jul: case Month::aug: case Month::oct: case Month::dec:  int ndays;  switch  m  { case Month::feb:  ndays = 30; break;  ndays = 31; break;  return false;  default:  }  return 1<=d && d<=ndays;   Section 16.3.2  Helper Functions  477  I’m deliberately being a bit paranoid here. A Month shouldn’t be outside the jan to dec range, but it is possible  someone might have been sloppy with a cast , so I check.  The troublesome default_date ﬁnally becomes:  const Date& Chrono::default_date   {  static Date d {1,Month::jan,1970}; return d;  16.3.3  Overloaded Operators It  is  often  useful  to  add  functions  to  enable  conventional  notation. For example, operator==   deﬁnes the equality operator, ==, to work for Dates:  inline bool operator== Date a, Date b  {     equality  return a.day  ==b.day   && a.month  ==b.month   && a.year  ==b.year  ;  }  }  Other obvious candidates are:  bool operator!= Date, Date ;  bool operator< Date, Date ;  bool operator> Date, Date ;     ...     inequality    less than    greater than  Date& operator++ Date& d  { return d.add_day 1 ; } Date& operator−− Date& d  { return d.add_day −1 ; }     increase Date byone day    decrease Date byone day  Date& operator+= Date& d, int n  { return d.add_day n ; } Date& operator−= Date& d, int n  { return d.add_day −n ; }     add n days    subtract n days  Date operator+ Date d, int n  { return d+=n; } Date operator− Date d, int n  { return d+=n; }  ostream& operator<< ostream&, Date d ; istream& operator>> istream&, Date& d ;     add n days    subtract n days     output d    read into d  These operators are deﬁned in Chrono together with Date to avoid overload problems and to beneﬁt from argument-dependent lookup  §14.2.4 .  For Date, these operators can be seen as mere conveniences.  However, for many types – such as complex numbers  §18.3 , vectors  §4.4.1 , and function-like objects  §3.4.3, §19.2.2  – the use of conventional  operators  is  so  ﬁrmly  entrenched  in  people’s minds  that  their  deﬁnition  is  almost mandatory. Operator overloading is discussed in Chapter 18.  For Date, I was tempted to provide += and −= as member functions instead of add_day  . Had I  done so, I would have followed a common idiom  §3.2.1.1 .  Note that assignment and copy initialization are provided by default  §16.3, §17.3.3 .   478  Classes  Chapter 16  16.3.4  The Signiﬁcance of Concrete Classes I call  simple  user-deﬁned  types,  such  as Date, concrete  types to  distinguish  them  from  abstract classes  §3.2.2  and class hierarchies  §20.4 , and also to emphasize their similarity to built-in types such as int and char. Concrete classes are used just like built-in types. Concrete types have  also been  called value  types and  their  use value-oriented  programming. Their  model  of  use  and  the ‘‘philosophy’’ behind their design are quite different from what is often called object-oriented pro- gramming  §3.2.4, Chapter 21 .  The intent of a concrete type is to do a single, relatively simple thing well and efﬁciently. It is not usually the aim to provide the user with facilities to modify the behavior of a concrete type. In particular, concrete  types  are  not  intended  to  display  run-time  polymorphic  behavior   see  §3.2.3, §20.3.2 .  If you don’t like some detail of a concrete type, you build a new one with the desired behavior. If you want to ‘‘reuse’’ a concrete type, you use it in the implementation of your new type exactly as you would have used an int. For example:  class Date_and_time { private:  Date d; Time t;  public:  Date_and_time Date d, Time t ; Date_and_time int d, Date::Month m, int y, Time t ;    ...  };  Alternatively, the derived class mechanism discussed in Chapter 20 can be used to deﬁne new types from  a  concrete  class  by  describing  the  desired  differences.  The deﬁnition  of Vec from vector  §4.4.1.2  is an example of this. However,  derivation from a concrete class should be done with care  and  only  rarely  because  of  the  lack  of  virtual  functions  and  run-time  type  information  §17.5.1.4, Chapter 22 .  With a reasonably good compiler, a concrete class such as Date incurs no hidden overhead in time or space. In particular, no indirection through pointers is necessary for access to objects of concrete classes, and no ‘‘housekeeping’’ data is stored in objects of concrete classes. The size of a concrete type is known at compile time so that objects can be allocated on the run-time stack  that is, without free-store operations . The layout of an object is known at compile time so that inlining of operations is trivially achieved.  Similarly, layout compatibility with other languages, such as C and Fortran, comes without special effort.  A good set of such types can provide a foundation for applications. In particular, they can be  used to make interfaces more speciﬁc and less error-prone.  For example:  Month do_something Date d ;  This is far less likely to be misunderstood or misused than:  int do_something int d ;  Lack  of  concrete  types  can  lead  to  obscure  programs  and  time  wasted  when  each  programmer writes  code  to  directly  manipulate  ‘‘simple  and  frequently  used’’ data  structures  represented  as   Section 16.3.4  The Signiﬁcance of Concrete Classes  479  simple  aggregates  of  built-in  types. Alternatively, lack  of  suitable  ‘‘small  efﬁcient  types’’ in an application can lead to gross run-time and space inefﬁciencies when overly general and expensive classes are used.  16.4  Advice [1]  Represent concepts as classes; §16.1.

What are proper deﬁnitions of ‘‘copy’’ and ‘‘move’’? For example:   482  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  string ident string arg   {     stringpassed byvalue  copied into arg   return arg;      returnstr ing move the value of arg out of ident   to a caller   int main    {  string s1 {"Adams"}; s1 = indet s1 ;  string s2 {"Pratchett"};  s1 = s2;  }  }     initializestr ing constr uctin s1 .    copys1into ident      move the result of ident s1  into s1;    s1’svalue is "Adams".    initializestr ing constr uctin s2     copythe value of s2 into s1    both s1 and s2 have the value "Pratchett".  Clearly, after the call of ident  , the value of s1 ought to be "Adams". We copy the value of s1 into the argument arg, then we move the value of arg out of the function call and  back  into s1. Next, we construct s2 with the value "Prachett" and copy it into s1. Finally, at the exit from main   we destroy the  variables s1 and s2. The  difference  between move and copy is  that  after  a  copy two objects must have the same value, whereas after a move the source of the move is not required to have its original value.  Moves can be used when the source object will not be used again.  They are particularly useful for implementing the notion of moving a resource  §3.2.1.2, §5.2 .  Several functions are used here:  cid:129  A constructor initializing a string with a string literal  used for s1 and s2   cid:129  A copy constructor copying a string  into the function argument arg   cid:129  A move  constructor moving the value of a string  from arg out of ident   into a temporary   cid:129  A move assignment moving the value of a string  from the temporary variable holding the  variable holding the result of ident s1    result of ident s1  into s1    cid:129  A copy assignment copying a string  from s2 into s1   cid:129  A destructor releasing the resources owned by s1, s2, and the temporary variable holding the  result of ident s1   An optimizer can eliminate some of this work.  For example, in this simple example the temporary variable is typically eliminated. However, in principle, these operations are executed.  Constructors, copy and move assignment operations, and destructors directly support a view of lifetime and resource management. An object is considered an object of its type after its construc- tor completes, and it remains an object of its type until its destructor starts executing.  The interac- tion between object lifetime and errors is explored further in §13.2 and §13.3. In particular, this chapter doesn’t discuss the issue of half-constructed and half-destroyed objects.  Construction of objects plays a key role in many designs.  This wide variety of uses is reﬂected  in the range and ﬂexibility of the language features supporting initialization.  Constructors, destructors, and copy and move operations for a type are not logically separate. We must deﬁne them as a matched set or suffer logical or performance problems. If a class X has a destructor that performs a nontrivial task, such as free-store deallocation or lock release, the class is likely to need the full complement of functions:   Introduction   483  Section 17.1  class X {     ‘‘ordinar yconstr uctor’’: create an object    default constructor    copyconstr uctor    move constr uctor  X Sometype ;  X  ;  X const X& ; X X&& ;  X& operator= const X& ;    copyassignment: clean up target and copy X& operator= X&& ; ˜X  ;     ...     move assignment: clean up target and move    destructor:clean up  There are ﬁve situations in which an object is copied or moved:   cid:129  As the source of an assignment  cid:129  As an object initializer  cid:129  As a function argument  cid:129  As a function return value  cid:129  As an exception  In all cases, the copy or move constructor will be applied  unless it can be optimized away .  In addition to the initialization of named objects and objects on the free store, constructors are  used to initialize temporary objects  §6.4.2  and to implement explicit type conversion  §11.5 .  Except for the ‘‘ordinary constructor,’’ these special member functions can be generated by the  compiler; see §17.6.  This chapter is full of rules and technicalities. Those are necessary for a full understanding, but  most people just learn the general rules from examples.  17.2  Constructors and Destructors We  can  specify  how an object  of  a  class  is  to  be  initialized  by  deﬁning  a  constructor   §16.2.5, §17.3 .  To complement constructors, we can deﬁne a destructor to ensure ‘‘cleanup’’ at the point of destruction of an object  e.g., when it goes out of scope . Some of the most effective techniques for resource management in C++ rely on constructor destructor pairs. So do other techniques relying on a pair of actions, such as do undo, start stop, before after, etc.  For example:  };  };  struct Tracer {  string mess; Tracer const string& s  :mess{s} { clog << mess; } ˜Tracer   {clog << "˜" << mess; }  void f const vector & v  {  Tracer tr {"in f  \n"}; for  auto x : v  {  }  }  Tracer tr {string{"v loop "}+to  x +'\n'};    §25.2.5.1    ...   484  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  We could try a call:  f {2,3,5} ;  This would print to the logging stream:  in_f   v loop 2 ˜v loop 2 v loop 3 ˜v loop 3 v loop 5 ˜v loop 5 ˜in_f    class Vector { public:  Vector int s ;    ...  };  };  };  17.2.1  Constructors and Invariants A member with the same name as its class is called a constructor. For example:  A constructor  declaration  speciﬁes  an  argument  list   exactly  as  for  a  function   but  has  no  return type.  The name of a class cannot be used for an ordinary member function, data member, member type, etc., within the class. For example:  struct S { S  ;  void S int ; int S; enum S { foo, bar };     ﬁne    error :no type can be speciﬁed for a constructor    error :the class name must denote a constructor    error :the class name must denote a constructor  A constructor’s job is to initialize an object of its class. Often, that initialization must establish a class invariant, that is, something that must hold whenever a member function is called  from out- side the class . Consider:  class Vector { public:  Vector int s ;    ...  private:  double∗ elem;     elem points to an array ofszdoubles int sz;     sz is non-negative  Here  as is often the case , the invariant is stated as comments: ‘‘elem points to an array of sz dou- bles’’ and ‘‘sz is non-negative.’’ The constructor must make that true. For example:   Section 17.2.1  Constructors and Invariants   485  Vector::Vector int s  {  if  s<0  throw Bad_siz e{s}; sz = s; elem = new double[s];  }  This constructor tries to establish the invariant and if it cannot, it throws an exception.  If the con- structor cannot establish the invariant, no object is created and the constructor must ensure that no resources  are  leaked   §5.2,  §13.3 . A resource  is  anything  we  need  to  acquire  and  eventually  explicitly or implicitly  give  back  release  once we are ﬁnished with it. Examples of resources are memory  §3.2.1.2 , locks  §5.3.4 , ﬁle handles  §13.3 , and thread handles  §5.3.1 .  Why would you deﬁne an invariant?  cid:129  To focus the design effort for the class  §2.4.3.2   cid:129  To clarify the behavior of the class  e.g., under error conditions; §13.2   cid:129  To simplify the deﬁnition of member functions  §2.4.3.2, §16.3.1   cid:129  To clarify the class’s management of resources  §13.3   cid:129  To simplify the documentation of the class  On average, the effort to deﬁne an invariant ends up saving work.  17.2.2  Destructors and Resources A constructor initializes an object. In other words, it creates the environment in which the member functions operate. Sometimes, creating that environment involves acquiring a resource – such as a ﬁle, a lock, or some memory – that must be released after use  §5.2, §13.3 . Thus, some classes need a function that is guaranteed to be invoked when an object is destroyed in a manner similar to the  way  a  constructor  is  guaranteed  to  be  invoked when  an  object  is  created. Inevitably, such  a function is called a destructor. The name of a destructor is ˜ followed by the class name, for exam- ple ˜Vector  . One meaning of ˜ is ‘‘complement’’  §11.1.2 , and a destructor for a class comple- ments its constructors. A destructor does not take an argument, and a class can have only one de- structor. Destructors are called implicitly when an automatic variable goes out of scope, an object on the free store is deleted, etc. Only in very rare circumstances does the user need to call a de- structor explicitly  §17.2.4 .  Destructors typically clean up and release resources. For example:  class Vector { public:  private:  };  For example:  Vector int s  :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s} { }; ˜Vector   { delete[] elem; }    ...     constructor:acquire memory    destructor:release memory  double∗ elem;     elem points to an array ofszdoubles int sz;     sz is non-negative   486  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  Vector∗ f int s  {  Vector v1 s ;    ... return new Vector s+s ;  }  }  void g int ss  {  Vector∗ p = f ss ;    ... delete p;  Here, the Vector v1 is destroyed upon exit from f  . Also, the Vector created on the free store by f   using new is  destroyed  by  the  call  of delete. In both  cases, Vector’s  destructor  is  invoked to free  deallocate  the memory allocated by the constructor.  What  if  the  constructor  failed  to  acquire  enough  memory? For example, s∗sizeof double  or  s+s ∗sizeof double  may  be  larger  than  the  amount  of  available  memory   measured  in  bytes . In that case, an exception std::bad_alloc  §11.2.3  is thrown by new and the exception-handling mech- anism invokes the appropriate destructors so that all memory that has been acquired  and only that  is freed  §13.5.1 .  This style of constructor destructor-based resource management is called Resource Acquisition  Is Initialization or simply RAII  §5.2, §13.3 .  A matching constructor destructor pair is the usual mechanism for implementing the notion of a variably sized object in C++. Standard-library containers, such as vector and unordered_map, use variants of this technique for providing storage for their elements.  A type that has no destructor declared, such as a built-in type, is considered to have a destructor  A programmer who declares a destructor for a class must also decide if objects of that class can  that does nothing.  be copied or moved  §17.6 .  17.2.3  Base and Member Destructors Constructors and destructors interact correctly with class hierarchies  §3.2.4, Chapter 20 . A con- structor builds a class object ‘‘from the bottom up’’:  [1]  ﬁrst, the constructor invokes its base class constructors, [2]  [3]  ﬁnally, it executes its own body.  then, it invokes the member constructors, and  A destructor ‘‘tears down’’ an object in the reverse order:  [1]  ﬁrst, the destructor executes its own body, [2]  then, it invokes its member destructors, and [3]  ﬁnally, it inv okes its base class destructors.  In particular, a virtual base is constructed before any base that might use it and destroyed after all such  bases   §21.3.5.1 . This  ordering  ensures  that  a  base  or  a  member  is  not  used  before  it  has been  initialized  or  used  after  it  has  been  destroyed.  The programmer  can  defeat  this  simple  and   Section 17.2.3  Base and Member Destructors  487  essential rule, but only through deliberate circumvention involving passing pointers to uninitialized variables as arguments.  Doing so violates language rules and the results are usually disastrous.  Constructors execute member and base constructors in declaration order  not the order of ini- tializers : if two constructors used a different order, the destructor could not  without serious over- head  guarantee to destroy in the reverse order of construction. See also §17.4.  If a class is used so that a default constructor is needed, and if the class does not have other con-  structors, the compiler will try to generate a default constructor. For example:  S1 x;     OK: x.s is initialized to ""  Similarly, memberwise initialization can be used if initializers are needed. For example:  struct S1 {  string s;  };  struct X { X int ; };  struct S2 {  X x;  };  S2 x1; S2 x2 {1};    OK: x2.x is initialized with 1     error :  See also §17.3.1.  17.2.4  Calling Constructors and Destructors A destructor  is  invoked implicitly  upon  exit  from  a  scope  or  by delete. It is typically  not  only unnecessary to explicitly call a destructor; doing so would lead to nasty errors. However, there are rare  but important  cases where a destructor must be called explicitly. Consider a container that  like std::vector  maintains  a  pool  of  memory  into  which  it  can  grow and  shrink   e.g.,  using push_back   and pop_back   .  When we add an element, the container must invoke its constructor for a speciﬁc address:  void C::push_back const X& a  {     ... new p  X{a};    ...     copyconstr uctan X with the value a in address p  This use of a constructor is known as ‘‘placement new’’  §11.2.4 .  Conversely, when we remove an element, the container needs to invoke its destructor:  }  }  void C::pop_back   {     ... p−>˜X  ;      destroythe X in address p   488  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  The p−>˜X   notation invokes X’s destructor for ∗p. That notation should never be used for an object that is destroyed in the normal way  by its object going out of scope or being deleted .  For a more complete example of explicit management of objects in a memory area, see §13.6.1. If declared for a class X, a destructor will be implicitly invoked whenever an X goes out of scope or  is deleted.  This implies  that  we  can  prevent  destruction  of  an X by  declaring  its  destructor =delete  §17.6.4  or private.  Of the two alternatives, using private is the more ﬂexible.  For example, we can create a class  for which objects can be explicitly destroyed, but not implicitly:     ... void destroy   { this−>˜Nonlocal  ; }     explicit destruction     don’t destroyimplicitly  class Nonlocal { public:  private:     ... ˜Nonlocal  ;   void user   {  Nonlocal x; X∗ p = new Nonlocal;     ... delete p; p.destroy  ;      error :cannot destroyaNonlocal    OK     error :cannot destroyaNonlocal    OK  17.2.5 virtual Destructors A destructor can be declared to be virtual, and usually should be for a class with a virtual function. For example:  };  }  };  };  class Shape { public:     ... virtual void draw   = 0; virtual ˜Shape  ;  class Circle { public:     ... void draw  ; ˜Circle  ;     ...     overr ides˜Shape    The reason we need a virtual destructor is that an object usually manipulated through the interface provided by a base class is often also deleted through that interface:   Section 17.2.5  virtual Destructors   489  void user Shape∗ p  {  p−>draw  ;     ... delete p;  };     invoke the appropriate draw       invoke the appropriate destructor  Had Shape’s  destructor  not  been virtual that delete would  have  failed  to  invoke  the  appropriate derived class  destructor   e.g., ˜Circle   .  That failure  would  cause  the  resources  owned  by  the deleted object  if any  to be leaked.  17.3  Class Object Initialization This  section  discusses  how to initialize  objects  of  a  class  with  and  without  constructors. It  also shows how to deﬁne constructors to accept arbitrarily sized homogeneous initializer lists  such as {1,2,3} and {1,2,3,4,5,6} .  17.3.1  Initialization Without Constructors We  cannot deﬁne a constructor for a built-in type, yet we can initialize it with a value of suitable type.  For example:  Similarly, we can initialize objects of a class for which we have not deﬁned a constructor using   cid:129  memberwise initialization,  cid:129   cid:129   copy initialization, or default initialization  without an initializer or with an empty initializer list .  int a {1}; char∗ p {nullptr};  For example:  struct Work {  string author; string name; int year;  };  Work s9 { "Beethoven",  "Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125; Choral", 1824  };      memberwise initialization  Work currently_playing { s9 }; Work none {};     copyinitialization    default initialization  The three members of currently_playing are copies of those of s9.  The default initialization of using {} is deﬁned as initialization of each member by {}. So, none  is initialized to {{},{},{}}, which is {"","",0}  §17.3.3 .   490  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  Where no constructor requiring arguments is declared, it is also possible to leave out the initial-  izer completely. For example:  Work alpha;  void f   {  Work beta;    ...  struct Buf {  int count; char buf[16∗1024];  }  };  }     ... };  void f   {  For this, the rules are not as clean as we might like.  For statically allocated objects  §6.4.2 , the rules are exactly as if you had used {}, so the value of alpha is {"","",0}. Howev er, for local variables and free-store objects, the default initialization is done only for members of class type, and mem- bers of built-in type are left uninitialized, so the value of beta is {"","",unknown}.  The reason for this complication is to improve performance in rare critical cases. For example:  You can use a Buf as a local variable without initializing it before using it as a target for an input operation.  Most local  variable  initializations  are  not  performance  critical,  and  uninitialized  local variables are a major source of errors. If you want guaranteed initialization or simply dislike sur- prises, supply an initializer, such as {}. For example:  Buf buf0;      statically allocated, so initialized bydefault  Buf buf1;  Buf buf2 {};     leave elements uninitialized    Ireally want to zero out those elements     *p1 is uninitialized  int∗ p1 = new int;  int∗ p2 = new int{};     *p2 == 0 int∗ p3 = new int{7};    *p3 == 7    ...  Naturally, memberwise initialization works only if we can access the members. For example:  template  class Checked_pointer {    control access to T* member public:  T& operator∗  ;      checkfor nullptr and returnvalue  Checked_pointer  p {new int{7}};      error :can’t access p.p  If a class has a private non-static data member, it needs a constructor to initialize it.   Section 17.3.2  Initialization Using Constructors  491  17.3.2  Initialization Using Constructors Where memberwise copy is not sufﬁcient or desirable, a constructor can be deﬁned to initialize an object.  In particular, a constructor is often used to establish an invariant for its class and to acquire resources necessary to do that  §17.2.1 .  If a constructor is declared for a class, some constructor will be used for every object. It is an error  to  try  to  create  an  object  without  a  proper  initializer  as  required  by  the  constructors. For example:  struct X {  X int ;  };  X x0;  X x1 {};  X x2 {2};  X x3 {"two"};  X x4 {1,2};  X x5 {x4};      error :no initializer    error :empty initializer    OK    error :wrong initializer type    error :wrong number of initializers    OK: a copyconstr uctoris implicitly deﬁned  §17.6   Note that the default constructor  §17.3.3  disappears when you deﬁne a constructor requiring argu- ments; after all, X int  states that an int is required to construct an X. Howev er, the copy constructor does not disappear  §17.3.3 ; the assumption is that an object can be copied  once properly con- structed .  Where the latter might cause problems  §3.3.1 , you can speciﬁcally disallow copying  §17.6.4 .  I used the {} notation to make explicit the fact that I am initializing. I am not  just  assigning a value, calling a function, or declaring a function. The {} notation for initialization can be used to provide arguments to a constructor wherever an object can be constructed. For example:  struct Y : X { X m {0};  Y int a  :X{a}, m{a} { }; Y   : X{0} { };     provide default initializer for member m    initializebase and member  §17.4     initializebase and member  };  }  X g {1};      initializeglobal var iable  void f int a  {  X def {}; Y de2 {}; X∗ p {nullptr}; X var {2}; p = new X{4};  X a[] {1,2,3}; vector  v {1,2,3,4};     error :no default value for X    OK: use default constructor     initializelocal var iable    initializeobject on free store    initializearray elements    initializevector elements   };  }  };  492  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  For this reason, {} initialization is sometimes referred to as universal initialization: the notation can be used everywhere.  In addition, {} initialization is uniform: wherever you initialize an object of type X with a value v using the {v} notation, the same value of type X  X{v}  is created.  The = and    notations for initialization  §6.3.5  are not universal.  For example:     syntax error:can’t use = for member initialization  struct Y : X {  X m; Y int a  : X a , m=a { };  X g 1 ;      initializeglobal var iable  void f int a  {  X def  ;  X∗ p {nullptr}; X var = 2; p = new X=4;  X a[] 1,2,3 ;  vector  v 1,2,3,4 ;     function returning an X  surpr ise!?      initializelocal var iable    syntax error:can’t use = for new    error :can’t use    for array initialization    error :can’t use    for list elements  The = and    notations for initialization are not uniform either, but fortunately the examples of that are  obscure. If  you  insist  on  using = or    initialization,  you  have  to remember  where  they are allowed and what they mean.  The usual overload resolution rules  §12.3  apply for constructors. For example:  struct S {  S const char∗ ; S double∗ ;  S s1 {"Napier"};  S s2 {new double{1.0}};  S s3 {nullptr};      S::S const char*     S::S double* ;    ambiguous: S::S const char*  or S::S double* ?  Note  that  the {}-initializer  notation  does  not  allow narrowing   §2.2.2 . That  is  another  reason  to prefer the {} style over    or =.  17.3.2.1  Initialization by Constructors  Using  the    notation,  you  can  request  to  use  a  constructor  in  an  initialization. That  is,  you  can ensure that for a class, you will get initialization by constructor and not get the memberwise initial- ization or initializer-list initialization  §17.3.4  that the {} notation also offers.  For example:  struct S1 {  int a,b;  };     no constructor   Section 17.3.2.1  Initialization by Constructors  493  struct S2 {  };  int a,b; S2 int a = 0, int b = 0  : a aa , b bb  {}     constructor  S1 x11 1,2 ; S1 x12 {1,2};     error :no constructor    OK: memberwise initialization  S1 x13 1 ; S1 x14 {1};     error :no constructor    OK: x14.b becomes 0  S2 x21 1,2 ; S2 x22 {1,2};     OK: use constructor    OK: use constructor  S2 x23 1 ; S2 x24 {1};     OK: use constructor and one default argument    OK: use constructor and one default argument  The uniform use of {} initialization only became possible in C++11, so older C++ code uses    and = initialization.  Consequently, the    and = may be more familiar to you. However, I don’t know any logical  reason  to  prefer  the    notation  except  in  the  rare  case  where  you  need  to  distinguish between initialization with a list of elements and a list of constructor arguments.  For example:  vector  v1 {77}; vector  v2 77 ;     one element with the value 77    77 elements with the default value 0  This problem – and the need to choose – can occur when a type with an initializer-list constructor  §17.3.4 , typically a container, also has an ‘‘ordinary constructor’’ accepting arguments of the ele- ment type. In particular, we occasionally must use   initialization for vectors of integers and ﬂoat- ing-point numbers but never need to for vectors of strings of pointers:  vector  v1 {77};  vector  v2 77 ;     77 elements with the default value ""     vector  std::initializer_list  doesn’t accept {77}     77 elements with the default value ""  vector  v3 {"Booh!"}; vector  v4 "Booh!" ;     one element with the value "Booh!"    error :no constructor takes a string argument  vector  v5 {100,0};      100 int*s initialized to nullptr  100 is not an int*   vector  v6 {0,0};  vector  v7 0,0 ;  vector  v8;      2int*s initialized to nullptr    empty vector  v7.size  ==0     empty vector  v7.size  ==0   The v6 and v7 examples are only of interest to language lawyers and testers.  17.3.3  Default Constructors A constructor that can be invoked without an argument is called a default constructor. Default con- structors are very common. For example:   494  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  class Vector { public:  Vector  ;     default constructor :no elements    ...  A default constructor is used if no arguments are speciﬁed or if an empty initializer list is provided:  A default argument  §12.2.5  can make a constructor that takes arguments into a default construc- tor. For example:     default constructor :empty string  Vector v1; Vector v2 {};     OK    OK  class String { public:  String const char∗ p = "" ;     ...  String s1; String s2 {};     OK    OK  The standard-library vector and string have such default constructors  §36.3.2, §31.3.2 .  The built-in types are considered to have default and copy constructors.  However, for a built-in type  the  default  constructor  is  not  invoked for  uninitialized  non-static variables   §17.3 . The default value of a built-in type is 0 for integers, 0.0 for ﬂoating-point types, and nullptr for pointers. For example:  void f   {  int a0; int a1  ;     uninitialized    function declaration  intended?   int a {}; double d {}; char∗ p {};      abecomes 0    dbecomes 0.0    pbecomes nullptr  int∗ p1 = new int;  int∗ p2 = new int{};     the int is initialized to 0     uninitialized int  template  struct Handle {  T∗ p; Handle T∗ pp = new T{}  :p{pp} { }    ...  Handle  px;     will generate int{}  Constructors for built-in types are most often used for template arguments.  For example:  };  };  }  };   Section 17.3.3  Default Constructors  495  The generated int will be initialized to 0.  References and consts must be initialized  §7.7, §7.5 . Therefore, a class containing such mem- bers  cannot  be  default  constructed  unless  the  programmer  supplies  in-class  member  initializers  §17.4.4  or deﬁnes a default constructor that initializes them  §17.4.1 . For example:  int glob {9};  struct X {  };  const int a1 {7}; const int a2; const int& r {9}; int& r1 {glob}; int& r2;     OK    error :requires a user-deﬁned constructor    OK    OK    error :requires a user-deﬁned constructor  X x;     error :no default constructor for X  An array, a standard-library vector, and similar containers can be declared to allocate a number of default-initialized elements. In such cases, a default constructor is obviously required for a class used as the element type of a vector or array. For example:  struct S1 { S1  ; }; struct S2 { S2 string ; };     has default constructor    no default constructor  S1 a1[10]; S2 a2[10]; S2 a3[] { "alpha", "beta" };     OK: 10 default elements    error :cannot initializeelements    OK: twoelements: S2{"alpha"}, S2{"beta"}  vector  v1 10 ; vector  v2 10 ; vector  v3 { "alpha", "beta" };     OK: 10 default elements    error :cannot initializeelements    OK: twoelements: S2{"alpha"}, S2{"beta"}  vector  v2 10,"" ; vector  v4;     OK: 10 elements each initialized to S2{""}    OK: no elements  When should a class have a default constructor? A simple-minded technical answer is ‘‘when you use it as the element type for an array, etc.’’  Howev er, a better question is ‘‘For what types does it make sense to have a default value?’’ or even ‘‘Does this type have a ‘special’ value we can ‘natu- rally’  use  as  a  default?’’ String  has  the  empty  string, "", containers  have  the  empty  set, {}, and numeric values have zero.  The trouble with deciding on a default Date  §16.3  arose because there is no ‘‘natural’’ default date  the Big Bang is too far in the past and not precisely associated with our everyday dates . It is a good idea not to be too clever when inventing default values.  For exam- ple, the problem with containers of elements without default values is often best solved by not allo- cating elements until you have proper values for them  e.g., using push_back   .  17.3.4  Initializer-List Constructors A constructor that takes a single argument of type std::initializer_list is called an initializer-list con- structor. An initializer-list constructor is used to construct objects using a {}-list as its initializer   496  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  value.  Standard-library containers  e.g., vector and map  hav e initializer-list constructors, assign- ments, etc.  §31.3.2, §31.4.3 . Consider:  vector  v = { 1, 2, 3.456, 99.99 };  list > languages = {  {"Nygaard","Simula"}, {"Richards","BCPL"}, {"Ritchie","C"}  map ,vector > years = {  { {"Maurice","Vincent", "Wilkes"},{1913, 1945, 1951, 1967, 2000} }, { {"Mar tin", "Richards"} {1982, 2003, 2007} }, { {"David", "John", "Wheeler"}, {1927, 1947, 1951, 2004} }  The mechanism for accepting a {}-list is a function  often a constructor  taking an argument of type std::initializer_list . For example:  void f initializer_list  ;  f {1,2} ; f {23,345,4567,56789} ; f {} ;      the empty list  f{1,2};      error :function call    missing  years.inser t {{"Bjarne","Stroustrup"},{1950, 1975, 1985}} ;  The initializer list can be of arbitrary length but must be homogeneous. That is, all elements must be of the template argument type, T, or implicitly convertible to T.  17.3.4.1 initializer_list Constructor Disambiguation  When you have sev eral constructors for a class, the usual overload resolution rules  §12.3  are used to select the right one for a given set of arguments.  For selecting a constructor, default and initial- izer lists take precedence.  Consider:  struct X {  X initializer_list  ; X  ; X int ;  X x0 {};     empty list: default constructor or initializer-list constructor?  the default constructor  X x1 {1};     one integer:anint argument or a list of one element?  the initializer-list constructor   The rules are:  If either a default constructor or an initializer-list constructor could be invoked, prefer the default constructor. If both an initializer-list constructor and an ‘‘ordinary constructor’’ could be invoked, prefer the initializer-list constructor.  };  };  };   cid:129    cid:129    Section 17.3.4.1  initializer_list Constructor Disambiguation  497  The ﬁrst rule, ‘‘prefer the default constructor,’’ is basically common sense: pick the simplest con- structor  when  you  can. Furthermore,  if  you  deﬁne  an  initializer-list  constructor  to  do  something with an empty list that differs from what the default constructor does, you probably have a design error on your hands.  The second rule, ‘‘prefer the initializer-list constructor,’’ is necessary to avoid different resolu-  tions based on different numbers of elements. Consider std::vector  §31.4 :  vector  v1 {1}; vector  v2 {1,2}; vector  v3 {1,2,3};     one element    twoelements    three elements  vector  vs1 {"one"}; vector  vs2 {"one", "two"}; vector  vs3 {"one", "two", "three"};  In every case, the initializer-list constructor is used. If we really want to invoke the constructor tak- ing one or two integer arguments, we must use the    notation:  vector  v1 1 ; vector  v2 1,2 ;    one element with the value 2     one element with the default value  0   17.3.4.2  Use of initializer_lists  A function with an initializer_list  argument can access it as a sequence using the member func- tions begin  , end  , and size  . For example:  void f initializer_list  args  {  for  int i = 0; i!=args.siz e  ; ++i   cout << args.begin  [i] << "\n";  Unfortunately, initializer_list doesn’t provide subscripting.  An initializer_list  is  passed  by  value.  That is  required  by  the  overload  resolution  rules  §12.3   and  does  not  impose  overhead  because  an initializer_list  object  is  just  a  small  handle  typically two words  to an array of Ts.  }  }  }  That loop could equivalently have been written:  void f initializer_list  args  {  for  auto p=args.begin  ; p!=args.end  ; ++p   cout << ∗p << "\n";  or:  void f initializer_list  args  {  for  auto x : args   cout << x << "\n";   498  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  To  explicitly use an initializer_list you must include the header ﬁle in which it is deﬁned: <initial- izer_list>. Howev er, since vector, map, etc., use initializer_lists, their headers   ,  , etc.  already include  , so you rarely have to do so directly.  The elements of an initializer_list are immutable. Don’t even think about trying to modify their     error :attempt to change the value of an initializer-list element  values.  For example:  int f std::initializer_list  x, int val  {  ∗x.begin   = val;  return ∗x.begin  ;      OK  void g   {  for  int i=0; i!=10; ++i   cout << f {1,2,3},i  << '\n';  Had the assignment in f   succeeded, it would have  appeared that the value of 1  in {1,2,3}  could change.  That would  have  done  serious  damage  to  some  of  our  most  fundamental  concepts. Because initializer_list elements  are  immutable,  we  cannot  apply  a  move constructor   §3.3.2, §17.5.2  to them.  A container might implement an initializer-list constructor like this:  template  class Vector { public:  private:  int sz; E∗ elem;  Vector std::initializ er_list  s ;    initializer-list constructor    ...  template  Vector::Vector std::initializ er_list  s   :sz{s.size  }     set vector size  reserve sz ; uninitialized_copy s.begin  , s.end  , elem ;     get the right amount of space     initializeelements in elem[0:s.size     The initializer lists are part of the universal and uniform initialization design  §17.3 .  17.3.4.3  Direct and Copy Initialization  The  distinction  between  direct  initialization  and  copy initialization   §16.2.6   is  maintained  for {} initialization.  For a container, this implies that the distinction is applied to both the container and its elements:  }  }  };  {  }   Section 17.3.4.3  Direct and Copy Initialization  499   cid:129  The container’s initializer-list constructor can be explicit or not.  cid:129  The constructor of the element type of the initializer list can be explicit or not.  For a vector >, we can see the direct initialization vs. copy initialization distinction applied to elements. For example:  vector > vs = {  {10,11,12,13,14},  {10},  10,      OK: vector of ﬁveelements    OK: vector of one element    error :vector  int  is explicit  vector {10,11,12,13},     OK: vector of ﬁveelements vector {10},  vector  10 ,      OK: vector of one element with value 10.0    OK: vector of 10 elements with value 0.0  A container can have  some constructors explicit and some not. The standard-library vector is an example of that. For example, std::vector  int  is explicit, but std::vector  initialize_list   is not:  vector  v1 7 ; vector  v2 = 9;     OK: v1 has 7 elements; note: uses    rather than {}    error :no conversion from int to vector  void f const vector & ; void g   {  v1 = 9; f 9 ;      error :no conversion from int to vector    error :no conversion from int to vector  By replacing    with {} we get:  vector  v1 {7}; vector  v2 = {9};     OK: v1 has one element  with the value 7     OK: v2 has one element  with the value 9   void f const vector & ; void g   {  v1 = {9}; f {9} ;      OK: v1 nowhas one element  with the value 9     OK: f is called with the list {9}  };  }  }  Obviously, the results are dramatically different.  This example was carefully crafted to give an example of the most confusing cases. Note that the apparent ambiguities  in the eyes of the human reader but not the compiler  do not emerge for longer lists. For example:  vector  v1 {7,8,9}; vector  v2 = {9,8,7};     OK: v1 has three elements with values {7,8,9}    OK: v2 has three elements with values {9,8,7}   500  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  void f const vector & ; void g   {  v1 = {9,10,11}; f {9,8,7,6,5,4} ;      OK: v1 nowhas three elements with values {9,10,11}    OK: f is called with the list {9,8,7,6,5,4}  Similarly, the potential ambiguities do not occur for lists of elements of nonintegral types:  vector  v1 { "Anya"};  vector  v2 = {"Courtney"};      OK: v1 has one element  with the value "Anya"     OK: v2 has one element  with the value "Courtney"   void f const vector & ; void g   {  v1 = {"Gavin"};  f {"Norah"} ;      OK: v1 nowhas one element  with the value "Gavin"     OK: f is called with the list {"Norah"}  17.4  Member and Base Initialization Constructors can establish invariants and acquire resources. Generally, they do that by initializing class members and base classes.  17.4.1  Member Initialization Consider a class that might be used to hold information for a small organization:  class Club {  string name; vector  members; vector  ofﬁcers; Date founded;    ... Club const string& n, Date fd ;  The Club’s  constructor takes the name of the club and its founding date as arguments.  Arguments for  a  member’s constructor  are  speciﬁed  in  a member  initializer  list in  the  deﬁnition  of  the  con- structor of the containing class. For example:  Club::Club const string& n, Date fd   : name{n}, members{}, ofﬁcers{}, founded{fd}     ...  The member initializer list starts with a colon, and the individual member initializers are separated by commas.  }  }  };  {  }   Section 17.4.1  Member Initialization  501  The members’ constructors are called before the body of the containing class’s own constructor is executed  §17.2.3 . The constructors are called in the order in which the members are declared in the class rather than the order in which the members appear in the initializer list. To  avoid con- fusion, it is best to specify the initializers in the member declaration order. Hope for a compiler warning if you don’t get the order right. The member destructors are called in the reverse order of construction after the body of the class’s own destructor has been executed.  If a member constructor needs no arguments, the member need not be mentioned in the member  initializer list. For example:  Club::Club const string& n, Date fd   : name{n}, founded{fd}  {  }     ...  This constructor is equivalent to the previous version.  In each case, Club::ofﬁcers and Club::mem- bers are initialized to a vector with no elements.  It is usually a good idea to be explicit about initializing members. Note that an ‘‘implicitly ini-  tialized’’ member of a built-in type is left uninitialized  §17.3.1 .  A constructor  can  initialize  members  and  bases  of  its  class,  but  not  members  or  bases  of  its  members or bases. For example:  struct B { B int ;  * ...* }; struct BB : B {  * ...*  }; struct BBB : BB {  BBB int i  : B i  { };    ...     error :tr yingto initializebase’sbase  17.4.1.1  Member Initialization and Assignment  Member initializers are essential for types for which the meaning of initialization differs from that of assignment. For example:  class X {  const int i; Club cl; Club& rc;    ... X int ii, const string& n, Date d, Club& c  : i{ii}, cl{n,d}, rc{c} { }  };  };  A reference  member  or  a const member  must  be  initialized   §7.5,  §7.7,  §17.3.3 . However,  for most types the programmer has a choice between using an initializer and using an assignment. In that case, I usually prefer to use the member initializer syntax to make it explicit that initialization is being done. Often, there also is an efﬁciency advantage to using the initializer syntax  compared to using an assignment . For example:   502  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  class Person {  string name; string address;    ... Person const Person& ; Person const string& n, const string& a ;  Person::Person const string& n, const string& a   : name{n}  address = a;  };  {  }  };  };  };  Here name is initialized with a copy of n. On the other hand, address is ﬁrst initialized to the empty string and then a copy of a is assigned.  17.4.2  Base Initializers Bases of a derived class are initialized in the same way non-data members are. That is, if a base requires an initializer, it must be provided as a base initializer in a constructor. If we want to, we can explicitly specify default construction. For example:  class B1 { B1  ; };    has default constructor class B2 { B2 int ; }    no default constructor  struct D1 : B1, B2 {  D1 int i  :B1{}, B2{i} {}  struct D2 : B1, B2 {  D2 int i  :B2{i} {}     B1{} is used implicitly  struct D1 : B1, B2 {  D1 int i  { }     error :B2 requires an int initializer  As with members, the order of initialization is the declaration order, and it is recommended to spec- ify base initializers in that order. Bases are initialized before members and destroyed after mem- bers  §17.2.3 .  17.4.3  Delegating Constructors If  you  want  two constructors  to  do  the  same  action,  you  can  repeat  yourself  or  deﬁne ‘‘an init   function’’ to perform the common action. Both ‘‘solutions’’ are common  because older versions of C++ didn’t offer anything better . For example:   Section 17.4.3  Delegating Constructors  503  class X {  public:  int a; validate int x  { if  0<x && x<=max  a=x; else throw Bad_X x ; }  X int x  { validate x ; } X   { validate 42 ; } X string s  { int x = to  s ; validate x ; }    ...     §25.2.5.1  };  };  };  };  class X {  int a;  public:  class X {  int a;  public:  class X {  int a;  public:  Verbosity hinders readability and repetition is error-prone.  Both get in the way of maintainability. The alternative is to deﬁne one constructor in terms of another:  X int x  { if  0<x && x<=max  a=x; else throw Bad_X x ; } X   :X{42} { } X string s  :X{to  s } { }    ...     §25.2.5.1  That is, a member-style initializer using the class’s own name  its constructor name  calls another constructor as part of the construction. Such a constructor is called a delegating constructor  and occasionally a forwarding constructor .  You cannot both delegate and explicitly initialize a member. For example:  X int x  { if  0<x && x<=max  a=x; else throw Bad_X x ; } X   :X{42}, a{56} { }    ...     error  Delegating by calling another constructor in a constructor’s member and base initializer list is very different from explicitly calling a constructor in the body of a constructor. Consider:  X int x  { if  0<x && x<=max  a=x; else throw Bad_X x ; } X   { X{42}; }    ...     likely error  The X{42} simply creates a new unnamed object  a temporary  and does nothing with it. Such use is more often than not a bug.  Hope for a compiler warning.  An object is not considered constructed until its constructor completes  §6.4.2 . When using a delegating  constructor, the  object  is  not  considered  constructed  until  the  delegating  constructor completes – just completing the delegated-to constructor is not sufﬁcient.  A destructor will not be   504  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  called for an object unless its original constructor completed.  If all you need is to set a member to a default value  that doesn’t depend on a constructor argu-  ment , a member initializer  §17.4.4  may be simpler.  17.4.4  In-Class Initializers We can specify an initializer for a non-static data member in the class declaration. For example:  For pretty  obscure  technical  reasons  related  to  parsing  and  name  lookup,  the {} and = initializer notations can be used for in-class member initializers, but the    notation cannot.  By default, a constructor will use such an in-class initializer, so that example is equivalent to:  Such use of in-class initializers can save a bit of typing, but the real beneﬁts come in more compli- cated classes with multiple constructors. Often, several constructors use the same initializer for a member. For example:  A   :a{7}, b{5}, algorithm{"MD5"}, state{"Constructor run"} {} A int a_val  :a{a_val}, b{5}, algorithm{"MD5"}, state{"Constructor run"} {} A D d  :a{7}, b{g d }, algorithm{"MD5"}, state{"Constructor run"} {}    ...  int a, b; HashFunction algorithm; string state;     cr yptographic hash to be applied to all As    stringindicating state in object lifecycle  The fact that algorithm and state have the same value in all constructors is lost in the mess of code and can easily become a maintenance problem. To make the common values explicit, we can factor out the unique initializer for data members:  class A { public:  int a {7}; int b = 77;  class A { public:  int a; int b; A   : a{7}, b{77} {}  };  };  };  class A { public:  private:  class A { public:  A   :a{7}, b{5} {} A int a_val  :a{a_val}, b{5} {} A D d  :a{7}, b{g d } {}    ...   In-Class Initializers  505  int a, b; HashFunction algorithm {"MD5"}; string state {"Constructor run"};     cr yptographic hash to be applied to all As    stringindicating state in object lifecycle  If  a  member  is  initialized  by  both  an  in-class  initializer  and  a  constructor, only  the  constructor’s initialization is done  it ‘‘overrides’’ the default .  So we can simplify further:  int a {7}; int b {5}; HashFunction algorithm {"MD5"}; string state {"Constructor run"};     the meaning of 7 for a is ...    the meaning of 5 for b is ...    Cr yptographic hash to be applied to all As    Stringindicating state in object lifecycle  As shown, default in-class initializers provide an opportunity for documentation of common cases. An in-class member initializer can use names that are in scope at the point of their use in the  member declaration. Consider the following headache-inducing technical example:  Section 17.4.4  private:  };  };  };  }  class A { public:  private:  A   {} A int a_val  :a{a_val} {} A D d  :b{g d } {}    ...  int count = 0; int count2 = 0;  int f int i  { return i+count; }  struct S {  int main   {  S s1;  ++count; S s2;      {0,0}     {1,2}  int m1 {count2}; int m2 {f m1 }; S   { ++count2; }     that is,::count2    that is,this->m1+::count; that is,::count2+::count    very odd constructor  Member initialization is done in declaration order  §17.2.3 , so ﬁrst m1 is initialized to the value of a global variable count2. The value of the global variable is obtained at the point where the con- structor for a new S object is run, so it can  and in this example does  change. Next, m2 is initial- ized by a call to the global f  .  It is a bad idea to hide subtle dependencies on global data in member initializers.   506  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  17.4.5 static Member Initialization A static class member is statically allocated rather than part of each object of the class. Generally, the static member declaration acts as a declaration for a deﬁnition outside the class. For example:  class Node {     ... static int node_count;     declaration  int Node::node_count = 0;     deﬁnition  However, for a few simple special cases, it is possible to initialize a static member in the class de- claration.  The static member must be a const of an integral or enumeration type, or a constexpr of a literal type  §10.4.3 , and the initializer must be a constant-expression. For example:  class Curious { public:  static const int c1 = 7; static int c2 = 11; const int c3 = 13; static const int c4 = sqrt 9 ;  static const ﬂoat c5 = 7.0;    ...     OK    error :not const    OK, but not static  §17.4.4     error :in-class initializer not constant    error :in-class not integral use constexpr rather than const   If  and only if  you use an initialized member in a way that requires it to be stored as an object in memory, the member must be  uniquely  deﬁned somewhere.  The initializer may not be repeated:  const int Curious::c1; const int∗ p = &Curious::c1;      don’t repeat initializer here    OK: Curious::c1 has been deﬁned  The main use of member constants is to provide symbolic names for constants needed elsewhere in the class declaration. For example:  template  class Fixed { public:     ﬁxed-sizearray  static constexpr int max = N;    ...  private:  T a[max];  For integers, enumerators  §8.4  offer an alternative for deﬁning symbolic constants within a class declaration.  For example:  class X {  enum { c1 = 7, c2 = 11, c3 = 13, c4 = 17 };    ...  };  };  };  };   Section 17.5  Copy and Move   507  17.5  Copy and Move When we need to transfer a value from a to b, we usually have two logically distinct options:   cid:129  Copy is the conventional meaning of x=y; that is, the effect is that the values of x and y are  both equal to y’s value before the assignment.   cid:129  Move leaves x with y’s former value and y with some moved-from state. For the most inter-  esting cases, containers, that moved-from state is ‘‘empty.’’  This simple logical distinction is confounded by tradition and by the fact that we use the same nota- tion for both move and copy.  Typically, a move cannot  throw,  whereas  a  copy might   because  it  may  need  to  acquire  a resource , and a move is often more efﬁcient than a copy.  When you write a move operation, you should  leave  the  source  object  in  a  valid  but  unspeciﬁed  state  because  it  will  eventually  be destroyed and the destructor cannot destroy an object left in an invalid state. Also, standard-library algorithms rely on being able to assign to  using move or copy  a moved-from object. So, design your  moves not  to  throw,  and  to  leave  their  source  objects  in  a  state  that  allows  destruction  and assignment.  To sav e us from tedious repetitive work, copy and move hav e default deﬁnitions  §17.6.2 .  17.5.1  Copy Copy for a class X is deﬁned by two operations:   cid:129  Copy constructor: X const X&   cid:129  Copy assignment: X& operator= const X&   You can deﬁne these two operations with more adventurous argument types, such as volatile X&, but don’t; you’ll just confuse yourself and others. A copy constructor is supposed to make a copy of an object without modifying it. Similarly, you can use const X& as the return type of the copy assign- ment.  My opinion  is  that  doing  so  causes  more  confusion  than  it  is  worth,  so  my  discussion  of copy assumes that the two operations have the conventional types.  Consider a simple two-dimensional Matrix:  template  class Matrix {  public:  array  dim; T∗ elem;      twodimensions    pointer to dim[0]*dim[1] elements of type T  Matrix int d1, int d2  :dim{d1,d2}, elem{new T[d1∗d2]} {} int size   const { return dim[0]∗dim[1]; }     simpliﬁed  no error handling   Matrix const Matrix& ;    copyconstr uctor Matrix& operator= const Matrix& ;    copyassignment  Matrix Matrix&& ;  Matrix& operator= Matrix&& ;     move constr uctor    move assignment  ˜Matrix   { delete[] elem; }    ...  };   508  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  First we note that the default copy  copy the members  would be disastrously wrong: the Matrix ele- ments  would  not  be  copied,  the Matrix copy would  have  a  pointer  to  the  same  elements  as  the source, and the Matrix destructor would delete the  shared  elements twice  §3.3.1 .  However,  the programmer can deﬁne any suitable meaning for these copy operations, and the  conventional one for a container is to copy the contained elements:  template  Matrix:: Matrix const Matrix& m   : dim{m.dim}, elem{new T[m.siz e  ]}     copyconstr uctor  uninitialized_copy m.elem,m.elem+m.siz e  ,elem ;     copyelements  template  Matrix& Matrix::operator= const Matrix& m  {  if  dim[0]!=m.dim[0]  dim[1]!=m.dim[1]      copyassignment  throw runtime_error "bad size in Matrix =" ;  copy m.elem,m.elem+m.siz e  ,elem ;     copyelements  A copy constructor and a copy assignment differ in that a copy constructor initializes uninitialized memory, whereas the copy assignment operator must correctly deal with an object that has already been constructed and may own resources.  The Matrix copy assignment  operator  has  the  property  that  if  a  copy of an element  throws  an exception,  the  target  of  the  assignment  may  be  left  with  a  mixture  of  its  old  value  and  the  new. That is, that Matrix assignment provided the basic guarantee, but not the strong guarantee  §13.2 . If that is not considered acceptable, we can avoid it by the fundamental technique of ﬁrst making a copy and then swapping representations:  Matrix& Matrix::operator= const Matrix& m  {     copyassignment  Matrix tmp {m}; swap tmp,∗this ;  return ∗this;     makeacopy    swaptmp’srepresentation with *this’s  The swap   will be done only if the copy was successful. Obviously, this operator=   works only if the implementation swap   does not use assignment  std::swap   does not ; see §17.5.2.  Usually a copy constructor must copy every non-static member  §17.4.1 . If a copy constructor cannot copy an element  e.g., because it needs to acquire an unavailable resource to do so , it can throw an exception.  Note that I did not protect Matrix’s copy assignment against self-assignment, m=m. The reason I did  not  test  is  that  self-assignment  of  the  members  is  already  safe:  both  my  implementations  of Matrix’s copy assignment will work correctly and reasonably efﬁciently for m=m. Also, self-assign- ment is rare, so test for self-assignment in a copy assignment only if you are sure that you need to.  {  }  }  }   Section 17.5.1.1  Beware of Default Constructors  509  17.5.1.1  Beware of Default Constructors  When writing a copy operation, be sure to copy every base and member. Consider:  X const X&   :s{a.s}, v{a.v}     copyconstr uctor    probably sloppyand probably wrong  Here, I ‘‘forgot’’ to copy s2, so it gets default initialized  to "" .  This is unlikely to be right. It is also  unlikely  that  I  would  make this  mistake for  a  simple  class. However,  for  larger  classes  the chances of forgetting go up. Worse, when someone long after the initial design adds a member to a class, it is easy to forget to add it to the list of members to be copied. This is one reason to prefer the default  compiler-generated  copy operations  §17.6 .  17.5.1.2  Copy of Bases  For the purposes of copying, a base is just a member: to copy an object of a derived class you have to copy its bases. For example:  class X {  string s; string s2; vector  v;  { }    ...  };  struct B1 { B1  ; B1 const B1& ;    ...  struct B2 {  B2 int ; B2 const B2& ;    ...  };  };  };  struct D : B1, B2 {  D int i  :B1{}, B2{i}, m1{}, m2{2∗i} {} D const D& a  :B1{a}, B2{a}, m1{a.m1}, m2{a.m2} {} B1 m1; B2 m2;  D d {1};  D dd {d};     copyconstr uct     constructwith int argument  The order of initialization is the usual  base before member , but for copying the order had better not matter.   510  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  A virtual base  §21.3.5  may appear as a base of several classes in a hierarchy.  A default copy constructor   §17.6   will  correctly  copy it.  If you  deﬁne  your  own  copy constructor, the  simplest technique is to repeatedly copy the virtual base.  Where the base object is small and the virtual base occurs only a few times in a hierarchy,  that can be more efﬁcient than techniques for avoiding the replicated copies.  17.5.1.3  The Meaning of Copy  What does a copy constructor or copy assignment have to do to be considered ‘‘a proper copy oper- ation’’?  In addition to be declared with a correct type, a copy operation must have the proper copy semantics.  Consider a copy operation, x=y, of two  objects  of  the  same  type. To  be suitable  for value-oriented programming in general  §16.3.4 , and for use with the standard library in particular  §31.2.2 , the operation must meet two criteria:   cid:129  Equivalence: After x=y, operations on x and y should give the same result. In particular, if == is  deﬁned  for  their  type,  we  should  have x==y and f x ==f y  for  any function f   that depends  only  on  the  values  of x and y  as  opposed  to  having  its  behavior  depend  on  the addresses of x and y . Independence: After x=y, operations on x should not implicitly change the state of y, that is f x  does not change the value of y as long as f x  doesn’t refer to y.   cid:129   This is the behavior that int and vector offer. Copy operations that provide equivalence and inde- pendence lead to simpler and more maintainable code. This is worth stating because code that vio- late these simple rules is not uncommon, and programmers don’t always realize that such violations are the root cause of some of their nastier problems. A copy that provides equivalence and inde- pendence is part of the notion of a regular type  §24.3.1 .  First  consider  the  requirement  of  equivalence.  People rarely  violate  this  requirement  deliber- ately, and  the  default  copy operations  do  not  violate  it;  they do memberwise  copy  §17.3.1, §17.6.2 .  However, tricks, such as having the meaning of copy depend on ‘‘options,’’  occasionally appear and typically cause confusion. Also, it is not uncommon for an object to contain members that are not considered part of its value.  For example, a copy of a standard container does not copy its allocator because the allocator is considered part of the container, rather than part of its value. Similarly, counters  for  statistics  gathering  and  cached  values  are  sometimes  not  simply  copied. Such ‘‘non-value’’ parts of an object’s state should not affect the result of comparison operators. In particular, x=y should  imply x==y. Furthermore,  slicing   §17.5.1.4   can  lead  to  ‘‘copies’’ that behave differently, and is most often a bad mistake.  Now consider the requirement of independence. Most of the problems related to  lack of  inde- pendence have to do with objects that contain pointers. The default meaning of copy is member- wise copy.  A default copy operation copies a pointer member, but does not copy the object  if any  that it points to. For example:  struct S {  int∗ p;   };     apointer  S x {new int{0}};   Section 17.5.1.3  The Meaning of Copy  511  void f   {  }  S y {x};      ‘‘copy’’x  ∗y.p = 1; ∗x.p = 2; delete y.p;  y.p = new int{3};  ∗x.p = 4;     change y; affects x    change x; affects y    affects x and y    OK: change y; does not affect x    oops: write to deallocated memory  Here I violated the rule of independence. After the ‘‘copy’’ of x into y, we can manipulate part of x’s state through y. This is sometimes called shallow copy and  too  often praised for ‘‘efﬁciency.’’ The obvious alternative of copying the complete state of an object is called deep copy. Often, the better alternative to deep copy is not a shallow copy, but a move operation, which minimizes copy- ing without adding complexity  §3.3.2, §17.5.2 .  A shallow copy leaves two objects  here, x and y  with a shared state, and has a huge potential for confusion and errors. We say that the objects x and y have become entangled when the require- ment of independence have been violated. It is not possible to reason about an entangled object in isolation.  For example, it is not obvious from the source code that the two assignments to ∗x.p can have dramatically different effects.  We can represent two entangled objects graphically:  y’s state:  x’s state:  x:  y:  shared state  Note that entanglement can arise in a variety of ways.  Often, it is not obvious that entanglement has happened until probems arise. For example, a type like S may incautiously be used as a mem- ber of an otherwise well-behaved class.  The original author of S may be aware of the entanglement and prepared to cope with it, but someone naively assuming that copying an S meant copying its complete  value  could  be  surprised,  and  someone  who  ﬁnds  an S deeply  nested  in  other  classes could be very surprised.  We  can address problems related to the lifetime of a shared subobject by introducing a form of  garbage collection. For example:  struct S2 {  shared_ptr  p;  };  S2 x {new int{0}};   512  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  void f   {  S2 y {x};     ‘‘copy’’x  ∗y.p = 1; ∗x.p = 2; y.p.reset new int{3} ;  ∗x.p = 4;     change y,affects x    change x; affects y    change y; affects x    change x; affects y  In  fact,  shallow copy and  such  entangled  objects  are  among  the  sources  of  demands  for  garbage collection.  Entangled objects  lead  to  code  that  is  very  hard  to  manage  without  some  form  of garbage collection  e.g., shared_ptrs .  However, a shared_ptr is still a pointer, so we cannot consider objects containing a shared_ptr in isolation.  Who can  update  the  pointed-to  object? How?  When?  If we  are  running  in  a  multi- threaded system, is synchronization needed for access to the shared data? How can we be sure? Entangled objects  here, resulting from a shallow copy  is a source of complexity and errors that is at best partially solved by garbage collection  in any form .  Note that an immutable shared state is not a problem. Unless we compare addresses, we cannot tell whether two equal values happen to be represented as one or two copies.  This is a useful obser- vation because many copies are never modiﬁed.  For example, objects passed by value are rarely written to. This observation leads to the notion of copy-on-write. The idea is that a copy doesn’t actually need independence until a shared state is written to, so we can delay the copying of the shared state until just before the ﬁrst write to it. Consider:  class Image { public:     ... Image const Image& a ;     ... void write_block Descriptor ;    ...  private:  Representation∗ clone  ;  Representation∗ rep; bool shared;     copyconstr uctor     copy*rep  Assume that a Representation can be huge and that a write_block   is expensive compared to testing a bool. Then, depending on the use of Images, it can make sense to implement the copy constructor as a shallow copy:  Image::Image const Image& a      do shallowcopyand prepare for copy-on-wr ite  :rep{a.rep}, shared{true}  We protect the argument to that copy constructor by copying the Representation before a write:  }  };  { }   Section 17.5.1.3  The Meaning of Copy  513  void write_block Descriptor d  {  if  shared  {  rep =clone  ;  shared = false;     makeacopyof*rep    no more sharing  }    ... nowwecan safely write to our own copyofrep ...  Like any other technique, copy-on-write is not a panacea, but it can be an effective combination of the simplicity of true copy and the efﬁciency of shallow copy.  17.5.1.4  Slicing  A pointer to a derived class implicitly converts to a pointer to its public base class. When applied to a copy operation, this simple and necessary rule  §3.2.4, §20.2  leads to a trap for the unwary. Consider:  }  };  };  }  }  struct Base {  int b; Base const Base& ;    ...  struct Derived : Base {  int d; Derived const Derived& ;    ...  void naive Base∗ p  {  B b2 =∗p;     ...  void user   {  Derived d; naive &d ; Base bb = d;    ...     mayslice: invokesBase::Base const Base&      slices: invokesBase::Base const Base& , not Derived::Der ived const Derived&   The variables b2 and bb contain copies of the Base part of d, that is, a copy of d.b. The member d.d is not copied. This phenomenon is called slicing. It may be exactly what you intended  e.g., see the copy constructor for D in §17.5.1.2 where we pass selected information to a base class , but typ- ically it is a subtle bug.  If you don’t want slicing, you have two major tools to prevent it:   514  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  [1]  Prohibit copying of the base class: delete the copy operations  §17.6.4 . [2]  Prevent conversion of a pointer to a derived to a pointer to a base: make the base class a  private or protected base  §20.5 .  The  former  would  make the  initializations  of b2 and bb errors;  the  latter  would  make the  call  of naive   and the initialization of bb errors.  17.5.2  Move The traditional way of getting a value from a to b is to copy it.  For an integer in a computer’s mem- ory, that’s just about the only thing that makes sense: that’s what the hardware can do with a single instruction.  However, from a general and logical point of view that’s not so. Consider the obvious implementation of swap   exchanging the value of two objects:  After the initialization of tmp, we hav e two copies of a’s  value.  After the assignment to tmp, we have two copies of b’s value.  After the assignment to b, we hav e two copies of tmp’s value  that is, the original value of a .  Then we destroy tmp. That sounds like a lot of work, and it can be. For example:  template  void swap T& a, T& b  {  const T tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;      put a copyofainto tmp    put a copyofbinto a    put a copyoftmp into b  };  {  }  void f string& s1, string& s2,  vector & vs1, vector & vs2, Matrix& m1, Matrix& m2   swap s1,s2 ; swap vs1.vs2 ; swap m1,m2 ;  What  if s1 has  a  thousand  characters? What  if vs2 has  a  thousand  elements  each  of  a  thousand characters?  What if m1 is a 1000∗1000 matrix of doubles?  The cost of copying those data struc- tures could be signiﬁcant. In fact, the standard-library swap   has always been carefully designed to avoid such overhead for string and vector. That is, effort has been made to avoid copying  taking advantage of the fact that string and vector objects really are just handles to their elements . Similar work must be done to avoid a serious performance problem for swap   of Matrixes.  If the only oper- ation we have is copy, similar work must be done for huge numbers of functions and data structures that are not part of the standard.  The fundamental problem is that we really didn’t want to do any copying at all: we just wanted  to exchange pairs of values.  We  can also look at the issue of copying from a completely different point of view: we don’t usually copy physical things unless we absolutely have to.  If you want to borrow my phone, I pass my phone to you rather than making you your own copy.  If I lend you my car, I giv e you a key and   Section 17.5.2  Move   515  you drive away in my car, rather than in your freshly made copy of my car. Once I have giv en you an object, you have it and I no longer do. Consequently, we talk about ‘‘giving away,’’  ‘‘handing over,’’  ‘‘transferring ownership of,’’  and ‘‘moving’’ physical objects. Many objects in a computer resemble physical objects  which we don’t copy without need and only at considerable cost  more than integer values  which we typically copy because that’s easier and cheaper than alternatives . Examples are locks, sockets, ﬁle handles, threads, long strings, and large vectors.  To  allow the user to avoid the logical and performance problems of copying, C++ directly sup- ports the notion of moving as well as the notion of copying. In particular, we can deﬁne move con- structors and move assignments to move rather than copy their argument.  Consider again the sim- ple two-dimensional Matrix from §17.5.1:  template  class Matrix {  std::array  dim; T∗ elem;     pointer to sz elements of type T  Matrix int d1, int d2  :dim{d1,d2}, elem{new T[d1∗d2]} {} int size   const { return dim[0]∗dim[1]; }  Matrix const Matrix& ; Matrix Matrix&& ;      copyconstr uctor    move constr uctor  Matrix& operator= const Matrix& ;    copyassignment Matrix& operator= Matrix&& ;    move assignment  ˜Matrix  ;     destructor    ...  };  {  }  The && indicates an rvalue reference  §7.7.2 .  The idea behind a move assignment is to handle lvalues separately from rvalues: copy assign- ment  and  copy constructors  take lvalues  whereas  move assignment  and  move constructors  take rvalues.  For a return value, the move constructor is chosen.  We  can deﬁne Matrix’s  move constructor to simply take the representation from its source and  replace it with an empty Matrix  which is cheap to destroy .  For example:  template  Matrix ::Matrix Matrix&& a  :dim{a.dim}, elem{a.elem}  a.dim = {0,0}; a.elem = nullptr;     move constr uctor    graba’s representation     clear a’srepresentation  For the move assignment, we can simply do a swap.  The idea behind using a swap to implement a move assignment is that the source is just about to be destroyed, so we can just let the destructor for the source do the necessary cleanup work for us:   516  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  template  Matrix & Matrix ::operator= Matrix&& a  {     move assignment     swaprepresentations  swap dim,a.dim ;  swap elem,a.elem ; return ∗this;  Move  constructors  and  move assignments  take non-const  rvalue   reference  arguments:  they can, and usually do, write to their argument.  However, the argument of a move operation must always be left in a state that the destructor can cope with  and preferably deal with very cheaply and eas- ily .  For resource handles, move operations tend to be signiﬁcantly simpler and more efﬁcient than copy operations.  In particular, move operations  typically  do  not  throw exceptions;  they don’t acquire  resources  or  do  complicated  operations,  so  they don’t need  to. In  this,  they differ  from many copy operations  §17.5 .  How does the compiler know when it can use a move operation rather than a copy operation? In a few cases, such as for a return value, the language rules say that it can  because the next action is deﬁned to destroy the element . However, in general we have to tell it by giving an rvalue refer- ence argument.  For example:  template  void swap T& a, T& b  {  T tmp = std::move a ; a = std::move b ; b = std::move tmp ;     "perfect swap"  almost   }  }  The move   is  a  standard-library  function  returning  an  rvalue  reference  to  its  argument   §35.5.1 : move x  means ‘‘give me an rvalue reference to x.’’ That is, std::move x  does not move anything; instead, it allows a user to move x. It would have been better if move   had been called rval  , but the name move   has been used for this operation for years.  Standard-library containers have move operations  §3.3.2, §35.5.1  and so have other standard- library types, such as pair  §5.4.3, §34.2.4.1  and unique_ptr  §5.2.1, §34.3.1 . Furthermore, opera- tions  that  insert  new elements  into  standard-library  containers,  such  as insert   and push_back  , have versions that take rvalue references  §7.7.2 . The net result is that the standard containers and algorithms deliver better performance than they would have been able to if they had to copy.  What if we try to swap objects of a type that does not have a move constructor?  We copy and pay the price. In general, a programmer is responsible for avoiding excessive copying.  It is not the compiler’s job to decide what is excessive  and what is necessary. To get the copy-to-move opti- mization  for  your  own  data  structures,  you  have  to provide  move operations   either  explicitly  or implicitly; see §17.6 .  Built-in types, such as int and double∗, are considered to have move operations that simply copy. As usual, you have  to be careful about data structures containing pointers  §3.3.1 . In particular, don’t assume that a moved-from pointer is set to nullptr.   {  }  }  Section 17.5.2  Move   517  Having move operations affects the idiom for returning large objects from functions. Consider:  Matrix operator+ const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b      res[i][j] = a[i][j]+b[i][j] for each i and j  if  a.dim[0]!=b.dim[0]  a.dim[1]!=b.dim[1]   throw std::runtime_error "unequal Matrix sizes in +" ;  Matrix res{a.dim[0],a.dim[1]}; constexpr auto n = a.size  ; for  int i = 0; i!=n; ++i   res.elem[i] = a.elem[i]+b.elem[i];  return res;  Matrix has a move constructor so that ‘‘return by value’’ is simple and efﬁcient as well as ‘‘natural.’’ Without  move operations,  we  have  performance  problems  and  must  resort  to  workarounds.  We might have considered:  Matrix& operator+ const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b  {     beware!  Matrix& res = ∗new Matrix;     res[i][j] = a[i][j]+b[i][j] for each i and j return res;     allocate on free store  The use of new within operator+   is not obvious and forces the user of + to deal with tricky memory management issues:   cid:129  How does the object created by new get deleted?  cid:129  Do we need a garbage collector?  cid:129  Should we use a pool of Matrixes rather than the general new?  cid:129  Do we need use-counted Matrix representations?  cid:129  Should we redesign the interface of our Matrix addition?  cid:129  Must the caller of operator+   remember to delete the result?  cid:129  What happens to the newly allocated memory if the computation throws an exception?  None of the alternatives are elegant or general.  17.6  Generating Default Operations Writing conventional operations, such as a copy and a destructor, can be tedious and error-prone, so the compiler can generate them for us as needed. By default, a class provides:   cid:129  A default constructor: X    cid:129  A copy constructor: X const X&   cid:129  A copy assignment: X& operator= const X&   cid:129  A move constructor: X X&&   cid:129  A move assignment: X& operator= X&&   cid:129  A destructor: ˜X     518  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  By default, the compiler generates each of these operations if a program uses it. However,  if the programmer  takes  control  by  deﬁning  one  or  more  of  those  operations,  the  generation  of  related operations is suppressed:   cid:129    cid:129   If the programmer declares any constructor for a class, the default constructor is not gener- ated for that class. If the programmer declares a copy operation, a move operation, or a destructor for a class, no copy operation, move operation, or destructor is generated for that class.  Unfortunately, the  second  rule  is  only  incompletely  enforced:  for  backward  compatibility, copy constructors and copy assignments are generated even if a destructor is deﬁned. However, that gen- eration  is  deprecated  in  the  ISO  standard   §iso.D ,  and  you  should  expect  a  modern  compiler  to warn against it.  If necessary, we can be explicit about which functions are generated  §17.6.1  and which are not   §17.6.4 .  17.6.1  Explicit Defaults Since the generation of otherwise default operations can be suppressed, there has to be a way of getting back a default.  Also, some people prefer to see a complete list of operations in the program text even if that complete list is not needed. For example, we can write:  class gslice {  valarray  siz e; valarray  stride; valarray  d1;  public:  gslice   = default; ˜gslice   = default; gslice const gslice&  = default; gslice gslice&&  = default; gslice& operator= const gslice&  = default; gslice& operator= gslice&&  = default;    ...  };  class gslice {  valarray  siz e; valarray  stride; valarray  d1;  public:     ...  };  This fragment of the implementation of std::gslice  §40.5.6  is equivalent to:  I prefer the latter, but I can see the point of using the former in code bases maintained by less expe- rienced C++ programmers: what you don’t see, you might forget about.  Using =default is always better than writing your own implementation of the default semantics.  Someone assuming that it is better to write something, rather than nothing, might write:   Section 17.6.1  Explicit Defaults  519  class gslice {  valarray  siz e; valarray  stride; valarray  d1;     ... gslice const gslice& a ;  public:  gslice::gslice const gslice& a   : siz e{a.size }, stride{a.stride}, d1{a.d1}  };  { }  };  }  struct S {  string a; int b;  S f S arg  {     default construction: {"",0}  S s0 {};  S s1 {s0};    copyconstr uction s1 = arg;     copyassignment return s1;    move constr uction  This is not only verbose, making it harder to read the deﬁnition of gslice, but also opens the oppor- tunity  for  making  mistakes.  For  example,  I  might  forget  to  copy one  of  the  members  and  get  it default initialized  rather than copied . Also, when the user provides a function, the compiler no longer  knows  the  semantics  of  that  function  and  some  optimizations  become  inhibited. For the default operations, those optimizations can be signiﬁcant.  17.6.2  Default Operations The default meaning of each generated operation, as implemented when the compiler generates it, is  to  apply  the  operation  to  each  base  and  non-static data  member  of  the  class. That  is,  we  get memberwise copy, memberwise default construction, etc. For example:  The copy construction of s1 copies s0.a and s0.b. The return of s1 moves s1.a and s1.b, leaving s1.a as the empty string and s1.b unchanged.  Note that the value of a moved-from object of a built-in type is unchanged. That’s the simplest and fastest thing for the compiler to do. If we want something else done for a member of a class, we have to write our move operations for that class.  The default moved-from state is one for which the default destructor and default copy assign- ment work correctly. It is not guaranteed  or required  that an arbitrary operation on a moved-from object will work correctly. If you need stronger guarantees, write your own operations.   520  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  17.6.3  Using Default Operations This section presents a few examples demonstrating how copy,  move, and destructors are logically linked.  If they were not linked, errors that are obvious when you think about them would not be caught by the compiler.  17.6.3.1  Default Constructors  Consider:  struct X {  X int ;      require an int to initializeanX  };  };  };  By declaring a constructor that requires an integer argument, the programmer clearly states that a user needs to provide an int to initialize an X. Had we allowed the default constructor to be gener- ated, that simple rule would have been violated. We hav e:  X a {1};  X b {};      OK    error :no default constructor  If we also want the default constructor, we can deﬁne one or declare that we want the default gener- ated by the compiler. For example:  struct Y {  string s; int n; Y const string& s ;    initializeYwith a string Y   = default;     allowdefault initialization with the default meaning  The default  i.e., generated  default constructor default constructs each member. Here, Y   sets s to the empty string. The ‘‘default initialization’’ of a built-in member leaves that member uninitial- ized.  Sigh!  Hope for a compiler warning.  17.6.3.2  Maintaining Invariants  Often, a class has an invariant.  If so, we want copy and move operations to maintain it and the de- structor  to  free  any resources  involved.  Unfortunately, the  compiler  cannot  in  every  case  know what a programmer considers an invariant.  Consider a somewhat far-fetched example:     my_favor iteis the indexofmyfavor iteelement of elem    largest points to the element with the highest value in elem  struct Z {    invariant:  vector  elem; int my_favorite; int∗ largest;  The programmer stated an invariant in the comment, but the compiler doesn’t read comments. Fur- thermore,  the  programmer  did  not  leave  a  hint  about  how that  invariant  is  to  be  established  and maintained.  In particular, there  are  no  constructors  or  assignments  declared. That  invariant  is   Section 17.6.3.2  Maintaining Invariants   521  implicit.  The result is that a Z can be copied and moved using the default operations:  Z v0;  Z val {{1,2,3},1,&val[2]};  Z v2 = val;  Z v3 = move val ;      no initialization  oops! possibility of undeﬁned values     OK, but ugly and error-prone    copies: v2.largest points into val    moves: val.elem becomes empty; v3.my_favor iteis out of range  This is a mess. The root problem is that Z is badly designed because critical information is ‘‘hid- den’’ in a comment or completely missing. The rules for the generation of default operations are heuristic intended to catch common mistakes and to encourage a systematic approach to construc- tion, copy, move, and destruction. Wherever possible  [1]  Establish an invariant in a constructor  including possibly resource acquisition . [2]  Maintain the invariant with copy and move operations  with the usual names and types . [3]  Do any needed cleanup in the destructor  incl. possibly resource release .  17.6.3.3  Resource Invariants  Many of the most critical and obvious uses of invariants relate to resource management. Consider a simple Handle:  The idea is that you construct a Handle given a pointer to an object allocated using new. The Handle provides access to the object pointed to and eventually deletes that object. For example:  template  class Handle {  T∗ p;  public:  Handle T∗ pp  :p{pp} { } T& operator∗   { return ∗p; } ˜Handle   { delete p; }  Handle  h {new int{99}};    ...  };  }  }  void f1   {  void f2   {  Handle  h;    error :no default constructor    ...  Handle declares a constructor that takes an argument: this suppresses the generation of the default constructor. That’s good because a default constructor could leave Handle ::p uninitialized:  The absence of a default constructor saves us from the possibility of a delete with a random mem- ory address.  Also, Handle declares a destructor: this suppresses the generation of copy and move operations.  Again, that saves us from a nasty problem. Consider:   522  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  void f3   {  Handle  h1 {new int{7}}; Handle  h2 {h1};    ...     error :no copyconstr uctor  }  };  Had Handle had a default copy constructor, both h1 and h2 would have had a copy of the pointer and both would have deleted it.  The results would be undeﬁned and most likely disastrous  §3.3.1 . Caveat: the generation of copy operations is only deprecated, not banned, so if you ignore warn- ings, you might get this example past the compiler. In general, if a class has a pointer member, the default copy and move operations should be considered suspicious. If that pointer member repre- sents ownership, memberwise copy is wrong.  If that pointer member does not represent ownership and memberwise copy is appropriate, explicit =default and a comment are most likely a good idea.  If we wanted copy construction, we could deﬁne something like:  template  class Handle {     ... Handle const T& a  :p{new T{∗a.p}} { }     clone  17.6.3.4  Partially Speciﬁed Invariants  Troublesome examples that rely on invariants but only partially express them through constructors or destructors are rarer but not unheard of. Consider:  class Tic_tac_toe { public:  Tic_tac_toe  : pos 9  {}     always9positions  Tic_tac_toe& operator= const Tic_tac_toe& arg  {  for int i = 0; i<9; ++i   pos.at i  = arg.pos.at i ;  return ∗this;  }     ... other operations ...  enum State { empty, nought, cross };  private:  };  vector  pos;  This was reported to have been part of a real program. It uses the ‘‘magic number’’ 9 to implement a copy assignment that accesses its argument arg without checking that the argument actually has nine  elements. Also,  it  explicitly  implements  the  copy assignment,  but  not  the  copy constructor. This is not what I consider good code.   Section 17.6.3.4  Partially Speciﬁed Invariants   523  We  deﬁned  copy assignment,  so  we  must  also  deﬁne  the  destructor. That  destructor  can  be =default because  all  it  needs  to  do  is  to  ensure  that  the  member pos is  destroyed,  which  is  what would have been done anyway had the copy assignment not been deﬁned. At this point, we notice that the user-deﬁned copy assignment is essentially the one we would have gotten by default, so we can =default that also. Add a copy constructor for completeness and we get:  class Tic_tac_toe { public:  Tic_tac_toe  : pos 9  {} Tic_tac_toe const Tic_tac_toe&  = default; Tic_tac_toe& operator= const Tic_tac_toe& arg  = default; ˜Tic_tac_toe   = default;     always9positions     ... other operations ...  enum State { empty, nought, cross };  private:  };  vector  pos;  Looking at this, we realize that the net effect of these =defaults is just to eliminate move operations. Is that what we want?  Probably not.  When we made the copy assignment =default, we eliminated the nasty dependence on the magic constant 9. Unless other operations on Tic_tac_toe, not men- tioned so far, are also ‘‘hardwired with magic numbers,’’  we can safely add move operations.  The simplest way to do that is to remove the explicit =defaults, and then we see that Tic_tac_toe is really a perfectly ordinary type:  class Tic_tac_toe { public:     ... other operations ... enum State { empty, nought, cross };  private:  };  vector  pos {Vector  9 };      always9positions  One  conclusion  that  I  draw from  this  and  other  examples  where  an  ‘‘odd  combination’’ of the default operations is deﬁned is that we should be highly suspicious of such types: their irregularity often hides design ﬂaws.  For every class, we should ask:  [1]   Is a default constructor needed  because the default one is not adequate or has been sup- pressed by another constructor ? Is a destructor needed  e.g., because some resource needs to be released ?  [2]  [3]  Are copy operations  needed   because  the  default  copy semantics  is  not  adequate,  e.g., because the class is meant to be a base class or because it contains pointers to objects that must be deleted by the class ?  [4]  Are move operations needed  because the default semantics is not adequate, e.g., because  an empty object doesn’t make sense ?  In particular, we should never just consider one of these operations in isolation.   524  Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move  Chapter 17  17.6.4 deleted Functions We  can ‘‘delete’’ a function; that is, we can state that a function does not exist so that it is an error to try to use it  implicitly or explicitly .  The most obvious use is to eliminate otherwise defaulted functions.  For  example,  it  is  common  to  want  to  prevent  the  copying  of  classes  used  as  bases because such copying easily leads to slicing  §17.5.1.4 :  class Base {     ... Base& operator= const Base&  = delete;   disallowcopying Base const Base&  = delete;  Base& operator= Base&&  = delete; Base Base&&  = delete;     disallowmoving  Base x1; Base x2 {x1};     error :no copyconstr uctor  Enabling  and  disabling  copy and  move  is typically  more  conveniently  done  by  saying  what  we want  using =default; §17.6.1  rather than saying what we don’t want  using =delete .  However, we can delete any function that we can declare. For example, we can eliminate a specialization from the set of possible specializations of a function template:  template  T∗ clone T∗ p      returncopyof*p {  return new T{∗p};  Foo∗ clone Foo∗  = delete;      don’t trytoclone a Foo  void f Shape∗ ps, Foo∗ pf  {  Shape∗ ps2 = clone ps ;  Foo∗ pf2 = clone pf ;      ﬁne    error :clone Foo*  deleted  Another application is to eliminate an undesired conversion.  For example:     can initializewith a double    butnot with an integer  struct Z {    ... Z double ;  Z int  = delete;  void f   {  Z z1 {1};  Z z2 {1.0};      error :Z int  deleted    OK  };  };  }  };  }   Section 17.6.4  deleted Functions   525  A further use is to control where a class can be allocated:  class Not_on_stack {     ... ˜Not_on_stack   = delete;  class Not_on_free_store {     ... void∗ operator new siz e_t  = delete;  };  };  }  void f   {  You can’t hav e a local variable that can’t be destroyed  §17.2.2 , and you can’t allocate an object on the free store when you have =deleted its class’s memory allocation operator  §19.2.5 . For exam- ple:  Not_on_stack v1;  Not_on_free_store v2;     error :can’t destroy    OK  Not_on_stack∗ p1 = new Not_on_stack;  Not_on_free_store∗ p2 = new Not_on_free_store;     error :can’t allocate     OK  However,  we can  never delete that Not_on_stack object.  The alternative  technique  of  making  the destructor private  §17.2.2  can address that problem.  Note the difference between a =deleted function and one that simply has not been declared. In the former case, the compiler notes that the programmer has tried to use the deleted function and gives an error. In the  latter  case,  the  compiler  looks  for  alternatives,  such  as  not  invoking  a  de- structor or using a global operator new  .  17.7  Advice [1]  Design constructors, assignments, and the destructor as a matched set of operations; §17.1.

For example, because of long acquaintance,  x+y∗z  is clearer to us than  multiply y by z and add the result to x  It is hard to overestimate the importance of concise notation for common operations.  Like most languages, C++ supports a set of operators for its built-in types. However, most con- cepts  for  which  operators  are  conventionally  used  are  not  built-in  types  in  C++,  so  they must  be   528  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  represented  as  user-deﬁned  types. For example,  if  you  need  complex arithmetic,  matrix  algebra, logic signals, or character strings in C++, you use classes to represent these notions. Deﬁning oper- ators  for  such  classes  sometimes  allows  a  programmer  to  provide  a  more  conventional  and  con- venient  notation  for  manipulating  objects  than  could  be  achieved using  only  the  basic  functional notation.  Consider:  class complex {    double re, im;  public:     very simpliﬁed complex  complex double r, double i  :re{r}, im{i} { } complex operator+ complex ; complex operator∗ complex ;  This  deﬁnes  a  simple  implementation  of  the  concept  of  complex numbers.  A complex is  repre- sented by a pair of double-precision ﬂoating-point numbers manipulated by the operators + and ∗. The  programmer  deﬁnes complex::operator+   and complex::operator∗   to  provide  meanings  for + and ∗, respectively. For example, if b and c are of type complex, b+c means b.operator+ c . We can now approximate the conventional interpretation of complex expressions:  void f   {  complex a = complex{1,3.1}; complex b {1.2, 2}; complex c {b};  a = b+c; b = b+c∗a; c = a∗b+complex 1,2 ;  };  }  }  The usual precedence rules hold, so the second statement means b=b+ c∗a , not b= b+c ∗a.  Note that the C++ grammar is written so that the {} notation can only be used for initializers and  on the right-hand side of an assignment:  void g complex a, complex b  {  a = {1,2};  a += {1,2};  b = a+{1,2};  b = a+complex{1,2};    OK g a,{1,2} ;  {a,b} = {b,a};     OK: right hand side of assignment    OK: right hand side of assignment    syntax error     OK: a function argument is considered an initializer    syntax error  There seems to be no fundamental reason not to use {} in more places, but the technical problems of writing a grammar allowing {} ev erywhere in an expression  e.g., how would you know if a { after a semicolon was the start of an expression or a block?  and also giving good error messages led to a more limited use of {} in expressions.   Section 18.1  Introduction   529  Many of the  most  obvious  uses  of  operator  overloading  are  for  numeric  types. However,  the usefulness of user-deﬁned operators is not restricted to numeric types. For example, the design of general and abstract interfaces often leads to the use of operators such as −>, [], and   .  18.2  Operator Functions Functions deﬁning meanings for the following operators  §10.3  can be declared:  − ˜ ∗= >>  && []  ∗ !  = >>=          = %= <<=  ++ new  % < ˆ= == −−  new[]   ˆ > &= !=  −>∗ delete  & += = <= , delete[]  The following operators cannot be deﬁned by a user:  scope resolution  §6.3.4, §16.2.12  member selection  §8.2  member selection through pointer to member  §20.6   +  −= <<  >=  −>   :: . .∗  They take a name, rather than a value, as their second operand and provide the primary means of referring to members. Allowing them to be overloaded would lead to subtleties [Stroustrup,1994]. The named ‘‘operators’’cannot be overloaded because they report fundamental facts about their op- erands:  sizeof alignof typeid   size of object  §6.2.8  alignment of object  §6.2.9  type_info of an object  §22.5   Finally, the ternary conditional expression operator cannot be overloaded  for no particularly funda- mental reason :  ?:  conditional evaluation  §9.4.1   In  addition,  user-deﬁned  literals   §19.2.6   are  deﬁned  by  using  the operator"" notation.  This is  a kind of syntactic subterfuge because there is no operator called "". Similarly, operator T   deﬁnes a conversion to a type T  §18.4 .  It is not possible to deﬁne new operator tokens, but you can use the function call notation when this set of operators is not adequate. For example, use pow  , not ∗∗. These restrictions may seem Draconian, but more ﬂexible rules can easily lead to ambiguities. For example, deﬁning an opera- tor ∗∗ to mean exponentiation may seem an obvious and easy task, but think again.  Should ∗∗ bind to the left  as in Fortran  or to the right  as in Algol ? Should the expression a∗∗p be interpreted as a∗ ∗p  or as  a ∗∗ p ? There are solutions to all such technical questions. However, it is most uncer- tain  if  applying  subtle  technical  rules  will  lead  to  more  readable  and  maintainable  code. If  in doubt, use a named function.  The name of an operator function is the keyword operator followed by the operator itself, for example, operator<<. An operator function is declared and can be called like any other function. A use of the operator is only a shorthand for an explicit call of the operator function. For example:   530  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  void f complex a, complex b  {  complex c = a + b; complex d = a.operator+ b ;      shor thand    explicit call  Given the previous deﬁnition of complex, the two initializers are synonymous.  18.2.1  Binary and Unary Operators A binary operator can be deﬁned by either a non-static member function taking one argument or a nonmember function taking two arguments.  For any binary operator @, aa@bb can be interpreted as  either aa.operator@ bb  or operator@ aa,bb . If both  are  deﬁned,  overload  resolution   §12.3  determines which, if any, interpretation is used. For example:  class X { public:  void operator+ int ; X int ;  void operator+ X,X ; void operator+ X,double ;  void f X a  {  a+1;  1+a;  a+1.0;      a.operator+ 1     ::operator+ X 1 ,a     ::operator+ a,1.0   }  };  }  };  A unary operator, whether preﬁx or postﬁx, can be deﬁned by either a non-static member function taking no arguments or a nonmember function taking one argument.  For any preﬁx unary operator @, @aa can be interpreted as either aa.operator@   or operator@ aa . If both are deﬁned, overload resolution  §12.3  determines which, if any,  interpretation is used. For any postﬁx unary operator @, aa@ can be interpreted as either aa.operator@ int  or operator@ aa,int . This is explained further in §19.2.4. If both are deﬁned, overload resolution  §12.3  determines which, if any, interpretation is used. An operator can be declared only for the syntax deﬁned for it in the grammar  §iso.A . For example, a user cannot deﬁne a unary % or a ternary +. Consider:  class X { public:      members  with implicit this pointer :  X∗ operator&  ;  X operator& X ;  X operator++ int ;  X operator& X,X ;  X operator   ;      preﬁx unary& address of     binar y& and     postﬁx increment  see §19.2.4     error :ter nary    error :unar y    Section 18.2.1  Binary and Unary Operators  531     nonmember functions :  X operator− X ;  X operator− X,X ;  X operator−− X&,int ;  X operator−  ;  X operator− X,X,X ;  X operator% X ;      preﬁx unaryminus    binar yminus    postﬁx decrement    error :no operand    error :ter nary    error :unar y%  Operator [] is described in §19.2.1, operator    in §19.2.2, operator −> in §19.2.3, operators ++ and −− in §19.2.4, and the allocation and deallocation operators in §11.2.4 and §19.2.5.  The  operators operator=  §18.2.2 , operator[]  §19.2.1 , operator    §19.2.2 ,  and operator−>   §19.2.3  must be non-static member functions.  The default meaning of &&, , and ,  comma  involves sequencing: the ﬁrst operand is evaluated before the second  and for && and  the second operand is not always evaluated .  This special rule does not hold for user-deﬁned versions of &&, , and ,  comma ; instead these operators are treated exactly like other binary operators.  18.2.2  Predeﬁned Meanings for Operators The meanings of some built-in operators are deﬁned to be equivalent to some combination of other operators on the same arguments.  For example, if a is an int, ++a means a+=1, which in turn means a=a+1. Such relations do not hold for user-deﬁned operators unless the user deﬁnes them to. For example, a compiler will not generate a deﬁnition of Z::operator+=   from the deﬁnitions of Z::opera- tor+   and Z::operator=  .  The operators =  assignment , &  address-of , and ,  sequencing; §10.3.2  have predeﬁned mean- ings  when  applied  to  class  objects. These  predeﬁned  meanings  can  be  eliminated   ‘‘deleted’’; §17.6.4 :  class X { public:     ... void operator= const X&  = delete; void operator&   = delete; void operator, const X&  = delete;    ...  void f X a, X b  {  a = b; &a;  a,b;      error :no operator=      error :no operator&      error :no operator,    };  }  Alternatively, they can be given new meanings by suitable deﬁnitions.   532  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  18.2.3  Operators and User-Deﬁned Types An operator function must either be a member or take at least one argument of a user-deﬁned type  functions redeﬁning the new and delete operators need not . This rule ensures that a user cannot change  the  meaning  of  an  expression  unless  the  expression  contains  an  object  of  a  user-deﬁned type.  In particular, it is not  possible  to  deﬁne  an  operator  function  that  operates  exclusively  on pointers.  This ensures that C++ is extensible but not mutable  with the exception of operators =, &, and , for class objects .  An operator function intended to accept a built-in type  §6.2.1  as its ﬁrst operand cannot be a member function. For example, consider adding a complex variable aa to the integer 2: aa+2 can, with a suitably declared member function, be interpreted as aa.operator+ 2 , but 2+aa cannot because there is no class int for which to deﬁne + to mean 2.operator+ aa . Even if there were, two different member  functions  would  be  needed  to  cope  with 2+aa and aa+2. Because  the  compiler  does  not know the meaning of a user-deﬁned +, it cannot assume that the operator is commutative  and so interpret 2+aa as aa+2. This example is trivially handled using one or more nonmember functions  §18.3.2, §19.4 .  Enumerations are user-deﬁned types so that we can deﬁne operators for them. For example:  enum Day { sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat };  Day& operator++ Day& d  {  }  return d =  sat==d  ? sun : static_cast  d+1 ;  Every  expression  is  checked  for  ambiguities. Where  a  user-deﬁned  operator  provides  a  possible interpretation, the expression is checked according to the overload resolution rules in §12.3.  18.2.4  Passing Objects When  we  deﬁne  an  operator, we typically  want  to  provide  a  conventional  notation,  for  example, a=b+c. Consequently, we hav e limited choices of how to pass arguments to the operator function and  how it returns  its  value.  For  example,  we  cannot  require  pointer  arguments  and  expect  pro- grammers to use the address-of operator or return a pointer and expect the user to dereference it: ∗a=&b+&c is not acceptable.  For arguments, we have two main choices  §12.2 :  cid:129  Pass-by-value  cid:129  Pass-by-reference  For small objects, say, one to four words, call-by-value is typically a viable alternative and often the one that gives the best performance. However, performance of argument passing and use depends on machine architecture, compiler interface conventions  Application Binary Interfaces; ABIs , and the  number  of  times  an  argument  is  accessed   it  almost  always  is  faster  to  access  an  argument passed by value than one passed by reference . For example, assume that a Point is represented as a pair of ints:  void Point::operator+= Point delta ;     pass-by-value   Section 18.2.4  Passing Objects  533  Larger objects, we pass by reference. For example, because a Matrix  a simple matrix of doubles; §17.5.1  is most likely larger than a few words, we use pass-by-reference:  Matrix operator+ const Matrix&, const Matrix& ;     pass-by-const-reference  In particular, we use const references to pass large objects that are not meant to be modiﬁed by the called function  §12.2.1 .  Typically, an operator  returns  a  result. Returning  a  pointer  or  a  reference  to  a  newly  created object  is  usually  a  very  bad  idea:  using  a  pointer  gives notational  problems,  and  referring  to  an object  on  the  free  store   whether  by  a  pointer  or  by  a  reference   results  in  memory  management problems.  Instead, return objects by value.  For large objects, such as a Matrix, deﬁne move opera- tions to make such transfers of values efﬁcient  §3.3.2, §17.5.2 . For example:  Matrix operator+ const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b  {     return-by-value  Matrix res {a}; return res+=b;  Note that operators that return one of their argument objects can – and usually do – return a refer- ence.  For example, we could deﬁne Matrix’s operator += like this:  Matrix& Matrix::operator+= const Matrix& a  {  if  dim[0]!=a.dim[0]  dim[1]!=a.dim[1]   throw std::exception "bad Matrix += argument" ;     return-by-reference  }  }  double∗ p = elem; double∗ q = a.elem; double∗ end = p+dim[0]∗dim[1]; while p!=end   ∗p++ += ∗q++  return ∗this;  This is particularly common for operator functions that are implemented as members.  If a function simply passes an object to another function, an rvalue reference argument should  be used  §17.4.3, §23.5.2.1, §28.6.3 .  18.2.5  Operators in Namespaces An operator is either a member of a class or deﬁned in some namespace  possibly the global name- space .  Consider this simpliﬁed version of string I O from the standard library:  namespace std {     simpliﬁed std  class string {     ...  };   534  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  class ostream {     ... ostream& operator<< const char∗ ;   };  extern ostream cout;     output C-style string  ostream& operator<< ostream&, const string& ;     output std::string  }    namespace std  int main   {  }  const char∗ p = "Hello"; std::string s = "world"; std::cout << p << ", " << s << "!\n";  Naturally, this  writes  out Hello,  world!. But  why?  Note that  I  didn’t make everything  from std accessible by writing:  Instead, I used the std:: preﬁx for string and cout. In other words, I was on my best behavior and didn’t pollute the global namespace or in other ways introduce unnecessary dependencies.  The output operator for C-style strings is a member of std::ostream, so by deﬁnition  However, std::ostream doesn’t hav e a member function to output a std::string, so  using namespace std;  std::cout << p  means  std::cout.operator<< p   std::cout << s  means  operator<< std::cout,s   Operators deﬁned in namespaces can be found based on their operand types just as functions can be found  based  on  their  argument  types   §14.2.4 . In  particular, cout is  in  namespace std, so std is considered when looking for a suitable deﬁnition of <<. In that way, the compiler ﬁnds and uses:  std::operator<< std::ostream&, const std::string&   Consider a binary operator @. If x is of type X and y is of type Y, x@y is resolved like this:   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   If X is a class, look for operator@ as a member of X or as a member of a base of X; and look for declarations of operator@ in the context surrounding x@y; and if X is deﬁned in namespace N, look for declarations of operator@ in N; and if Y is deﬁned in namespace M, look for declarations of operator@ in M.  Declarations for several operator@s may be found and overload resolution rules  §12.3  are used to ﬁnd the best match, if any.  This lookup mechanism is applied only if the operator has at least one   Section 18.2.5  Operators in Namespaces  535  operand of a user-deﬁned type. Therefore, user-deﬁned conversions  §18.3.2, §18.4  will be con- sidered.  Note that a type alias is just a synonym and not a separate user-deﬁned type  §6.5 .  Unary operators are resolved analogously. Note that in operator lookup no preference is given to members over nonmembers.  This differs from  lookup  of  named  functions   §14.2.4 . The  lack  of  hiding  of  operators  ensures  that  built-in operators are never inaccessible and that users can supply new meanings for an operator without modifying existing class declarations. For example:  X operator! X ;  struct Z {  Z operator!  ;  X f X x  {  * ...*  return !x; } int f int x  {  * ...*  return !x; }     does not hide ::operator!      invoke ::operator! X     invoke the built-in ! for ints  In particular, the standard iostream library deﬁnes << member functions to output built-in types, and a user can deﬁne << to output user-deﬁned types without modifying class ostream  §38.4.2 .  18.3  A Complex Number Type The implementation of complex numbers presented in §18.1 is too restrictive to please anyone.  For example, we would expect this to work:  };  }  void f   {  complex a {1,2}; complex b {3}; complex c {a+2.3}; complex d {2+b}; b = c∗2∗c;  In addition, we would expect to be provided with a few additional operators, such as == for compar- ison and << for output, and a suitable set of mathematical functions, such as sin   and sqrt  .  Class complex is a concrete type, so its design follows the guidelines from §16.3. In addition, users of complex arithmetic rely so heavily on operators that the deﬁnition of complex brings into play most of the basic rules for operator overloading.  The complex type developed in this section uses double for its scalars and is roughly equivalent  to the standard-library complex   §40.4 .  18.3.1  Member and Nonmember Operators I prefer  to  minimize  the  number  of  functions  that  directly  manipulate  the  representation  of  an object.  This can be achieved by deﬁning only operators that inherently modify the value of their ﬁrst argument, such as +=, in the class itself. Operators that simply produce a new value based on the  values  of  their  arguments,  such  as +, are  then  deﬁned  outside  the  class  and  use  the  essential operators in their implementation:   536  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  };  }  }  }  class complex {  double re, im;  public:  complex& operator+= complex a ;     needs access to representation    ...  complex operator+ complex a, complex b  {  return a += b;     access representation through +=  Given these declarations, we can write:  void f complex x, complex y, complex z  {  complex r1 {x+y+z};    r1 = operator+ operator+ x,y ,z   complex r2 {x};  r2 += y; r2 += z;     r2 = x    r2.operator+= y     r2.operator+= z   The arguments to this operator+   are passed by value, so a+b does not modify its operands.  Except for possible efﬁciency differences, the computations of r1 and r2 are equivalent.  Composite assignment operators such as += and ∗= tend to be simpler to deﬁne than their ‘‘sim- ple’’ counterparts + and ∗. This surprises most people at ﬁrst, but it follows from the fact that three objects are involved in a + operation  the two operands and the result , whereas only two objects are involved  in  a += operation.  In the  latter  case,  run-time  efﬁciency is improved by eliminating  the need for temporary variables.  For example:  inline complex& complex::operator+= complex a  {  re += a.re; im += a.im; return ∗this;  This  does  not  require  a  temporary  variable  to  hold  the  result  of  the  addition  and  is  simple  for  a compiler to inline perfectly.  A good  optimizer  will  generate  close  to  optimal  code  for  uses  of  the  plain + operator  also. However,  we don’t always have  a  good optimizer, and not all types are as simple as complex, so §19.4 discusses ways of deﬁning operators with direct access to the representation of classes.  18.3.2  Mixed-Mode Arithmetic To cope with 2+z, where z is a complex, we need to deﬁne operator + to accept operands of different types.  In Fortran  terminology, we need mixed-mode  arithmetic. We can  achieve  that  simply  by adding appropriate versions of the operators:   Section 18.3.2  Mixed-Mode Arithmetic  537  class complex {  double re, im;  public:  complex& operator+= complex a  {  re += a.re; im += a.im; return ∗this;  complex& operator+= double a  {  re += a; return ∗this;  }  }     ...  };  The three variants of operator+   can be deﬁned outside complex:  complex operator+ complex a, complex b  {  return a += b;     calls complex::operator+= complex   }  }  }  }  complex operator+ complex a, double b  {  return {a.real  +b,a.imag  };  complex operator+ double a, complex b  {  return {a+b.real  ,b.imag  };  The access functions real   and imag   are deﬁned in §18.3.6.  Given these declarations of +, we can write:  void f complex x, complex y  {  auto r1 = x+y; auto r2 = x+2; auto r3 = 2+x; auto r4 = 2+3;     calls operator+ complex,complex     calls operator+ complex,double     calls operator+ double,complex     built-in integer addition  I added the integer addition for completeness.   538  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  18.3.3  Conversions To cope with assignments and initialization of complex variables with scalars, we need a conversion of a scalar  integer or ﬂoating-point number  to a complex. For example:  complex b {3};    should mean b.re=3, b.im=0  void comp complex x  {  x = 4;    ...     should mean x.re=4, x.im=0  We can achieve that by providing a constructor that takes a single argument.  A constructor taking a single argument speciﬁes a conversion from its argument type to the constructor’s type.  For exam- ple:  class complex {  double re, im;  public:  complex double r  :re{r}, im{0} { }    ...     build a complexfrom a double  The constructor speciﬁes the traditional embedding of the real line in the complex plane.  A constructor  is  a  prescription  for  creating  a  value  of  a  given type.  The constructor  is  used when a value of a type is expected and when such a value can be created by a constructor from the value supplied as an initializer or assigned value.  Thus, a constructor requiring a single argument need not be called explicitly. For example:  complex b {3};  means  complex b {3,0};  A user-deﬁned conversion is implicitly applied only if it is unique  §12.3 . If you don’t want a con- structor to be used implicitly, declare it explicit  §16.2.6 .  Naturally, we still need the constructor that takes two doubles, and a default constructor initial-  izing a complex to {0,0} is also useful:  class complex {  double re, im;  public:  complex   : re{0}, im{0} { } complex double r  : re{r}, im{0} { } complex double r, double i  : re{r}, im{i} { }    ...  Using default arguments, we can abbreviate:  }  };  };   Section 18.3.3  Conversions   539  By  default,  copying complex values  is  deﬁned  as  copying  the  real  and  imaginary  parts   §16.2.2 . For example:  class complex {  double re, im;  public:  complex double r =0, double i =0  : re{r}, im{i} { }    ...  void f   {  complex z; complex x {1,2}; complex y {x};    yalso has the value {1,2} z = x;    zalso has the value {1,2}  18.3.3.1  Conversions of Operands  We deﬁned three versions of each of the four standard arithmetic operators:  complex operator+ complex,complex ; complex operator+ complex,double ; complex operator+ double ,complex ;    ...  This can get tedious, and what is tedious easily becomes error-prone.  What if we had three alterna- tives for the type of each argument for each function? We  would need three versions of each sin- gle-argument  function,  nine  versions  of  each  two-argument  function,  27  versions  of  each  three- argument function, etc. Often these variants are very similar. In fact, almost all variants involve a simple conversion of arguments to a common type followed by a standard algorithm.  The alternative to providing different versions of a function for each combination of arguments is  to  rely  on  conversions.  For  example,  our complex class  provides  a  constructor  that  converts  a double to a complex. Consequently, we could simply declare only one version of the equality oper- ator for complex:  bool operator== complex,complex ;  void f complex x, complex y  {  x==y;  x==3;  3==y;      means operator== x,y     means operator== x,complex 3      means operator== complex 3 ,y   There can be reasons for preferring to deﬁne separate functions. For example, in some cases the conversion can impose overhead, and in other cases, a simpler algorithm can be used for speciﬁc argument types. Where such issues are not signiﬁcant, relying on conversions and providing only the  most  general  variant  of  a  function  –  plus  possibly  a  few critical  variants  –  contain  the  };  }  }   540  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  combinatorial explosion of variants that can arise from mixed-mode arithmetic.  Where several variants of a function or an operator exist, the compiler must pick ‘‘the right’’ variant  based  on  the  argument  types  and  the  available   standard  and  user-deﬁned   conversions. Unless a best match exists, an expression is ambiguous and is an error  see §12.3 .  An object constructed by explicit or implicit use of a constructor in an expression is automatic  and will be destroyed at the ﬁrst opportunity  see §10.3.4 .  No implicit user-deﬁned conversions are applied to the left-hand side of a .  or a −> .  This is  the case even when the . is implicit. For example:  void g complex z  {  3+z;  3.operator+= z ;  3+=z;      OK: complex 3 +z     error :3isnot a class object     error :3isnot a class object  }  }  }  Thus, you can approximate the notion that an operator requires an lvalue as its left-hand operand by making that operator a member. Howev er,  that is only an approximation because it is possible to access a temporary with a modifying operation, such as operator+=  :  complex x {4,5} complex z {sqr t x +={1,2}};     liketmp=sqr t x ,tmp+={1,2}  If we don’t want implicit conversions, we can use explicit to suppress them  §16.2.6, §18.4.2 .  18.3.4  Literals We  hav e literals of built-in types. For example, 1.2 and 12e3 are literals of type double. For com- plex, we can come pretty close to that by declaring constructors constexpr  §10.4 .  For example:  class complex { public:  constexpr complex double r =0, double i =0  : re{r}, im{i} { }    ...  Given that, a complex can be constructed from its constituent parts at compile time just like a literal from a built-in type. For example:  complex z1 {1.2,12e3}; constexpr complex z2 {1.2,12e3};      guaranteed compile-time initialization  When constructors are simple and inline, and especially when they are constexpr, it is quite reason- able to think of constructor invocations with literal arguments as literals.  It is possible to go further and introduce a user-deﬁned literal  §19.2.6  in support of our com-  plex type.  In particular, we could deﬁne i to be a sufﬁx meaning ‘‘imaginary.’’ For example:  constexpr complex  operator "" i long double d  {  return {0,d};     complexisaliteral type     imaginar yliteral   Section 18.3.4  Literals   541  This would allow us to write:  complex z1 {1.2+12e3i};  complex f double d  {  auto x {2.3i}; return x+sqrt d+12e3i +12e3i;  }  }  };  This user-deﬁned literal gives us one advantage over what we get from constexpr constructors: we can  use  user-deﬁned  literals  in  the  middle  of  expressions  where  the {} notation  can  only  be  used when qualiﬁed by a type name. The example above is roughly equivalent to:  complex z1 {1.2,12e3};  complex f double d  {  complex x {0,2.3}; return x+sqrt complex{d,12e3} +complex{0,12e3};  I suspect that the choice of style of literal depends on your sense of aesthetics and the conventions of your ﬁeld of work.  The standard-library complex uses constexpr constructors rather than a user- deﬁned literal.  18.3.5  Accessor Functions So far, we hav e provided class complex with constructors and arithmetic operators only. That is not quite sufﬁcient for real use. In particular, we often need to be able to examine and change the value of the real and imaginary parts:  class complex {  double re, im;  public:  constexpr double real   const { return re; } constexpr double imag   const { return im; }  void real double r  { re = r; } void imag double i  { im = i; }    ...  I don’t consider it a good idea to provide individual access to all members of a class; in general, it is  not. For many types,  individual  access   sometimes  referred  to  as get-and-set  functions  is an invitation to disaster. If we are not careful, individual access could compromise an invariant, and it typically  complicates  changes  to  the  representation. For example,  consider  the  opportunities  for misuse from providing getters and setters for every member of the Date from §16.3 or  even more so  for the String from §19.3. However, for complex, real   and imag   are semantically signiﬁcant: some algorithms are most cleanly written if they can set the real and imaginary parts independently.   542  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  For example, given real   and imag  , we can simplify simple, common, and useful operations, such as ==, as nonmember functions  without compromising performance :  inline bool operator== complex a, complex b  {  return a.real  ==b.real   && a.imag  ==b.imag  ;  }  18.3.6  Helper Functions If we put all the bits and pieces together, the complex class becomes:  class complex {  double re, im;  public:  constexpr complex double r =0, double i =0  : re r , im i  { }  constexpr double real   const { return re; } constexpr double imag   const { return im; }  In addition, we must provide a number of helper functions:  void real double r  { re = r; } void imag double i  { im = i; }  complex& operator+= complex ; complex& operator+= double ;     -=, *=, and  =  };  complex operator+ complex,complex ; complex operator+ complex,double ; complex operator+ double ,complex ;     binar y-, *, and    complex operator− complex ;     unar yminus complex operator+ complex ;     unar yplus  bool operator== complex,complex ; bool operator!= complex,complex ;  istream& operator>> istream&,complex& ;  ostream& operator<< ostream&,complex ;      input    output  Note that the members real   and imag   are essential for deﬁning the comparisons. The deﬁnitions of most of the following helper functions similarly rely on real   and imag  .  We might provide functions to allow users to think in terms of polar coordinates:   Section 18.3.6  Helper Functions  543  complex polar double rho, double theta ; complex conj complex ;  double abs complex ; double arg complex ; double norm complex ;  complex acos complex ; complex asin complex ; complex atan complex ;    ...  double real complex ;  double imag complex ;      fornotational convenience    fornotational convenience  Finally, we must provide an appropriate set of standard mathematical functions:  From a user’s point of view, the complex type presented here is almost identical to the complex<dou- ble> found in   in the standard library  §5.6.2, §40.4 .  18.4  Type Conversion Type conversion can be accomplished by   cid:129  A constructor taking a single argument  §16.2.5   cid:129  A conversion operator  §18.4.1   In either case the conversion can be   cid:129    cid:129   explicit; that is, the conversion is only performed in a direct initialization  §16.2.6 , i.e., as an initializer not using a =. Implicit; that is, it will be applied wherever it can be used unambiguously  §18.4.3 , e.g., as a function argument.  18.4.1  Conversion Operators Using a constructor taking a single argument to specify type conversion is convenient but has impli- cations that can be undesirable. Also, a constructor cannot specify  [1]   [2]   an implicit  conversion  from  a  user-deﬁned  type  to  a  built-in  type   because  the  built-in types are not classes , or a conversion from a new class to a previously deﬁned class  without modifying the decla- ration for the old class .  These problems can be handled by deﬁning a conversion operator for the source type. A member function X::operator T  , where T is a type name, deﬁnes a conversion from X to T. For example, we could deﬁne a 6-bit non-negative integer, Tiny, that can mix freely with integers in arithmetic opera- tions. Tiny throws Bad_range if its operations overﬂow or underﬂow:   544  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  class Tiny { char v; void assign int i  { if  i&˜077  throw Bad_rang e  ; v=i; }  public:  class Bad_range { };  Tiny int i  { assign i ; } Tiny& operator= int i  { assign i ; return ∗this; }  operator int   const { return v; }     conversion to int function  The range is checked whenever a Tiny is initialized by an int and whenever an int is assigned to one. No range check is needed when we copy a Tiny, so the default copy constructor and assignment are just right.  To enable the usual integer operations on Tiny variables, we deﬁne the implicit conversion from Tiny to int, Tiny::operator int  . Note that the type being converted to is part of the name of the oper- ator and cannot be repeated as the return value of the conversion function:  Tiny::operator int   const { return v; } int Tiny::operator int   const { return v; }     right    error  In this respect also, a conversion operator resembles a constructor.  Whenever a Tiny appears where an int is needed, the appropriate int is used. For example:  int main   {  Tiny c1 = 2; Tiny c2 = 62; Tiny c3 = c2−c1;  Tiny c4 = c3;  int i = c1+c2;     c3 = 60    no range check not necessary     i=64  c1 = c1+c2; i = c3−64;  c2 = c3−64; c3 = c4;     range error:c1can’t be 64    i=-4    range error:c2can’t be -4    no range check not necessary   };  }  Conversion  functions  appear  to  be  particularly  useful  for  handling  data  structures  when  reading  implemented by a conversion operator  is trivial, while assignment and initialization are distinctly less trivial.  The istream and ostream types rely on a conversion function to enable statements such as:  while  cin>>x  cout<<x;  The input operation cin>>x returns an istream&. That value is implicitly converted to a value indi- cating the state of cin. This value can then be tested by the while  see §38.4.4 . However, it is typi- cally not a good idea to deﬁne an implicit conversion from one type to another in such a way that   Section 18.4.1  Conversion Operators  545  information is lost in the conversion.  In general, it is wise to be sparing in the introduction of conversion operators. When used in excess, they lead to ambiguities. Such ambiguities are caught by the compiler, but they can be a nuisance to resolve.  Probably the best idea is initially to do conversions by named functions, such as X::make_int  . If such a function becomes popular enough to make explicit use inelegant, it can be replaced by a conversion operator X::operator int  .  If  both  user-deﬁned  conversions  and  user-deﬁned  operators  are  deﬁned,  it  is  possible  to  get  ambiguities between the user-deﬁned operators and the built-in operators. For example:  int operator+ Tiny,Tiny ;  void f Tiny t, int i  {  t+i;      error,ambiguous: ‘‘operator+ t,Tiny i  ’’or‘‘int t +i’’?  It is therefore often best to rely on user-deﬁned conversions or user-deﬁned operators for a given type, but not both.  18.4.2 explicit Conversion Operators Conversion operators tend to be deﬁned so that they can be used everywhere.  However, it is possi- ble to declare a conversion operator explicit and have it apply only for direct initialization  §16.2.6 , where an equivalent explicit constructor would have been used. For example, the standard-library unique_ptr  §5.2.1, §34.3.1  has an explicit conversion to bool:  template  > class unique_ptr { public:     ... explicit operator bool   const noexcept;     ...     does *this hold a pointer  that is not nullptr ?  The  reason  to  declare  this  conversion  operator explicit is  to  avoid  its  use  in  surprising  contexts. Consider:  void use unique_ptr  p, unique_ptr  q  {  if  !p      OK: wewant this use  throw Inv alid_uninque_ptr{};  bool b = p; int x = p+q;     error ;suspicious use    error ;we deﬁnitly don’t want this  }  };  }  Had unique_ptr’s conversion to bool not been explicit, the last two deﬁnitions would have compiled. The value of b would have become true and the value of x would have become 1 or 2  depending on whether q was valid or not .   546  Operator Overloading   Chapter 18  18.4.3  Ambiguities An assignment of a value of type V to an object of class X is legal if there is an assignment operator X::operator= Z  so that V is Z or there is a unique conversion of V to Z. Initialization is treated equiv- alently.  In some cases, a value of the desired type can be constructed by repeated use of constructors or conversion operators. This must be handled by explicit conversions; only one level of user-deﬁned implicit conversion is legal.  In some cases, a value of the desired type can be constructed in more than one way; such cases are illegal.  For example:  class X {  * ...*  X int ; X const char∗ ; }; class Y {  * ...*  Y int ; }; class Z {  * ...*  Z X ; };  X f X ; Y f Y ;  Z g Z ;  void k1   {  }  }  class XX {  * ...*  XX int ; };  void h double ; void h XX ;  void k2   {  f 1 ;  f X{1} ;  f Y{1} ;      error :ambiguous f X 1   or f Y 1  ?    OK    OK  g "Mack" ;  g X{"Doc"} ;  g Z{"Suzy"} ;      error :twouser-deﬁned conversions needed; g Z{X{"Mack"}}  not tried    OK: g Z{X{"Doc"}}     OK: g Z{X{"Suzy"}}   User-deﬁned conversions are considered only if a call cannot be resolved without them  i.e., using only built-in conversions .  For example:  h 1 ;    h double{1}  or h XX{1} ? h double{1} !  The call h 1  means h double 1   because that alternative uses only a standard conversion rather than a user-deﬁned conversion  §12.3 .  The rules for conversion are neither the simplest to implement, nor the simplest to document, nor the most general that could be devised.  They are, however, considerably safer, and the resulting resolutions  are  typically  less  surprising  than  alternatives.  It is  far  easier  to  manually  resolve an ambiguity than to ﬁnd an error caused by an unsuspected conversion.   Section 18.4.3  Ambiguities   547  The insistence on strict bottom-up analysis implies that the return type is not used in overload-  Quad r1 = a1+a2; Quad r2 = Quad{a1}+a2;    force quad arithmetic     double-precision ﬂoating-point add  The reason for this design choice is partly that strict bottom-up analysis is more comprehensible and  partly  that  it  is  not  considered  the  compiler’s job  to  decide  which  precision  the  programmer might want for the addition.  Once the types of both sides of an initialization or assignment have been determined, both types  are used to resolve the initialization or assignment. For example:  ing resolution. For example:  class Quad { public:  Quad double ;    ...  Quad operator+ Quad,Quad ;  void f double a1, double a2  {  class Real { public:  operator double  ; operator int  ;    ...  void g Real a  {  double d = a; int i = a;     d=a.double  ;    i=a.int  ;  d = a; i = a;     d=a.double  ;    i=a.int  ;  };  }  };  }  In  these  cases,  the  type  analysis  is  still  bottom-up,  with  only  a  single  operator  and  its  argument types considered at any one time.  18.5  Advice [1]  Deﬁne operators primarily to mimic conventional usage; §18.1.

In fact, operators are crucial in the design of containers  e.g., vector and map; §4.4 , ‘‘smart pointers’’  e.g., unique_ptr and shared_ptr; §5.2.1 , iterators  §4.5 , and other classes concerned with resource management.  19.2  Special Operators The operators  []       −>  ++  −−  new delete  are special only in that the mapping from their use in the code to a programmer’s deﬁnition differs slightly from that used for conventional unary and binary operators, such as +, <, and ˜  §18.2.3 . The []  subscript  and     call  operators are among the most useful user-deﬁned operators.   550   Special Operators   Chapter 19  19.2.1  Subscripting An operator[] function can be used to give subscripts a meaning for class objects. The second argu- ment  the subscript  of an operator[] function may be of any type.  This makes it possible to deﬁne vectors, associative arrays, etc.  As an example, we can deﬁne a simple associative array type like this:  struct Assoc {  vector > vec;     vector of {name,value} pairs  const int& operator[]  const string&  const; int& operator[] const string& ;  An Assoc keeps  a  vector  of std::pairs.  The implementation  uses  the  same  trivial  and  inefﬁcient search method as in §7.7:  };  {  }  }  int& Assoc::operator[] const string& s      search for s; returnareference to its value if found;    otherwise,makeanew pair {s,0} and returnareference to its value  for  auto x : vec   if  s == x.ﬁrst  return x.second;  vec.push_back {s,0} ;      initial value: 0  return vec.back  .second;      returnlast element  §31.2.2   We can use Assoc like this:  int main   {     count the occurrences of each word on input  Assoc values; string buf; while  cin>>buf  ++values[buf]; for  auto x : values.vec   cout << '{' << x.ﬁrst << ',' << x.second << "}\n";  The standard-library map and unordered_map are further developments of the idea of an associative array  §4.4.3, §31.4.3  with less naive implementations. An operator[]   must be a non-static member function.  19.2.2  Function Call Function call, that is, the notation expression expression-list , can be interpreted as a binary opera- tion with the expression as the left-hand operand and the expression-list as the right-hand operand. The call operator,   , can be overloaded in the same way as other operators can. For example:   Section 19.2.2  Function Call  551  struct Action {  int operator   int ; pair  operator   int,int ; double operator   double ;    ...  void f Action act  {  int x = act 2 ; auto y = act 3,4 ; double z = act 2.3 ;    ...  };  };  };  }  An argument list for an operator     is evaluated and checked according to the usual argument-pass- ing rules. Overloading the function call operator seems to be useful primarily for deﬁning types that have only a single operation and for types for which one operation is predominant. The call operator is also known as the application operator.  The  most  obvious  and  also  the  most  important,  use  of  the    operator  is  to  provide  the  usual function call syntax for objects that in some way behave like functions.  An object that acts like a function is often called a function-like object or simply a function object  §3.4.3 .  Such function objects allow us to write code that takes nontrivial operations as parameters. In many cases, it is essential that function objects can hold data needed to perform their operation. For example, we can deﬁne a class with an operator     that adds a stored value to its argument:  class Add {  complex val;  public:  Add complex c  :val{c} { } Add double r, double i  :val{{r,i}} { }     save a value  void operator   complex& c  const { c += val; }     add a value to argument  An object of class Add is initialized with a complex number, and when invoked using   , it adds that number to its argument.  For example:  void h vector & vec, list & lst, complex z  {  for_each vec.begin  ,vec.end  ,Add{2,3} ; for_each lst.begin  ,lst.end  ,Add{z} ;  This will add complex{2,3} to every element of the vector and z to every element of the list. Note that Add{z} constructs an object that is used repeatedly by for_each  : Add{z}’s operator     is called for each element of the sequence.  This all works because for_each is a template that applies    to its third argument without caring  exactly what that third argument really is:   552   Special Operators   Chapter 19  template  Fct for_each Iter b, Iter e, Fct f  {  while  b != e  f ∗b++ ; return f;  }  }  };  }  }  At  ﬁrst  glance,  this  technique  may  look  esoteric,  but  it  is  simple,  efﬁcient,  and  extremely  useful  §3.4.3, §33.4 .  Note  that  a  lambda  expression   §3.4.3,  §11.4   is  basically  a  syntax  for  deﬁning  a  function  object.  For example, we could have written:  void h2 vector & vec, list & lst, complex z  {  for_each vec.begin  ,vec.end  ,[] complex& a { a+={2,3}; } ; for_each lst.begin  ,lst.end  ,[] complex& a { a+=z; } ;  In this case, each of the lambda expressions generates the equivalent of the function object Add.  Other popular uses of operator     are as a substring operator and as a subscripting operator for  multidimensional arrays  §29.2.2, §40.5.2 .  An operator     must be a non-static member function. Function call operators are often templates  §29.2.2, §33.5.3 .  19.2.3  Dereferencing The dereferencing operator, −>  also known as the arrow operator , can be deﬁned as a unary post- ﬁx operator. For example:  class Ptr {    ... X∗ operator−>  ;  Objects of class Ptr can be used to access members of class X in a very similar manner to the way pointers are used. For example:  void f Ptr p  {  p−>m = 7;      p.operator->   ->m = 7  The transformation of the object p into the pointer p.operator−>   does not depend on the member m pointed to. That is the sense in which operator−>   is a unary postﬁx operator. Howev er, there is no new syntax introduced, so a member name is still required after the −>. For example:  void g Ptr p  {  X∗ q1 = p−>; X∗ q2 = p.operator−>  ;     syntax error    OK   Section 19.2.3  Dereferencing   553  Overloading −> is primarily useful for creating ‘‘smart pointers,’’ that is, objects that act like point- ers and in addition perform some action whenever an object is accessed through them. The stan- dard-library ‘‘smart pointers’’ unique_ptr and shared_ptr  §5.2.1  provide operator −>.  As an example, we could deﬁne a class Disk_ptr for accessing objects stored on disk. Disk_ptr’s constructor takes a name that can be used to ﬁnd the object on disk, Disk_ptr::operator−>   brings the object into main memory when accessed through its Disk_ptr, and Disk_ptr’s  destructor eventually writes the updated object back out to disk:  template  class Disk_ptr {  string identiﬁer; T∗ in_core_address;    ...  public:  Disk_ptr const string& s  : identiﬁer{s}, in_core_address{nullptr} { } ˜Disk_ptr   { write_to_disk in_core_address,identiﬁer ; }  T∗ operator−>   {  }  if  in_core_address == nullptr   in_core_address = read_from_disk identiﬁer ;  return in_core_address;  Disk_ptr might be used like this:  struct Rec {  string name;    ...  void update const string& s  {  Disk_ptr  p {s};     get Disk_ptr for s  };  };  }  p−>name = "Roscoe";    ...     update s; if necessary, ﬁrst retrieve from disk     p’sdestr uctorwr itesbacktodisk  Naturally, a realistic program would contain error-handling code and use a less naive way of inter- acting with the disk.  For ordinary pointers, use of −> is synonymous with some uses of unary ∗ and []. Giv en a class  Y for which −>, ∗, and [] have their default meaning and a Y∗ called p, then:  p−>m ==  ∗p .m   ∗p .m == p[0].m p−>m == p[0].m     is true    is true    is true  As usual, no such guarantee is provided for user-deﬁned operators. The equivalence can be pro- vided where desired:   554   Special Operators   Chapter 19  template  class Ptr { Y∗ p;  public:  Y∗ operator−>   { return p; } Y& operator∗   { return ∗p; } Y& operator[] int i  { return p[i]; }    ...     dereference to access member    dereference to access whole object    dereference to access element  If you provide more than one of these operators, it might be wise to provide the equivalence, just as it is wise to ensure that ++x and x+=1 have the same effect as x=x+1 for a simple variable x of some class X if ++, +=, =, and + are provided.  The  overloading  of −> is  important  to  a  class  of  interesting  programs  and  is  not  just  a  minor curiosity. The reason is that indirection is a key concept and that overloading −> provides a clean, direct, and efﬁcient way of representing indirection in a program. Iterators  Chapter 33  provide an important example of this.  Operator −> must be a non-static member function. If used, its return type must be a pointer or an object of a class to which you can apply −>. The body of a template class member function is only checked if the function is used  §26.2.1 , so we can deﬁne operator−>   without worrying about types, such as Ptr , for which −> does not make sense.  Despite the similarity between −> and .  dot , there is no way of overloading operator .  dot .  19.2.4  Increment and Decrement Once people invent ‘‘smart pointers,’’  they often decide to provide the increment operator ++ and the decrement operator −− to mirror these operators’ use for built-in types. This is especially obvi- ous and necessary where the aim is to replace an ordinary pointer type with a ‘‘smart pointer’’ type that has the same semantics, except that it adds a bit of run-time error checking. For example, con- sider a troublesome traditional program:  void f1 X a  {     traditional use  X v[200]; X∗ p = &v[0]; p−−; ∗p = a; ++p; ∗p = a;     OK     oops: p out of range,uncaught  };  }  Here, we might want to replace the X∗ with an object of a class Ptr  that can be dereferenced only if  it  actually  points  to  an X. We  would  also  like to ensure  that p can  be  incremented  and  decre- mented only if it points to an object within an array and the increment and decrement operations yield an object within that array. That is, we would like something like this:   Section 19.2.4  Increment and Decrement   555  void f2 Ptr  a  {     checked  X v[200]; Ptr  p &v[0],v ; p−−; ∗p = a; ++p; ∗p = a;     OK     run-time error:pout of range  template  class Ptr { T∗ ptr; T∗ array; int sz;  public:  template   Ptr T∗ p, T &a [N] ;  Ptr T∗ p, T∗ a, int s ; Ptr T∗ p ;   Ptr& operator++  ; Ptr operator++ int ;  Ptr& operator−−  ; Ptr operator−− int ;  T& operator∗  ;      preﬁx    postﬁx     preﬁx    postﬁx     preﬁx  }  };  }  The increment and decrement operators are unique among C++ operators in that they can be used as  both  preﬁx  and  postﬁx  operators. Consequently, we must  deﬁne  preﬁx  and  postﬁx  increment and decrement for Ptr . For example:     bind to array a,sz==N, initial value p    bind to array a ofsizes,initial value p    bind to single object, sz==0, initial value p  The int argument is used to indicate that the function is to be invoked for postﬁx application of ++. This int is never used; the argument is simply a dummy used to distinguish between preﬁx and post- ﬁx application. The way to remember which version of an operator++ is preﬁx is to note that the version without the dummy argument is preﬁx, exactly like all the other unary arithmetic and logi- cal operators. The dummy argument is used only for the ‘‘odd’’ postﬁx ++ and −−.  Consider omitting postﬁx ++ and −− in a design. They are not only odd syntactically, they tend to be marginally harder to implement than the postﬁx versions, less efﬁcient, and less frequently used.  For example:  template  Ptr& Ptr ::operator++   {     ... checkthat ptr+1 can be pointed to ... return ∗++ptr;     returnthe current object after incrementing   556   Special Operators   Chapter 19  The pre-increment operator can return a reference to its object. The post-increment operator must make a new object to return.  template  Ptr Ptr ::operator++ int  {     ... checkthat ptr+1 can be pointed to ... Ptr  old {ptr,array,sz}; ++ptr; return old;     increment and returnaPtr with the old value  }  }  Using Ptr, the example is equivalent to:  void f3 T a  {     checked  T v[200]; Ptr  p &v[0],v,200 ; p.operator−− 0 ;  p.operator∗   = a; p.operator++  ;  p.operator∗   = a;     sufﬁx: p--    run-time error:pout of range    preﬁx: ++p    OK  Completing class Ptr is left as an exercise.  A pointer template that behaves correctly with respect to inheritance is presented in §27.2.2.  19.2.5  Allocation and Deallocation Operator new  §11.2.3  acquires its memory by calling an operator new  . Similarly, operator delete frees its memory by calling an operator delete  . A user can redeﬁne the global operator new   and operator delete   or deﬁne operator new   and operator delete   for a particular class.  Using the standard-library type alias siz e_t  §6.2.8  for sizes, the declarations of the global ver-  sions look like this:  void∗ operator new siz e_t ; void∗ operator new[] siz e_t ; void operator delete void∗, siz e_t ; void operator delete[] void∗, siz e_t ;     use for individual object    use for array    use for individual object    use for array     formore versions,see §11.2.4  That  is,  when new needs  memory  on  the  free  store  for  an  object  of  type X, it calls operator new siz eof X  . Similarly, when new needs  memory  on  the  free  store  for  an  array  of N objects  of type X, it calls operator  new[] N∗siz eof X  . A new expression  may  ask  for  more  memory  than  is indicated by N∗siz eof X , but it will always do so in terms of a number of characters  i.e., a number of bytes . Replacing the global operator  new   and operator  delete   is not for the fainthearted and not recommended. After all, someone else might rely on some aspect of the default behavior or might even hav e supplied other versions of these functions.   Section 19.2.5  Allocation and Deallocation  557  A more selective, and often better, approach is to supply these operations for a speciﬁc class. This class might be the base for many derived classes.  For example, we might like to hav e a class Employee provide a specialized allocator and deallocator for itself and all of its derived classes:  class Employee { public:     ...  void∗ operator new siz e_t ; void operator delete void∗, siz e_t ;  void∗ operator new[] siz e_t ; void operator delete[] void∗, siz e_t ;  Member operator  new  s and operator  delete  s are  implicitly static members.  Consequently, they don’t hav e a this pointer and do not modify an object. They provide storage that a constructor can initialize and a destructor can clean up.  void∗ Employee::operator new siz e_t s  {     allocate s bytes of memoryand returnapointer to it  void Employee::operator delete void∗ p, size_t s  {  if  p  {     delete only if p!=0; see §11.2, §11.2.3     assume p points to s bytes of memoryallocated byEmployee::operator new      and free that memoryfor reuse  };  }  }  }  The  use  of  the  hitherto  mysterious size_t argument  now becomes  obvious.  It is  the  size  of  the object  being deleted.  Deleting a ‘‘plain’’ Employee gives an argument  value  of sizeof Employee ; deleting a Manager derived from Employee that does not have its own operator delete   gives an argu- ment value of sizeof Manager . This allows a class-speciﬁc allocator to avoid storing size informa- tion with each allocation. Naturally, a class-speciﬁc allocator can store such information  as a gen- eral-purpose allocator must  and ignore the size_t argument to operator delete  . Howev er, doing so makes it harder to improve signiﬁcantly on the speed and memory consumption of a general-pur- pose allocator.  How does a compiler know how to supply the right size to operator delete  ? The type speciﬁed in the delete operation matches the type of the object being deleted.  If we delete an object through a pointer to a base class, that base class must have a virtual destructor  §17.2.5  for the correct size to be given:  Employee∗ p = new Manager;     potential trouble  the exact type is lost     ... delete p;     hope Employeehas a virtual destructor  In principle, deallocation is then done by the destructor  which knows the size of its class .   558   Special Operators   Chapter 19  19.2.6  User-deﬁned Literals C++ provides literals for a variety of built-in types  §6.2.6 :  123  1.2  1.2F  'a'  1ULL  0xD0  "as"      int    double    ﬂoat    char    unsigned long long    hexadecimal unsigned    C-style string  const char[3]   In addition, we can deﬁne literals for user-deﬁned types and new forms of literals for built-in types. For example:  "Hi!"s  1.2i  101010111000101b  123s  123.56km  1234567890123456789012345678901234567890x      string,not ‘‘zero-ter minatedarray ofchar’’    imaginar y    binar y    seconds    not miles!  units      extended-precision  Such user-deﬁned  literals are  supported  through  the  notion  of literal  operators that  map  literals with a given sufﬁx into a desired type. The name of a literal operator is operator"" followed by the sufﬁx.  For example:  constexpr complex  operator"" i long double d  {  return {0,d};     complexisaliteral type     imaginar yliteral  std::string operator"" s const char∗ p, size_t n  {  return string{p,n};     requires free-store allocation     std::stringliteral  These two operators deﬁne sufﬁxes i and s, respectively. I use constexpr to enable compile-time evaluation.  Given those, we can write:  template  void f const T& ;  void g   {  f "Hello" ;  f "Hello"s ;  f "Hello\n"s ;      pass pointer to char*    pass  ﬁve-character  string object    pass  six-character  string object  auto z = 2+1i;     complex{2,1}  }  }  }  The basic  implementation  idea is that after parsing what could be a literal, the compiler always checks  for  a  sufﬁx.  The user-deﬁned  literal  mechanism  simply  allows  the  user  to  specify  a  new   Section 19.2.6  User-deﬁned Literals  559  sufﬁx and deﬁne what is to be done with the literal before it. It is not possible to redeﬁne the mean- ing of a built-in literal sufﬁx or to augment the syntax of literals.  There are four kinds of literals that can be sufﬁxed to make a user-deﬁned literal  §iso.2.14.8 :  cid:129  An integer literal  §6.2.4.1 : accepted by a literal operator taking an unsigned long long or a for  example, 123m or  literal  operator,  template   const  char∗ argument  or  by  a  12345678901234567890X   cid:129  A ﬂoating-point  literal   §6.2.5.1 :  accepted  by  a  literal  operator  taking  a long  double or  a example,  template   operator,  literal   char∗  for   or   a  const  12345678901234567890.976543210x or 3.99s  argument   by    cid:129  A string literal  §7.3.2 : accepted by a literal operator taking a  const  char∗, size_t  pair of  arguments, for example, "string"s and R" Foo\bar "_path   cid:129  A character literal  §6.2.3.2 : accepted by a literal operator taking a character argument of  type char, wchar_t, char16_t, or char32_t, for example, 'f'_runic or u'BEEF'_w.  For example,  we could deﬁne a literal operator to  collect digits for integer values  that  cannot  be represented in any of the built-in integer types:  Bignum operator"" x const char∗ p  {  return Bignum p ;  }  void f Bignum ;  f 123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345x ;  Here, the C-style string "123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345" is passed to operator"" x  . Note that I did not put those digits in double quotes. I requested a C-style string for my opera- tor, and the compiler delivered it from the digits provided.  To  get a C-style string from the program source text into a literal operator, we request both the  string and its number of characters. For example:  string operator"" s const char∗ p, size_t n ;  string s12 = "one two"s;  string s22 = "two\ntwo"s;  string sxx = R" two\ntwo "s;      calls operator "" "one two",7     calls operator "" "two\ntwo",7     calls operator "" "two\\ntwo",8   In the raw string  §7.3.2.1 , "\n" represents the two characters ’\’ and 'n'.  The rationale for requiring the number of characters is that if we want to have ‘‘a different kind  of string,’’ we almost always want to know the number of characters anyway.  A literal operator that takes just a const char∗ argument  and no size  can be applied to integer  and ﬂoating-point literals. For example:  string operator"" SS const char∗ p ;      warning: this will not wor kas expected  string s12 = "one two"SS;  string s13 = 13SS;     error :no applicable literal operator    OK, but whywould anyone do that?  A literal operator converting numerical values to strings could be quite confusing.   560   Special Operators   Chapter 19  A template literal operator is a literal operator that takes its argument as a template parameter  pack, rather than as a function argument.  For example:  template  constexpr int operator"" _b3  ;     base 3, i.e., ternar y  Given that, we get:  201_b3  241_b3      means operator"" b3   ; so 9*2+0*3+1 == 19    means operator"" b3   ; so error:4isn’t a ternar ydigit  The variadic template techniques  §28.6  can be disconcerting, but it is the only way of assigning nonstandard meanings to digits at compile time.  To deﬁne operator"" _b3  , we need some helper functions:  constexpr int ipow int x, int n     xtothe nth powerfor n>=0 {  return  n>0  ? x∗ipow n−1  : 1;  template  constexpr int b3_helper   {     handle the single ternar ydigit case  static_assert c<'3',"not a ternar y digit" ; return c;  template     peel off one ternar ydigit constexpr int b3_helper   {  static_assert c<'3',"not a ternar y digit" ; return ipow 3,siz eof... tail  ∗ c−'0' +b3_helper tail... ;  Given that, we can deﬁne our base 3 literal operator:  template  constexpr int operator"" _b3   {  return b3_helper chars... ;     base 3, i.e., ternar y  }  }  }  }  namespace Numerics {     ...  class Bignum {  * ...*  };  namespace literals {  Bignum operator"" x char const∗ ;  }  Many sufﬁxes will be short  e.g., s for std::string, i for imaginary, m for meter  §28.7.3 , and x for extended , so different uses could easily clash. Use namespaces to prevent clashes:   Section 19.2.6  User-deﬁned Literals  561     ...  }  using namespace Numerics::literals;  The standard library reserves all sufﬁxes not starting with an initial underscore, so deﬁne your suf- ﬁxes starting with an underscore or risk your code breaking in the future:  123km  123_km      reser ved bythe standard librar y    available for your use  19.3  A String Class The relatively simple string class presented in this section illustrates several techniques that are use- ful  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  classes  using  conventionally  deﬁned  operators. This String is a simpliﬁed version of the standard-library string  §4.2, Chapter 36 . String provides value semantics,  checked  and  unchecked  access  to  characters,  stream  I O,  support  for  range-for loops, equality  operations,  and  concatenation  operators. I also  added  a String literal,  which std::string does not  yet  have.  To  allow simple interoperability with C-style strings  including string literals  §7.3.2  , I repre- sent strings as zero-terminated arrays of characters. For realism, I implement the short string opti- mization. That  is,  a String with  only  a  few characters  stores  those  characters  in  the  class  object itself,  rather  than  on  the  free  store. This  optimizes  string  usage  for  small  strings. Experience shows that for a huge number of applications most strings are short. This optimization is particu- larly important in multi-threaded systems where sharing through pointers  or references  is infeasi- ble and free-store allocation and deallocation relatively expensive.  To  allow Strings to efﬁciently ‘‘grow’’ by adding characters at the end, I implement a scheme for keeping extra space for such growth similar to the one used for vector  §13.6.1 .  This makes String a suitable target for various forms of input.  Writing a better string class and or one that provides more facilities is a good exercise.  That  done, we can throw away our exercises and use std::string  Chapter 36 .  19.3.1  Essential Operations Class String provides the usual set of constructors, a destructor, and assignment operations  §17.1 :  class String { public:  String  ;   explicit String const char∗ p ;      constructorfrom C-style string: x{"Euler"}     default constructor :x{""}  String const String& ; String& operator= const String& ;     copyconstr uctor    copyassignment   562   Special Operators   Chapter 19  String String&& x ; String& operator= String&& x ;     move constr uctor    move assignment  ˜String   { if  short_max<sz  delete[] ptr; }     destructor     ...  };  This String has value semantics. That is, after an assignment s1=s2, the two strings s1 and s2 are fully distinct, and subsequent changes to one have no effect on the other. The alternative would be to give String pointer semantics. That would be to let changes to s2 after s1=s2 also affect the value of s1. Where it makes sense, I prefer value semantics; examples are complex, vector, Matrix, and string. Howev er,  for value semantics to be affordable, we need to pass Strings by reference when we don’t need copies and to implement move semantics  §3.3.2, §17.5.2  to optimize returns.  The  slightly  nontrivial  representation  of String is  presented  in  §19.3.3. Note  that  it  requires  user-deﬁned versions of the copy and move operations.  19.3.2  Access to Characters The design of access operators for a string is a difﬁcult topic because ideally access is by conven- tional notation  that is, using [] , maximally efﬁcient, and range checked.  Unfortunately, you can- not  have  all  of  these  properties  simultaneously. Here,  I  follow the  standard  library  by  providing efﬁcient  unchecked  operations  with  the  conventional [] subscript  notation  plus  range-checked at   operations:  class String { public:     ...  char& operator[] int n  { return ptr[n]; } char operator[] int n  const { return ptr[n]; }     uncheckedelement access  char& at int n  { check n ; return ptr[n]; } char at int n  const { check n ; return ptr[n]; }     range-checkedelement access  String& operator+= char c ;     add c at end  const char∗ c_str   { return ptr; } const char∗ c_str   const { return ptr; }     C-style string access  int size   const { return sz; } int capacity   const     number of elements    elements plus available space  { return  sz<=short_max  ? short_max : sz+space; }     ...  };  The idea is to use [] for ordinary use. For example:   Section 19.3.2  Access to Characters  563  int hash const String& s  {  int h {s[0]}; for  int i {1}; i!=s.size  ; i++  h ˆ= s[i]>>1; return h;     uncheckedaccess to s  Here,  using  the  checked at   would  be  redundant  because  we  correctly  access s only  from 0 to s.size  −1.  We can use at   where we see a possibility of mistakes.  For example:  void print_in_order const String& s,const vector & index  {  for  x : index  cout << s.at x  << ‘\n';  Unfortunately, assuming that people will use at   consistently where mistakes can be made is overly optimistic, so some implementations of std::string  from which the [] at   convention is borrowed  also check []. I personally prefer a checked [] at least during development.  However,  for serious string  manipulation  tasks,  a  range  check  on  each  character  access  could  impose  quite  noticeable overhead.  I provide const and  non-const versions  of  the  access  functions  to  allow them  to  be  used  for  const as well as other objects.  19.3.3  Representation The representation for String was chosen to meet three goals:  access to the characters of a String as a C-style string   cid:129  To minimize the use of the free store  cid:129  To make adding characters to the end of a String efﬁcient   cid:129  To make it easy to convert a C-style string  e.g., a string literal  to a String and to allow easy  The result is clearly messier than a simple {pointer,size} representation, but much more realistic:  class String {  *  Asimple string that implements the shortstr ingoptimization  size  ==sz is the number of elements if size  <= short_max, the characters are held in the String object itself; otherwise the free store is used.  ptr points to the startofthe character sequence the character sequence is kept zero-ter minated:ptr[size  ]==0; this allows us to use C librar ystr ingfunctions and to easily returnaC-style string: c_str    To allowefﬁcient addition of characters at end, String grows bydoubling its allocation; capacity   is the amount of space available for characters  excluding the terminating 0 : sz+space  }  }  *    564   Special Operators   Chapter 19  public:     ...  private:  };  }  static const int short_max = 15; int sz; char∗ ptr; union {     number of characters  int space; char ch[shor t_max+1];     unused allocated space    leave space for terminating 0  void check int n  const {  if  n<0  sz<=n      range check  throw std::out_of_rang e "String::at  " ;     ancillar ymember functions: void copy_from const String& x ; void move_from String& x ;  };  This supports what is known as the short string optimization by using two string representations: If sz<=short_max, the characters are stored in the String object itself, in the array named ch. If ! sz<=short_max , the  characters  are  stored  on  the  free  store  and  we  may  allocate  extra space for expansion.  The member named space is the number of such characters.   cid:129   cid:129   In both cases, the number of elements is kept in sz and we look at sz, to determine which imple- mentation scheme is used for a given string.  In both cases, ptr points to the elements. This is essential for performance: the access functions do not need to test which representation is used; they simply use ptr. Only the constructors, assign- ments, moves, and the destructor  §19.3.4  must care about the two alternatives.  We use the array ch only if sz<=short_max and the integer space only if ! sz<=short_max . Con- sequently, it would be a waste to allocate space for both ch and space in a String object.  To avoid such waste, I use a union  §8.3 .  In particular, I used a form of union called an anonymous union  §8.3.2 ,  which  is  speciﬁcally  designed  to  allow a class  to  manage  alternative  representations  of objects.  All members  of  an  anonymous  union  are  allocated  in  the  same  memory, starting  at  the same address. Only one member may be used at any one time, but otherwise they are accessed and used exactly as if they were separate members of the scope surrounding the anonymous union. It is the programmer’s job to make sure that they are never misused.  For example, all member functions of String that use space must make sure that it really was space that was set and not ch. That is done by looking at sz<=short_max. In other words, Shape is  among other things  a discriminated union with sz<=short_max as the discriminant.   Section 19.3.3.1  Ancillary Functions  565  19.3.3.1  Ancillary Functions  In addition to functions intended for general use, I found that my code became cleaner when I pro- vided three ancillary functions as ‘‘building blocks’’ to help me with the somewhat tricky represen- tation and to minimize code replication. Tw o of those need to access the representation of String, so  I  made  them  members. However,  I  made  them private members  because  they don’t represent operations that are generally useful and safe to use. For many interesting classes, the implementa- tion  is  not  just  the  representation  plus  the public functions.  Ancillary functions  can  lead  to  less duplication of code, better design, and improved maintainability.  The ﬁrst such function moves characters into newly allocated memory: char∗ expand const char∗ ptr, int n  {     expand into free store  This function does not access the String representation, so I did not make it a member.  The second implementation function is used by copy operations to give a String a copy of the  char∗ p = new char[n]; strcpy p,ptr ;  return p;     §43.4  members of another:  void String::copy_from const String& x      make*this a copyofx  if  x.sz<=short_max  {  memcpy this,&x,siz eof x  ; ptr = ch;     copy*this    §43.5  } else {  ptr = expand x.ptr,x.sz+1 ; sz = x.sz; space = 0;     copythe elements  Any necessary cleanup of the target String is the task of callers of copy_from  ; copy_from   uncondi- tionally overwrites its target.  I use the standard-library memcpy    §43.5  to copy the bytes of the source into the target.  That’s a low-level and sometimes pretty nasty function. It should be used only  where  there  are  no  objects  with  constructors  or  destructors  in  the  copied  memory  because memcpy   knows nothing about types. Both String copy operations use copy_from  .  The corresponding function for move operations is:  void String::move_from String& x  {  if  x.sz<=short_max  {  memcpy this,&x,siz eof x  ; ptr = ch;     copy*this    §43.5  }  {  }  }  }   566   Special Operators   Chapter 19  else {     grabthe elements  ptr = x.ptr; sz = x.sz; space = x.space; x.ptr = x.ch;  x.sz = 0; x.ch[0]=0;     x=""  }  }  It too unconditionally makes its target a copy of its argument.  However, it does not leave its argu- ment owning any free store. I could also have used memcpy   in the long string case, but since a long string representation uses only part of String’s representation, I decided to copy the used mem- bers individually.  19.3.4  Member Functions The default constructor deﬁnes a String to be empty:  String::String     : sz{0}, ptr{ch}      default constructor :x{""}    ptr points to elements,chisaninitial location  §19.3.3   {  }  ch[0] = 0;     terminating0  Given copy_from   and move_from  , the constructors, moves, and assignments are fairly simple to implement.  The constructor  that  takes  a  C-style  string  argument  must  determine  the  number  of characters and store them appropriately:  String::String const char∗ p   :sz{strlen p }, ptr{ sz<=short_max  ? ch : new char[sz+1]}, space{0}  strcpy ptr,p ;      copycharacters into ptr from p  {  }  }  If the argument is a short string, ptr is set to point to ch; otherwise, space is allocated on the free store.  In either case, the characters are copied from the argument string into the memory managed by String.  The copy constructor simply copies the representation of its arguments:  String::String const String& x  {     copyconstr uctor  copy_from x ;     copyrepresentation from x  I didn’t bother trying to optimize the case where the size of the source equals the size of the target  as was done for vector; §13.6.3 .  I don’t know if that would be worthwhile.  Similarly, the move constructor moves the representation from its source  and possibly sets it  argument to be the empty string :   Section 19.3.4  Member Functions  567  String::String String&& x  {  move_from x ;     move constr uctor  Like the copy constructor, the copy assignment uses copy_from   to clone its argument’s representa- tion.  In addition, it has to delete any free store owned by the target and make sure it does not get into trouble with self-assignment  e.g., s=s :  String& String::operator= const String& x  {  if  this==&x  return ∗this;  char∗ p =  shor t_max<sz  ? ptr : 0; copy_from x ; delete[] p; return ∗this;     deal with self-assignment  The String move assignment deletes its target’s free store  if there is any  and then moves:  String& String::operator= String&& x  {  if  this==&x  return ∗this;  if  short_max<sz  delete[] ptr; move_from x ;  return ∗this;     deal with self-assignment  x = move x  is insanity     delete target    does not throw  It is logically possible to move a source into itself  e.g., s=std::move s  , so again we have to protect against self-assignment  however unlikely .  The logically most complicated String operation is +=, which adds a character to the end of the  }  }  }     expand to long string    double the allocation  +2 because of the terminating 0      expand in free store    double the allocation  +2 because of the terminating 0   string, increasing its size by one:  String& String::operator+= char c  {  if  sz==short_max  { int n = sz+sz+2; ptr = expand ptr,n ; space = n−sz−2;  } else if  short_max<sz  {  if  space==0  {  int n = sz+sz+2; char∗ p = expand ptr,n ; delete[] ptr; ptr = p; space = n−sz−2;  } else  −−space;  }   568   Special Operators   Chapter 19  ptr[sz] = c; ptr[++sz] = 0;  return ∗this;     add c at end    increase sizeand set terminator  There is a lot going on here: operator+=   has to keep track of which representation  short or long  is used and whether there is extra space available to expand into. If more space is needed, expand   is called to allocate that space and move the old characters into the new space.  If there was an old allocation that needs deleting, it is returned, so that += can delete it. Once enough space is avail- able, it is trivial to put the new character c into it and to add the terminating 0.  Note the calculation of available memory for space. Of all the String implementation that took the longest to get right: its a messy little calculation prone to off-by-one errors. That repeated con- stant 2 feels awfully like a ‘‘magic constant.’’  All String members take care not to modify a new representation before they are certain that a new one can be put in place. In particular, they don’t delete until after any possible new operations have been done. In fact, the String members provide the strong exception guarantee  §13.2 .  If you don’t like the kind of ﬁddly code presented as part of the implementation of String, sim- ply use std::string. To a large extent, the standard-library facilities exist to save us from program- ming at this low lev el most of the time. Stronger: writing a string class, a vector class, or a map is an excellent exercise.  However, once the exercise is done, one outcome should be an appreciation of what the standard offers and a desire not to maintain your own version.  19.3.5  Helper Functions To complete class String, I provide a set of useful functions, stream I O, support for range-for loops, comparison, and concatenation. These all mirror the design choices used for std::string. In particu- lar,  > skips  initial  whitespace  before reading until it ﬁnds terminating whitespace  or the end of the stream :  ostream& operator<< ostream& os, const String& s  {  return os << s.c_str  ;     §36.3.3  istream& operator>> istream& is, String& s  {     clear the target string    skip whitespace  §38.4.5.1   s = "";  is>>ws;  char ch = ' '; while is.get ch  && !isspace ch    s += ch;  return is;  I provide == and != for comparison:  }  }  }   Section 19.3.5  Helper Functions  569  bool operator== const String& a, const String& b  {  if  a.size  !=b.siz e     return false;  for  int i = 0; i!=a.size  ; ++i   if  a[i]!=b[i]   return false;  return true;  bool operator!= const String& a, const String& b  {  return ! a==b ;  char∗ end String& x  {  return x.c_str  +x.size  ;  const char∗ begin const String& x  {  return x.c_str  ;  const char∗ end const String& x  {  return x.c_str  +x.size  ;  }  }  }  }  }  }  }  Adding <, etc., would be trivial.  To  support the range-for loop, we need begin   and end    §9.5.1 .  Again, we can provide those  as freestanding  nonmember  functions without direct access to the String implementation:  char∗ begin String& x  {  return x.c_str  ;     C-string-styleaccess  Given the member function += that adds a character at the end, concatenation operators are easily provided as nonmember functions:  String& operator+= String& a, const String& b  {     concatenation  for  auto x : b   a+=x;  return a;   }  }  }  570   Special Operators   Chapter 19  String operator+ const String& a, const String& b     concatenation {  String res {a}; res += b; return res;  I feel that I may have slightly ‘‘cheated’’ here. Should I have provided a member += that added a C- style string to the end? The standard-library string does, but without it, concatenation with a C-style string still works.  For example:  String s = "Njal "; s += "Gunnar";      concatenate: add to the end of s  This use of += is interpreted as operator+= s,String "Gunnar"  . My guess is that I could provide a more efﬁcient String::operator+= const char∗ , but I have no idea if the added performance would be worthwhile  in  real-world  code. In  such  cases,  I  try  to  be  conservative  and  deliver the  minimal design.  Being able to do something is not by itself a good reason for doing it.  Similarly, I do not try to optimize += by taking the size of a source string into account. Adding _s as a string literal sufﬁx meaning String is trivial: String operator"" _s const char∗ p, size_t  {  return String{p};  We can now write:  void f const char∗ ;  void f const String& ;     C-style string    our string  void g   {  f "Madden's" ;  f "Christopher's"_s ;      f const char*     f const String& ;  19.3.6  Using Our String The main program simply exercises the String operators a bit:  int main   {  String s  "abcdefghij" ; cout << s << '\n'; s += 'k'; s += 'l'; s += 'm'; s += 'n'; cout << s << '\n';   Section 19.3.6  Using Our String  571  String s2 = "Hell"; s2 += " and high water"; cout << s2 << '\n';  String s3 = "qwerty"; s3 = s3; String s4 ="the quick bro wn fox jumped over the lazy dog"; s4 = s4; cout << s3 << " " << s4 << "\n"; cout << s + ". " + s3 + String ". "  + "Horsefeathers\n";  String buf; while  cin>>buf && buf!="quit"   cout << buf << " " << buf.siz e   << " " << buf.capacity   << '\n';  }  };  This String lacks many features that you might consider important or even essential.  However, for what  it  does  it  closely  resembles std::string  Chapter  36   and  illustrates  techniques  used  for  the implementation of the standard-library string.  19.4  Friends An ordinary member function declaration speciﬁes three logically distinct things:  [1]  The function can access the private part of the class declaration. [2]  The function is in the scope of the class. [3]  The function must be invoked on an object  has a this pointer .  By declaring a member function static  §16.2.12 , we can give it the ﬁrst two properties only. By declaring a nonmember function a friend, we can give it the ﬁrst property only. That is, a function declared friend is granted access to the implementation of a class just like a member function but is otherwise independent of that class.  For example, we could deﬁne an operator that multiplies a Matrix by a Vector. Naturally, Vector and Matrix hide their respective representations and provide a complete set of operations for manip- ulating  objects  of  their  type. However,  our  multiplication  routine  cannot  be  a  member  of  both. Also, we don’t really want to provide low-level access functions to allow every user to both read and write the complete representation of both Matrix and Vector. To avoid this, we declare the oper- ator∗ a friend of both:  constexpr rc_max {4};     rowand column size  class Matrix;  class Vector {  ﬂoat v[rc_max];    ... friend Vector operator∗ const Matrix&, const Vector& ;   };  }  };  };  };  572   Special Operators   Chapter 19  Now operator∗   can  reach  into  the  implementation  of  both Vector and Matrix. That  would  allow sophisticated implementation techniques, but a simple implementation would be:  class Matrix {  Vector v[rc_max];    ... friend Vector operator∗ const Matrix&, const Vector& ;  Vector operator∗ const Matrix& m, const Vector& v  {  Vector r; for  int i = 0; i!=rc_max; i++  {     r[i] = m[i] * v;  r.v[i] = 0; for  int j = 0; j!=rc_max; j++   r.v[i] += m.v[i].v[j] ∗ v.v[j];  } return r;  A friend declaration can be placed in either the private or the public part of a class declaration; it does not matter where. Like a member function, a friend function is explicitly declared in the de- claration of the class of which it is a friend. It is therefore as much a part of that interface as is a member function.  A member function of one class can be the friend of another. For example:  class List_iterator {     ... int∗ next  ;  class List {  friend int∗ List_iterator::next  ;    ...  class List {  friend class List_iterator;    ...  There is a shorthand for making all functions of one class friends of another. For example:  This friend declaration makes all of List_iterator’s member functions friends of List.  Declaring a class a friend grants access to every function of that class. That implies that we can- not know the set of functions that can access the granting class’s representation just by looking at the class itself. In this, a friend class declaration differs from the declaration of a member function and  a  friend  function. Clearly, friend  classes  should  be  used  with  caution  and  only  to  express closely connected concepts.  It is possible to make a template argument a friend:   Section 19.4  Friends   573  template  class X {  friend T; friend class T;    ...  };     redundant ‘‘class’’  Often, there is a choice between making a class a member  a nested class  or a nonmember friend  §18.3.1 .  19.4.1  Finding Friends A friend must be previously declared in an enclosing scope or deﬁned in the non-class scope imme- diately enclosing the class that is declaring it to be a friend. Scopes outside the innermost enclosing namespace scope are not considered for a name ﬁrst declared as a friend  §iso.7.3.1.2 .  Consider a technical example:  class C1 { }; void f1  ;     will become friend of N::C    will become friend of N::C     will become friend of C    will become friend of C  namespace N {  class C2 { }; void f2   { }  class C {  int x;  public:  friend class C1; friend void f1  ;  friend class C3; friend void f3  ; friend class C4; friend void f4  ;  };  class C3 {}; void f3   { C x; x.x = 1; }    OK: friend of C     friendof C  }    namespace N     OK  previously deﬁned      OK  deﬁned in enclosing namespace      First declared in N and assumed to be in N  class C4 { }; void f4   { N::C x; x.x = 1; }     not friend of N::C    error :xisprivate and f4   is not a friend of N::C  A friend function can be found through its arguments  §14.2.4  even if it was not declared in the immediately enclosing scope. For example:  void f Matrix& m  {  }  inver t m ;     Matrix’sfriend invert     574   Special Operators   Chapter 19  Thus, a friend function should be explicitly declared in an enclosing scope or take an argument of its class or a class derived from that. If not, the friend cannot be called. For example:     no f   in this scope  class X {  friend void f  ; friend void h const X& ;     useless    can be found through its argument  void g const X& x  {  f  ;  h x ;      no f   in scope    X’sfriend h    19.4.2  Friends and Members When should we use a friend function, and when is a member function the better choice for speci- fying an operation? First, we try to minimize the number of functions that access the representa- tion of a class and try to make the set of access functions as appropriate as possible. Therefore, the ﬁrst  question  is  not  ‘‘Should  it  be  a  member, a static member, or a friend?’’ but  rather  ‘‘Does  it really need access?’’ Typically, the set of functions that need access is smaller than we are willing to believe at ﬁrst.  Some operations must be members – for example, constructors, destructors, and virtual  functions   §3.2.3,  §17.2.5   –  but  typically  there  is  a  choice. Because  member  names  are local to the class, a function that requires direct access to the representation should be a member unless there is a speciﬁc reason for it to be a nonmember.  Consider a class X supplying alternative ways of presenting an operation:  class X {    ... X int ;  int m1  ; int m2   const;     member  friend int f1 X& ; friend int f2 const X& ; friend int f3 X ;     friend,not member  void g   {  99.m1  ;  99.m2  ;      error :X 99 .m1   not tried    error :X 99 .m2   not tried  Member functions can be invoked for objects of their class only; no user-deﬁned conversions are applied to the leftmost operand of a . or −>  but see §19.2.3 . For example:  };  }  };  }   Section 19.4.2  Friends and Members  575  The global function f1   has a similar property because implicit conversions are not used for non- const reference arguments  §7.7 . However,  conversions may be applied to the arguments of f2   and f3  :  void h   {  }  f1 99 ;  f2 99 ;  f3 99 ;      error :f1 X 99   not tried: non-const X& argument    OK: f2 X 99  ; const X& argument    OK: f3 X 99  ; X argument  An operation modifying the state of a class object should therefore be a member or a function tak- ing a non-const reference argument  or a non-const pointer argument .  Operators that modify an operand  e.g., =, ∗=, and ++  are most naturally deﬁned as members for user-deﬁned types. Conversely, if implicit type conversion is desired for all operands of an opera- tion,  the  function  implementing  it  must  be  a  nonmember  function  taking  a const reference  argu- ment or a non-reference argument.  This is often the case for the functions implementing operators that do not require lvalue operands when applied to fundamental types  e.g., +, −, and  .  However, such operators often need access to the representations of their operand class. Consequently, binary operators are the most common source of friend functions.  Unless  type  conversions  are  deﬁned,  there  appears  to  be  no  compelling  reason  to  choose  a member over a friend taking a reference argument, or vice versa.  In some cases, the programmer may have a preference for one call syntax over another. For example, most people seem to prefer the notation m2=inv m  for producing a inverted Matrix from m to the alternative m2=m.inv  . On the other hand, if inv   inverts m itself, rather than producing a new Matrix that is the inverse of m, it should be a member.  All other things considered equal, implement operations that need direct access to a representa-  tion as member functions:  It is not possible to know if someone someday will deﬁne a conversion operator.   cid:129   cid:129  The member function call syntax makes it clear to the user that the object may be modiﬁed;  a reference argument is far less obvious.   cid:129  Expressions in the body of a member can be noticeably shorter than the equivalent expres- sions in a global function; a nonmember function must use an explicit argument, whereas the member can use this implicitly.   cid:129  Member names are local to a class, so they tend to be shorter than the names of nonmember   cid:129   functions. If we hav e deﬁned a member f   and we later feel the need for a nonmember f x , we can simply deﬁne it to mean x.f  .  Conversely, operations that do not need direct access to a representation are often best represented as  nonmember  functions,  possibly  in  a  namespace  that  makes  their  relationship  with  the  class explicit  §18.3.6 .   576   Special Operators   Chapter 19  19.5  Advice [1]  Use operator[]   for subscripting and for selection based on a single value; §19.2.1.

In addition, it borrowed the design idea that classes should be used to model concepts in the programmer’s and the application’s world.  C++ provides language constructs that directly support these design notions. Conversely, using the language features in support of design ideas distinguishes effective  use of C++. Using language  constructs  as  just  notational  props  for  traditional  types  of  programming  is  to  miss  key strengths of C++.  A concept  idea, notion, etc.  does not exist in isolation. It coexists with related concepts and derives much of its power from relationships with other concepts. For example, try to explain what a car is. Soon you’ll have introduced the notions of wheels, engines, drivers, pedestrians, trucks, ambulances, roads, oil, speeding tickets, motels, etc. Since we use classes to represent concepts,   578  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  the issue becomes how to represent relationships among concepts. However, we can’t express arbi- trary relationships directly in a programming language. Even if we could, we wouldn’t want to. To be useful, our classes should be more narrowly deﬁned than our everyday concepts – and more pre- cise.  The notion of a derived class and its associated language mechanisms are provided to express hierarchical relationships, that is, to express commonality between classes. For example, the con- cepts of a circle and a triangle are related in that they are both shapes; that is, they hav e the concept of a shape in common. Thus, we explicitly deﬁne class Circle and class Triangle to have class Shape in common. In that case, the common class, here Shape, is referred to as the base class or super- class and  classes  derived from  that,  here Circle and Triangle , are  referred  to  as derived classes  or subclasses. Representing  a  circle  and  a  triangle  in  a  program  without  involving  the  notion  of  a shape would be to miss something essential. This chapter is an exploration of the implications of this simple idea, which is the basis for what is commonly called object-oriented programming. The language features support building new classes from existing ones:   cid:129    cid:129   Implementation inheritance: to sav e implementation effort by sharing facilities provided by a base class Interface inheritance: to allow different derived classes to be used interchangeably through the interface provided by a common base class  Interface inheritance is often referred to as run-time polymorphism  or dynamic polymorphism .  In contrast, the uniform use of classes not related by inheritance provided by templates  §3.4, Chapter 23  is often referred to as compile-time polymorphism  or static polymorphism .  The discussion of class hierarchies is organized into three chapters:  cid:129  Derived Classes  Chapter 20 : This chapter introduces the basic language features support- ing  object-oriented  programming. Base  and  derived classes,  virtual  functions,  and  access control are covered.   cid:129  Class Hierarchies  Chapter 21 : This chapter focuses on the use of base and derived classes to effectively organize code around the notion of class hierarchies. Most of this chapter is devoted to discussion of programming techniques, but technical aspects of multiple inheri- tance  classes with more than one base class  are also covered.   cid:129  Run-time Type Identiﬁcation  Chapter 22 : This chapter describes the techniques for explic- itly navigating class hierarchies. In particular, the type conversion operations dynamic_cast and static_cast are presented, as is the operation for determining the type of an object given one of its base classes  typeid .  A brief introduction to the basic idea of hierarchical organization of types can be found in Chapter 3: base and derived classes  §3.2.2  and virtual functions  §3.2.3 . These chapters examine these fundamental features and their associated programming and design techniques in greater detail.  20.2  Derived Classes Consider building a program dealing with people employed by a ﬁrm. Such a program might have a data structure like this:   Section 20.2  Derived Classes   579  };  };  };  struct Employee {  string ﬁrst_name , family_name; char middle_initial; Date hiring_date; short depar tment;    ...  Next, we might try to deﬁne a manager:  struct Manager {  Employee emp;  list  group;     people managed short level;    ...     manager’semployeerecord  A manager  is  also  an  employee;  the Employee data  is  stored  in  the emp member  of  a Manager object.  This may be obvious to a human reader – especially a careful reader – but there is nothing that  tells  the  compiler  and  other  tools  that Manager is  also  an Employee. A Manager∗ is  not  an Employee∗, so one cannot simply use one where the other is required. In particular, one cannot put a Manager onto a list of Employees without writing special code. We  could either use explicit type conversion on a Manager∗ or put the address of the emp member onto a list of employees.  However, both solutions are inelegant and can be quite obscure. The correct approach is to explicitly state that a Manager is an Employee, with a few pieces of information added:  struct Manager : public Employee {  list  group; short level;    ...  The Manager is derived from Employee, and conversely, Employee is a base class for Manager. The class Manager has the members of class Employee  ﬁrst_name, department, etc.   in addition to its own members  group, level, etc. .  Derivation is often represented graphically by a pointer from the derived class to its base class  indicating that the derived class refers to its base  rather than the other way around :  Employee  Manager  A derived class  is  often  said  to  inherit  properties  from  its  base,  so  the  relationship  is  also  called inheritance. A base class is sometimes called a superclass and a derived class a subclass. This ter- minology, howev er, is confusing to people who observe that the data in a derived class object is a superset  of  the  data  of  an  object  of  its  base  class. A derived class  is  typically  larger   and  never smaller  than its base class in the sense that it holds more data and provides more functions.   580  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  A popular  and  efﬁcient  implementation  of  the  notion  of  derived classes  has  an  object  of  the derived class represented as an object of the base class, with the information belonging speciﬁcally to the derived class added at the end. For example:  Employee:  Manager:  ﬁrst_name family_name  ...  ﬁrst_name family_name  ...  group level ...  No memory overhead is implied by deriving a class. The space required is just the space required by the members.  Deriving Manager from Employee in this way makes Manager a subtype of Employee, so that a Manager can be used wherever an Employee is acceptable. For example, we can now create a list of Employees, some of whom are Managers:  void f Manager m1, Employee e1  {  list  elist {&m1,&e1 ;    ...  }  }  A Manager is   also   an Employee, so a Manager∗ can  be  used  as  an Employee∗. Similarly, a Man- ager& can  be  used  as  an Employee&. Howev er,  an Employee is  not  necessarily  a Manager, so an Employee∗ cannot  be  used  as  a Manager∗. In general,  if  a  class Derived has  a  public  base  class  §20.5  Base, then a Derived∗ can be assigned to a variable of type Base∗ without the use of explicit type conversion.  The opposite conversion, from Base∗ to Derived∗, must be explicit.  For example:  void g Manager mm, Employee ee  {  Employee∗ pe = &mm; Manager∗ pm = &ee;     OK: every Manager is an Employee    error :not every EmployeeisaManager  pm−>level = 2;     disaster :ee doesn’t have a lev el  pm = static_cast  pe ;      bruteforce: wor ksbecause pe points    to the Manager mm  pm−>level = 2;     ﬁne: pm points to the Manager mm that has a level  In other words, an object of a derived class can be treated as an object of its base class when manip- ulated  through  pointers  and  references. The  opposite  is  not  true. The  use  of static_cast and dynamic_cast is discussed in §22.2.   Section 20.2  Derived Classes   581  Using  a  class  as  a  base  is  equivalent  to  deﬁning  an   unnamed   object  of  that  class. Conse-  quently, a class must be deﬁned in order to be used as a base  §8.2.2 :  class Employee;      declaration only,nodeﬁnition  class Manager : public Employee {     error :Employeenot deﬁned     ...  };  20.2.1  Member Functions Simple data structures, such as Employee and Manager, are really not that interesting and often not particularly useful. We need to provide a proper type with a suitable set of operations, and we need to do so without being tied to the details of a particular representation. For example:  void print   const; string full_name   const { return ﬁrst_name + ' ' + middle_initial + ' ' + family_name; }    ...  class Employee { public:  private:  string ﬁrst_name , family_name; char middle_initial;    ...  class Manager : public Employee { public:  void print   const;    ...  A member of a derived class can use the public – and protected  see §20.5  – members of a base class as if they were declared in the derived class itself. For example:  void Manager::print   const {  cout << "name is " << full_name   << '\n';    ...  However, a derived class cannot access private members of a base class:  void Manager::print   const {  cout << " name is " << family_name << '\n';    ...     error!  This second version of Manager::print   will not compile because family_name is not accessible to Manager::print  .  };  };  }  }   582  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  This  comes  as  a  surprise  to  some,  but  consider  the  alternative: that  a  member  function  of  a derived class could access the private members of its base class. The concept of a private member would be rendered meaningless by allowing a programmer to gain access to the private part of a class simply by deriving a new class from it. Furthermore, one could no longer ﬁnd all uses of a private name by looking at the functions declared as members and friends of that class. One would have to examine every source ﬁle of the complete program for derived classes, then examine every function  of  those  classes,  then  ﬁnd  every  class  derived from  those  classes,  etc. This  is,  at  best, tedious and often impractical. Where it is acceptable, protected – rather than private – members can be used  §20.5 .  Typically, the  cleanest  solution  is  for  the  derived class  to  use  only  the  public  members  of  its  base class. For example:  void Manager::print   const {  Employee::print  ;  cout << level;     ...     printEmployeeinfor mation    printManager-speciﬁc infor mation  }  }  void Manager::print   const {  print  ;     printManager-speciﬁc infor mation     oops!  Note that :: must be used because print   has been redeﬁned in Manager. Such reuse of names is typ- ical.  The unwary might write this:  The result is a sequence of recursive calls ending with some form of program crash.  20.2.2  Constructors and Destructors As usual, constructors and destructors are as essential:   cid:129  Objects  are  constructed  from  the  bottom  up   base  before  member  and  member  before derived   and  destroyed  top-down   derived before  member  and  member  before  base ; §17.2.3.   cid:129  Each  class  can  initialize  its  members  and  bases   but  not  directly  members  or  bases  of  its   cid:129  Typically, destructors in a hierarchy need to be virtual; §17.2.5.  cid:129  Copy constructors of classes in a hierarchy should be used with care  if at all  to avoid slic-  bases ; §17.4.1.  ing; §17.5.1.4.   cid:129  The resolution of a virtual function call, a dynamic_cast, or a typeid   in a constructor or de- structor reﬂects the stage of construction and destruction  rather than the type of the yet-to- be-completed object ; §22.4.  In computer science ‘‘up’’ and ‘‘down’’ can get very confused. In source text, deﬁnitions of base classes must occur before the deﬁnitions of their derived classes.  This implies that for small exam- ples, the bases appear above the derived classes on a screen. Furthermore, we tend to draw trees with the root on top. However, when I talk about constructing objects from the bottom up, I mean   Section 20.2.2  Constructors and Destructors  583  starting  with  the  most  fundamental   e.g.,  base  classes   and  building  what  depends  on  that   e.g., derived classes  later. We build from the roots  base classes  toward the leaves  derived classes .  Such a set of related classes is traditionally called a class hierarchy. Such a hierarchy is most often a tree, but it can also be a more general graph structure. For example:  20.3  Class Hierarchies A derived class can itself be a base class. For example:  class Employee {  * ...*  }; class Manager : public Employee {  * ...*  }; class Director : public Manager {  * ...*  };  class Temporar y {  * ...*  }; class Assistant : public Employee {  * ...*  }; class Temp : public Temporar y, public Assistant {  * ...*  }; class Consultant : public Temporar y, public Manager {  * ...*  };  or graphically:  Temporar y  Employee  Assistant  Manager  Temp  Consultant  Director  Thus, as is explained in detail in §21.3, C++ can express a directed acyclic graph of classes.  20.3.1  Type Fields To  use derived classes as more than a convenient shorthand in declarations, we must solve the fol- lowing problem: Given a pointer of type Base∗, to which derived type does the object pointed to really belong? There are four fundamental solutions:  [1]  Ensure that only objects of a single type are pointed to  §3.4, Chapter 23 . [2]  Place a type ﬁeld in the base class for the functions to inspect. [3]  Use dynamic_cast  §22.2, §22.6 . [4]  Use virtual functions  §3.2.3, §20.3.2 .  Unless  you  have  used ﬁnal  §20.3.4.2 ,  solution  1  relies  on  more  knowledge  about  the  types involved than is available to the compiler. In general, it is not a good idea to try to be smarter than the type system, but  especially in combination with the use of templates  it can be used to imple- ment homogeneous containers  e.g., the standard-library vector and map  with unsurpassed perfor- mance.  Solutions [2], [3], and [4] can be used to build heterogeneous lists, that is, lists of  pointers to  objects of several different types. Solution [3] is a language-supported variant of solution [2].   584  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  Solution [4] is a special type-safe variation of solution [2]. Combinations of solutions [1] and [4] are particularly interesting and powerful; in almost all situations, they yield cleaner code than do solutions [2] and [3].  Let us ﬁrst examine the simple type-ﬁeld solution to see why it is typically best avoided.  The  manager employee example could be redeﬁned like this:  struct Employee {  enum Empl_type { man, empl }; Empl_type type;  Employee   : type{empl} { }  string ﬁrst_name , family_name; char middle_initial;  Date hiring_date; short depar tment;    ...  struct Manager : public Employee {  Manager   { type = man; }  list  group;     people managed short level;    ...  };  };  } }  }  Given this, we can now write a function that prints information about each Employee:  void print_employee const Employee∗ e  {  switch  e−>type  { case Employee::empl:  cout  family_name  department << '\n';    ... break;  case Employee::man: {  cout  family_name  department << '\n';    ... const Manager∗ p = static_cast  e ; cout  level << '\n';    ... break;  and use it to print a list of Employees, like this:   Section 20.3.1  Type Fields  585  void print_list const list & elist  {  for  auto x : elist   print_employee x ;  }  This works ﬁne, especially in a small program maintained by a single person. However,  it has a fundamental weakness in that it depends on the programmer manipulating types in a way that can- not  be  checked  by  the  compiler. This  problem  is  usually  made  worse  because  functions  such  as print_employee   are often organized to take advantage of the commonality of the classes involved:  void print_employee const Employee∗ e  {  cout  family_name  department << '\n';    ... if  e−>type == Employee::man  {  const Manager∗ p = static_cast  e ; cout  level << '\n';    ...  }  }  Finding all such tests on the type ﬁeld buried in a large function that handles many derived classes can be difﬁcult.  Even when they hav e been found, understanding what is going on can be difﬁcult. Furthermore, any addition of a new kind of Employee involves a change to all the key functions in a system – the ones containing the tests on the type ﬁeld. The programmer must consider every func- tion that could conceivably need a test on the type ﬁeld after a change. This implies the need to access critical source code and the resulting necessary overhead of testing the affected code. The use of an explicit type conversion is a strong hint that improvement is possible.  In other words, use of a type ﬁeld is an error-prone technique that leads to maintenance prob- lems.  The problems increase in severity as the size of the program increases because the use of a type ﬁeld causes a violation of the ideals of modularity and data hiding. Each function using a type ﬁeld  must  know about  the  representation  and  other  details  of  the  implementation  of  every  class derived from the one containing the type ﬁeld.  It also seems that any common data accessible from every derived class, such as a type ﬁeld, tempts people to add more such data. The common base thus becomes the repository of all kinds of  ‘‘useful  information.’’  This,  in  turn,  gets  the  implementation  of  the  base  and  derived classes intertwined in ways that are most undesirable. In a large class hierarchy,  accessible  not private  data in a common base class becomes the ‘‘global variables’’ of the hierarchy.  For clean design and simpler maintenance, we want to keep separate issues separate and avoid mutual dependencies.  20.3.2  Virtual Functions Virtual functions overcome the problems with the type-ﬁeld solution by allowing the programmer to declare functions in a base class that can be redeﬁned in each derived class.  The compiler and linker will guarantee the correct correspondence between objects and the functions applied to them. For example:   586  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  class Employee { public:  Employee const string& name, int dept ; virtual void print   const;    ...  private:  string ﬁrst_name , family_name; short depar tment;    ...  The keyword virtual indicates that print   can act as an interface to the print   function deﬁned in this class  and print   functions  deﬁned  in  classes  derived from  it. Where  such print   functions  are deﬁned in derived classes, the compiler ensures that the right print   for the given Employee object is invoked in each case.  To  allow a virtual  function  declaration  to  act  as  an  interface  to  functions  deﬁned  in  derived classes, the argument types speciﬁed for a function in a derived class cannot differ from the argu- ment  types  declared  in  the  base,  and  only  very  slight  changes  are  allowed  for  the  return  type  §20.3.6 .  A virtual member function is sometimes called a method.  A virtual function must be deﬁned for the class in which it is ﬁrst declared  unless it is declared  to be a pure virtual function; see §20.4 . For example:  void Employee::print   const {  cout << family_name << '\t' << department << '\n';    ...  A virtual function can be used even if no class is derived from its class, and a derived class that does not need its own version of a virtual function need not provide one. When deriving a class, simply provide an appropriate function if it is needed. For example:  class Manager : public Employee { public:  Manager const string& name, int dept, int lvl ; void print   const;    ...  private:  list  group; short level;    ...  void Manager::print   const {  Employee::print  ; cout << "\tlevel " << level << '\n';    ...  };  }  };  }   Section 20.3.2  Virtual Functions  587  A function from a derived class with the same name and the same set of argument types as a virtual function in a base is said to override the base class version of the virtual function. Furthermore, it is possible to override a virtual function from a base with a more derived return type  §20.3.6 .  Except  where  we  explicitly  say  which  version  of  a  virtual  function  is  called   as  in  the  call Employee::print   , the overriding function is chosen as the most appropriate for the object for which it is called. Independently of which base class  interface  is used to access an object, we always get the same function when we use the virtual function call mechanism.  The global function print_employee    §20.3.1  is now unnecessary because the print   member  functions have taken its place. A list of Employees can be printed like this:  Each Employee will be written out according to its type. For example:  void print_list const list & s  {  for  auto x : s   x−>print  ;  int main   {  }  }  produced:  Smith 1234 level 2 Brown 1234  Employee e {"Brown",1234}; Manager m {"Smith",1234,2};  print_list {&e,&m} ;  Note  that  this  will  work  even if print_list   was written  and  compiled  before  the  speciﬁc  derived class Manager was even conceived of!  This is  a  key  aspect  of  classes. When  used  properly, it becomes the cornerstone of object-oriented designs and provides a degree of stability to an evolv- ing program.  Getting ‘‘the right’’ behavior from Employee’s  functions independently of exactly what kind of Employee is actually used is called polymorphism. A type with virtual functions is called a poly- morphic type or  more precisely  a run-time polymorphic type. To get runtime polymorphic behav- ior in C++, the member functions called must be virtual and objects must be manipulated through pointers or references. When manipulating an object directly  rather than through a pointer or ref- erence , its exact type is known by the compiler so that run-time polymorphism is not needed.  By default, a function that overrides a virtual function itself becomes virtual. We can, but do not have  to, repeat virtual in a derived class.  I don’t recommend repeating virtual. If you want to be explicit, use override  §20.3.4.1 .  Clearly, to implement polymorphism, the compiler must store some kind of type information in each object of class Employee and use it to call the right version of the virtual function print  . In a typical implementation, the space taken is just enough to hold a pointer  §3.2.3 : the usual imple- mentation technique is for the compiler to convert the name of a virtual function into an index into   588  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  a table of pointers to functions. That table is usually called the virtual function table or simply the vtbl. Each class with virtual functions has its own vtbl identifying its virtual functions. This can be represented graphically like this:  Employee:  ﬁrst_name  second_name  ...  Manager:  ﬁrst_name  second_name  ...  group level  ...  vtbl:  vtbl:  ...  ...  Employee::print    Manager::print    The functions in the vtbl allow the object to be used correctly even when the size of the object and the layout of its data are unknown to the caller. The implementation of a caller need only know the location of the vtbl in an Employee and the index used for each virtual function. This virtual call mechanism  can  be  made  almost  as  efﬁcient  as  the  ‘‘normal  function  call’’ mechanism   within 25% , so efﬁciency concerns should not deter anyone from using a virtual function where an ordi- nary function call would be acceptably efﬁcient.  Its space overhead is one pointer in each object of a class  with  virtual  functions  plus  one vtbl for  each  such  class. You pay  this  overhead  only  for objects  of  a  class  with  a  virtual  function. You choose  to  pay  this  overhead  only  if  you  need  the added functionality virtual functions provide.  Had you chosen to use the alternative type-ﬁeld solu- tion, a comparable amount of space would have been needed for the type ﬁeld.  A virtual function invoked from a constructor or a destructor reﬂects that the object is partially constructed or partially destroyed  §22.4 . It is therefore typically a bad idea to call a virtual func- tion from a constructor or a destructor.  20.3.3  Explicit Qualiﬁcation Calling a function using the scope resolution operator, ::, as is done in Manager::print   ensures that the virtual mechanism is not used:  void Manager::print   const {  Employee::print  ;  cout << "\tlevel " << level << '\n';    ...     not a virtual call  }   Section 20.3.3  Explicit Qualiﬁcation  589  Otherwise, Manager::print   would  suffer  an  inﬁnite  recursion. The  use  of  a  qualiﬁed  name  has another desirable effect.  That is, if a virtual function is also inline  as is not uncommon , then inline substitution can be used for calls speciﬁed using ::. This provides the programmer with an efﬁcient way to handle some important special cases in which one virtual function calls another for the same object.  The Manager::print   function is an example of this. Because the type of the object is deter- mined in the call of Manager::print  , it need not be dynamically determined again for the resulting call of Employee::print  .  20.3.4  Override Control If you declare a function in a derived class that has exactly the same name and type as a virtual function in a base class, then the function in the derived class overrides the one in the base class. That’s a simple and effective rule.  However, for larger class hierarchies it can be difﬁcult to be sure that you actually override the function you meant to override.  Consider:  struct B0 {  void f int  const; virtual void g double ;  };  };  struct B1 : B0 {  * ...*  }; struct B2 : B1 {  * ...*  }; struct B3 : B2 {  * ...*  }; struct B4 : B3 {  * ...*  }; struct B5 : B4 {  * ...*  };  struct D : B5 {  void f int  const; void g int ; virtual int h  ;     overr idef   in base class    overr ideg   in base class    overr ideh   in base class  This  illustrates  three  errors  that  are  far  from  obvious  when  they appear  in  a  real  class  hierarchy where the classes B0...B5 have many members each and are scattered over many header ﬁles. Here:   cid:129  B0::f   is not virtual, so you can’t override it, only hide it  §20.3.5 .  cid:129  D::g   doesn’t hav e the same argument type as B0::g  , so if it overrides anything it’s not the  virtual function B0::g  . Most likely, D::g   just hides B0::g  .   cid:129  There is no function called h   in B0, if D::h   overrides anything, it is not a function from B0.  Most likely, it is introducing a brand-new virtual function.  I didn’t show you  what  was  in B1...B5, so maybe  something  completely  different  is  going  on because of declarations in those classes. I personally don’t  redundantly  use virtual for a function that’s meant to override.  For smaller programs  especially with a compiler with decent warnings against common mistakes  getting overriding done correctly isn’t hard.  However, for larger hierar- chies more speciﬁc controls are useful:   cid:129   cid:129   virtual: The function may be overridden  §20.3.2 . =0: The function must be virtual and must be overridden  §20.4 .   590  Derived Classes   Chapter 20   cid:129   cid:129   override: The function is meant to override a virtual function in a base class  §20.3.4.1 . ﬁnal: The function is not meant to be overridden  §20.3.4.2 .  In the absence of any of these controls, a non-static member function is virtual if and only if it over- rides a virtual function in a base class  §20.3.2 .  A compiler can warn against inconsistent use of explicit override controls. For example, a class declaration that uses override for seven out of nine virtual base class functions could be confusing to maintainers.  20.3.4.1 override  struct D : B5 {  We can be explicit about our desire to override:  void f int  const override;  void g int  override;  virtual int h   override;      error :B0::f   is not virtual    error :B0::f   takes a double argument    error :no function h   to overr ide  Given this deﬁnition  and assuming that the intermediate base classes B1...B5 do not provide rele- vant functions , all three declarations give errors.  In  a  large  or  complicated  class  hierarchy with  many virtual  functions,  it  is  best  to  use virtual only to introduce a new virtual function and to use override on all functions intended as overriders. Using override is a bit verbose but clariﬁes the programmer’s intent.  The override speciﬁer comes last in a declaration, after all other parts. For example:  void f int  const noexcept override;    OK  if there is a suitable f   to overr ide  override void f int  const noexcept;    syntax error void f int  override const noexcept;    syntax error  And yes, it’s illogical that virtual is a preﬁx and override is a sufﬁx.  This is part of the price we pay for compatibility and stability over decades.  An override speciﬁer is not part of the type of a function and cannot be repeated in an out-of-  class deﬁnition. For example:  class Derived : public Base {  void f   override;  void g   override;      OK if Base has a virtual f      OK if Base has a virtual g    void Derived::f   override  {     ...     error :overr ideout of class  void g   {     ...     OK  };  };  }  }  Curiously, override is not a keyword; it is what is called a contextual keyword. That is, override has   Section 20.3.4.1  override  591  a special meaning in a few contexts but can be used as an identiﬁer elsewhere.  For example:  int override = 7;  struct Dx : Base { int override;  int f   override {  }  };  return override + ::override;  Don’t indulge in such cleverness; it complicates maintenance. The only reason that override is a contextual  keyword,  rather  than  an  ordinary  keyword,  is  that  there  exists  a  signiﬁcant  amount  of code that has used override as an ordinary identiﬁer for decades. The other contextual keyword is ﬁnal  §20.3.4.2 .  20.3.4.2 ﬁnal  When we declare a member function, we have a choice between virtual and not virtual  the default . We  use virtual for functions we want writers of derived classes to be able to deﬁne or redeﬁne. We base our choice on the meaning  semantics  of our class:   cid:129  Can we imagine the need for further derived classes?  cid:129  Does a designer of a derived class need to redeﬁne the function to achieve a plausible aim?  cid:129   Is overriding a function error-prone  i.e., is it hard for an overriding function to provide the expected semantics of a virtual function ?  If the answer is ‘‘no’’ to all three questions, we can leave the function non-virtual to gain simplicity of design and occasionally some performance  mostly from inlining . The standard library is full of examples of this.  Far more rarely, we hav e a class hierarchy that starts out with virtual functions, but after the def- inition of a set of derived classes, one of the answers becomes ‘‘no.’’  For example, we can imagine an abstract syntax tree for a language where all language constructs have been deﬁned as concrete node classes derived from a few interfaces.  We only need to derive a new class if we change the language.  In that  case,  we  might  want  to  prevent  our  users  from  overriding  virtual  functions because the only thing such overrides could do would be to change the semantics of our language. That is, we might want to close our design to modiﬁcation from its users. For example:  struct Node {     interface class  virtual Type type   = 0;    ...  class If_statement : public Node { public:  Type type   override ﬁnal;    ...  };  };     prevent further overr iding   592  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  In a realistic class hierarchy, there would be several intermediate classes between the general inter- face   here, Node  and  the  derived class  representing  a  speciﬁc  language  construct   here, If_state- ment .  However,  the  key  point  about  this  example  is  that Node::type   is  meant  to  be  overridden  that’s why it’s declared virtual  and its overrider If_statement::type   is not  that’s why it’s declared ﬁnal .  After using ﬁnal for a member function, it can no longer be overridden and an attempt to do so is an error. For example:  class Modiﬁed_if_statement : public If_statement { public:  Type type   override;     ...     error :If_statement::type   is ﬁnal  We  can make every virtual member function of a class ﬁnal; just add ﬁnal after the class name. For example:  class For_statement ﬁnal : public Node { public:  Type type   override;    ...  class Modiﬁed_for_statement : public For_statement {     error :For_statement is ﬁnal  Type type   override;    ...  For good  and  bad,  adding ﬁnal to  the  class  not  only  prevents  overriding,  it  also  prevents  further derivation from a class. There are people who use ﬁnal to try to gain performance – after all, a non- virtual function is faster than a virtual one  by maybe 25% on a modern implementation  and offers greater  opportunities  for  inlining   §12.1.5 . However,  do not  blindly  use ﬁnal as  an  optimization aid; it affects the class hierarchy design  often negatively , and the performance improvements are rarely signiﬁcant. Do some serious measurements before claiming efﬁciency improvements.  Use ﬁnal where it clearly reﬂects a class hierarchy design that you consider proper. That is, use ﬁnal to reﬂect a semantic need.  A ﬁnal speciﬁer is not part of the type of a function and cannot be repeated in an out-of-class  deﬁnition.  For example:  class Derived : public Base {  void f   ﬁnal; void g   ﬁnal;    ...     OK if Base has a virtual f      OK if Base has a virtual g    void Derived::f   ﬁnal {     ...     error :ﬁnal out of class  };  };  };  };  }   ﬁnal  593  Like override  §20.3.4.1 , ﬁnal is a contextual keyword.  That is, ﬁnal has a special meaning in a few contexts but can be used as an ordinary identiﬁer elsewhere.  For example:  Section 20.3.4.2  void g   ﬁnal {     ...  }     OK  int ﬁnal = 7;  struct Dx : Base {  int ﬁnal;  int f   ﬁnal {  }  };  return ﬁnal + ::ﬁnal;  Don’t indulge in such cleverness; it complicates maintenance. The only reason that ﬁnal is a con- textual keyword, rather than an ordinary keyword, is that there exist a signiﬁcant amount of code that has used ﬁnal as an ordinary identiﬁer for decades. The other contextual keyword is override  §20.3.4.1 .  20.3.5 using Base Members Functions do not overload across scopes  §12.3.3 . For example:  struct Base {  void f int ;  struct Derived : Base {  void f double ;  void use Derived d  {  d.f 1 ;  Base& br = d br.f 1 ;      call Derived::f double      call Base::f int   };  };  }  };  This  can  surprise  people,  and  sometimes  we  want  overloading  to  ensure  that  the  best  matching member function is used. As for namespaces, using-declarations can be used to add a function to a scope.  For example:  struct D2 : Base {  using Base::f; void f double ;     bringall fs from Base into D2   594  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  void use2 D2 d  {  d.f 1 ;  Base& br = d br.f 1 ;      call D2::f int , that is,Base::f int      call Base::f int   This is a simple consequence of a class also being considered a namespace  §16.2 .  Several using-declarations can bring in names from multiple base classes. For example:  struct B1 {  void f int ;  struct B2 {  void f double ;  struct D : B1, B2 { using B1::f; using B2::f; void f char ;  void use D d  {  }  };  };  };  }  };  d.f 1 ;  d.f 'a' ;  d.f 1.0 ;      call D::f int , that is,B1::f int     call D::f char     call D::f double , that is,B2::f double   We can bring constructors into a derived class scope; see §20.3.5.1. A name brought into a derived class scope by a using-declaration has its access determined by the placement of the using-declara- tion;  see  §20.5.3. We  cannot  use using-directives to bring  all  members  of  a  base  class  into  a derived class.  20.3.5.1  Inheriting Constructors  Say I want a vector that’s just like std::vector, but with guaranteed range checking. I can try this:  template  struct Vector : std::vector  {  T& operator[] size_type i  { check i ; return this−>elem i ; } const T& operator[] size_type i  const { check i ; return this−>elem i ; }  void check siz e_type i  { if  this−>size  <i  throw rang e_error{"Vector::check   failed"}; }   Section 20.3.5.1  Inheriting Constructors  595  Unfortunately, we would soon ﬁnd out that this deﬁnition is rather incomplete. For example:  Vector  v { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 };     error :no initializer-list constructor  A quick check will show that Vector failed to inherit any constructors from std::vector.  That’s not  an  unreasonable  rule:  if  a  class  adds  data  members  to  a  base  or  requires  a  stricter class invariant, it would be a disaster to inherit constructors. However, Vector did not do anything like that.  We solve the problem by simply saying that the constructors should be inherited:  template  struct Vector : std::vector  { using vector ::vector;     inheritconstr uctors  T& operator=[] size_type i  { check i ; return this−>elem i ; } const T& operator= size_type i  const { check i ; return this−>elem i ; }  void check siz e_type i  { if  this−>size  <i  throw Bad_index i ; }  Vector  v { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 };     OK: use initializer-list constructor from std::vector  This use of using is exactly equivalent to its use for ordinary functions  §14.4.5, §20.3.5 .  If you so choose, you can shoot yourself in the foot by inheriting constructors in a derived class  in which you deﬁne new member variables needing explicit initialization:  using B1::B1; string s; int x;     implicitly declares D1 int     stringhas a default constructor    we ‘‘forgot’’toprovide for initialization of x  D1 d {6}; D1 e;     oops: d.x is not initialized    error :D1 has no default constructor  The reason that D1::s is initialized and D1::x is not is that the inheriting constructor is equivalent to a constructor that simply initializes the base. In this case, we might equivalently have written:  struct D1 : B1 {  D1 int i  : B1 i  { } string s; int x;     stringhas a default constructor    we ‘‘forgot’’toprovide for initialization of x  One way to remove the bullet from your foot is by adding an in-class member initializer  §17.4.4 :  struct B1 {  B1 int  { }  struct D1 : B1 {  void test   {  };  };  };  }  };   596  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  struct D1 : B1 {  using B1::B1; int x {0};     implicitly declares D1 int     note: x is initialized  void test   {  };  }  D1 d {6};     d.x is zero  Most often it is best to avoid being clever and restrict the use of inheriting constructors to the sim- ple cases where no data members are added.  20.3.6  Return Type Relaxation There is a relaxation of the rule that the type of an overriding function must be the same as the type of the virtual function it overrides.  That is, if the original return type was B∗, then the return type of the overriding function may be D∗, provided B is a public base of D. Similarly, a return type of B& may be relaxed to D&. This is sometimes called the covariant return rule.  This relaxation applies only to return types that are pointers or references, and not to ‘‘smart pointers’’ such as unique_ptr  §5.2.1 .  In particular, there is not a similar relaxation of the rules for argument types because that would lead to type violations.  Consider a class hierarchy representing different kinds of expressions.  In addition to the opera- tions  for  manipulating  expressions,  the  base  class Expr would  provide  facilities  for  making  new expression objects of the various expression types:  class Expr { public:  Expr  ;  Expr const Expr& ; virtual Expr∗ new_expr   =0; virtual Expr∗ clone   =0;    ...     default constructor    copyconstr uctor  };  };  The idea is that new_expr   makes a default object of the type of the expression and clone   makes a copy of the object. Both will return an object of some speciﬁc class derived from Expr. They can never just return a ‘‘plain Expr’’  because Expr was deliberately and appropriately declared to be an abstract class.  A derived class can override new_expr   and or clone   to return an object of its own type:  class Cond : public Expr { public:  Cond  ; Cond const Cond& ; Cond∗ new_expr   override { return new Cond  ; } Cond∗ clone   override { return new Cond ∗this ; }    ...   Section 20.3.6  Return Type Relaxation  597  This  means  that  given an object  of  class Expr, a  user  can  create  a  new object  of  ‘‘just  the  same type.’’  For example: void user Expr∗ p  {  Expr∗ p2 = p−>new_expr  ;    ...  The pointer assigned to p2 is declared to point to a ‘‘plain Expr,’’ but it will point to an object of a type derived from Expr, such as Cond.  The return type of Cond::new_expr   and Cond::clone   is Cond∗ rather than Expr∗. This allows a Cond to be cloned without loss of type information. Similarly, a derived class Addition would have a clone   returning a Addition∗. For example:  }  }  }  void user2 Cond∗ pc, Addition∗ pa  {  Cond∗ p1 = pc−>clone  ; Addition∗ p2 = pa−>clone  ;    ...  void user3 Cond∗ pc, Expr∗ pe  {  Cond∗ p1 = pc−>clone  ; Cond∗ p2 = pe−>clone  ;     ...  If we use clone   for an Expr we only know that the result is an Expr∗:     error :Expr ::clone  retur nsan Expr*  Because functions such as new_expr   and clone   are virtual and they  indirectly  construct objects, they are  often  called virtual  constructors. Each  simply  uses  a  constructor  to  create  a  suitable object.  To make an object, a constructor needs the exact type of the object it is to create. Consequently, a constructor cannot be virtual. Furthermore, a constructor is not quite an ordinary function. In par- ticular, it interacts with memory management routines in ways ordinary member functions don’t. So, you cannot take a pointer to a constructor and pass that to an object creation function.  Both  of  these  restrictions  can  be  circumvented  by  deﬁning  a  function  that  calls  a  constructor and returns a constructed object. This is fortunate because creating a new object without knowing its  exact  type  is  often  useful. The Ival_box_maker  §21.2.4   is  an  example  of  a  class  designed speciﬁcally to do that.  20.4  Abstract Classes Many classes  resemble  class Employee in  that  they are  useful  as  themselves,  as  interfaces  for derived classes, and as part of the implementation of derived classes.  For such classes, the tech- niques  described  in  §20.3.2  sufﬁce.  However,  not  all  classes  follow that  pattern. Some  classes, such as a class Shape, represent abstract concepts for which objects cannot exist.  A Shape makes   598  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  sense only as the base of some class derived from it. This can be seen from the fact that it is not possible to provide sensible deﬁnitions for its virtual functions:  class Shape { public:  virtual void rotate int  { throw runtime_error{"Shape::rotate"}; } virtual void draw   const { throw runtime_error{"Shape::draw"}; }    ...     inelegant  Trying to make a shape of this unspeciﬁed kind is silly but legal:  Shape s;    silly: ‘‘shapeless shape’’  It is silly because every operation on s will result in an error.  A better alternative is to declare the virtual functions of class Shape to be pure virtual functions.  A virtual function is ‘‘made pure’’ by the ‘‘pseudo initializer’’ = 0:  class Shape { public:     abstract class  virtual void rotate int  = 0; virtual void draw   const = 0; virtual bool is_closed   const = 0;    ... virtual ˜Shape  ;      pure virtual function    pure virtual function    pure virtual function     vir tual  };  };  A class with one or more pure virtual functions is an abstract class, and no objects of that abstract class can be created:  Shape s;    error :variable of abstract class Shape  An abstract class is intended as an interface to objects accessed through pointers and references  to preserve polymorphic behavior .  Consequently, it is usually important for an abstract class to have a virtual destructor  §3.2.4, §21.2.2 . Because the interface provided by an abstract class cannot be used to create objects using a constructor, abstract classes don’t usually have constructors.  An abstract class can be used only as an interface to other classes. For example:  class Point {  * ...*  };  class Circle : public Shape { public:  void rotate int  override { } void draw   const override; bool is_closed   const override { return true; }  Circle Point p, int r ;  private:  Point center; int radius;  };   Section 20.4  Abstract Classes  599  A pure virtual function that is not deﬁned in a derived class remains a pure virtual function, so the derived class is also an abstract class. This allows us to build implementations in stages:  class Polygon : public Shape { public:     abstract class  bool is_closed   const override { return true; }    ... draw and rotate not overr idden...  Polygon b {p1,p2,p3,p4};     error :declaration of object of abstract class Polygon  Polygon is still abstract because we did not override draw   and rotate  . Only when that is done do we have a class from which we can create objects:  };  };  };  class Irregular_polygon : public Polygon {  list  lp;  public:  Irregular_polygon initializ er_list  ;  void draw   const override; void rotate int  override;    ...  class Character_device { public:  virtual int open int opt  = 0; virtual int close int opt  = 0; virtual int read char∗ p, int n  = 0; virtual int write const char∗ p, int n  = 0; virtual int ioctl int ...  = 0;    device I O control  virtual ˜Character_device   { }     vir tualdestr uctor  Irregular_polygon poly {p1,p2,p3,p4};      assume that p1 .. p4 are Points deﬁned somewhere  An abstract class provides an interface without exposing implementation details. For example, an operating system might hide the details of its device drivers behind an abstract class:  We  can then specify drivers as classes derived from Character_device and manipulate a variety of drivers through that interface.  The design style supported by abstract classes is called interface inheritance in contrast to the implementation inheritance supported by base classes with state and or deﬁned member functions. Combinations of the two approaches are possible. That is, we can deﬁne and use base classes with both state and pure virtual functions. However, such mixtures of approaches can be confusing and require extra care.  With the introduction of abstract classes, we have the basic facilities for writing a complete pro-  gram in a modular fashion using classes as building blocks.   600  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  20.5  Access Control A member of a class can be private, protected, or public:   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   If it is private, its name can be used only by member functions and friends of the class in which it is declared. If it is protected, its name can be used only by member functions and friends of the class in which it is declared and by member functions and friends of classes derived from this class  see §19.4 . If it is public, its name can be used by any function.  This reﬂects the view that there are three kinds of functions accessing a class: functions implement- ing the class  its friends and members , functions implementing a derived class  the derived class’s friends and members , and other functions. This can be presented graphically:  general users  derived class’s member functions and friends  own member functions and friends  The access control is applied uniformly to names. What a name refers to does not affect the control of its use. This means that we can have private member functions, types, constants, etc., as well as private data members. For example, an efﬁcient nonintrusive list class often requires data structures to keep track of elements. A list is nonintrusive if it does not require modiﬁcation to its elements  e.g., by requiring element types to have link ﬁelds . The information and data structures used to organize the list can be kept private:  public: protected: private:  template  class List { public:  void insert T ; T get  ;    ...  private:  struct Link { T val; Link∗ next; };  struct Chunk {  enum { chunk_siz e = 15 }; Link v[chunk_siz e]; Chunk∗ next;  };   Section 20.5  Access Control   601  The deﬁnitions of the public functions are pretty strainghtforward:  Chunk∗ allocated; Link∗ free; Link∗ get_free  ; Link∗ head;  template  void List ::insert T val  {  Link∗ lnk = get_free  ; lnk−>val = val; lnk−>next = head; head = lnk;  template  T List ::g et   {  if  head == 0   Link∗ p= head; head = p−>next; p−>next = free; free = p; return p−>val;  };  }  }  }  throw Underﬂow{};     Underﬂowismyexception class  As is common, the deﬁnition of the supporting  here, private  functions are a bit more tricky:  template  typename List ::Link∗ List ::get_free   {     ... allocate a newchunk and place its Links on the free list ...  if  free == 0  {  } Link∗ p = free; free = free−>next; return p;  The List  scope is entered by saying List :: in a member function deﬁnition. However, because the return type of get_free   is mentioned before the name List ::get_free   is mentioned, the full name List ::Link must be used instead of the abbreviation Link. The alternative is to use the sufﬁx notation for return types  §12.1.4 :   602  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  Nonmember functions  except friends  do not have such access:  template  auto List ::get_free   −> Link∗ {     ...  }  template  void would_be_meddler List ∗ p  {  List ::Link∗ q = 0;    ... q = p−>free;     ... if  List ::Chunk::chunk_siz e > 31  {     ...  }  }     error :List ::Link is private     error :List ::free is private     error :List ::Chunk::chunk_sizeisprivate  In a class, members are by default private; in a struct, members are by default public  §16.2.4 .  The obvious alternative to using a member type is to place the type in the surrounding name-  space.  For example:  template  struct Link2 {  T val; Link2∗ next;  template  class List { private:  Link2 ∗ free;    ...  };  };  };  Link is implicitly parameterized with List ’s parameter T. For Link2, we must make that explicit.  If a member type does not depend on all the template class’s parameters, the nonmember ver-  sion can be preferable; see §23.4.6.3.  If the nested class is not generally useful by itself and the enclosing class needs access to its  representation, declaring the member class a friend  §19.4.2  may be a good idea:  template  class List;  template  class Link3 {  friend class List ; T val; Link3∗ next;     only List  can access Link    Section 20.5  Access Control   603  template  class List { private:  Link3 ∗ free;    ...  };  class S { public:  public:  int m1;  int m2;  };  A compiler may reorder sections of a class with separate access speciﬁers  §8.2.6 . For example:  The compiler may decide for m2 to precede m1 in the layout of an S object.  Such reordering could come  as  a  surprise  to  the  programmer  and  is  implementation-dependent,  so  don’t use  multiple access speciﬁers for data members without good reason.  20.5.1 protected Members When designing a class hierarchy,  we sometimes provide functions designed to be used by imple- menters of derived classes but not by the general user. For example, we may provide an  efﬁcient  unchecked  access  function  for  derived class  implementers  and   safe   checked  access  for  others. Declaring the unchecked version protected achieves that.  For example:  class Buffer { public:  char& operator[] int i ;    ...     checkedaccess  protected:  char& access int i ;    ...     uncheckedaccess  };  };  }  class Circular_buffer : public Buffer { public:  void reallocate char∗ p, int s ;    ...     change location and size  void Circular_buffer::reallocate char∗ p, int s    change location and size {     ... for  int i=0; i!=old_sz; ++i      ...  p[i] = access i ;     no redundant checking   604  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  void f Buffer& b  {  b[3] = 'b'; b.access 3  = 'c';     OK  checked     error :Buffer ::access  is protected  For another example, see Window_with_border in §21.3.5.2.  A derived class can access a base class’s protected members only for objects of its own type:  }  };  };  }  };  class Buffer { protected:  char a[128];    ...  class Linked_buffer : public Buffer {     ...  class Circular_buffer : public Buffer {     ... void f Linked_buffer∗ p  {  a[0] = 0; p−>a[0] = 0;     OK: access to Circular_buffer’sown protected member    error :access to protected member of different type  This prevents subtle errors that would otherwise occur when one derived class corrupts data belong- ing to other derived classes.  20.5.1.1  Use of protected Members  The  simple  private public  model  of  data  hiding  serves  the  notion  of  concrete  types   §16.3   well. However, when derived classes are used, there are two kinds of users of a class: derived classes and ‘‘the general public.’’  The members and friends that implement the operations on the class operate on the class objects on behalf of these users. The private public model allows the programmer to distinguish clearly between the implementers and the general public, but it does not provide a way of catering speciﬁcally to derived classes.  Members declared protected are far more open to abuse than members declared private. In par- ticular, declaring data members protected is usually a design error. Placing signiﬁcant amounts of data in a common class for all derived classes to use leaves that data open to corruption. Worse, protected data, like public data, cannot easily be restructured because there is no good way of ﬁnd- ing every use. Thus, protected data becomes a software maintenance problem.  Fortunately, you don’t hav e to use protected data; private is the default in classes and is usually In  my  experience,  there  have  always  been  alternatives to placing  signiﬁcant  the  better  choice. amounts of information in a common base class for derived classes to use directly.   Section 20.5.1.1  Use of protected Members   605  However, none of these objections are signiﬁcant for protected member functions; protected is a ﬁne way of specifying operations for use in derived classes.  The Ival_slider in §21.2.2 is an exam- ple  of  this. Had  the  implementation  class  been private in  this  example,  further  derivation  would have  been  infeasible. On  the  other  hand,  making  bases  providing  implementation  details public invites mistakes and misuse.  20.5.2  Access to Base Classes Like a member, a base class can be declared private, protected, or public. For example:  class X : public B {  * ...*  }; class Y : protected B {  * ...*  }; class Z : private B {  * ...*  };   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   The different access speciﬁers serve different design needs:  public derivation makes the derived class a subtype of its base. For example, X is a kind of B. This is the most common form of derivation. private bases are most useful when deﬁning a class by restricting the interface to a base so that stronger guarantees can be provided.  For example, B is an implementation detail of Z. The Vector of pointers template that adds type checking to its Vector  base from §25.3 is a good example. protected bases are useful in class hierarchies in which further derivation is the norm. Like private derivation, protected derivation  is  used  to  represent  implementation  details. The Ival_slider from §21.2.2 is a good example.  The access speciﬁer for a base class can be left out. In that case, the base defaults to a private base for a class and a public base for a struct. For example:  class XX : B {  * ...*  }; struct YY : B {  * ...*  };     Bisaprivate base    Bisapublic base  People expect base classes to be public  that is, to express a subtype relationship , so the absence of an access speciﬁer for a base is likely to be surprising for a class but not for a struct.  The access speciﬁer for a base class controls the access to members of the base class and the conversion of pointers and references from the derived class type to the base class type. Consider a class D derived from a base class B:  If B is a private base, its public and protected members can be used only by member func- tions and friends of D. Only friends and members of D can convert a D∗ to a B∗. If B is a protected base, its public and protected members can be used only by member func- tions and friends of D and by member functions and friends of classes derived from D. Only friends and members of D and friends and members of classes derived from D can convert a D∗ to a B∗. If B is a public base, its public members can be used by any function.  In addition, its pro- tected  members  can  be  used  by  members  and  friends  of D and  members  and  friends  of classes derived from D. Any function can convert a D∗ to a B∗.  This  basically  restates  the  rules  for  member  access   §20.5 . When  designing  a  class,  we  choose access for bases in the same way as we do for members. For an example, see Ival_slider in §21.2.2.   606  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  20.5.2.1  Multiple Inheritance and Access Control  If the name of a base class can be reached through multiple paths in a multiple-inheritance lattice  §21.3 , it is accessible if it is accessible through any path.  For example:  struct B {  int m; static int sm;    ...  };  class D1 : public virtual B {  * ...*  } ; class D2 : public virtual B {  * ...*  } ; class D12 : public D1, private D2 {  * ...*  };  D12∗ pd = new D12; B∗ pb = pd; int i1 = pd−>m;     OK: accessible through D1    OK: accessible through D1  class X1 : public B {  * ...*  } ; class X2 : public B {  * ...*  } ; class XX : public X1, public X2 {  * ...*  };  If a single entity is reachable through several paths, we can still refer to it without ambiguity. For example:  XX∗ pxx = new XX; int i1 = pxx−>m; int i2 = pxx−>sm;     error,ambiguous: XX::X1::B::m or XX::X2::B::m?    OK: there is only one B::sm in an XX  sm is a static member   20.5.3 using-Declarations and Access Control A using-declaration  §14.2.2, §20.3.5  cannot be used to gain access to additional information. It is simply a mechanism for making accessible information more convenient to use. On the other hand, once access is available, it can be granted to other users. For example:  class B { private:  int a; protected: int b;  public:  int c;  };  };  class D : public B { public:  using B::a; using B::b;     error :B::a is private    makeB::b publicly available through D   Section 20.5.3  using-Declarations and Access Control   607  When a using-declaration is combined with private or protected derivation, it can be used to specify interfaces to some, but not all, of the facilities usually offered by a class. For example:     giveaccess to B::b and B::c,but not B::a  class BB : private B { public:  using B::b; using B::c;  };  See also §20.3.5.  20.6  Pointers to Members A pointer  to  member  is  an  offset-like construct  that  allows  a  programmer  to  indirectly  refer  to  a member of a class. The operators −>∗ and .∗ are arguably the most specialized and least used C++ operators.  Using −>, we can access a member of a class, m, by naming it: p−>m. Using −>∗, we can access a member that  conceptually  has its name stored in a pointer to member, ptom: p−>∗ptom. This allows us to access members with their names passed as arguments.  In both cases, p must be a pointer to an object of an appropriate class.  A pointer to member cannot be assigned to a void∗ or any other ordinary pointer. A null pointer   e.g., nullptr  can be assigned to a pointer to member and then represents ‘‘no member.’’  20.6.1  Pointers to Function Members Many classes  provide  simple,  very  general  interfaces  intended  to  be  invoked in sev eral  different ways.  For example, many ‘‘object-oriented’’ user interfaces deﬁne a set of requests to which every object represented on the screen should be prepared to respond. In addition, such requests can be presented directly or indirectly from programs. Consider a simple variant of this idea:  class Std_interface { public:  virtual void start   = 0; virtual void suspend   = 0; virtual void resume   = 0; virtual void quit   = 0; virtual void full_size   = 0; virtual void small   = 0;  virtual ˜Std_interface   {}  };  The exact meaning of each operation is deﬁned by the object on which it is invoked.  Often, there is a layer of software between the person or program issuing the request and the object receiving it. Ideally, such intermediate layers of software should not have to know anything about the individual operations  such  as resume   and full_size  . If they did,  the  intermediate  layers  would  have  to be updated each time an operation changed. Consequently, such intermediate layers simply transmit data representing the operation to be invoked from the source of the request to its recipient.   608  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  One simple way of doing that is to send a string representing the operation to be invoked.  For example, to invoke suspend   we could send the string "suspend". Howev er, someone has to create that string and someone has to decode it to determine to which operation it corresponds – if any. Often, that seems indirect and tedious. Instead, we might simply send an integer representing the operation.  For  example, 2 might  be  used  to  mean suspend  . Howev er,  while  an  integer  may  be convenient for machines to deal with, it can get pretty obscure for people. We  still have to write code to determine that 2 means suspend   and to invoke suspend  .  However, we can use a pointer to member to indirectly refer to a member of a class. Consider Std_interface. If I want to invoke suspend   for some object without mentioning suspend   directly, I need a pointer to member referring to Std_interface::suspend  . I also need a pointer or reference to the object I want to suspend. Consider a trivial example:  using Pstd_mem = void  Std_interface::∗   ;      pointer-to-member type  void f Std_interface∗ p  {  }  Pstd_mem s = &Std_interface::suspend; p−>suspend  ;  p−>∗s  ;      pointer to suspend      direct call    call through pointer to member  A pointer to member can be obtained by applying the address-of operator, &, to a fully qualiﬁed class member name, for example, &Std_interface::suspend. A variable of type ‘‘pointer to member of class X’’ is declared using a declarator of the form X::∗.  The use of an alias to compensate for the lack of readability of the C declarator syntax is typi-  cal.  However, please note how the X::∗ declarator matches the traditional ∗ declarator exactly.  A pointer to member m can be used in combination with an object. The operators −>∗ and .∗ allow the  programmer  to  express  such  combinations. For example, p−>∗m binds m to  the  object pointed to by p, and obj.∗m binds m to the object obj. The result can be used in accordance with m’s type.  It is not possible to store the result of a −>∗ or a .∗ operation for later use.  Naturally, if we knew which member we wanted to call, we would invoke it directly rather than mess with pointers to members. Just like ordinary pointers to functions, pointers to member func- tions are used when we need to refer to a function without having to know its name. However,  a pointer to member isn’t a pointer to a piece of memory the way a pointer to a variable or a pointer to a function is. It is more like an offset into a structure or an index into an array, but of course an implementation  takes  into  account  the  differences  between  data  members,  virtual  functions,  non- virtual functions, etc. When a pointer to member is combined with a pointer to an object of the right type, it yields something that identiﬁes a particular member of a particular object.  The p−>∗s   call can be represented graphically like this:  p  vtbl:  s:  X::start  X::suspend   Section 20.6.1  Pointers to Function Members  609  Because a pointer to a virtual member  s in this example  is a kind of offset, it does not depend on an object’s location in memory. A pointer to a virtual member can therefore be passed between dif- ferent address spaces as long as the same object layout is used in both. Like pointers to ordinary functions, pointers to non-virtual member functions cannot be exchanged between address spaces.  Note  that  the  function  invoked through  the  pointer  to  function  can  be virtual. For  example, when we call suspend   through a pointer to function, we get the right suspend   for the object to which the pointer to function is applied. This is an essential aspect of pointers to functions.  When writing an interpreter, we might use pointers to members to invoke functions presented as  strings:  map  variable; map  operation;  void call_member string var, string oper  {   variable[var]−>∗operation[oper]   ;    var.oper    A static member isn’t associated with a particular object, so a pointer to a static member is simply an ordinary pointer. For example:  class Task {     ... static void schedule  ;  void  ∗p    = &Task::schedule;  void  Task::∗ pm    = &Task::schedule;      OK    error :ordinar ypointer assigned    to pointer to member  Pointers to data members are described in §20.6.2.  20.6.2  Pointers to Data Members Naturally, the notion of pointer to member applies to data members and to member functions with arguments and return types. For example:  struct C {  const char∗ val; int i;  void print int x  { cout << val << x << '\n'; } int f1 int ; void f2  ; C const char∗ v  { val = v; }  using Pmﬁ = void  C::∗  int ;  using Pm = const char∗ C::∗;     pointer to member function of C taking an int    pointer to char* data member of C  }  };  };   610  Derived Classes   Chapter 20  void f C& z1, C& z2  {  C∗ p = &z2; Pmﬁ pf = &C::print; Pm pm = &C::val;  z1.print 1 ;  z1.∗pf  2 ; z1.∗pm = "nv1 "; p−>∗pm = "nv2 "; z2.print 3 ;  p−>∗pf  4 ;  class Text : public Std_interface { public:  void start  ; void suspend  ;    ... virtual void print  ;  private:  vector s;  };  pf = &C::f1; pf = &C::f2; pm = &C::i; pm = pf;     error :retur ntype mismatch    error :argument type mismatch    error :type mismatch    error :type mismatch  }  The type of a pointer to function is checked just like any other type.  20.6.3  Base and Derived Members A derived class has at least the members that it inherits from its base classes. Often it has more. This implies that we can safely assign a pointer to a member of a base class to a pointer to a mem- ber of a derived class, but not the other way around. This property is often called contravariance. For example:  void  Std_interface::∗ pmi    = &Text::print;  void  Text::∗pmt    = &Std_interface::start;      error    OK  This contravariance rule appears to be the opposite of the rule that says we can assign a pointer to a derived class  to  a  pointer  to  its  base  class. In  fact,  both  rules  exist  to  preserve the  fundamental guarantee that a pointer may never point to an object that doesn’t at least have the properties that the  pointer  promises. In  this  case, Std_interface::∗ can  be  applied  to  any Std_interface, and  most such  objects  presumably  are  not  of  type Te xt. Consequently, they do not  have  the  member Te xt::print with which we tried to initialize pmi. By refusing the initialization, the compiler saves us from a run-time error.

The exam- ples  are  taken  from  user-interface  design,  but  I  avoid  the  topic  of  event-driven programming  as commonly used for graphical user interface  GUI  systems. A discussion of exactly how an action on the screen is transformed into a call of a member function would add little to the issues of class hierarchy design and has a huge potential for distraction: it is an interesting and important topic in its own right. For an understanding of GUI, have a look at one of the many C++ GUI libraries.  21.2  Design of Class Hierarchies Consider a simple design problem: Provide a way for a program  ‘‘an application’’  to get an inte- ger value from a user. This can be done in a bewildering number of ways.  To insulate our program from  this  variety, and  also  to  get  a  chance  to  explore  the  possible  design  choices,  let  us  start  by deﬁning our program’s model of this simple input operation.   614  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  The idea is to have a class Ival_box  ‘‘integer value input box’’  that knows what range of input values it will accept. A program can ask an Ival_box for its value and ask it to prompt the user if necessary. In addition, a program can ask an Ival_box if a user changed the value since the program last looked at it:  user   via ‘‘system’’   Ival_box:  value  set_value    get_value    application  Because there are many ways of implementing this basic idea, we must assume that there will be many different kinds of Ival_boxes, such as sliders, plain boxes in which a user can type a number, dials, and voice interaction.  The  general  approach  is  to  build  a  ‘‘virtual  user-interface  system’’ for  the  application  to  use. This system provides some of the services provided by existing user-interface systems. It can be implemented on a wide variety of systems to ensure the portability of application code. Naturally, there  are  other  ways  of  insulating  an  application  from  a  user-interface  system. I chose  this approach  because  it  is  general,  because  it  allows  me  to  demonstrate  a  variety  of  techniques  and design tradeoffs, because those techniques are also the ones used to build ‘‘real’’ user-interface sys- tems, and – most important – because these techniques are applicable to problems far beyond the narrow domain of interface systems.  In  addition  to  ignoring  the  topic  of  how to map  user  actions   events   to  library  calls,  I  also  ignore the need for locking in a multi-threaded GUI system.  21.2.1  Implementation Inheritance Our ﬁrst solution is a class hierarchy using implementation inheritance  as is commonly found in older programs .  Class Ival_box deﬁnes the basic interface to all Ival_boxes and speciﬁes a default implementation that more speciﬁc kinds of Ival_boxes can override with their own versions.  In addition, we declare the data needed to implement the basic notion:  class Ival_box { protected:  int val; int low, high; bool chang ed {false};   public:     changed byuser using set_value    Ival_box int ll, int hh  :val{ll}, low{ll}, high{hh} { }  virtual int get_value   { chang ed = false; return val; } virtual void set_value int i  { chang ed = true; val = i; } virtual void reset_value int i  { chang ed = false; val = i; } virtual void prompt   { } virtual bool was_chang ed   const { return chang ed; }     forapplication    foruser    forapplication  virtual ˜Ival_box   {};  };   Section 21.2.1  Implementation Inheritance  615  The default implementation of the functions is pretty sloppy and is provided here primarily to illus- trate the intended semantics. A realistic class would, for example, provide some range checking.  A programmer might use these ‘‘ival classes’’ like this: void interact Ival_box∗ pb  {  pb−>prompt  ;    aler tuser    ... int i = pb−>get_value  ; if  pb−>was_chang ed    {     ... newvalue; do something ...  } else {  }     ... do something else ...  void some_fct   {  }  }  unique_ptr  p1 {new Ival_slider{0,5}};  interact p1.get   ;     Ival_slider derived from Ival_box  unique_ptr  p2 {new Ival_dial{1,12}}; interact p2.get   ;  Most application code is written in terms of  pointers to  plain Ival_boxes the way interact   is.  That way,  the  application  doesn’t hav e to  know about  the  potentially  large  number  of  variants  of  the Ival_box concept.  The knowledge of such specialized classes is isolated in the relatively few func- tions  that  create  such  objects. This  isolates  users  from  changes  in  the  implementations  of  the derived classes.  Most code can be oblivious to the fact that there are different kinds of Ival_boxes.  I use unique_ptr  §5.2.1, §34.3.1  to avoid forgetting to delete the ival_boxes. To simplify the discussion, I do not address issues of how a program waits for input. Maybe the program really does wait for the user in get_value    e.g., using a get   on a future; §5.3.5.1 , maybe the program associates the Ival_box with an event and prepares to respond to a callback, or maybe the program spawns a thread for the Ival_box and later inquires about the state of that thread. Such decisions are crucial in the design of user-interface systems. However, discussing them here in any realistic  detail  would  simply  distract  from  the  presentation  of  programming  techniques  and  lan- guage facilities.  The design techniques described here and the language facilities that support them are not speciﬁc to user interfaces.  They apply to a far greater range of problems.  The different kinds of Ival_boxes are deﬁned as classes derived from Ival_box. For example:  class Ival_slider : public Ival_box { private:  public:  Ival_slider int, int ;     ... graphics stuff to deﬁne what the slider looks like, etc. ...   616  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  int get_value   override;     get value from user and deposit it in val void prompt   override;  };  The data members of Ival_box were declared protected to allow access from derived classes.  Thus, Ival_slider::g et_value   can deposit a value in Ival_box::val. A protected member is accessible from a class’s own members and from members of derived classes, but not to general users  see §20.5 .  In addition to Ival_slider, we would deﬁne other variants of the Ival_box concept.  These could include Ival_dial, which lets you select a value by turning a knob; Flashing_ival_slider, which ﬂashes when  you  ask  it  to prompt  ; and Popup_ival_slider, which  responds  to prompt   by  appearing  in some prominent place, thus making it hard for the user to ignore.  From  where  would  we  get  the  graphics  stuff?  Most user-interface  systems  provide  a  class deﬁning the basic properties of being an entity on the screen. So, if we use the system from ‘‘Big Bucks Inc.,’’  we would have to make each of our Ival_slider, Ival_dial, etc., classes a kind of BBwid- get. This would most simply be achieved by rewriting our Ival_box so that it derives from BBwidget. In that way, all our classes inherit all the properties of a BBwidget. For example, every Ival_box can be placed on the screen, obey the graphical style rules, be resized, be dragged around, etc., accord- ing to the standard set by the BBwidget system.  Our class hierarchy would look like this:  class Ival_box : public BBwidget {  * ...*  }; class Ival_slider : public Ival_box {  * ...*  }; class Ival_dial : public Ival_box {  * ...*  }; class Flashing_ival_slider : public Ival_slider {  * ...*  }; class Popup_ival_slider : public Ival_slider {  * ...*  };     rewr ittento use BBwidget  or graphically:  BBwidget  Ival_box  Ival_slider  Ival_dial  Popup_ival_slider  Flashing_ival_slider  21.2.1.1  Critique  This design works well in many ways, and for many problems this kind of hierarchy is a good solu- tion.  However, there are some awkward details that could lead us to look for alternative designs.  We retroﬁtted BBwidget as the base of Ival_box. This is not quite right  even if this style is com- mon in real-world systems . The use of BBwidget isn’t part of our basic notion of an Ival_box; it is an implementation detail. Deriving Ival_box from BBwidget elevated an implementation detail to a ﬁrst-level design decision. That can be right. For example, using the environment deﬁned by ‘‘Big Bucks Inc.’’  may be a key decision based on how our organization conducts its business.  However, what  if  we  also  wanted  to  have  implementations  of  our Ival_boxes  for  systems  from  ‘‘Imperial   Section 21.2.1.1  Critique   617  Bananas,’’ ‘‘Liberated Software,’’ and ‘‘Compiler Whizzes’’?  We would have to maintain four dis- tinct versions of our program:  class Ival_box : public BBwidget {  * ...*  }; class Ival_box : public CWwidget {  * ...*  }; class Ival_box : public IBwidget {  * ...*  }; class Ival_box : public LSwindow {  * ...*  };     BB version    CW version    IB version    LS version  Having many versions could result in a version control nightmare.  In reality, we are unlikely to ﬁnd a simple, coherent, two-letter preﬁx scheme. More likely, the libraries from different purveyors would be in different namespaces and use different terminologies for similar concepts, such as BigBucks::Widg et, Wizzies::control, and LS::window. But that does not affect our class hierarchy design discussion, so to simplify I ignore naming and namespace issues.  Another problem is that every derived class shares the basic data declared in Ival_box. That data is, of course, an implementation detail that also crept into our Ival_box interface.  From a practical point of view, it is also the wrong data in many cases.  For example, an Ival_slider doesn’t need the value stored speciﬁcally. It can easily be calculated from the position of the slider when someone executes get_value  . In general, keeping two related, but different, sets of data is asking for trou- ble.  Sooner or later someone will get them out of sync. Also, experience shows that novice pro- grammers  tend  to  mess  with  protected  data  in  ways  that  are  unnecessary  and  that  cause  mainte- nance  problems. Data  members  are  better  kept  private  so  that  writers  of  derived classes  cannot mess with them. Better still, data should be in the derived classes, where it can be deﬁned to match requirements  exactly  and  cannot  complicate  the  life  of  unrelated  derived classes.  In almost  all cases, a protected interface should contain only functions, types, and constants.  Deriving from BBwidget gives the beneﬁt of making the facilities provided by BBwidget avail- able  to  users  of Ival_box. Unfortunately, it also  means  that  changes  to  class BBwidget may  force users to recompile or even rewrite their code to recover from such changes. In particular, the way most C++ implementations work implies that a change in the size of a base class requires a recom- pilation of all derived classes.  Finally, our program may have  to run in a mixed environment in which windows of different user-interface  systems  coexist.  This could  happen  either  because  two systems  somehow share  a screen or because our program needs to communicate with users on different systems. Having our user-interface systems ‘‘wired in’’ as the one and only base of our one and only Ival_box interface just isn’t ﬂexible enough to handle those situations.  21.2.2  Interface Inheritance So, let’s start again and build a new class hierarchy that solves the problems presented in the cri- tique of the traditional hierarchy:  [1]  The user-interface system should be an implementation detail that is hidden from users  who don’t want to know about it.  [2]  The Ival_box class should contain no data. [3]  No recompilation of code using the Ival_box family of classes should be required after a  change of the user-interface system. Ival_boxes for different interface systems should be able to coexist in our program.  [4]   618  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  Several alternative approaches can be taken to achieve this.  Here, I present one that maps cleanly into the C++ language.  First, I specify class Ival_box as a pure interface:  This is much cleaner than the original declaration of Ival_box. The data is gone and so are the sim- plistic implementations of the member functions. Gone, too, is the constructor, since there is no data for it to initialize. Instead, I added a virtual destructor to ensure proper cleanup of the data that will be deﬁned in the derived classes.  class Ival_box { public:  virtual int get_value   = 0; virtual void set_value int i  = 0; virtual void reset_value int i  = 0; virtual void prompt   = 0; virtual bool was_chang ed   const = 0; virtual ˜Ival_box   { }  };  The deﬁnition of Ival_slider might look like this:  class Ival_slider : public Ival_box, protected BBwidget { public:  Ival_slider int,int ; ˜Ival_slider   override;  int get_value   override; void set_value int i  override;    ...  protected:  private:  };     ... functions overr idingBBwidget virtual functions    e.g., BBwidget::draw  , BBwidget::mouse1hit   ...     ... data needed for slider ...  The derived class Ival_slider inherits from an abstract class  Ival_box  that requires it to implement the  base  class’s pure  virtual  functions. It  also  inherits  from BBwidget which  provides  it  with  the means of doing so. Since Ival_box provides the interface for the derived class, it is derived using public. Since BBwidget is only an implementation aid, it is derived using protected  §20.5.2 .  This implies that a programmer using Ival_slider cannot directly use facilities deﬁned by BBwidget. The interface provided by Ival_slider is the one inherited from Ival_box, plus what Ival_slider explicitly declares.  I used protected derivation  instead  of  the  more  restrictive   and  usually  safer  private derivation to make BBwidget available to classes derived from Ival_slider. I used explicit override because  this  ‘‘widget  hierarchy’’ is exactly  the  kind  of  large,  complicated  hierachy where  being explicit can help minimize confusion.  Deriving directly from more than one class is usually called multiple inheritance  §21.3 .  Note that Ival_slider must  override  functions  from  both Ival_box and BBwidget. Therefore,  it  must  be derived directly or indirectly from both. As shown in §21.2.1.1, deriving Ival_slider indirectly from BBwidget by  making BBwidget a base  of Ival_box is  possible,  but  doing  so  has  undesirable  side   Section 21.2.2  Interface Inheritance  619  effects.  Similarly, making  the  ‘‘implementation  class’’ BBwidget a member  of Ival_box is  not  a solution because a class cannot override virtual functions of its members. Representing the win- dow by a BBwidget∗ member in Ival_box leads to a completely different design with a separate set of tradeoffs.  To  some people, the words ‘‘multiple inheritance’’ indicate something complicated and scary. However, the use of one base class for implementation details and another for interface  the abstract class  is common to all languages supporting inheritance and compile-time checked interfaces.  In particular, the use of the abstract class Ival_box is almost identical to the use of an interface in Java or C.  Interestingly, this  declaration  of Ival_slider allows  application  code  to  be  written  exactly  as  before.  All we have done is to restructure the implementation details in a more logical way.  Many classes require some form of cleanup for an object before it goes away.  Since the abstract class Ival_box cannot  know if a derived class  requires  such  cleanup,  it  must  assume  that  it  does require some. We  ensure proper cleanup by deﬁning a virtual destructor Ival_box::˜Ival_box   in the base and overriding it suitably in derived classes.  For example:  The delete operator  explicitly  destroys  the  object  pointed  to  by p. We hav e no  way  of  knowing exactly to which class the object pointed to by p belongs, but thanks to Ival_box’s virtual destructor, proper cleanup as  optionally  deﬁned by that class’ destructor will be done.  void f Ival_box∗ p  {     ... delete p;  }  The Ival_box hierarchy can now be deﬁned like this:  class Ival_box {  * ...*  }; class Ival_slider  class Ival_dial  : public Ival_box, protected BBwidget {  * ...*  };  : public Ival_box, protected BBwidget {  * ...*  };  class Flashing_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider {  * ...*  };  class Popup_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider {  * ...*  };  or graphically:  BBwidget  Ival_box  BBwidg et  Ival_slider  Ival_dial  Popup__ival_slider  Flashing_ival_slider  I used a dashed line to represent protected inheritance  §20.5.1 . General users cannot access the protected bases because they are  correctly  considered part of the implementation.   620  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  21.2.3  Alternative Implementations This design is cleaner and more easily maintainable than the traditional one – and no less efﬁcient. However, it still fails to solve the version control problem:  class Ival_box {  * ...*  };    common class Ival_slider  : public Ival_box, protected BBwidget {  * ...*  };    forBB  : public Ival_box, protected CWwidget {  * ...*  };    forCW  class Ival_slider     ...  There is no way of having the Ival_slider for BBwidgets coexist with the Ival_slider for CWwidgets, ev en if the two user-interface systems could themselves coexist.  The obvious solution is to deﬁne several different Ival_slider classes with separate names:  class Ival_box {  * ...*  }; class BB_ival_slider  class CW_ival_slider  : public Ival_box, protected BBwidget {  * ...*  };  : public Ival_box, protected CWwidget {  * ...*  };     ...  or graphically:  BBwidget  Ival_box  CWwidg et  BB_ival_slider  CW_ival_slider  To  further  insulate  our  application-oriented Ival_box classes  from  implementation  details,  we  can derive an abstract Ival_slider class from Ival_box and then derive the system-speciﬁc Ival_sliders from that:  class Ival_box {  * ...*  }; class Ival_slider  : public Ival_box {  * ...*  };  class BB_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider, protected BBwidget {  * ...*  };  class CW_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider, protected CWwidget {  * ...*  };     ...  or graphically:  Ival_box  BBwidget  Ival_slider  CWwidg et  BB_ival_slider  CW_ival_slider   Section 21.2.3  Alternative Implementations   621  Usually, we can  do  better  yet  by  utilizing  more  speciﬁc  classes  in  the  implementation  hierarchy. For example, if the ‘‘Big Bucks Inc.’’ system has a slider class, we can derive our Ival_slider directly from the BBslider:  class BB_ival_slider  class CW_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider, protected BBslider {  * ...*  };  : public Ival_slider, protected CWslider {  * ...*  };  or graphically:  BBwidget  Ival_box  CWwidg et  BBslider  Ival_slider  CWslider  BB_ival_slider  CW_ival_slider  This improvement becomes signiﬁcant where – as is not uncommon – our abstractions are not too different  from  the  ones  provided  by  the  system  used  for  implementation. In  that  case,  program- ming is reduced to mapping between similar concepts. Derivation from general base classes, such as BBwidget, is then done only rarely.  The complete hierarchy will consist of our original application-oriented conceptual hierarchy of  interfaces expressed as derived classes:  class Ival_box {  * ...*  }; class Ival_slider  : public Ival_box {  * ...*  };  class Ival_dial  : public Ival_box {  * ...*  };  class Flashing_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider {  * ...*  };  class Popup_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider {  * ...*  };  followed  by  the  implementations  of  this  hierarchy for  various  graphical  user  interface  systems, expressed as derived classes:  : public Flashing_ival_slider, protected BBwidget_with_bells_and_whistles {  * ...*  };  class BB_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider, protected BBslider {  * ...*  };  class BB_ﬂashing_ival_slider  class BB_popup_ival_slider  class CW_ival_slider  : public Popup_ival_slider, protected BBslider {  * ...*  };  : public Ival_slider, protected CWslider {  * ...*  };     ...  Using obvious abbreviations, this hierarchy can be represented graphically like this:   622  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  Ival_box  Ival_slider  Ival_dial  ipopup  iﬂash  BBslider  BBslider  CWsl  CWsl  BBb&w  CWsl  BBislider  BBipop  CWipop  CWiﬂ  BBiﬂ  CWislider  The original Ival_box class hierarchy appears unchanged surrounded by implementation classes.  21.2.3.1  Critique  The abstract class design is ﬂexible and almost as simple to deal with as the equivalent design that relies on a common base deﬁning the user-interface system. In the latter design, the windows class is the root of a tree. In the former, the original application class hierarchy appears unchanged as the root of classes that supply its implementations. From the application’s point of view, these designs are equivalent in the strong sense that almost all code works unchanged and in the same way in the two cases.  In either case, you can look at the Ival_box family of classes without bothering with the window-related implementation details most of the time. For example, we would not need to re- write interact   from §21.2.1 if we switched from one class hierarchy to the other.  In  either  case,  the  implementation  of  each Ival_box class  must  be  rewritten  when  the  public interface  of  the  user-interface  system  changes. However,  in the  abstract  class  design,  almost  all user code is protected against changes to the implementation hierarchy and requires no recompila- tion after such a change. This is especially important when the supplier of the implementation hier- archy issues a new ‘‘almost compatible’’ release.  In addition, users of the abstract class hierarchy are in less danger of being locked into a proprietary implementation than are users of a classical hierarchy.  Users of the Ival_box abstract class application hierarchy cannot accidentally use facili- ties from the implementation because only facilities explicitly speciﬁed in the Ival_box hierarchy are accessible; nothing is implicitly inherited from an implementation-speciﬁc base class.  The logical conclusion of this line of thought is a system represented to users as a hierarchy of  abstract classes and implemented by a classical hierarchy.  In other words:  cid:129  Use abstract classes to support interface inheritance  §3.2.3, §20.1 .  cid:129  Use base classes with implementations of virtual functions to support implementation inher-  itance  §3.2.3, §20.1 .   Section 21.2.4  Localizing Object Creation   623  21.2.4  Localizing Object Creation Most of an application can be written using the Ival_box interface.  Further, should the derived inter- faces evolve to provide more facilities than plain Ival_box, then most of an application can be writ- ten using the Ival_box, Ival_slider, etc., interfaces.  However,  the creation of objects must be done using implementation-speciﬁc names such as CW_ival_dial and BB_ﬂashing_ival_slider. We would like to minimize the number of places where such speciﬁc names occur, and object creation is hard to localize unless it is done systematically.  As usual, the solution is to introduce an indirection. This can be done in many ways.  A simple  one is to introduce an abstract class to represent the set of creation operations:  class Ival_maker { public:  virtual Ival_dial∗ dial int, int  =0; virtual Popup_ival_slider∗ popup_slider int, int  =0;    ...     makedial    makepopup slider  For each  interface  from  the Ival_box family  of  classes  that  a  user  should  know about,  class Ival_maker provides a function that makes an object. Such a class is sometimes called a factory, and its functions are  somewhat misleadingly  sometimes called virtual constructors  §20.3.6 .  We now represent each user-interface system by a class derived from Ival_maker:  };  };  };  }  }  class BB_maker : public Ival_maker { public:     makeBBversions  Ival_dial∗ dial int, int  override; Popup_ival_slider∗ popup_slider int, int  override;    ...  class LS_maker : public Ival_maker { public:     makeLSversions  Ival_dial∗ dial int, int  override; Popup_ival_slider∗ popup_slider int, int  override;    ...  Ival_dial∗ BB_maker::dial int a, int b  {  return new BB_ival_dial a,b ;  Ival_dial∗ LS_maker::dial int a, int b  {  return new LS_ival_dial a,b ;  Each function creates an object of the desired interface and implementation type. For example:  Given an Ival_maker, a user  can  now create  objects  without  having  to  know exactly  which  user- interface system is used. For example:   624  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  }  }   cid:129    cid:129   void user Ival_maker& im  {  unique_ptr  pb {im.dial 0,99 };    ...     create appropriate dial  BB_maker BB_impl; LS_maker LS_impl;     forBBusers    forLSusers  void driver   {  user BB_impl ;  user LS_impl ;      use BB    use LS  Passing arguments to such ‘‘virtual constructors’’ is a bit tricky.  In particular, we cannot override the  base  class  functions  that  represent  the  interface  with  different  arguments  in  different  derived classes.  This implies that a fair bit of foresight is required to design the factory class’s interface.  21.3  Multiple Inheritance As described in §20.1, inheritance aims to provide one of two beneﬁts:  Shared  interfaces: leading  to  less  replication  of  code  using  classes  and  making  such  code more uniform. This is often called run-time polymorphism or interface inheritance. Shared implementation: leading to less code and more uniform implementation code. This is often called implementation inheritance.  A class can combine aspects of these two styles.  Here, we explore more general uses of multiple base classes and examine more technical issues  related to combining and accessing features from multiple base classes.  21.3.1  Multiple Interfaces An  abstract  class   e.g., Ival_box; §21.2.2   is  the  obvious  way  to  represent  an  interface.  For  an abstract class without mutable state, there really is little difference between single and multiple uses of a base class in a class hierarchy.  The resolution of potential ambiguities is discussed in §21.3.3, §21.3.4, and §21.3.5. In fact, any class without mutable state can be used as an interface in a multi- ple-inheritance lattice without signiﬁcant complications and overhead.  The key observation is that a class without mutable state can be replicated if necessary or shared if that is desired.  The use of multiple abstract classes as interfaces is almost universal in object-oriented designs   in any language with a notion of an interface .  21.3.2  Multiple Implementation Classes Consider  a  simulation  of  bodies  orbiting  the  Earth  in  which  orbiting  objects  are  represented  as object of class Satellite. A Satellite object would contain orbital, size, shape, albedo, density param- eters, etc., and provide operations for orbital calculations, modifying attributes, etc. Examples of   Section 21.3.2  Multiple Implementation Classes  625  satellites would be rocks, debris from old space vehicles, communication satellites, and the Interna- tional Space Station. These kinds of satellites would be objects of classes derived from Satellite. Such derived classes would add data members and functions and would override some of Satellite’s virtual functions to adjust their meaning suitably.  Now assume that I want to display the results of these simulations graphically and that I had available  a  graphics  system  that  used  the   not  uncommon   strategy  of  deriving  objects  to  be  dis- played from a common base class holding graphical information. This graphics class would pro- vide operations for placement on the screen, scaling, etc. For generality, simplicity, and to hide the details of the actual graphics system, I will refer to the class providing graphical  or in fact alterna- tively nongraphical  output Display.  We can now deﬁne a class of simulated communication satellites, class Comm_sat:  class Comm_sat : public Satellite, public Displayed { public:     ...  };  or graphically:  Satellite  Displayed  Comm_sat  In addition to whatever operations are deﬁned speciﬁcally for a Comm_sat, the union of operations on Satellite and Displayed can be applied. For example:  void f Comm_sat& s  {  s.draw  ;  Pos p = s.center  ;  s.transmit  ;      Displayed::draw      Satellite::center      Comm_sat::transmit    void highlight Displayed∗ ; Pos center_of_gravity const Satellite∗ ;  void g Comm_sat∗ p  {  }  }  Similarly, a Comm_sat can  be  passed  to  a  function  that  expects  a Satellite and  to  a  function  that expects Displayed. For example:  highlight p ;  Pos x = center_of_gravity p ;     pass a pointer to the Satellite partofthe Comm_sat     pass a pointer to the Displayedpar tof the Comm_sat  The implementation of this clearly involves some  simple  compiler technique to ensure that func- tions  expecting  a Satellite see  a  different  part  of  a Comm_sat than  do  functions  expecting  a Dis- played. Virtual functions work as usual. For example:   626  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  class Satellite { public:  virtual Pos center   const = 0;    ...     center of gravity  class Displayed { public:  virtual void draw   = 0;    ...  class Comm_sat : public Satellite, public Displayed { public:  Pos center   const override;  void draw   override;     ...     overr ideSatellite::center      overr ideDisplayed::draw    };  };  };  This ensures that Comm_sat::center   and Displayed::draw   will be called for a Comm_sat treated as a Comm_sat and a Displayed, respectively.  Why didn’t I just keep the Satellite and Displayed parts of a Comm_sat completely separate? I could have deﬁned Comm_sat to have a Satellite member and a Displayed member. Alternatively, I could have deﬁned Comm_sat to have a Satellite∗ member and a Displayed∗ member and let its con- structor set up the proper connections. For many design problems, I would do just that. However, the system that inspired this example was built on the idea of a Satellite class with virtual functions and a  separately designed  Displayed class with virtual functions. You provided your own satellites and your own displayed objects through derivation.  In particular, you had to override Satellite vir- tual member functions and Displayed virtual member functions to specify the behavior of your own objects.  That is the situation in which multiple inheritance of base classes with state and imple- mentation is hard to avoid.  Workarounds can be painful and hard to maintain.  The use of multiple inheritance to ‘‘glue’’ two  otherwise unrelated classes together as part of the implementation of a third class is crude, effective, and relatively important, but not very inter- esting.  Basically, it sav es the programmer from writing a lot of forwarding functions  to compen- sate  for  the  fact  that  we  can  only  override  functions  deﬁned  in  bases . This  technique  does  not affect the overall design of a program signiﬁcantly and can occasionally clash with the wish to keep implementation details hidden. However, a technique doesn’t hav e to be clever to be useful.  I generally prefer to have a single implementation hierarchy and  where needed  several abstract classes providing interfaces.  This is typically more ﬂexible and leads to systems that are easier to ev olve.  However, you can’t always get that – especially if you need to use existing classes that you don’t want to modify  e.g., because they are parts of someone else’s library .  Note that with single inheritance  only , the programmer’s choices for implementing the classes Displayed, Satellite, and Comm_sat would  be  limited. A Comm_sat could  be  a Satellite or  a Dis- played, but not both  unless Satellite was derived from Displayed or vice versa .  Either alternative involves a loss of ﬂexibility.   Section 21.3.2  Multiple Implementation Classes  627  Why would anyone want a class Comm_sat? Contrary to some people’s conjectures, the Satel- lite example is real. There really was – and maybe there still is – a program constructed along the lines used to describe multiple implementation inheritance here. It was used to study the design of communication systems involving satellites, ground stations, etc. In fact, Satellite was derived from an early notion of a concurrent task. Given such a simulation, we can answer questions about com- munication trafﬁc ﬂow,  determine proper responses to a ground station that is being blocked by a rainstorm, consider tradeoffs between satellite connections and Earth-bound connections, etc.  21.3.3  Ambiguity Resolution Tw o base classes may have member functions with the same name. For example:  class Satellite { public:  virtual Debug_info get_debug  ;    ...  class Displayed { public:  virtual Debug_info get_debug  ;    ...  };  };  }  When  a Comm_sat is  used,  these  functions  must  be  disambiguated. This  can  be  done  simply  by qualifying a member name by its class name:  void f Comm_sat& cs  {  Debug_info di = cs.g et_debug  ;  di = cs.Satellite::get_debug  ;  di = cs.Displayed::g et_debug  ;      error :ambiguous    OK    OK  However, explicit disambiguation is messy, so it is usually best to resolve such problems by deﬁn- ing a new function in the derived class:  class Comm_sat : public Satellite, public Displayed { public:  Debug_info get_debug       overr ideComm_sat::get_debug   and Displayed::get_debug   {  Debug_info di1 = Satellite::get_debug  ; Debug_info di2 = Displayed::g et_debug  ; return merge_info di1,di2 ;  }    ...  };  A function declared in a derived class overrides all functions of the same name and type in its base classes.  Typically, that is exactly the right thing to do because it is generally a bad idea to use the same name for operations with different semantics in a single class. The ideal for virtual is for a   628  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  call  to  have  the  same  effect  independently  of  which  interface  was  used  to  ﬁnd  the  function  §20.3.2 .  In the implementation of an overriding function, it is often necessary to explicitly qualify the name to get the right version from a base class. A qualiﬁed name, such as Telstar::draw, can refer to a draw declared either in Telstar or in one of its base classes. For example:  class Telstar : public Comm_sat { public:  void draw   {  Comm_sat::draw  ;     ... own stuff ...  }    ...  };  or graphically:     ﬁnds Displayed::draw  Satellite  Displayed  Comm_sat  Telstar  If Comm_sat::draw doesn’t resolve to a draw declared in Comm_sat, the compiler recursively looks in its base classes; that is, it looks for Satellite::draw and Displayed::draw, and if necessary looks in their  base  classes. If  exactly  one  match  is  found,  that  name  will  be  used. Otherwise, Comm_sat::draw is either not found or is ambiguous.  If, in Telstar::draw  , I had said plain draw  , the result would have been an ‘‘inﬁnite’’ recursive  call of Telstar::draw  .  I could have said Displayed::draw  , but now the code would be subtly broken if someone added a Comm_sat::draw  ; it is generally better to refer to a direct base class than to an indirect base class. I could  have  said Comm_sat::Displayed::draw  , but  that  would  have  been  redundant. Had  I  said Satellite::draw  , the  result  would  have  been  an  error  because  the draw is  over on the Displayed branch of the class hierarchy.  The get_debug   example  basically  assumes  that  at  least  some  parts  of Satellite and Displayed have been designed together. Getting an exact match of names, return types, argument types, and semantics by accident is extremely unlikely. It is far more likely that similar functionality is pro- vided in different ways so that it takes effort to merge it into something that can be used together. We  might  originally  have  been  presented  with  two classes SimObj and Widget that  we  could  not modify, didn’t exactly provide what we needed, and where they did provide what we needed, did so through incompatible interfaces.  In that case, we might have designed Satellite and Displayed as our interface classes, providing a ‘‘mapping layer’’ for our higher-level classes to use:   Section 21.3.3  Ambiguity Resolution  629     map SimObj facilities to something easier to use for Satellite simulation     call SimObj::DBinf   and extract infor mation     map Widget facilities to something easier to use to displaySatellite simulation results     read Widget data and compose Debug_info  class Satellite : public SimObj {  public:  virtual Debug_info get_debug  ;     ...  class Displayed : public Widget {  public:  virtual Debug_info get_debug  ;     ...  or graphically:  SimObj  Widg et  Satellite  Displayed  Comm_sat  Telstar  Interestingly  enough,  this  is  exactly  the  technique  we  would  use  to  disambiguate  in  the  unlikely case  where  two base  classes  provided  operations  with  exactly  the  same  name,  but  with  different semantics:  add  an  interface  layer. Consider  the  classical   but  mostly  hypothetical theoretical  example of a class of a draw   member function in a video game involving cowboys:  class Window { public:  void draw  ;     ...  class Cowboy { public:  void draw  ;     ...     displayimage     pull gun from holster  class Cowboy_window : public Cowboy, public Window {     ...  How do we override Cowboy::draw   and Window::draw  ? These two functions have radically dif- ferent meanings  semantics  but are identical in name and type; we need to override them by two  };  };  };  };  };   630  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  separate functions. There is no direct language solution to this  exotic  problem, but adding inter- mediate classes will do:  struct WWindow : Window {  using Window::Window;  virtual void win_draw   = 0; void draw   override ﬁnal { win_draw  ; }     inheritconstr uctors    force derived class to overr ide    displayimage  struct CCowboy : Cowboy{  using Cowboy::Cowboy;  virtual void cow_draw   = 0; void draw   override ﬁnal { cow_draw  ; }     inheritconstr uctors    force derived class to overr ide     pull gun from holster  };  };  };  class Cowboy_window : public CCowboy, public WWindow { public:  void cow_draw   override; void win_draw   override;    ...  Or graphically:  Window  Cowboy  WWindow  CCowboy  Cowboy_window  Had  the  designer  of Window been  a  bit  more  careful  and  speciﬁed draw   to  be const, the  whole problem would have evaporated.  I ﬁnd that fairly typical.  21.3.4  Repeated Use of a Base Class When each class has only one direct base class, the class hierarchy will be a tree, and a class can only occur once in the tree. When a class can have multiple base classes, a class can appear multi- ple times in the resulting hierarchy.  Consider a class providing facilities for storing state in a ﬁle  e.g., for breakpointing, debug information, or persistence  and restoring it later:  struct Storable {     persistent storage  virtual string get_ﬁle   = 0; virtual void read   = 0; virtual void write   = 0;  virtual ˜Storable   { }  };  Such a useful class will naturally be used in several places in a class hierarchy.  For example:   Section 21.3.4  Repeated Use of a Base Class  631  class Transmitter : public Storable { public:  void write   override;    ...  class Receiver : public Storable { public:  void write   override;    ...  class Radio : public Transmitter, public Receiver { public:  string get_ﬁle   override; void read   override; void write   override;    ...  Given that, we could imagine two cases:  [1]  A Radio object  has  two subobjects  of  class Storable  one  for Transmitter and  one  for  Receiver .  [2]  A Radio object has one subobject of class Storable  shared by Transmitter and Receiver .  The  default,  provided  for  the  example  as  written,  is  two subobjects.  Unless you  state  otherwise, you get one copy for each time you mention a class as a base. Graphically, we can represent that like this:  Storable  Storable  Transmitter  Receiver  Radio  A virtual function of a replicated base class can be overridden by a  single  function in a derived class.  Typically, an overriding function calls its base class versions and then does the work speciﬁc to the derived class:  void Radio::write   {  Transmitter::write  ; Receiver::write  ;    ... write radio-speciﬁc infor mation...  Casting from a replicated base class to a derived class is discussed in §22.2.

The reason for that is simply that Storable is an abstract class providing a pure interface.  A Storable object holds no data of its own.  This is the simplest case and the  one  that  offers  the  best  separation  of  interface  and  implementation  concerns. In  fact,  a  class could not without some difﬁculty determine that there were two Storable subobjects on a Radio.  What if Storable did hold data and it was important that it should not be replicated? For exam-  ple, we might deﬁne Storable to hold the name of the ﬁle to be used for storing the object:  Given this apparently minor change to Storable, we must change the design of Radio. All parts of an  object  must  share  a  single  copy of Storable. Otherwise,  we  could  get  two parts  of  something derived from Storable multiple times using different ﬁles. We avoid replication by declaring a base virtual: every virtual base of a derived class is represented by the same  shared  object. For exam- ple:  class Storable { public:  Storable const string& s ; virtual void read   = 0; virtual void write   = 0; virtual ˜Storable  ;  protected:  string ﬁle_name;     store in ﬁle named s  Storable const Storable&  = delete; Storable& operator= const Storable&  = delete;  };  };  };  };  class Transmitter : public virtual Storable { public:  void write   override;    ...  class Receiver : public virtual Storable { public:  void write   override;    ...  class Radio : public Transmitter, public Receiver { public:  void write   override;    ...  Or graphically:   Section 21.3.5  Virtual Base Classes  633  Receiver  Transmitter  Storable  Radio  Compare  this  diagram  with  the  drawing  of  the Storable object  in  §21.3.4  to  see  the  difference between ordinary inheritance and virtual inheritance. In an inheritance graph, every base class of a given name that is speciﬁed to be virtual will be represented by a single object of that class. On the other hand, each base class not speciﬁed virtual will have its own subobject representing it.  Why would someone want to use a virtual base containing data? I can think of three obvious  ways for two classes in a class hierarchy to share data:  [1]  Make the data nonlocal  outside the class as a global or namespace variable . [2]  Put the data in a base class. [3]  Allocate an object somewhere and give each of the two classes a pointer.  Option [1], nonlocal data, is usually a poor choice because we cannot control what code accesses the data and how.  It breaks all notions of encapsulation and locality.  Option [2], put the data in a base class, is usually the simplest. However, for single inheritance that solution makes useful data  and functions  ‘‘bubble up’’ to a  common base class; often it ‘‘bub- bles’’ all the way to the root of an inheritance tree. This means that every member of the class hier- archy gets access. That is logically very similar to using nonlocal data and suffers from the same problems.  So we need a common base that is not the root of a tree – that is, a virtual base.  Option [3], sharing an object accessed through pointers, makes sense. However, then construc- tor s   need  to  set  aside  memory  for  that  shared  object,  initialize  it,  and  provide  pointers  to  the shared object to objects needing access. That is roughly what constructors do to implement a vir- tual base.  If you don’t need sharing, you can do without virtual bases, and your code is often better and typically simpler for it. However, if you do need sharing within a general class hierarchy, you basi- cally have a choice between using a virtual base and laboriously constructing your own variants of the idea.  We can represent an object of a class with a virtual base like this:  Receiver  Transmitter  Radio  Storable   634  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  The ‘‘pointers’’ to the shared object representing the virtual base, Storable, will be offsets, and often one  of  those  can  be  optimized  away by placing Storable in  a  ﬁxed  position  relative  to either  the Receiver or the Transmitter subobject.  Expect a storage overhead of one word for each virtual base.  21.3.5.1  Constructing Virtual Bases  Using virtual bases you can create complicated lattices. Naturally, we would prefer to keep the lat- tices simple, but however complicated we make them, the language ensures that a constructor of a virtual base is called exactly once. Furthermore, the constructor of a base  whether virtual or not  is called before its derived classes.  Anything else would cause chaos  that is, an object might be used before it had been initialized . To  avoid such chaos, the constructor of every virtual base is invoked  implicitly or explicitly  from the constructor for the complete object  the constructor for the most derived class .  In particular, this ensures that a virtual base is constructed exactly once ev en if it is mentioned in many places in the class hierarchy.  For example:  struct V {  V int i ;    ...  struct A { A  ;     ...     default constructor  struct B : virtual V, vir tual A {  B   :V{1} {  * ...*  };    ...     default constructor ;must initializebase V  class C : virtual V { public:  C int i  : V{i} {  * ...*  };    ...     must initializebase V  class D : virtual public B, virtual public C {     implicitly gets the virtual base V from B and C    implicitly gets virtual base A from B  public:  D   {  * ...*  } D int i  :C{i} {  * ...*  }; D int i, int j  :V{i}, C{j} {  * ...*  }    ...     error :no default constructor for C or V    error :no default constructor for V     OK  };  };  };  };  };  Note that D can and must provide an initializer for V. The fact that V wasn’t explicitly mentioned as a base of D is irrelevant.  Knowledge of a virtual base and the obligation to initialize it ‘‘bubbles up’’ to the most derived class.  A virtual base is always considered a direct base of its most derived   Section 21.3.5.1  Constructing Virtual Bases  635  class.  The fact that both B and C initialized V is irrelevant because the compiler has no idea which of those two initializers to prefer. Thus, only the initializer provided by the most derived class is used.  The constructor for a virtual base is called before the constructors for its derived classes. In practice, this is not quite as localized as we would prefer. In particular, if we derive another class, DD, from D, then DD has  to  do  work  to  initialize  the  virtual  bases. Unless  we  can  simply inherit D’s  constructors   §20.3.5.1 ,  that  can  be  a  nuisance. That  ought  to  encourage  us  not  to overuse virtual base classes.  This logical problem with constructors does not exist for destructors. They are simply invoked in reverse order of construction  §20.2.2 . In particular, a destructor for a virtual base is invoked exactly once.  21.3.5.2  Calling a Virtual Class Member Once Only  When deﬁning the functions for a class with a virtual base, the programmer in general cannot know whether  the  base  will  be  shared  with  other  derived classes.  This can  be  a  problem  when  imple- menting  a  service  that  requires  a  base  class  function  to  be  called  exactly  once  for  each  call  of  a derived function.  Where needed, the programmer can simulate the scheme used for constructors by calling  a  virtual  base  class  function  only  from  the  most  derived class.  For  example,  assume  we have a basic Window class that knows how to draw its contents:  In addition, we have various ways of decorating a window and adding facilities:  class Window { public:     basic stuff virtual void draw  ;  };  };  };  class Window_with_border : public virtual Window {     border stuff  protected:  public:  void draw   override;  void own_draw  ;      displaythe border  class Window_with_menu : public virtual Window {     menustuff  protected:  void own_draw  ;      displaythe menu  public:  void draw   override;  The own_draw   functions need not be virtual because they are meant to be called from within a vir- tual draw   function that ‘‘knows’’ the type of the object for which it was called.  From this, we can compose a plausible Clock class:   636  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  class Clock : public Window_with_border, public Window_with_menu {  void own_draw  ;      displaythe clockface and hands     clockstuff  protected:  void draw   override;  public:  };  or graphically:  Window_with_border  Window_with_menu  Window  Clock  The draw   functions  can  now be deﬁned  using  the own_draw   functions,  so  that  a  caller  of  any draw   gets Window::draw   invoked exactly once. This is done independently of the kind of Window for which draw   is invoked:  void Window_with_border::draw   {  Window::draw  ; own_draw  ;      displaythe border  void Window_with_menu::draw   {  Window::draw  ; own_draw  ;      displaythe menu  void Clock::draw   {  Window::draw  ; Window_with_border::own_draw  ; Window_with_menu::own_draw  ; own_draw  ;      displaythe clockface and hands  }  }  }  Note that a qualiﬁed call, such as Window::draw  , does not use the virtual call mechanism. Instead, it directly calls the explicitly named function, thus avoiding nasty inﬁnite recursion.  Casting from a virtual base class to a derived class is discussed in §22.2.  21.3.6  Replicated vs. Virtual Bases Using multiple inheritance to provide implementations for abstract classes representing pure inter- faces affects the way a program is designed. Class BB_ival_slider  §21.2.3  is an example:   Section 21.3.6  Replicated vs. Virtual Bases  637  class BB_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider, protected BBslider     interface    implementation  {  };     implementation of functions required byIval_slider and BBslider,using facilities from BBslider  In  this  example,  the  two base  classes  play  logically  distinct  roles. One  base  is  a  public  abstract class providing the interface, and the other is a protected concrete class providing implementation ‘‘details.’’  These roles are reﬂected in both the style of the classes and in the access control  §20.5  provided.  The use of multiple inheritance is close to essential here because the derived class needs to override virtual functions from both the interface and the implementation.  For example, consider again the Ival_box classes from §21.2.1. In the end  §21.2.2 , I made all the Ival_box classes abstract to reﬂect their role as pure interfaces.  Doing that allowed me to place all implementation details in speciﬁc implementation classes. Also, all sharing of implementation details was done in the classical hierarchy of the windows system used for the implementation.  When using an abstract class  without any shared data  as an interface, we have a choice:  cid:129  Replicate the interface class  one object per mention in the class hierarchy .  cid:129  Make the interface class virtual to share a simple object among all classes in the hierarchy  that mention it.  Using Ival_slider as a virtual base gives us:  class BB_ival_slider  : public virtual Ival_slider, protected BBslider {  * ...*  };  class Popup_ival_slider  : public virtual Ival_slider {  * ...*  };  class BB_popup_ival_slider  : public virtual Popup_ival_slider, protected BB_ival_slider {  * ...*  };  or graphically:  Ival_slider  BBslider  Popup_ival_slider  BB_ival_slider  BB_popup_ival_slider  It is easy to imagine further interfaces derived from Popup_ival_slider and further implementation classes derived from such classes and BB_popup_ival_slider.  However, we also have this alternative using replicated Ival_slider objects:  class BB_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider, protected BBslider {  * ...*  };  class Popup_ival_slider  : public Ival_slider {  * ...*  };  class BB_popup_ival_slider  : public Popup_ival_slider, protected BB_ival_slider {  * ...*  };   638  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  or graphically:  Ival_slider  Ival_slider  BBslider  Popup_ival_slider  BB_ival_slider  BB_popup_ival_slider  Surprisingly, there are no fundamental run-time or space advantages to one design over the other. There  are  logical  differences,  though. In  the  replicated Ival_slider design,  a BB_popup_ival_slider can’t be implicitly converted to an Ival_slider  because that would be ambiguous :  void f Ival_slider∗ p ;  void g BB_popup_ival_slider∗ p  {  f p ;     error :Popup_ival_slider ::Ival_slider or BB_ival_slider ::Ival_slider?  On the other hand, it is possible to construct plausible scenarios where the sharing implied in the virtual base design causes ambiguities for casts from the base class  §22.2 . However, such ambi- guities are easily dealt with.  How do we choose between virtual base classes and replicated base classes for our interfaces? Most  often,  of  course,  we  don’t get  a  choice  because  we  have  to conform  to  an  existing  design. When we do have a choice, we can take into account that  surprisingly  the replicated base solution tends  to  lead  to  slightly  smaller  objects   because  there  is  no  need  for  data  structures  supporting sharing  and that we often get our interface objects from ‘‘virtual constructors’’ or ‘‘factory func- tions’’  §21.2.4 .  For example:  Popup_ival_slider∗ popup_slider_factory args  {     ... return new BB_popup_ival_slider args ;    ...  }  }  No explicit conversion is needed to get from an implementation  here, BB_popup_ival_slider  to its direct interfaces  here, Popup_ival_slider .  21.3.6.1  Overriding Virtual Base Functions  A derived class can override a virtual function of its direct or indirect virtual base class. In particu- lar, two  different  classes  might  override  different  virtual  functions  from  the  virtual  base. In  that way,  sev eral derived classes can contribute implementations to the interface presented by a virtual base class. For example, the Window class might have  functions set_color   and prompt  . In that case, Window_with_border might  override set_color   as  part  of  controlling  the  color  scheme,  and Window_with_menu might override prompt   as part of its control of user interactions:   Section 21.3.6.1  Overriding Virtual Base Functions  639  };  };  };  };  };  class Window {     ... virtual void set_color Color  = 0; virtual void prompt   = 0;     set background color  class Window_with_border : public virtual Window {     ... void set_color Color  override;      control background color  class Window_with_menu : public virtual Window {     ... void prompt   override;      control user interactions  class My_window : public Window_with_menu, public Window_with_border {     ...  What if different derived classes override the same function? This is allowed if and only if some overriding class is derived from every other class that overrides the function. That is, one function must override all others. For example, My_window could override prompt   to improve on what Win- dow_with_menu provides:  class My_window : public Window_with_menu, public Window_with_border {     ... void prompt   override;      don’t leave user interactions to base  or graphically:  Window_with_border { set_color   }  Window_with_menu { prompt   }  Window { set_color  , prompt   }  My_window { prompt   }  If two classes override a base class function, but neither overrides the other, the class hierarchy is an error. The reason is that no single function can be used to give a consistent meaning for all calls independently of which class they use as an interface.  Or, using implementation terminology, no virtual  function  table  can  be  constructed  because  a  call  to  that  function  on  the  complete  object would be ambiguous. For example, had Radio in §21.3.5 not declared write  , the declarations of write   in Receiver and Transmitter would have caused an error when deﬁning Radio. As with Radio, such a conﬂict is resolved by adding an overriding function to the most derived class.  A class that provides some – but not all – of the implementation for a virtual base class is often  called a mixin.   640  Class Hierarchies   Chapter 21  21.4  Advice [1]  Use unique_ptr or shared_ptr to avoid forgetting to delete objects created using new; §21.2.1.

Such a class lattice is often called a class hierarchy. We try to design classes so that users need not be unduly concerned about the way a class is composed out of other classes. In particular, the virtual call mechanism ensures that when we call a function f   on an object, the same function is called whichever class in the hierarchy pro- vided the declaration of f   used for the call and whichever class deﬁned it. This chapter explains how to gain information about the total object given only the interface provided by a base class.   642  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  22.2  Class Hierarchy Navigation A plausible use of the Ival_boxes deﬁned in §21.2 would be to hand them to a system that controlled a screen and have that system hand objects back to the application program whenever some activity had occurred. We  will refer to the combination of GUI library and operating system facilities that control the screen as the system. Objects passed back and forth between the system and the appli- cation  are  commonly  referred  to  as widgets or controls. This  is  how many user  interfaces  work. From a language point of view, it is important that the system does not know about our Ival_boxes. The system’s interfaces are speciﬁed in terms of the system’s own classes and objects rather than our application’s classes.  This is necessary and proper. Howev er, it does have the unpleasant effect that we lose information about the type of objects passed to the system and later returned to us.  Recovering the ‘‘lost’’ type of an object requires us to somehow ask the object to reveal its type. Any operation  on  an  object  requires  us  to  have  a  pointer  or  reference  of  a  suitable  type  for  the object.  Consequently, the most obvious and useful operation for inspecting the type of an object at run time is a type conversion operation that returns a valid pointer if the object is of the expected type  and  a  null  pointer  if  it  isn’t.  The dynamic_cast operator  does  exactly  that. For example, assume that ‘‘the system’’ inv okes my_event_handler   with a pointer to a BBwindow, where an activ- ity has occurred. I then might invoke my application code using Ival_box’s do_something  :  void my_event_handler BBwindow∗ pw  {  if  auto pb = dynamic_cast  pw   {    does pw point to an Ival_box?     ... int x = pb−>get_value  ;     use the Ival_box    ...     ... oops! cope with unexpected event ...  } else {  }  }  One way of explaining what is going on here is that dynamic_cast translates from the implementa- tion-oriented language of the user-interface system to the language of the application. It is impor- tant to note what is not mentioned in this example: the actual type of the object. The object will be a particular kind of Ival_box, say, an Ival_slider, implemented by a particular kind of BBwindow, say, a BBslider. It is neither necessary nor desirable to make the actual type of the object explicit in this interaction between ‘‘the system’’ and the application. An interface exists to represent the essen- tials of an interaction. In particular, a well-designed interface hides inessential details.  Graphically, the action of pb=dynamic_cast  pw  can be represented like this:  pw  BBwindow  Ival_box  pb  BBslider  Ival_slider  BB_ival_slider   Section 22.2  Class Hierarchy Navigation   643  The arrows from pw and pb represent the pointers into the object passed, whereas the rest of the arrows represent the inheritance relationships between the different parts of the object passed.  The use of type information at run time is conventionally referred to as ‘‘run-time type informa-  tion,’’ often abbreviated to RTTI.  Casting from a base class to a derived class is often called a downcast because of the convention of drawing inheritance trees growing from the root down.  Similarly, a cast from a derived class to a base is called an upcast. A cast that goes from a base to a sibling class, like the cast from BBwin- dow to Ival_box, is called a crosscast.  22.2.1 dynamic_cast The dynamic_cast operator takes two operands: a type bracketed by  , and a pointer or refer- ence bracketed by   and  . Consider ﬁrst the pointer case:  If p is of type T∗ or of a type D∗ where T is a base class of D, the result is exactly as if we had sim- ply assigned p to a T∗. For example:  class BB_ival_slider : public Ival_slider, protected BBslider {  dynamic_cast  p      ...  };  void f BB_ival_slider∗ p  {  Ival_slider∗ pi1 = p; Ival_slider∗ pi2 = dynamic_cast  p ;      OK    OK  BBslider∗ pbb1 = p; BBslider∗ pbb2 = dynamic_cast  p ;      error :BBslider is a protected base    OK: pbb2 becomes nullptr  }  This   the  upcast   is  the  uninteresting  case. However,  it is reassuring  to  know that dynamic_cast doesn’t allow accidental violation of the protection of private and protected base classes. Since a dynamic_cast used as an upcast is exactly like a simple assignment, it implies no overhead and is sensitive to its lexical context.  The purpose of dynamic_cast is to deal with the case in which the correctness of the conversion cannot be determined by the compiler. In that case, dynamic_cast  p  looks at the object pointed to by p  if any .  If that object is of class T or has a unique base class of type T, then dynamic_cast returns a pointer of type T∗ to that object; otherwise, nullptr is returned. If the value of p is nullptr, dynamic_cast  p  returns nullptr. Note the requirement that the conversion must be to a uniquely identiﬁed  object. It  is  possible  to  construct  examples  where  the  conversion  fails  and nullptr is returned because the object pointed to by p has more than one subobject representing bases of type T  §22.2 .  A dynamic_cast requires a pointer or a reference to a polymorphic type in order to do a down-  cast or a crosscast. For example:   644  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  class My_slider: public Ival_slider {     polymor phicbase  Ival_slider has virtual functions   class My_date : public Date {     base not polymorphic  Date has no virtual functions   void g Ival_box∗ pb, Date∗ pd  {  My_slider∗ pd1 = dynamic_cast  pb ;  My_date∗ pd2 = dynamic_cast  pd ;      OK    error :Date not polymorphic  Requiring  the  pointer’s type  to  be  polymorphic  simpliﬁes  the  implementation  of dynamic_cast because it makes it easy to ﬁnd a place to hold the necessary information about the object’s type.  A typical implementation will attach a ‘‘type information object’’  §22.5  to an object by placing a pointer  to  the  type  information  in  the  virtual  function  table  for  the  object’s class   §3.2.3 . For example:  vtbl:  type_info:  "My_slider"  bases  type_info:  "Ival_slider"  My_slider::get_value    The dashed arrow represents an offset that allows the start of the complete object to be found given only a pointer to a polymorphic subobject. It is clear that dynamic_cast can be efﬁciently imple- mented.  All that is involved are a few comparisons of type_info objects representing base classes; no expensive lookups or string comparisons are needed.  Restricting dynamic_cast to polymorphic types also makes sense from a logical point of view. That is, if an object has no virtual functions, it cannot safely be manipulated without knowledge of its exact type. Consequently, care should be taken not to get such an object into a context in which its type isn’t known.  If its type is known, we don’t need to use dynamic_cast.  The target type of dynamic_cast need not be polymorphic. This allows us to wrap a concrete type in a polymorphic type, say, for transmission through an object I O system  §22.2.4 , and then ‘‘unwrap’’ the concrete type later. For example:  class Io_obj {     base class for object I O system  virtual Io_obj∗ clone   = 0;     ...     ...  My_slider:  ... vptr ...  };  };  }  };   Section 22.2.1  dynamic_cast  645  class Io_date : public Date, public Io_obj { };  void f Io_obj∗ pio  {  Date∗ pd = dynamic_cast  pio ;    ...  }  }  A dynamic_cast to void∗ can be used to determine the address of the beginning of an object of poly- morphic type. For example:  void g Ival_box∗ pb, Date∗ pd  {  void∗ pb2 = dynamic_cast  pb ;  void∗ pd2 = dynamic_cast  pd ;      OK    error :Date not polymorphic  The object representing a base class, such as Ival_box, in a derived class object is not necessarily the ﬁrst subobject in that object of the most derived class.  So, pb does not necessarily hold the same address as pb2.  Such  casts  are  only  useful  for  interaction  with  very  low-level functions   only  such  functions deal with void∗s .  There is no dynamic_cast from void∗  because there would be no way of knowing where to ﬁnd the vptr; §22.2.3 .  22.2.1.1 dynamic_cast to Reference  To  get  polymorphic  behavior, an object  must  be  manipulated  through  a  pointer  or  a  reference. When a dynamic_cast is used for a pointer type, a nullptr indicates failure.  That is neither feasible nor desirable for references.  Given a pointer result, we must consider the possibility that the result is nullptr, that is, that the pointer doesn’t point to an object. Consequently, the result of a dynamic_cast of a pointer should always be explicitly tested. For a pointer p, dynamic_cast  p  can be seen as the question ‘‘Is the object pointed to by p, if any, of type T?’’ For example:  if  Ival_slider∗ is = dynamic_cast  p   {     does p point to an Ival_slider?  void fp Ival_box∗ p  {     ... use is ...  } else {  }  }     ... *p not a slider;handle alternatives ...  On the other hand, we may legitimately assume that a reference refers to an object  §7.7.4 . Conse- quently, dynamic_cast  r  of a reference r is not a question but an assertion: ‘‘The object referred to by r is of type T.’’ The result of a dynamic_cast for a reference is implicitly tested by the imple- mentation  of dynamic_cast itself.  If the  operand  of  a dynamic_cast to  a  reference  isn’t of the expected type, a bad_cast exception is thrown.  For example:   646  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  void fr Ival_box& r  {  }  Ival_slider& is = dynamic_cast  r ;     ... use is ...     rreferences an Ival_slider!  The  difference  in  results  of  a  failed  dynamic  pointer  cast  and  a  failed  dynamic  reference  cast reﬂects a fundamental difference between references and pointers. If a user wants to protect against bad casts to references, a suitable handler must be provided.  For example:  void g BB_ival_slider& slider, BB_ival_dial& dial  {  try {  fp &slider ;  fr slider ;  fp &dial ;  fr dial ;      pointer to BB_ival_slider passed as Ival_box*    reference to BB_ival_slider passed as Ival_box&    pointer to BB_ival_dial passed as Ival_box*    dial passed as Ival_box  } catch  bad_cast  {     ...     §30.4.1.1  }  }  The calls to fp   and the ﬁrst call to fr   will return normally  assuming that fp   really can cope with a BB_ival_dial , but the second call of fr   will cause a bad_cast exception that will be caught by g  . Explicit  tests  against nullptr can  easily  be  accidentally  omitted. If  that  worries  you,  you  can  write a conversion function that throws an exception instead of returning nullptr in case of failure.  22.2.2  Multiple Inheritance When only single inheritance is used, a class and its base classes constitute a tree rooted in a single base class. This is simple but often constraining. When multiple inheritance is used, there is no single root. In itself, this doesn’t complicate matters much. However, if a class appears more than once in a hierarchy,  we must be a bit careful when we refer to the object or objects that represent that class.  Naturally, we try  to  keep  hierarchies  as  simple  as  our  application  allows   and  no  simpler . However,  once  a  nontrivial  hierarchy has  been  constructed,  we  sometimes  need  to  navigate  it  to ﬁnd a speciﬁc class to use. This need occurs in two variants:   cid:129  Sometimes, we want to explicitly name a base class for use as an interface, for example, to resolve an ambiguity  or  to  call  a  speciﬁc  function  without  relying  on  the  virtual  function mechanism  an explicitly qualiﬁed call; §21.3.3 .   cid:129  Sometimes,  we  want  to  obtain  a  pointer  to  a  subobject  of  a  hierarchy giv en a pointer  to another, for example, to get a pointer to the complete derived class object from a pointer to a base  a downcast; §22.2.1  or to get a pointer to a base class object from a pointer to another base  a crosscast; §22.2.4 .  Here, we consider how to navigate a class hierarchy using type conversions  casts  to gain a pointer of the desired type. To illustrate the mechanisms available and the rules that guide them, consider a lattice containing both a replicated base and a virtual base:   Section 22.2.2  Multiple Inheritance  647  : public virtual Storable {  * ...*  };  class Component  class Receiver  class Transmitter  class Radio  : public Component {  * ...*  };  : public Component {  * ...*  };  : public Receiver, public Transmitter {  * ...*  };  or graphically:  Component  Component  Receiver  Transmitter  Storable  Radio  Here, a Radio object has two subobjects of class Component. Consequently, a dynamic_cast from Storable to Component within a Radio will be ambiguous and return a 0. There is simply no way of knowing which Component the programmer wanted:  void h1 Radio& r  {     aRadio has a unique Storable  Storable∗ ps = &r;    ... Component∗ pc = dynamic_cast  ps ;     ...  }     pc = 0; a Radio has twoComponents  In general – and typically – a programmer  and a compiler looking at a single translation unit  does not know the complete class lattice. Instead, code is written with the knowledge of some sublattice. For example, a programmer might know only about the Transmitter part of a Radio and write:  void h2 Storable∗ ps   {     ps might or might not point to a Component  if  Component∗ pc = dynamic_cast  ps   {     we haveacomponent!  } else {  }  }     it wasn’t a Component  The ambiguity for a pointer to a Radio object is not in general detectable at compile time.  This kind of run-time ambiguity detection is needed only for virtual bases. For ordinary bases, there is always a unique subobject of a given cast  or none  when downcasting  that is, toward a   648  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  derived class; §22.2 . The equivalent ambiguity for virtual bases occurs when upcasting  that is, toward a base , but such ambiguities are caught at compile time.  22.2.3 static_cast and dynamic_cast A dynamic_cast can cast from a polymorphic virtual base class to a derived class or a sibling class  §22.2.1 .  A static_cast  §11.5.2  does not examine the object it casts from, so it cannot:  void g Radio& r  {  Receiver∗ prec = &r; Radio∗ pr = static_cast  prec ;     OK, unchecked pr = dynamic_cast  prec ;      OK, run-time checked     Receiver is an ordinarybase of Radio  Storable∗ ps = &r; pr = static_cast  ps ;  pr = dynamic_cast  ps ;      Storable is a virtual base of Radio    error :cannot cast from virtual base    OK, run-time checked  }  }  The dynamic_cast requires a polymorphic operand because there is no information stored in a non- polymorphic object that can be used to ﬁnd the objects for which it represents a base. In particular, an object of a type with layout constraints determined by some other language – such as Fortran or C – may be used as a virtual base class. For objects of such types, only static type information will be available.  However, the information needed to provide run-time type identiﬁcation includes the information needed to implement the dynamic_cast.  Why would anyone want to use a static_cast for class hierarchy navigation?  There is a run-time cost associated with the use of a dynamic_cast  §22.2.1 .  More signiﬁcantly, there are millions of lines of code that were written before dynamic_cast became available.  This code relies on alterna- tive  ways  of  making  sure  that  a  cast  is  valid,  so  the  checking  done  by dynamic_cast is  seen  as redundant.  However, such code is typically written using the C-style cast  §11.5.3 ; often obscure errors remain. Where possible, use the safer dynamic_cast.  The  compiler  cannot  assume  anything  about  the  memory  pointed  to  by  a void∗. This  implies that dynamic_cast – which must look into an object to determine its type – cannot cast from a void∗. For that, a static_cast is needed. For example:  Radio∗ f1 void∗ p  {  Storable∗ ps = static_cast  p ;  return dynamic_cast  ps ;     trustthe programmer  Both dynamic_cast and static_cast respect const and access controls. For example:  class Users : private set  {  * ...*  };  void f2 Users∗ pu, const Receiver∗ pcr  {  static_cast ∗> pu ;  dynamic_cast ∗> pu ;      error :access violation    error :access violation   Section 22.2.3  static_cast and dynamic_cast  649  static_cast  pcr ;  dynamic_cast  pcr ;      error :can’t cast awayconst    error :can’t cast awayconst  Receiver∗ pr = const_cast  pcr ;     ...     OK  }  It  is  not  possible  to  cast  to  a  private  base  class  using static_cast or reinterpret_cast, and  ‘‘casting aw ay const’’   or volatile  requires a const_cast  §11.5.2 .  Even then, using the result is safe only provided the object wasn’t originally declared const  or volatile   §16.2.9 .  22.2.4  Recovering an Interface From a design perspective, dynamic_cast  §22.2.1  can be seen as a mechanism for asking an object if it provides a given interface.  As an example, consider a simple object I O system. Users want to read objects from a stream,  determine that they are of the expected types, and then use them. For example:  void user   {  } else {  }  }     ... open ﬁle assumed to hold shapes,and attach ss as an istream for that ﬁle ...  unique_ptr  p {get_obj ss };    read object from stream  if  auto sp = dynamic_cast  p.get     {  sp−>draw  ;     ...     use the Shape     oops: non-shape in Shape ﬁle  The function user   deals with shapes exclusively through the abstract class Shape and can therefore use every kind of shape. The use of dynamic_cast is essential because the object I O system can deal with many other kinds of objects, and the user may accidentally have opened a ﬁle containing perfectly good objects of classes that the user has never heard of.  I used unique_ptr   §5.2.1, §34.3.1  so that I would not forget to delete the object allo-  cated by get_obj  .  This  object  I O  system  assumes  that  every  object  read  or  written  is  of  a  class  derived from Io_obj. Class Io_obj must be a polymorphic type to allow the user of get_obj   to use dynamic_cast to recover the ‘‘true type’’ of a returned object. For example:  class Io_obj { public:  };  virtual Io_obj∗ clone   const =0; virtual ˜Io_obj   {}     polymor phic   650  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  The critical function in the object I O system is get_obj  , which reads data from an istream and cre- ates  class  objects  based  on  that  data. Assume  that  the  data  representing  an  object  on  an  input stream  is  preﬁxed  by  a  string  identifying  the  object’s class.  The job  of get_obj   is  to  read  that string and call a function capable of reading and creating an object of the right class. For example:  using Pf = Io_obj∗ istream& ;      pointer to function returning an Io_obj*  map  io_map;     maps strings to creation functions  string get_word istream& is ;     read a word from is; throwRead_error if the read failed  Io_obj∗ get_obj istream& is  {  string str = get_word is ;  if  auto f = io_map[str]   return f is ;  throw Unknown_class{};      read initial word    look up str to get function    call function    no match for str  }  };  };  The map called io_map holds pairs of name strings and functions that can construct objects of the class with that name.  We could derive class Shape from Io_obj as needed by user  :  class Shape : public Io_obj {     ...  However, it would be more interesting  and in many cases more realistic  to use an already deﬁned Shape  §3.2.4  unchanged:  struct Io_circle : Circle, Io_obj {  Io_circle istream& ;  Io_circle∗ clone   const { return new Io_circle{∗this}; } static Io_obj∗ new_circle istream& is  { return new Io_circle{is}; }    forio_map     initializefrom input stream    use copyconstr uctor  This is an example of how a class can be ﬁtted into a hierarchy using an abstract class with less foresight than would have been required to build it as a node class in the ﬁrst place  §21.2.2 .  The Io_circle istream&  constructor initializes an object with data from its istream argument.  The new_circle   function is the one put into the io_map to make the class known to the object I O sys- tem.  For example:  io_map["Io_circle"]=&Io_circle::new_circle;      somewhere  Other shapes are constructed in the same way:  class Io_triangle : public Triangle , public Io_obj {     ...  };  io_map["Io_triangle"]=&Io_circle::new_triangle;      somewhere   Section 22.2.4  Recovering an Interface  651  If the provision of the object I O scaffolding becomes tedious, a template might help:  Io istream& ;  Io∗ clone   const override { return new Io{∗this}; } static Io∗ new_io istream& is  { return new Io{is}; }     forio_map     initializefrom input stream  template  struct Io : T, Io_obj { public:  Given this, we can deﬁne Io_circle:  using Io_circle = Io ;  We still need to deﬁne Io ::Io istream&  explicitly, though, because it needs to know about the details of Circle. Note that Io ::Io istream&  does not have access to T’s  private or protected data.  The idea is that the transmission format for a type X is what is needed to construct an X using one of X’s constructors.  The information of the stream is not necessarily the sequence of X’s mem- ber values.  The Io template is an example of a way to ﬁt concrete types into a class hierarchy by providing a handle  that  is  a  node  in  that  hierarchy.  It derives from  its  template  parameter  to  allow casting from Io_obj. For example:  Unfortunately, deriving from the template argument precludes using Io for a built-in type:  using Io_date = Io ; using Io_int = Io ;     wrap concrete type    error :cannot derivefrom built-in type  This problem can be handled by making the user’s object a member of Io_obj:  Io istream& ;  Io∗ clone   const override { return new Io{∗this}; } static Io∗ new_io istream& is  { return new Io{is}; }     forio_map     initializefrom input stream  Now we can handle  using Io_int = Io ;     wrap built-in type  Having made the value a member rather than a base, we can no longer directly cast an Io_obj  to an X, so we provide a function to do that:  };  }  };  void f io & ios  {  Shape∗ ps = &ios;    ...  template  struct Io :Io_obj {  T val;   652  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  template  T∗ get_val  Io_obj∗ p  {  if  auto pp = dynamic_cast ∗> p    return &pp−>val;  return nullptr;  The user   function now becomes:  }  void user   {  } else {  }  }     ... open ﬁle assumed to hold shapes,and attach ss as an istream for that ﬁle ...  unique_ptr  p {get_obj ss };    read object from stream  if  auto sp = get_val  p.g et     {  sp−>draw  ;     ...     use the Shape     ... oops: cope with non-shape in Shape ﬁle ...  This simple object I O system does not do everything anyone ever wanted, but it almost ﬁts on a single page and the key mechanisms have many uses.  It is a blueprint for the ‘‘receiver end’’ of a system  for  transmitting  arbitrary  objects  across  a  communication  channel  in  a  type-safe  manner. More generally, these techniques can be used to invoke a function based on a string supplied by a user  and  to  manipulate  objects  of  unknown  type  through  interfaces  discovered  through  run-time type identiﬁcation.  In general, the sender part of such an object I O system will also use RTTI.  Consider:  class Face : public Shape { public:  Shape∗ outline; array  eyes; Shape∗ mouth;     ...  };  To correctly write out the Shape pointed to by outline, we need to ﬁgure out which kind of Shape it is.  That’s a job for typeid    §22.5 .  In general, we must also keep a table of  pointer,unique identi- ﬁer  pairs to be able to transmit linked data structures and to avoid duplicating objects pointed to by more than one pointer  or reference .   Section 22.3  Double Dispatch and Visitors   653  22.3  Double Dispatch and Visitors Classical  object-oriented  programming  is  based  on  selecting  a  virtual  function  based  on  the dynamic type  the type of the most derived class  of an object given only a pointer or a reference to an interface  a base class . In particular, C++ can do this run-time lookup  also called a dynamic dispatch  for one type at a time. In this, C++ resembles Simula and Smalltalk and more recent lan- guages, such as Java and C. Not being able to select a function based on two dynamic types can be a serious limitation. Also, a virtual function must be a member function. This implies that we cannot add a virtual function to a class hierarchy without modifying the base class es  that provides the  interface  and  all  derived classes  that  should  be  affected.  This too  can  be  a  serious  problem. This section describes the basic workarounds for these problems:  §22.3.1  Double Dispatch shows how to select a virtual function based on two types. §22.3.2  Visitors shows how to use double dispatch to add multiple functions to a class hierar-  chy with only a single additional virtual function in the hierarchy.  Most realistic examples of these techniques occur when we deal with data structures, such as vec- tors  or  graphs  or  pointers  to  objects  of  polymorphic  types. In  such  cases,  the  actual  type  of  an object  e.g., a vector element or a graph node  can only be known dynamically by  implicitly or explicitly  inspecting the interface provided by a base class.  22.3.1  Double Dispatch Consider how to select a function based on two arguments.  For example:  void do_someting Shape& s1, Shape& s2  {  if  s1.intersect s2   {     the twoshapes overlap  }    ...  }  We would like this to work for any two classes in the class hierarchy rooted in Shape, such as Circle and Triangle.  The basic strategy is to do a virtual function call to select the right function for s1 and then do a second  call  to  select  the  right  function  for s2. To simplify, I will  leave  out  the  calculation  of whether  the  two shapes  actually  intersect  and  just  write  the  code  skeleton  for  selecting  the  right functions.  First we deﬁne Shape with a function for intersection:  class Circle; class Triangle;  class Shape { public:  };  virtual bool intersect const Shape&  const =0; virtual bool intersect const Circle&  const =0; virtual bool intersect const Triangle&  const =0;  Next we need to deﬁne Circle and Triangle to override those virtual functions:   654  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  };  };  }  class Circle : public Shape { public:  bool intersect const Shape&  const override; virtual bool intersect const Circle&  const override; virtual bool intersect const Triangle&  const override  class Triangle : public Shape { public:  bool intersect const Shape&  const override; virtual bool intersect const Circle&  const override; virtual bool intersect const Triangle&  const override;  Now each class can handle all possible classes in the Shape hierarchy,  so we just have  to decide what should be done for each combination:  bool Circle::intersect const Shape& s  const { return s.intersect ∗this ; } bool Circle::intersect const Circle&  const { cout <<"intersect circle,circle \n"; return true; } bool Circle::intersect const Triangle&  const { cout <<"intersect circle,triangle \n"; return true; }  bool Triangle::intersect const Shape& s  const { return s.intersect ∗this ; } bool Triangle::intersect const Circle&  const { cout <<"intersect triangle ,circle \n"; return true; } bool Triangle::intersect const Triangle&  const { cout <<"intersect triangle ,triangle \n"; return true; }  The  interesting  functions  here  are Circle::intersect const  Shape&  and Triangle::intersect const Shape& . These need to handle a Shape& argument because that argument must refer to a derived class.  The trick technique  is  to  simply  do  a  virtual  call  with  the  arguments  in  the  reverse  order. That done, we are in one of the four functions that can actually do an intersection calculation.  We can test this by making a vector of all pairs of Shape∗ values and calling intersect   for those:  void test Triangle& t, Circle& c  {  vector > vs { {&t,&t}, {&t,&c}, {&c,&t}, {&c,&c} }; for  auto p : vs   p.ﬁrst−>intersect ∗p.second ;  Using Shape∗s ensures that we rely on run-time resolution of the types. We get:  intersect triangle ,triangle  intersect triangle ,circle  intersect circle,triangle  intersect circle,circle   If you consider this elegant, you need to raise your standards, but it gets the task done. As the class hierarchy grows, the need for virtual functions grows exponentially. That is not acceptable in most cases.  Expanding this  to  three  or  more  arguments  is  trivial,  but  tedious. Worst  of  all,  each  new operation  and  each  new derived class  require  a  modiﬁcation  to  every  class  in  the  hierarchy:  this double-dispatch  technique  is  highly  intrusive. Ideally, I would  have  preferred  a  simple inter- cept Shape&,Shape&  function with overriders speciﬁed for the desired combinations of particular   Section 22.3.1  Double Dispatch  655  shapes.  That is possible [Pirkelbauer,2009], but not in C++11.  The  awkwardness  of  double  dispatch  does  not  make the  problem  it  is  trying  to  address  less important.  It is not unusual to want an action, such as intersect x,y , that depends on the types of two  or more  operands. Workarounds abound. For example, ﬁnding the intersection of rectangles is  simple  and  efﬁcient.  So, for  many applications,  people  have  found  it  sufﬁcient  to  deﬁne  a ‘‘bounding box’’ for each shape and then calculate intersections on bounding boxes.  For example:  class Shape { public:  virtual Rectangle box   const = 0;    ...     the rectangle encloses the shape  class Circle : public Shape { public:  Rectangle box   const override;    ...  class Triangle : public Shape { public:  Rectangle box   const override;    ...  };  };  };  }  }  bool intersect const Rectangle&, const Rectangle& ;     simple to calculate  bool intersect const Shape& s1, const Shape& s2  {  return intersect s1.box  ,s2.box   ;  Another technique is to precompute a lookup table for combinations of types [Stroustrup,1994]:  bool intersect const Shape& s1, const Shape& s2  {  auto i = index type_id s1 ,type_id s2  ; return intersect_tbl[i] s1,s2 ;  Variations of this idea are widely used. Many variants use precomputed values stored in objects to speed up type identiﬁcation  §27.4.2 .  22.3.2  Visitors The  visitor  pattern  [Gamma,1994]  is  a  partial  solution  to  the  exponential  growth  of  virtual  func- tions and overriders and the unpleasent intrusiveness of the  too  simple double-dispatch technique. Consider how to apply two  or more  operations to every class in a class hierarchy.  Basically, we will do a double dispatch for a hierarchy of nodes and a hierarchy of operations to select the correct operation for the correct node. The operations are called visitors; here they are deﬁned in   656  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  classes  derived from  class Visitor. The  nodes  are  a  hierarchy of classes  with  a  virtual  function accept   that takes Visitor&s.  For this example, I use a hierarchy of Nodes that describe language constructs, as is common in tools based on abstract syntax trees  ASTs :  class Visitor;  class Node { public:  virtual void accept Visitor&  = 0;  class Expr : public Node { public:  void accept Visitor&  override;  class Stmt : public Node { public:  void accept Visitor&  override;  Node ‘‘visited’’ or the Visitor itself.  itor’s accept  :  void Expr::accept Visitor& v  { v.accept ∗this ; } void Stmt::accept Visitor& v  { v.accept ∗this ; }  The Visitor declares a set of operations:  class Visitor { public:  virtual void accept Expr&  = 0; virtual void accept Stmt&  = 0;  class Do1_visitor : public Visitor {  void accept Expr&  { cout << "do1 to Expr\n"; } void accept Stmt&  { cout << "do1 to Stmt\n"; }  class Do2_visitor : public Visitor {  void accept Expr&  { cout << "do2 to Expr\n"; } void accept Stmt&  { cout << "do2 to Stmt\n"; }  };  };  };  };  };  };  So far, so good: the Node hierarchy simply provides a virtual function accept   that takes a Visitor& argument representing what should be done to a Node of a given type.  I do not use const here, because in general an operation from a Visitor may update either the  Now the Node’s accept   performs the double-dispatch trick and passes the Node itself to the Vis-  We  can then deﬁne sets of operations by deriving from Visitor and overriding its accept   functions. For example:   Section 22.3.2  Visitors   657  We can test by making a vector of pairs of pointers to ensure that run-time type resolution is used:  void test Expr& e, Stmt& s  {  vector > vn {&e,&do1}, {&s,&do1}, {&e,&do2}, {&s,&do2}}; for  auto p : vn   p.ﬁrst−>accept ∗p.second ;  }  We get:  do1 to Expr do1 to Stmt do2 to Expr do2 to Stmt  As opposed to the simple double dispatch, the visitor pattern is heavily used in real-world program- ming.  It is only mildly intrusive  the accept   function , and many variations on the basic idea are used.  However, many operations on class hierarchies are hard to express as visitors. For example, an  operation  that  needs  access  to  multiple  nodes  of  different  types  in  a  graph  cannot  be  trivially implemented as a visitor. So, I consider the visitor pattern an inelegant workaround.  Alternatives exist, for example, [Solodkyy,2012], but not in plain C++11.  Most alternatives to visitors in C++ are based on the idea of explicit iteration over a homoge- neous data structure  e.g., a vector or a graph of nodes containing pointers to polymorphic types . At each element or node, a call of a virtual function can perform the desired operation, or some optimization based on stored data can be applied  e.g., see §27.4.2 .  22.4  Construction and Destruction A class object is more than simply a region of memory  §6.4 . A class object is built from ‘‘raw memory’’ by its constructors, and it reverts to ‘‘raw memory’’ as its destructors are executed.  Con- struction is bottom-up, destruction is top-down, and a class object is an object to the extent that it has been constructed or destroyed.  This order is necessary to ensure that an object is not accessed before it has been initialized. It is unwise to try to access base and member objects early or out of order through ‘‘clever’’ pointer manipulation  §17.2.3 . The order of construction and destruction is reﬂected in the rules for RTTI, exception handling  §13.3 , and virtual functions  §20.3.2 .  It is unwise to rely on details of the order of construction and destruction, but you can observe that order by calling virtual functions, dynamic_cast  §22.2 , or typeid  §22.5  at a point where the object  isn’t complete.  At such  a  point  in  a  constructor, the   dynamic   type  of  the  object  reﬂects only  what  is  constructed  so  far. For  example,  if  the  constructor  for Component in  the  hierarchy from §22.2.2 calls a virtual function, it will invoke a version deﬁned for Storable or Component, but not  one  from Receiver, Transmitter, or Radio. At that  point  of  construction,  the  object  isn’t yet  a Radio. Similarly, calling  a  virtual  function  from  a  destructor  will  reﬂect  only  what  is  still  not destroyed.  It is best to avoid calling virtual functions during construction and destruction.   658  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  22.5  Type Identiﬁcation The dynamic_cast operator  serves  most  needs  for  information  about  the  type  of  an  object  at  run time.  Importantly, it ensures that code written using it works correctly with classes derived from those explicitly mentioned by the programmer. Thus, dynamic_cast preserves ﬂexibility and exten- sibility in a manner similar to virtual functions.  However,  it is occasionally  essential  to  know the  exact  type  of  an  object. For example,  we might like to know the name of the object’s class or its layout. The typeid operator serves this pur- pose by yielding an object representing the type of its operand. Had typeid   been a function, its de- claration would have looked something like this:  class type_info; const type_info& typeid expression ;      pseudo declaration  That is, typeid   returns a reference to a standard-library type called type_info deﬁned in  :   cid:129  Giv en the name of a type as its operand, typeid type_name  returns a reference to a type_info  that represents the type_name; type_name must be a completely deﬁned type  §8.2.2 .   cid:129  Giv en an expression as its operand, typeid expr  returns a reference to a type_info that repre- sents the type of the object denoted by the expr; the expr must refer to a completely deﬁned type  §8.2.2 . If the value of expr is nullptr, typeid expr  throws a std::bad_typeid.  A typeid   can ﬁnd the type of an object referred to by a reference or a pointer:  void f Shape& r, Shape∗ p  {  typeid r ;  typeid ∗p ;  typeid p ;      type of the object referred to byr    type of the object pointed to byp    type of the pointer,that is,Shape*  uncommon, except as a mistake   If the operand of typeid   is a pointer or a reference of a polymorphic type with the value nullptr, typeid   throws a std::bad_typeid. If the operand of typeid   has a nonpolymorphic type or is not an lvalue, the result is determined at compile time without evaluating the operand expression.  If  the  object  denoted  by  a  dereferenced  pointer  or  a  reference  to  a  polymorphic  type,  the type_info returned is that of the most derived class for the object, that is, the type used when the object was deﬁned. For example:  }  };  struct Poly {       polymor phicbase class  virtual void f  ;    ...  struct Non_poly {  * ...*  };    no virtual functions  struct D1  struct D2  : Poly {  * ...*  };  : Non_poly {  * ...*  };   Section 22.5  Type Identiﬁcation  659  void f Non_poly& npr, Poly& pr  {  cout << typeid npr .name   << '\n'; cout << typeid pr .name   << '\n';     writessomething like"Non_poly"    name of Poly or a class derived from Poly  void g   {  }  }  };  D1 d1; D2 d2; f d2,d1 ;  f ∗static_cast  nullptr ,∗static_cast  nullptr  ;      writes"Non_poly D1"     oops!  That  last  call  will  print  just Non_poly  because typeid npr  is  not  evaluated   before  throwing  a bad_typeid.  The deﬁnition of type_info looks like this:  class type_info {     data  public:  virtual ˜type_info  ;      is polymorphic  bool operator== const type_info&  const noexcept;  bool operator!= const type_info&  const noexcept;     can be compared  bool before const type_info&  const noexcept;  size_t hash_code   const noexcept;  const char∗ name   const noexcept;      ordering    foruse byunordered_map and the like    name of type  type_info const type_info&  = delete; type_info& operator= const type_info&  = delete;     prevent copying    prevent copying  The before   function allows type_infos to be sorted.  In particular, it allows type_ids to be used as keys for ordered containers  such as map .  There is no relation between the relationships deﬁned by before and inheritance relationships. The hash_code   function allows type_ids be used as keys for hash tables  such as unordered_map .  It is not guaranteed that there is only one type_info object for each type in the system. In fact, where dynamically linked libraries are used, it can be hard for an implementation to avoid duplicate type_info objects.  Consequently, we should use == on type_info objects to test equality, rather than == on pointers to such objects.  We  sometimes want to know the exact type of an object so as to perform some service on the whole object  and not just on one of its bases . Ideally, such services are presented as virtual func- tions so that the exact type needn’t be known.  In some cases, no common interface can be assumed for  every  object  manipulated,  so  the  detour  through  the  exact  type  becomes  necessary   §22.5.1 . Another, much simpler use has been to obtain the name of a class for diagnostic output:   660  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  include   void g Component∗ p  {  cout << typeid ∗p .name  ;  The  character  representation  of  a  class’s name  is  implementation-deﬁned. This  C-style  string resides in memory owned by the system, so the programmer should not attempt to delete[] it.  22.5.1  Extended Type Information A type_info object  contains  only  minimal  information. Therefore,  ﬁnding  the  exact  type  of  an object is often just the ﬁrst step to acquiring and using more detailed information about that type.  Consider  how an implementation  or  a  tool  could  make information  about  types  available  to users at run time. Suppose I have a tool that generates descriptions of object layouts for each class used.  I can put these descriptors into a map to allow user code to ﬁnd the layout information:  include    map  layout_table;  void f B∗ p  {  Layout& x = layout_table[typeid ∗p .name  ];     ﬁnd the Layout based on *p’sname    ... use x ...  The resulting data structure looks like this:  layout_table:  "T" ...  object layout  Someone else might provide a completely different kind of information:  unordered_map  icon_table;      §31.4.3.2  void g B∗ p  {  Icon& i = icon_table[type_index{typeid ∗p }];    ... use i ...  The type_index is a standard-library type for comparing and hashing type_info objects  §35.5.4 .  The resulting data structure looks like this:  }  }  }   Section 22.5.1  Extended Type Information   661  icon_table:  type_index   ...  ...  representation  icon  of type  Associating typeids with  information  without  modifying  system  headers  allows  several  people  or tools to associate different information with types independently of each other. This is important because  the  likelihood  that  someone  can  come  up  with  a  single  set  of  information  that  satisﬁes ev ery user is close to zero.  22.6  Uses and Misuses of RTTI We  should  use  explicit  run-time  type  information  only  when  necessary. Static   compile-time  checking  is  safer, implies  less  overhead,  and  –  where  applicable  –  leads  to  better-structured  pro- grams.  Interfaces based on virtual functions combine static type checking with a run-time lookup in  a  way  that  gives both  type  safety  and  ﬂexibility. Howev er,  programmers  sometimes  overlook these  alternatives and  use  RTTI  where  it  is  unsuitable. For example,  RTTI  can  be  used  to  write thinly disguised switch-statements:     misuse of run-time type infor mation:  void rotate const Shape& r  {  if  typeid r  == typeid Circle   {     do nothing  } else if  typeid r  == typeid Triangle   {     ... rotate triangle ...  } else if  typeid r  == typeid Square   {     ... rotate square ...  }    ...  }  Using dynamic_cast rather than typeid would improve this code only marginally. Either way, this code is syntactically ugly and also inefﬁcient in that it performs an expensive operation repeatedly. Unfortunately, this  is  not  a  strawman  example;  such  code  really  does  get  written. For many people trained in languages without equivalents to class hierachies and virtual functions, there is an almost irresistible urge to organize software as a set of switch-statements.  This urge should usually be  resisted. Use  virtual  functions   §3.2.3,  §20.3.2   rather  than  RTTI  to  handle  most  cases  when run-time discrimination based on type is needed.  Many examples of proper use of RTTI arise when some service code is expressed in terms of one class and a user wants to add functionality through derivation.  The use of Ival_box in §22.2 is   662  Run-Time Type Information   Chapter 22  an example of this. If the user is willing and able to modify the deﬁnitions of the library classes, say BBwindow, then the use of RTTI can be avoided; otherwise, it is needed. Even if the user is willing to modify the base classes  e.g., to add a virtual function , such modiﬁcation may cause its own problems.  For example, it may be necessary to introduce dummy implementations of virtual functions in classes for which those functions are not needed or not meaningful. A use of RTTI to implement a simple object I O system can be found in §22.2.4.  For people with a background in languages that rely heavily on dynamic type checking, such as Smalltalk, pre-generics Java, or Lisp, it is tempting to use RTTI in conjunction with overly general types.  Consider:     misuse of run-time type infor mation:  class Object {    polymor phic     ...  class Container : public Object { public:  void put Object∗ ; Object∗ get  ;    ...  class Ship : public Object {  * ...*  };  Ship∗ f Ship∗ ps, Container∗ c  {  c−>put ps ;     ... Object∗ p = c−>g et  ; if  Ship∗ q = dynamic_cast  p   {  return q;  } else {  }     ... do something else  typically,error handling  ...     put the Ship into the container     retrieve anObject from the container    run-time checkthat the Object is a Ship  Here, class Object is an unnecessary implementation artifact.  It is overly general because it does not correspond to an abstraction in the application domain and forces the application programmer to use an implementation-level abstraction  Object .  Problems of this kind are often better solved by using container templates that hold only a single kind of pointer:  Ship∗ f Ship∗ ps, vector & c  {  c.push_back ps ;     ... return c.pop_back  ;      put the Ship into the container     retrieve a Ship from the container  };  };  }  }   Section 22.6  Uses and Misuses of RTTI   663  This style of code is less error-prone  better statically type checked  and less verbose than a pure- Object-based alternative. Combined with the use of virtual functions, this technique handles most cases.  In a template, a template argument T takes the place of Object and enables static type check- ing  §27.2 .  22.7  Advice [1]  Use virtual functions to ensure that the same operation is performed independently of which  interface is used for an object; §22.1.

The C++ template mechanism allows a type or a value to be a parameter in the deﬁnition of a class, a function, or a type alias. Templates provide a straightforward way to represent  a  wide  range  of  general  concepts  and  simple  ways  to  combine  them. The  resulting classes and functions can match handwritten, less general code in run-time and space efﬁciency.  A template  depends  only  on  the  properties  that  it  actually  uses  from  its  parameter  types  and does not require types used as arguments to be explicitly related. In particular, the argument types   666  Templates   Chapter 23  used for a template need not be part of an inheritance hierarchy.  Built-in types are acceptable and very common as template arguments.  The composition offered by templates is type-safe  no object can be implicitly used in a way that  disagrees  with  its  deﬁnition ,  but  unfortunately, a template’s requirements  on  its  arguments cannot be simply and directly stated in code  §24.3 .  Every  major  standard-library  abstraction  is  represented  as  a  template   for  example, string, ostream, regex, complex, list, map, unique_ptr, thread, future, tuple, and function , and so are the key operations  for example, string comparisons, the output operator <<, complex arithmetic operations, list insertions and deletions, and sort   .  This makes the library chapters  Part IV  of this book a rich source of examples of templates and programming techniques relying on them.  Here,  templates  are  introduced  with  the  primary  focus  on  techniques  needed  for  the  design, implementation, and use of the standard library. The standard library requires a greater degree of generality, ﬂexibility, and efﬁciency than does most software.  Consequently, techniques that can be used  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  standard  library  are  effective  and  efﬁcient  in  the design of solutions to a wide variety of problems. These techniques enable an implementer to hide sophisticated implementations behind simple interfaces and to expose complexity to the user when the user has a speciﬁc need for it.  Templates and the fundamental techniques for using them are the focus of this and the follow- ing six chapters. This chapter focuses on the most basic template facilities and fundamental pro- gramming techniques for using them:  §23.2  A Simple String Template: The basic mechanisms for deﬁning and using class templates  are introduced through the example of a string template.  §23.3  Type Checking: The basic rules of type equivalence and type checking as they apply to  templates.  §23.4  Class Template Members: How members of a class template are deﬁned and used. §23.5  Function Templates: How  to deﬁne  and  use  function  templates.

Chapter 24, Generic Programming, presents the basic technique of generic programming, and the fundamental idea of concepts  requirements on template arguments  is explored:  §24.2  Algorithms and  Lifting: An example  of  the  basic  technique  for  developing  a generic  algorithm from concrete examples.  §24.3  Concepts: Introduces and discusses the fundamental notion of a concept, that is, a set of  requirements that a template can impose on its template arguments.  §24.4  Making Concepts Concrete: Presents techniques for using concepts expressed as com-  pile-time predicates.

How to specify and use default template arguments.  §25.3  Specialization: Special versions, called specializations, of a template for a speciﬁc set of template arguments can be generated from the templates by the compiler or be provided by the programmer.

Chapter  27, Templates  and  Hierarchies, discusses  the  relation  between  the  generic  programming techniques  supported  by  templates  and  the  object-oriented  techniques  supported  by  class  hierar- chies.  The emphasis is on how to use them in combination:  §27.2  Parameterization and Hierarchy: Templates and class hierarchies are two ways of repre-  senting sets of related abstractions. How do we choose between them?  §27.3  Hierarchies  of  Class  Templates: Why  it is usually  a  bad  idea  simply  to  add  template  parameters to an existing class hierarchy?  §27.4  Template Parameters as Base Classes: Presents techniques for composing interfaces and  data structures for type safety and performance.

Chapter 29, A Matrix Design, demonstrates how various template features can be used in combina- tion to address a challenging design task:  §29.2  A Matrix Template: How  to deﬁne an N-dimensional matrix with ﬂexible and type-safe  initialization, subscription, and submatrices.  §29.3 Matrix Arithmetic  Operations: How  to provide  simple  arithmetic  operations  on  an  N-  dimensional matrix.  §29.4 Matrix Implementation: Some useful implementation techniques. §29.5  Solving Linear Equations: An example of simple matrix use.  Templates were introduced early  §3.4.1, §3.4.2  and used throughout this book, so I assume that you have some familiarity with them.   668  Templates   Chapter 23  23.2  A Simple String Template Consider  a  string  of  characters. A string  is  a  class  that  holds  characters  and  provides  operations such as subscripting, concatenation, and comparison that we usually associate with the notion of a ‘‘string.’’  We would like to provide that behavior for many different kinds of characters. For exam- ple, strings of signed characters, of unsigned characters, of Chinese characters, of Greek characters, etc., are useful in various contexts.  Thus, we want to represent the notion of ‘‘string’’ with minimal dependence on a speciﬁc kind of character. The deﬁnition of a string relies on the fact that a char- acter can be copied, and little else  §24.3 . Thus, we can make a more general string type by taking the string of char from §19.3 and making the character type a parameter:  template  class String { public:  String  ; explicit String const C∗ ; String const String& ; String operator= const String& ;    ... C& operator[] int n  { return ptr[n]; } String& operator+= C c ;    ...  private:  };  static const int short_max = 15; int sz; C∗ ptr;      ptr points to sz Cs     uncheckedelement access    add c at end     forthe shortstr ingoptimization  The template  preﬁx speciﬁes that a template is being declared and that a type argu- ment C will  be  used  in  the  declaration. After  its  introduction, C is  used  exactly  like other  type names.  The scope  of C extends  to  the  end  of  the  declaration  preﬁxed  by template . You may prefer the shorter and equivalent form template . In either case, C is a type name; it need not be the name of a class. Mathematicians will recognize template  as a vari- ant of the traditional ‘‘for all C’’ or more speciﬁcally ‘‘for all types C’’ or even ‘‘for all C, such that C is a type.’’  If you think along those lines, you will note that C++ lacks a fully general mechanism for specifying the required properties of a template parameter C. That is, we can’t say ‘‘for all C, such that ...’’  where the ‘‘...’’  is a set of requirements for C. In other words, C++ does not offer a direct way to say what kind of type a template argument C is supposed to be  §24.3 .  The name of a class template followed by a type bracketed by   is the name of a class  as  deﬁned by the template  and can be used exactly like other class names. For example:  String  cs; String  us; String  ws;  struct Jchar {  * ...*  };     Japanese character  String  js;   Section 23.2  A Simple String Template   669  Except for the special syntax of its name, String  works exactly as if it had been deﬁned using the deﬁnition of class String in §19.3. Making String a template allows us to provide the facilities we had for String of char for Strings of any kind of character. For example, if we use the standard- library map and the String template, the word-counting example from §19.2.1 becomes:  int main      count the occurrences of each word on input {  map ,int> m; for  String  buf; cin>>buf;   ++m[buf];     ... write out result ...  The version for our Japanese-character type Jchar would be:  int main      count the occurrences of each word on input {  map ,int> m; for  String  buf; cin>>buf;   ++m[buf];     ... write out result ...  using string = std::basic_string ;  This allows us to write the word-counting program like this:  int main      count the occurrences of each word on input {  map  m; for  string buf; cin>>buf;   ++m[buf];     ... write out result ...  }  }  }  The standard library provides the template class basic_string that is similar to the templatized String  §19.3, §36.3 . In the standard library, string is a synonym for basic_string   §36.3 :  In general, type aliases  §6.5  are useful for shortening the long names of classes generated from templates.  Also, we  often  prefer  not  to  know the  details  of  how a type  is  deﬁned,  and  an  alias allows us to hide the fact that a type is generated from a template.  23.2.1  Deﬁning a Template A class generated from a class template is a perfectly ordinary class. Thus, use of a template does not imply any run-time mechanisms beyond what is used for an equivalent ‘‘handwritten’’ class.  In fact, using a template can lead to a decrease of code generated because code for a member function of a class template is only generated if that member is used  §26.2.1 .  In addition to class templates, C++ offers function templates  §3.4.2, §23.5 . I will introduce most of the ‘‘mechanics’’ of templates in the context of class templates and postpone detailed dis- cussion of function templates to §23.5. A template is a speciﬁcation of how to generate something   670  Templates   Chapter 23  given suitable template arguments; the language mechanisms for doing that generation  instantia- tion  §26.2  and specialization  §25.3   don’t care much whether a class or a function is generated. So, unless otherwise stated, the rules for templates apply equally to class templates and function templates.  Templates can also be deﬁned as aliases  §23.6 , but other plausible constructs, such as namespace templates, are not provided.  There  are  people  who  make semantic  distinctions  between  the  terms class  template and tem- plate class. I don’t; that would be too subtle: please consider those terms interchangeable. Simi- larly, I consider function template interchangeable with template function.  When designing a class template, it is usually a good idea to debug a particular class, such as String, before turning it into a template such as String . By doing so, we handle many design problems and most of the code errors in the context of a concrete example.  This kind of debugging is familiar to all programmers, and most people cope better with a concrete example than with an abstract concept. Later, we can deal with any problems that might arise from generalization with- out being distracted by more conventional errors. Similarly, when trying to understand a template, it is often useful to imagine its behavior for a particular type argument such as char before trying to comprehend  the  template  in  its  full  generality. This  also  ﬁts  with  the  philosophy that  a  generic component should be developed as a generalization of one or more concrete examples, rather than simply being designed from ﬁrst principles  §24.2 .  Members  of  a  class  template  are  declared  and  deﬁned  exactly  as  they would  have  been  for  a non-template  class. A template  member  need  not  be  deﬁned  within  the  template  class  itself. In that case, its deﬁnition must be provided somewhere else, just as for non-template class members  §16.2.1 .  Members of a template class are themselves templates parameterized by the parameters of  their  template  class. When  such  a  member  is  deﬁned  outside  its  class,  it  must  explicitly  be declared a template. For example:  template  String ::String       String ’sconstr uctor  :sz{0}, ptr{ch}  ch[0] = {};    terminating0ofthe appropriate character type  {  }  }  template  String& String ::operator+= C c  {     ... add c to the end of this string ... return ∗this;  A template parameter, such as C, is a parameter rather than the name of a speciﬁc type. However, that  doesn’t affect  the  way  we  write  the  template  code  using  the  name. Within  the  scope  of String , qualiﬁcation  with   is  redundant  for  the  name  of  the  template  itself,  so String ::String is the name for the constructor.  Just as there can be only one function deﬁning a class member function in a program, there can be only one function template deﬁning a class template member function in a program. However, specialization   §25.3   enables  us  to  provide  alternative  implementations  for  a  template  given   Section 23.2.1  Deﬁning a Template   671  speciﬁc template arguments.  For functions, we can also use overloading to provide different deﬁni- tions for different argument types  §23.5.3 .  It is not possible to overload a class template name, so if a class template is declared in a scope,  no other entity can be declared there with the same name. For example:  template  class String {  * ...*  };  class String {  * ...*  };     error :double deﬁnition  A type  used  as  a  template  argument  must  provide  the  interface  expected  by  the  template. For example,  a  type  used  as  an  argument  to String must  provide  the  usual  copy operations   §17.5, §36.2.2 .  Note that there is no requirement that different arguments for the same template parame- ter should be related by inheritance. See also §25.2.1  template type parameters , §23.5.2  template parameter deduction , and §24.3  requirements on template arguments .  23.2.2  Template Instantiation The  process  of  generating  a  class  or  a  function  from  a  template  plus  a  template  argument  list  is often called template instantiation  §26.2 .  A version of a template for a speciﬁc template argu- ment list is called a specialization.  In general, it is the implementation’s job – not the programmer’s – to ensure that specializations  of a template are generated for each template argument list used. For example:  String  cs;  String  js;  void f   {  }  cs = "It's the implementation's job to ﬁgure out what code needs to be generated";  For this, the implementation generates declarations for classes String  and String , for their  destructors  and  default  constructors,  and  for String ::operator= char∗ . Other  member functions are not used and will not be generated. Generated classes are perfectly ordinary classes that obey all the usual rules for classes. Similarly, generated functions are ordinary functions that obey all the usual rules for functions.  Obviously, templates  provide  a  powerful  way  of  generating  lots  of  code  from  relatively  short deﬁnitions.  Consequently, a certain amount of caution is in order to avoid ﬂooding memory with almost identical function deﬁnitions  §25.3 . On the other hand, templates can be written to enable otherwise unachievable quality of generated code. In particular, composition using templates com- bined  with  simple  inlining  can  be  used  to  eliminate  many direct  and  indirect  function  calls. For example, that is how simple operations on critical data structures  such as < in a sort   and + for scalars in a matrix computation  are reduced to single machine instructions in heavily parameter- ized  libraries. Thus,  incautious  use  of  templates  leading  to  the  generation  of  very  similar  large functions can cause code bloat, whereas use of templates to enable inlining of tiny functions can lead to signiﬁcant code shrinkage  and speedup  compared to alternatives.  In particular, the code   672  Templates   Chapter 23  generated for a simple < or [] is often a single machine instruction, which is both much faster than any function call and smaller than the code needed to invoke a function and receive its result.  23.3  Type Checking Template instantiation takes a template plus a set of template arguments and generates code from them.  Because so much information is available at instantiation time, weaving together the infor- mation from the template deﬁnition and the template argument types provides wonderful degrees of ﬂexibility  and  can  yield  unparalleled  run-time  performance. Unfortunately, this  ﬂexibility  also implies complexity of type checking and difﬁculties for accurate reporting of type errors.  Type checking is done on the code generated by template instantiation  exactly as if the pro- grammer  had  expanded  the  templates  by  hand . This  generated  code  may  contain  much  that  the user of a template has never heard of  such as names of details of a template implementation  and often happens uncomfortably late in the build process. This mismatch between what the program- mer sees writes and what the compiler type checks can be a major problem, and we need to design our programs to minimize its consequences.  The  fundamental  weakness  of  the  template  mechanism  is  that  it  is  not  possible  to  directly  express requirements on a template argument.  For example, we cannot say:  template   requires Equal_comparable     int ﬁnd_index Cont& c, Elem e ;     requirements for types Cont and Elem    ﬁnd the indexofeinc  That is, we have no way in C++ itself to directly say that Cont should be a type that can act as a container and that the type Elem should be a type that allows us to compare a value to an element of Cont. Work is being done to make this possible in future versions of C++  without loss of ﬂexibil- ity, without loss of run-time performance, and without signiﬁcant increases in compile time [Sut- ton,2011] , but for now we will have to do without.  The  ﬁrst  step  in  dealing  effectively  with  problems  related  to  template  argument  passing  is  to establish a framework and vocabulary for discussing requirements. Think of a set of requirements on template arguments as a predicate. For example, we can think of ‘‘C must be a container’’ as a predicate that takes a type, C, as an argument and returns true if C is a container  however we may have  deﬁned  ‘‘container’’   and false if  it  is  not. For example, Container >   and Con- tainer >   should  be  true  whereas Container    and Container >   should be false.  We call such a predicate a concept. A concept is not  yet  a language construct in C++;  it  is  a  notion  that  we  can  use  to  reason  about  requirements  on  template  arguments,  use  in comments, and sometimes support with our own code  §24.3 .  For starters, think of a concept as a design tool: specify Container    as a set of comments say-  ing what properties a type T must have for Container    to be true. For example:   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   T must have a subscript operator  [] . T must have a size   member function. T must have a member type value_type which is the type of its elements.  Note that this list is incomplete  e.g., what does [] take as an argument and what does it return?  and fails to address most semantic issues  e.g., what does [] actually do? . However, even a partial set of requirements can be useful; even something very simple allows us to hand-check our uses   Section 23.3  Type Checking  673  and catch obvious errors. For example, Container    is obviously false because int does not have a subscript operator. I will return to the design of concepts  §24.3 , consider techniques for sup- porting concepts in code  §24.4 , and give  an example of a set of useful concepts  §24.3.2 . For now,  just note that C++ does not directly support concepts, but that does not mean that concepts don’t exist: for every working template, the designer had some concepts in mind for its arguments. Dennis Ritchie famously said, ‘‘C is a strongly typed, weakly checked language.’’  You could say the same about C++’s templates, except that the checking of template argument requirements  con- cepts  is actually done, but it is done too late in the compilation process and at an unhelpfully low level of abstraction.  23.3.1  Type Equivalence Given a template, we can generate types by supplying template arguments.  For example:  String  s1; String  s2; String  s3;  using Uchar = unsigned char; using uchar = unsigned char;  String  s4; String  s5; String  s6;  template      §25.2.2  class Buffer;  Buffer ,10> b1; Buffer  b2; Buffer  b3;  When using the same set of template arguments for a template, we always refer to the same gener- ated type. However,  what does ‘‘the same’’ mean in this context?  Aliases do not introduce new types, so String  and String  are the same type as String . Conversely, because char and unsigned char are different types  §6.2.3 , String  and String  are different types.  The compiler can evaluate constant expressions  §10.4 , so Buffer  is recognized to  be the same type as Buffer .  Types generated from a single template by different template arguments are different types. In particular, generated  types  from  related  arguments  are  not  automatically  related. For example, assume that a Circle is a kind of Shape:  Shape∗ p {new Circle p,100 };  vector ∗ q {new vector {}};  vector  vs {vector {}};  vector  vs {vector {}};      Circle* convertstoShape*    error :no vector * to vector * conversion    error :no vector  to vector  conversion    error :no vector  to vector  conversion  Had  such  conversions  been  allowed,  type  errors  would  have  resulted   §27.2.1 . between generated classes are needed, the programmer can deﬁne them  §27.2.2 .  If  conversions   674  Templates   Chapter 23  23.3.2  Error Detection A template is deﬁned and then later used in combination with a set of template arguments.  When the template is deﬁned, the deﬁnition is checked for syntax errors and possibly also for other errors that can be detected in isolation from a particular set of template arguments.  For example:     syntax error:missing semicolon  template  struct Link {  Link∗ pre; Link∗ suc  T val;  template  class List {  Link ∗ head;  public:  List   :head{7} { } List const T& t  : head{new Link {0,o,t}} { }    ... void print_all   const;     error :pointer initialized with int    error :undeﬁned identiﬁer o  A compiler can catch simple semantic errors at the point of deﬁnition or later at the point of use. Users generally prefer early detection, but not all ‘‘simple’’ errors are easy to detect. Here, I made three ‘‘mistakes’’:   cid:129  A simple syntax error: Leaving out a semicolon at the end of a declaration.  cid:129  A simple type error: Independently of what the template parameter is, a pointer cannot be  initialized by the integer 7.   cid:129  A name lookup error: The identiﬁer o  a mistyped 0, of course  cannot be an argument to  Link ’s constructor because there is no such name in scope.  A name used in a template deﬁnition must either be in scope or in some reasonably obvious way depend on a template parameter  §26.3 . The most common and obvious ways of depending on a template parameter T are to explicitly use the name T, to use a member of a T, and to take an argu- ment of type T. For example:  template  void List ::print_all   const {  for  Link ∗ p = head; p; p=p−>suc   cout << ∗p;      pdepends on T    << depends on T  Errors that relate to the use of template parameters cannot be detected until the template is used. For example:  class Rec {  string name; string address;  };  };  }  };   Section 23.3.2  Error Detection  675  void f const List & li, const List & lr  {  li.print_all  ; lr.print_all  ;  }  The li.print_all   checks  out  ﬁne,  but lr.print_all   gives a type  error  because  there  is  no << output operator deﬁned for Rec. The earliest that errors relating to a template parameter can be detected is at the ﬁrst point of use of the template for a particular template argument.  That point is called the ﬁrst point  of  instantiation  §26.3.3 .  The implementation  is  allowed  to  postpone  essentially  all checking until the program is linked, and for some errors link time is also the earliest point when complete checking is possible. Independently of when checking is done, the same set of rules is checked.  Naturally, users prefer early checking.  23.4  Class Template Members Exactly like a class, a template class can have members of several kinds:   cid:129  Data members  variable and constant ; §23.4.1  cid:129  Member functions; §23.4.2  cid:129  Member type aliases; §23.6  cid:129   cid:129  Member types  e.g., a member class ; §23.4.5  cid:129  Member templates  e.g., a member class template ; §23.4.6.3  static members  function and data ; §23.4.4  In addition, a class template can declare friends, just as an ‘‘ordinary class’’ can; §23.4.7.  The rules for class template members are those for their generated classes. That is, if you want to know what the rules of a template member are, just look for the rules for a member of an ordi- nary class  Chapter 16, Chapter 17, and Chapter 20 ; that will answer most questions.  23.4.1  Data Members As for an ‘‘ordinary class,’’ a class template can have data members of any type.  A non-static data member can be initialized in its deﬁnition  §17.4.4  or in a constructor  §16.2.5 . For example:  template  struct X {  int m1 = 7; T m2; X const T& x  :m2{x} { }  };  X  xi {9}; X  xs {"Rapperswil"};  Non-static data members can be const, but unfortunately not constexpr.   676  Templates   Chapter 23  23.4.2  Member Functions As for an ‘‘ordinary class,’’ a non-static member function of a class template can be deﬁned in-class or outside the class. For example:  template  struct X {  void mf1   {  * ...*  } void mf2  ;  };     deﬁned in-class  template  void X ::mf2   {  * ...*  }     deﬁned out of class  Similarly, a member function of a template can be virtual or not. However, a virtual member func- tion cannot also be a member function template  §23.4.6.2 .  23.4.3  Member Type Aliases Member  type  aliases,  whether  introduced  using using or typedef  §6.5 ,  play  a  major  role  in  the design of class templates. They deﬁne related types of a class in a way that is easy to access from outside the class. For example, we specify a container’s iterator and element types as aliases:  template  class Vector { public:  using value_type = T; using iterator = Vector_iter ;     ...  };     Vector_iter is deﬁned elsewhere  The template argument name, T, is only accessible to the template itself, so for other code to refer to the element type, we must provide an alias.  Type aliases play a major role in generic programming by allowing the designer of classes to provide common names for types in different classes  and class templates  with common semantics. Type names as member aliases are often referred to as associated types. The value_type and iterator names are borrowed from the standard library’s container design  §33.1.3 . If a class is missing a desired member alias, a trait can be used to compensate  §28.2.4 .  23.4.4 static Members A static data or function member that is not deﬁned in-class must have a unique deﬁnition in a pro- gram.  For example:  template  struct X {  static constexpr Point p {100,250};    Point must be a literal type  §10.4.3  static const int m1 = 7; static int m2 = 8;     error :not const   Section 23.4.4  static Members   677  template  int X ::m1 = 88; template  int X ::m3 = 99;     error :twoinitializers  template  void X:: ::f2   {  * ...*  }  As for non-template classes, a const or conexpr static data member of literal type can be initialized in-class and need not be deﬁned outside the class  §17.4.5, §iso.9.2 .  A static member need only be deﬁned if it is used  §iso.3.2, §iso.9.4.2, §16.2.12 . For example:  If this is all the mention of X  in a program, we will get a ‘‘not deﬁned’’ error for X ::a, but not for X ::b.  23.4.5  Member Types As for an ‘‘ordinary class,’’  we can deﬁne types as members. As usual, such a type can be a class or an enumeration. For example:     error :under lyingtype not known  static int m3; static void f1   {  * ...*  } static void f2  ;  };  };  };  template  struct X {  static int a; static int b;  int∗ p = &X ::a;  template  struct X {  enum E1 { a, b }; enum E2; enum class E3; enum E4 : char;  struct C1 {  * ...*  }; struct C2;  template  enum class X ::E3 { a, b };     needed  template  enum class X ::E4 : char { x, y };     needed  template  struct X ::C2 {  * ...*  };     needed   678  Templates   Chapter 23  The out-of-class deﬁnition of a member enumeration is only allowed for an enumeration for which we know the underlying type  §8.4 .  As usual, the enumerators of a non-class enum are placed in the scope of the enumeration; that  is, for a member enumeration, the enumerators are in the scope of its class.  23.4.6  Member Templates A class or a class template can have members that are themselves templates. This allows us to rep- resent related types with a pleasing degree of control and ﬂexibility. For example, complex num- bers are best represented as pairs of values of some scalar type:  template  class complex {  Scalar re, im;  public:  complex   :re{}, im{} {} template  complex T rr, T ii =0  :re{rr}, im{ii} { }     default constructor  complex const complex&  = default; template      copyconstr uctor  complex const complex & c  : re{c.real  }, im{c.imag  } { }     ...  };  This  allows  mathematically  meaningful  conversions  among  complex types,  while  prohibiting  the undesirable narrowing conversions  §10.5.2.6 :  complex  cf; complex  cd {cf}; complex  cf2 {cd};     default value    OK: uses ﬂoat to double conversion    error :no implicit double->ﬂoat conversion  complex  cf3 {2.0,3.0}; complex  cd2 {2.0F,3.0F};     OK: uses ﬂoat to double conversion     error :no implicit double->ﬂoat conversion  class Quad {     no conversion to int  };  complex  cq; complex  ci {cq};     error :no Quad to int conversion  Given this  deﬁnition  of complex, we can  construct  a complex  from  a complex  or  from  a pair of T2 values if and only if we can construct a T1 from a T2. That seems reasonable.  Be warned that the narrowing error in the complex  to complex  case will not be caught until the instantiation of complex ’s template constructors and then only because I used the {} initialization syntax  §6.3.5  in the constructor’s member initializers. That syntax does not allow narrowing.   Section 23.4.6  Member Templates   679  Using the  old     syntax would leave us open to narrowing errors. For example:  template  class complex {    Scalar re, im;  public:     old style  complex   :re 0 , im 0  { } template  complex T rr, T ii =0  :re rr , im ii  { }  complex const complex&  = default; template      copyconstr uctor  complex const complex & c  : re c.real   , im c.imag    { }     ...  };  complex  cf4 {2.1,2.9}; complex  cf5 {cd};     ouch! narrows    ouch! narrows  I consider this yet another reason to be consistent in the use of the {} notation for initialization.  23.4.6.1  Templates and Constructors  To minimize the chances of confusion, I explicitly added a default copy constructor. Leaving it out would not change the meaning of the deﬁnition: complex would still get a default copy constructor. For technical reasons, a template constructor is never used to generate a copy constructor, so with- out the explicitly declared copy constructor, a  default copy constructor would have been generated. Similarly, copy assignments,  move constructors,  and  move assignments   §17.5.1,  §17.6,  §19.3.1  must be deﬁned as non-template operators or the default versions will be generated.  23.4.6.2  Templates and virtual  A member template cannot be virtual. For example:  class Shape {     ... template   };  virtual bool intersect const T&  const =0;     error :vir tualtemplate  This must be illegal.  If it were allowed, the traditional virtual function table technique for imple- menting virtual functions  §3.2.3  could not be used. The linker would have to add a new entry to the  virtual  table  for  class Shape each  time  someone  called intersect   with  a  new argument  type. Complicating the implementation of the linker in this way was considered unacceptable. In partic- ular, handling dynamic linking would require implementation techniques rather different from what is most commonly used.   680  Templates   23.4.6.3  Use of Nesting  Chapter 23  In general, it is a good idea to keep information as local as possible. That way, a name is easier to ﬁnd and less likely to interfere with anything else in a program. This line of thinking leads to types being  deﬁned  as  members. Doing  so  is  often  a  good  idea. However,  for  members  of  class  tem- plates  we  must  consider  if  the  parameterization  is  appropriate  for  a  member  type. Formally, a member of a template depends on all of a template’s arguments.  That can have  unfortunate side effects in cases where the behavior of the member does not in fact use every template argument.  A famous example is a link type of a linked list. Consider:  Here, Link is  an  implementation  detail  of List. Thus,  it  seems  a  perfect  example  of  a  type  best deﬁned in the scope of List and even kept private. This has been a popular design and generally works very well. But surprisingly, it can imply performance cost compared to using a nonlocal Link type.  Assume that  no  member  of Link depends  on  the Allocator parameter, and  that  we  need List  and List . Now List ::Link and List ::Link are different types, so code using them cannot  without clever opti- mizers  be identical. That is, making Link a member when it uses only one of List’s  two template parameters implies some code bloat. This leads us to consider a design where Link isn’t a member:  template  class List { private:  struct Link {  T val; Link∗ succ; Link∗ prev;  };    ...  };  template  class List;  template  class Link {  template   friend class List;  T val; Link∗ succ; Link∗ prev;  template  class List {     ...  };  };  I made all members of Link private and granted List access.  Except for making the name Link non- local, this preserves the design intent that Link is an implementation detail of List.   Section 23.4.6.3  Use of Nesting  681  But what if a nested class is not considered an implementation detail? That is, what if we need  an associated type that is meant for a variety of users? Consider:  template  class List { public:  class Iterator {  Link ∗ current_position;  public:  };     ... usual iterator operations ...  Iterator  begin  ; Iterator  end  ;    ...  };  }  }  }  }  Here, the member type List ::Iterator  obviously  does not use the second template argument A. However, because Iterator is a member and therefore formally depends on A  the compiler doesn’t know anything  to  the  contrary ,  we  can’t write  a  function  to  process Lists independently  of  how they were constructed using allocators:  void fct List ::Iterator b, List ::Iterator e  {     error :List takes twoarguments  auto p = ﬁnd b,e,17 ;    ...  void user List & lm, List & ly  {  fct lm.begin  ,lm.end   ; fct ly.begin  ,ly.end   ;  Instead, we need to write a function template with a dependence on the allocator argument:  void fct List ::Iterator b, List ::Iterator e  {  auto p = ﬁnd b,e,17 ;    ...  However, that breaks our user  :  void user List & lm, List & ly  {  fct lm.begin  ,lm.end   ; fct ly.begin  ,ly.end   ;      error :fct takes List ::Iterators   682  Templates   Chapter 23  We  could make fct a template and generate separate specializations for each allocator. Howev er, that would generate a new specialization for every use of Iterator, so this could lead to signiﬁcant code bloat [Tsafrir,2009].  Again, we solve the problem by moving Link out of the class template:  template  struct Iterator {  Link ∗ current_position;  template  class List { public:  Iterator  begin  ; Iterator  end  ;    ...  This makes iterators for every List with the same ﬁrst template argument interchangeable as far as their types are concerned. In this case, that was exactly what we wanted.  Our user   now works as deﬁned.  Had fct   been  deﬁned  to  be  a  function  template,  there  would  have  been  only  one  copy  instantiation   of  the  deﬁnition  of fct  . My rule  of  thumb  is  ‘‘A void  nested  types  in  templates unless they genuinely rely on every template parameter.’’ This is a special case of the general rule to avoid unnecessary dependencies in code.  23.4.7  Friends As shown in §23.4.6.3, a template class can designate functions as friends.  Consider the Matrix and Vector example from §19.4. Typically, both Matrix and Vector will be templates:  template  class Matrix;  template  class Vector {  T v[4];  public:  friend Vector operator∗  const Matrix &, const Vector& ;    ...  template  class Matrix {  Vector  v[4];  public:  friend Vector  operator∗  const Matrix&, const Vector & ;    ...  The   after the name of the friend function is needed to make clear that the friend is a template function.  Without the  , a  non-template function would be assumed. The multiplication operator can then be deﬁned to access data from Vector and Matrix directly:  };  };  };  };   Section 23.4.7  Friends   683  template  Vector  operator∗ const Matrix & m, const Vector & v  {  Vector  r;    ... use m.v[i] and v.v[i] for direct access to elements ... return r;  Friends do not affect the scope in which the template class is deﬁned, nor do they affect the scope in  which  the  template  is  used. Instead,  friend  functions  and  operators  are  found  using  a  lookup based on their argument types  §14.2.4, §18.2.5, §iso.11.3 . Like a member function, a friend func- tion is instantiated only if it is used  §26.2.1 .  Like other classes, a class template can designate other classes as friends.  For example:  class C; using C2 = C;  template  class My_class {  friend C; friend C2; friend C3; friend class C4;     OK: C is a class    OK: C2 is an alias for a class    error :no class C3 in scope    OK: introduces a newclass C4  Naturally, the  interesting  cases  are  those  where  the  friend  depends  on  a  template  argument.  For example:  template  class my_other_class {  friend T; friend My_class ;  friend class T;     my argument is myfriend!    My_class with the corresponding argument is myfriend    error :redundant ‘‘class’’  As  ever,  friendship  is  neither  inherited  nor  transitive   §19.4 .  For  example, C has  not  become  a friend  of My_other_class  ev en though My_class  is  a  friend  and C is  a  friend  of My_class .  We  cannot directly make a template a friend of a class, but we can make a friend declaration a  }  };  };  template.  For example:  template  class List;  template  class Link {  template   friend class List;     ...  };   684  Templates   Chapter 23  Unfortunately, there is no way of saying that Link  should only be a friend of List .  Friend classes are designed to allow the representation of small clusters of closely related con-  cepts.  A complicated pattern of friendship is almost certainly a design error.  23.5  Function Templates For many people, the ﬁrst and most obvious use of templates is to deﬁne and use container classes such as vector  §31.4 , list  §31.4.2 , and map  §31.4.3 .  Soon after, the need for function templates to manipulate such containers arises. Sorting a vector is a simple example:  template  void sort vector & ;      declaration  void f vector & vi, vector & vs  {  sort vi ; sort vs ;     sor t vector & ;    sor t vector & ;  When a function template is called, the types of the function arguments determine which version of the  template  is  used;  that  is,  the  template  arguments  are  deduced  from  the  function  arguments  §23.5.2 .  Naturally, the function template must be deﬁned somewhere  §23.7 :  }  {  }  template  void sort vector & v      Shell sort Knuth, Vol. 3, pg. 84      deﬁnition  const size_t n = v.siz e  ;  for  int gap=n 2; 0<gap; gap =2   for  int i=gap; i<n; i++   for  int j=i−gap; 0<=j; j−=gap      swapv[j] and v[j+gap]  if  v[j+gap]<v[j]  { T temp = v[j]; v[j] = v[j+gap]; v[j+gap] = temp;  }  Please compare this deﬁnition to the sort   deﬁned in §12.5. This templatized version is cleaner and shorter because it can rely on more information about the type of the elements it sorts. Typically, it is also faster because it doesn’t rely on a pointer to function for the comparison. This implies that no indirect function calls are needed and that inlining a simple < is easy.  A further  simpliﬁcation  is  to  use  the  standard-library  template swap    §35.5.2   to  reduce  the  action to its natural form:  if  v[j+gap]<v[j]   swap v[j],v[j+gap] ;   Section 23.5  Function Templates   685  This  does  not  introduce  any new  overhead.  Better yet,  the  standard-library swap   uses  move semantics, so we may see a speedup  §35.5.2 .  In this example, operator < is used for comparison. However,  not every type has a < operator. This limits the use of this version of sort  , but the limitation is easily avoided by adding an argu- ment  see §25.2.3 . For example:  template > void sort vector & v      deﬁnition     Shell sort Knuth, Vol. 3, pg. 84   Compare cmp; const size_t n = v.siz e  ;     makeadefault Compare object  for  int gap=n 2; 0<gap; gap =2   for  int i=gap; i<n; i++   for  int j=i−gap; 0<=j; j−=gap   if  cmp v[j+gap],v[j]    swap v[j],v[j+gap] ;  We can now sort using the default comparison operation  <  or supply our own:  struct No_case {  bool operator   const string& a, const string& b  const;     compare case insensitive  void f vector & vi, vector & vs  {  sort vi ; sort > vi ;     sor t vector &     sor t vector &  using greater  sort vs ; sort  vs ;     sor t vector &     sor t vector & using No_case  Unfortunately, the rule that only trailing template arguments can be speciﬁed leads us to have  to specify  rather than deduce  the element type when we specify the comparison operations.  The explicit speciﬁcation of function template arguments is explained in §23.5.2.  23.5.1  Function Template Arguments Function templates are essential for writing generic algorithms to be applied to a wide variety of container types  §3.4.2, §32.2 . The ability to deduce template arguments for a call from the func- tion arguments is crucial.  A compiler can deduce type and non-type arguments from a call, provided the function argu-  ment list uniquely identiﬁes the set of template arguments.  For example:  {  }  }  };   686  Templates   Chapter 23  template  struct Buffer {  T buf[max];  public:     ...  };  template  T& lookup Buffer & b, const char∗ p ;  Record& f Buffer & buf, const char∗ p  {  return lookup buf,p ;    use the lookup   where T is string and i is 128  }  }  }  Here, lookup  ’s T is deduced to be string and max is deduced to be 128.  Note that class template parameters are never deduced.  The reason is that the ﬂexibility pro- vided by several constructors for a class would make such deduction impossible in many cases and obscure in many more.  Instead, specialization  §25.3  provides a mechanism for implicitly choos- ing between alternative deﬁnitions of a template. If we need to create an object of a deduced type, we can often do that by calling a function to do the deduction  and creation . For example, con- sider a simple variant of the standard library’s make_pair    §34.2.4.1 :  template  pair  make_pair T1 a, T2 b  {  return {a,b};  auto x = make_pair 1,2 ; auto y = make_pair string "New York" ,7.7 ;      xisapair     yisapair   If a template argument cannot be deduced from the function arguments  §23.5.2 , we must specify it  explicitly. This  is  done  in  the  same  way  that  template  arguments  are  explicitly  speciﬁed  for  a template class  §25.2, §25.3 . For example:  template  T∗ create  ;      makeaTand returnapointer to it  void f   {  vector  v; int∗ p = create   ;  int∗ q = create  ;      class,template argument int    function, template argument int    error :can’t deduce template argument  This use of explicit speciﬁcation to provide a return type for a function template is very common. It allows us to deﬁne families of object creation functions  e.g., create    and conversion functions  e.g.,  §27.2.2 . The  syntax  for static_cast, dynamic_cast, etc.   §11.5.2,  §22.2.1 ,  matches  the   Section 23.5.1  Function Template Arguments   687  explicitly qualiﬁed function template syntax.  Default  template  arguments  can  be  used  to  simplify  explicit  qualiﬁcation  in  some  cases   §25.2.5.1 .  23.5.2  Function Template Argument Deduction A compiler  can  deduce  a  type  template  argument, T or TT, and  a  non-type  template  argument, I, from  a  template  function  argument  with  a  type  composed  of  the  following  constructs  §iso.14.8.2.1 :  T T∗ type[I]  TT   T type::∗ T  ∗  args   type  type::∗  args_TI   T  type::∗  args_TI    const T T&  class_template_name   T  T T::∗ type  T::∗  args   T  T::∗  args_TI   type  ∗  args_TI   volatile T T[constant_expression] class_template_name  T  type T::∗ T  type::∗  args  type  T::∗  args_TI   Here, args_TI is a parameter list from which a T or an I can be determined by recursive application of these rules, and args is a parameter list that does not allow deduction.  If not all parameters can be deduced in this way, a call is ambiguous. For example:  template  void f const T∗, U ∗  U  ;  int g int ;  void h const char∗ p  {  f p,g ;  f p,h ;      Tischar,Uisint    error :can’t deduce U  }  }  template  void f T i, T∗ p ;  void g int i  {  f i,&i ;  f i,"Remember!" ;      OK    error,ambiguous: T is int or T is const char?  Looking at the arguments of the ﬁrst call of f  , we easily deduce the template arguments.  Looking at the second call of f  , we see that h   doesn’t match the pattern U ∗  U  because h  ’s argument and return types differ.  If a template parameter can be deduced from more than one function argument, the same type  must be the result of each deduction. Otherwise, the call is an error. For example:   688  Templates   Chapter 23  23.5.2.1  Reference Deduction  It can be useful to have different actions taken for lvalues and rvalues.  Consider a class for holding an {integer,pointer} pair:  template  class Xref { public:  Xref int i, T∗ p       store a pointer:Xref is the owner  :index{i}, elem{p}, owner{true}  Xref int i, T& r      store a pointer to r,owned bysomeone else  :index{i}, elem{&r}, owner{false}  Xref int i, T&& r      move r into Xref,Xref is the owner  :index{i}, elem{new T{move r }}, owner{true}  { }  { }  { }  ˜Xref   {  }    ...  if owned  delete elem;  private:  int index; T∗ elem; bool owned;  };  So:  string x {"There and back again"};  Xref  r1 {7,"Here"}; Xref  r2 {9,x}; Xref  r3 {3,new string{"There"}};      r1 owns a copyofstr ing{"Here"}    r2 just refers to x    r3 owns the string{"There"}  Here, r1 picks Xref int,string&&  because x is an rvalue.  Similarly, r2 picks Xref int,string&  because x is an lvalue.  Lvalues and rvalues are distinguished by template argument deduction: an lvalue of type X is deduced as an X& and an rvalue as X. This differs from the binding of values to non-template argu- ment rvalue references  §12.2.1  but is especially useful for argument forwarding  §35.5.1 . Con- sider writing a factory function that make Xrefs on the free store and returns unique_ptrs to them:  template   template   T&& std::forward typename remove_reference ::type& t  noexcept;     §35.5.1  T&& std::forward typename remove_reference ::type&& t  noexcept;   Section 23.5.2.1  Reference Deduction  689  template  unique_ptr  make_unique int i, A&& a  {  return unique_ptr {new TT{i,forward  a }};  }     simple var iantof make_shared  §34.3.2   We want make_unique  arg  to construct a T from an arg without making any spurious copies. To do that, it is essential that the lvalue rvalue distinction is maintained. Consider:  auto p1 = make_unique > 7,"Here" ;  "Here" is an rvalue, so forward string&&  is called, passing along an rvalue, so that Xref int,string&&  is called to move from the string holding "Here".  The more interesting  subtle  case is:  auto p2 = make_unique > 9,x ;  Here, x is an lvalue, so forward string&  is called, passing along an lvalue: forward  ’s T is deduced to string& so  that  the  return  value  becomes string&  &&, which  means string&  §7.7.3 .  Thus, Xref int,string&  is called for the lvalue x, so that x is copied.  Unfortunately, make_unique   is not part of the standard library, but it is widely supported never- theless.  Deﬁning a make_unique   that can take arbitrary arguments is relatively easy using a vari- adic template for forwarding  §28.6.3 .  23.5.3  Function Template Overloading We  can declare several function templates with the same name and even declare a combination of function  templates  and  ordinary  functions  with  the  same  name. When  an  overloaded  function  is called,  overload  resolution  is  necessary  to  ﬁnd  the  right  function  or  function  template  to  invoke. For example:  template   T sqr t T ;  template   complex  sqrt complex  ;  double sqrt double ;  void f complex  z  {     sqr t  int  sqrt 2 ; sqrt 2.0 ;    sqr t double  sqrt z ;  }     sqr t  complex    In the same way that a function template is a generalization of the notion of a function, the rules for resolution in the presence of function templates are generalizations of the function overload resolu- tion rules. Basically, for each template we ﬁnd the specialization that is best for the set of function arguments.  Then, we apply the usual function overload resolution rules to these specializations and all ordinary functions  §iso.14.8.3 :   690  Templates   Chapter 23  [1]  Find the set of function template specializations  §23.2.2  that will take part in overload resolution.  Do this by considering each function template and deciding which template arguments, if any,  would be used if no other function templates or functions of the same name were in scope. For the call sqrt z , this makes sqrt  complex   and sqrt > complex   candidates.  See also §23.5.3.2. If two function  templates  can  be  called  and  one  is  more  specialized  than  the  other  §25.3.3 ,  consider  only  the  most  specialized  template  function  in  the  following  steps. For the  call sqrt z , this  means  that sqrt  complex   is  preferred  over sqrt > complex  : any call that matches sqrt  complex   also matches sqrt  T .  [2]   [3]  Do overload resolution for this set of functions, plus any ordinary functions, as for ordi- nary functions  §12.3 . If a function template’s argument has been determined by tem- plate argument deduction  §23.5.2 , that argument cannot also have promotions, standard conversions,  or  user-deﬁned  conversions  applied. For sqrt 2 , sqrt  int  is  an  exact match, so it is preferred over sqrt double . If a function  and  a  specialization  are  equally  good  matches,  the  function  is  preferred. Consequently, sqrt double  is preferred over sqrt  double  for sqrt 2.0 . If no match is found, the call is an error. If we end up with two or more equally good matches, the call is ambiguous and is an error.  [4]   [5]   For example:  template  T max T,T ;  const int s = 7;  void k   {  max 1,2 ;  max 'a','b' ;  max 2.7,4.9 ;  max s,7 ;      max  1,2     max  ’a’,’b’     max  2.7,4.9     max  int{s},7   trivial conversion used   max 'a',1 ;  max 2.7,4 ;      error :ambiguous: max    or max   ?    error :ambiguous: max    or max   ?  }  The  problem  with  the  last  two calls  is  that  we  don’t apply  promotions  and  standard  conversions until after template parameters have been uniquely determined. There is no rule telling the com- piler to prefer one resolution over the other. In most cases, it is probably good that the language rules leave subtle decisions in the hands of the programmer. The alternative to surprising ambigu- ity errors is surprising results from unexpected resolutions. People’s ‘‘intuitions’’ about overload resolution differ dramatically, so it is impossible to design a perfectly intuitive set of overload reso- lution rules.   Section 23.5.3.1  Ambiguity Resolution  691  23.5.3.1  Ambiguity Resolution  We could resolve the two ambiguities by explicit qualiﬁcation:  void f   {  max  'a',1 ;  max  2.7,4 ;      max  int ’a’ ,1     max  2.7,double 4    Alternatively, we could add suitable declarations:  inline int max int i, int j  { return max  i,j ; } inline double max int i, double d  { return max  i,d ; } inline double max double d, int i  { return max  d,i ; } inline double max double d1, double d2  { return max  d1,d2 ; }  void g   {  max 'a',1 ;  max 2.7,4 ;      max int ’a’ ,1     max 2.7,4   For ordinary functions, ordinary overloading rules  §12.3  apply, and the use of inline ensures that no extra overhead is imposed.  The deﬁnition of max   is trivial, so we could have implemented the comparison directly rather than calling a specialization of max  . Howev er,  using an explicit specialization of the template is an  easy  way  of  deﬁning  such  resolution  functions  and  can  help  maintenance  by  avoiding  almost identical code in several functions.  23.5.3.2  Argument Substitution Failure  When looking for a best match for a set of arguments for a function template, the compiler consid- ers whether the argument can be used in the way required by the complete function template decla- ration  including the return type . For example:  template  typename Iter::value_type mean Iter ﬁrst, Iter last ;  void f vector & v, int∗ p, int n  {  auto x = mean v.begin  ,v.end   ;  auto y = mean p,p+n ;     OK    error  Here,  the  initialization  of x succeeds  because  the  arguments  match  and vector ::iterator has  a member called value_type. The initialization of y fails because even though the arguments match, int∗ does not have a member called value_type, so we cannot say:  int∗::value_type mean int∗,int∗ ;      int* does not have a member called value_type  However, what if there were another deﬁnition of mean  ?  }  }  }   692  Templates   Chapter 23  template  typename Iter::value_type mean Iter ﬁrst, Iter last ;  template  T mean T∗,T∗ ;   void f vector & v, int∗ p, int n  {  auto x = mean v.begin  ,v.end   ;  auto y = mean p,p+n ;     OK: call 1    OK: call 2     1     2  }  }  This  works:  both  initializations  succeed. But  why didn’t we get  an  error  when  trying  to  match mean p,p+n  with the ﬁrst template deﬁnition? The arguments match perfectly, but by substituting in the actual template argument  int∗ , we get the function declaration:  int∗::value_type mean int∗,int∗ ;      int* does not have a member called value_type  That is garbage, of course: a pointer does not have a member value_type. Fortunately, considering this possible declaration is not by itself an error. There is a language rule  §iso.14.8.2  that says that such a substitution failure is not an error. It simply causes the template to be ignored; that is, the  template  does  not  contribute  a  specialization  to  the  overload  set. That  done, mean p,p+n  matches declaration 2, which is called.  Without  the  ‘‘substitution  error  is  not  a  failure’’ rule,  we  would  get  compile-time  errors  even when error-free alternatives  such as 2  are available.  More, this rule gives us a general tool for selecting among templates. Techniques based on this rule are described in §28.4. In particular, the standard library provides enable_if to simplify conditional deﬁnition of templates  §35.4.2 .  The rule is known under the unpronounceable acronym SFINAE  Substitution Failure Is Not An Error .  SFINAE is often used as a verb with the ‘‘F’’ pronounced as a ‘‘v’’: ‘‘I SFINAEd away that constructor.’’ That sounds quite impressive, but I tend to avoid this jargon.  ‘‘The constructor was eliminated by a substitution failure’’ is clearer for most people and does less violence to the English language.  So, if – in the process of generating a candidate function to resolve a function call – the com- piler  ﬁnds  itself  generating  a  template  specialization  that  would  be  nonsensical,  that  candidate  is not entered into the overloading set. A template specialization is considered nonsensical if it would lead to a type error. In this, we consider only a declaration; template function deﬁnitions and the deﬁnition  of  class  members  are  not  considered   or  generated   unless  they are  actually  used. For example:  template  Iter mean Iter ﬁrst, Iter last  {  typename Iter::value_type = ∗ﬁrst;    ...  template  T∗ mean T∗,T∗ ;      1     2   Section 23.5.3.2  Argument Substitution Failure  693  void f vector & v, int∗ p, int n  {  auto x = mean v.begin  ,v.end   ;  auto y = mean p,p+n ;     OK: call 1    error :ambiguous  The declaration of mean   1 is ﬁne for mean p,p+n . The compiler does not start to instantiate the body of that mean   and eliminate it because of the type error.  Here, the result is an ambiguity error. Had mean   2 not been present, declaration 1 would have been chosen and we would have suffered an instantiation-time error. Thus, a function may be chosen as the best match yet still fail to compile.  23.5.3.3  Overloading and Derivation  The overload resolution rules ensure that function templates interact properly with inheritance:  template  class B {  * ...*  }; template   class D : public B  {  * ...*  };  template  void f B ∗ ;  void g B ∗ pb, D ∗ pd  {  f pb ;  f pd ;      f  pb  of course    f  static_cast *> pd  ;    standard conversion D * to B * used  }  }  In this example, the function template f   accepts a B ∗ for any type T. We hav e an argument of type D ∗, so the compiler easily deduces that by choosing T to be int, the call can be uniquely resolved to a call of f B ∗ .  23.5.3.4  Overloading and Non-Deduced Parameters  A function argument that is not involved in the deduction of a template parameter is treated exactly as  an  argument  of  a  non-template  function. In  particular, the  usual  conversion  rules  hold. Con- sider:  template  T get_nth C& p, int n ;     get the nth element  This function presumably returns the value of the nth element of a container of type C. Because C has to be deduced from an actual argument of get_nth   in a call, conversions are not applicable to the ﬁrst argument.  However, the second argument is perfectly ordinary, so the full range of possi- ble conversions is considered. For example:   694  Templates   Chapter 23  struct Index {  operator int  ;    ...  void f vector & v, shor t s, Index i  {  int i1 = get_nth  v,2 ;    exact match int i2 = get_nth  v,s ;    standard conversion: shorttoint int i3 = get_nth  v,i ;     user-deﬁned conversion: Indextoint  This notation is sometimes called explicit specialization  §23.5.1 .  23.6  Template Aliases We can deﬁne an alias for a type with the using syntax or with the typedef syntax  §6.5 . The using syntax is more general in the important sense that it can be used to deﬁne an alias for a template with some of its arguments bound. Consider:  template > vector;  using Cvec = vector ;      both arguments are bound  Cvec vc = {'a', 'b', 'c'};     vc is a vector >  template  using Vec = vector >;      vector using myallocator  2nd argument is bound   Vec  ﬁb = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13};     ﬁb is a vector >  In general, if we bind all arguments of a template, we get a type, but if we bind only some, we get a template.  Note that what we get from using in an alias deﬁnition is always an alias. That is, when we use the alias, it is completely equivalent to a use of the original template. For example:  vector > vc2 = vc; vector > verbose = ﬁb;     vc2 and vc are of the same type    verbose and ﬁb are of the same type  The equivalence of the alias and the original template implies that if you specialize the template, you  correctly  get the specializations when you use the alias. For example:     idea: int_exact_traits ::type is a type with exactly N bits  template  struct int_exact_traits {  using type = int;  template  struct int_exact_traits  {  using type = char;  };  }  };  };   Section 23.6  Template Aliases  695  template  struct int_exact_traits  {  using type = short;  };  template  using int_exact = typename int_exact_traits ::type;     deﬁne alias for convenient notation  int_exact  a = 7;     int_exact  is an int with 8 bits  If specializations did not get used through the alias, we couldn’t claim that int_exact was simply an alias  for int_exact_traits ::type; they would  behave  differently. On the  other  hand,  you  cannot deﬁne a specialization of an alias. If you had been able to, it would have  been rather easy for a human reader to get confused about what was specialized, so no syntax is provided for specializing an alias.  23.7  Source Code Organization There are three reasonably obvious ways of organizing code using templates:  [1]  [2]   [3]   Include template deﬁnitions before their use in a translation unit. Include template declarations  only  before their use in a translation unit. Include deﬁni- tions of templates later in the translation unit  potentially after their use . Include template declarations  only  before their use in a translation unit. Deﬁne the tem- plates in some other translation unit.  For technical and historical reasons, option [3], the separate compilation of template deﬁnitions and their  uses,  is  not  offered.  By far the  most  common  approach  is  to  include   usually include  the deﬁnition of the templates you use in every translation unit in which you use them and rely on your implementation to optimize compile times and eliminate object code duplication. For example, I might provide a template out   in a header out.h:     ﬁle out.h:  include   template  void out const T& t  {  std::cerr << t;  }     ﬁle user1.cpp:  include "out.h"    use out    We would include this header wherever out   was needed.  For example:   Chapter 23  That is, the deﬁnition of out   and all declarations on which it depends are included in sev eral dif- ferent compilation units. It is up to the compiler to generate code when needed  only  and to opti- mize the process of reading redundant deﬁnitions. This strategy treats template functions the same way as inline functions.  An obvious problem with this strategy is that users may accidentally come to depend on decla- rations included only for the beneﬁt of the deﬁnition of out  . This danger can be limited by taking approach [2] ‘‘include template deﬁnitions later,’’ by using namespaces, by avoiding macros, and generally by reducing the amount of information included. The ideal is to minimize a template def- inition’s dependency on its environment.  To  use the ‘‘include template deﬁnitions later’’ approach for our simple out   example, we ﬁrst  split out.h into two.  The declarations go into a .h ﬁle:  696  Templates   and     ﬁle user2.cpp:  include "out.h"    use out       ﬁle outdecl.h:  template  void out const T& t ;  The deﬁnitions go into out.cpp:     ﬁle out.cpp:  include   template  void out const T& t  {  std::cerr << t;  }  A user now includes both:     ﬁle user3.cpp:  include "out.h"    use out   include "out.cpp"  This minimizes the chances of the implementation of the templates having undesirable effects on the user code. Unfortunately, it also increases the chances that something in the user code  say, a macro  will have an undesirable effect on the template deﬁnitions.  As ever,  non-inline, non-template functions and static members  §16.2.12  must have a unique deﬁnition  in  some  compilation  unit. This  implies  that  such  members  are  best  not  used  for  tem- plates that are otherwise included in many translation units. As shown with out  , the deﬁnition of a template function may be replicated in different translation units, so beware of contexts that might   Section 23.7  Source Code Organization   697  subtly change the meaning of a deﬁnition:     ﬁle user1.cpp:  include "out.h"    use out    and     ﬁle user4.cpp:  deﬁne std MyLib include "out.c"    use out    This sneaky and error-prone use of a macro changes the deﬁnition of out so that user4.cpp’s deﬁni- tion  differs  from user1.cpp’s. This  is  an  error, but  it  is  an  error  that  an  implementation  may  not catch.  This kind of error can be very hard to detect in large programs, so be careful to minimize context dependencies of templates and be very suspicious about macros  §12.6 .  If you need more control over the context of instantiation, you can use explicit instantiation and  extern templates  §26.2.2 .  23.7.1  Linkage The rules for linkage of templates are the rules for linkage of the generated classes and functions  §15.2, §15.2.3 . This implies that if the layout of a class template or the deﬁnition of an inline function template changes, all code that uses that class or function must be recompiled.  For templates deﬁned in header ﬁles and included ‘‘everywhere’’ this can imply a lot of recom- pilation because templates tend to include a lot of information in header ﬁles, more than non-tem- plate  code  using .cpp ﬁles.  In particular, if dynamically  linked  libraries  are  used,  care  has  to  be taken that all uses of a template are consistently deﬁned.  Sometimes, it is possible to minimize the exposure to changes in complicated template libraries by encapsulating their use in functions with non-template interfaces.  For example, I might like to implement some computations using a general numerical library supporting a wide variety of types  e.g., Chapter 29, §40.4, §40.5, §40.6 . However, I often know the type used for my calculations. For example, in a program I may consistently use doubles and vector . In that case, I could deﬁne:  double accum const vector & v  {  return accumulate v.begin  ,v.end  ,0.0 ;  }  Given that, I can use the simple non-templated declaration of accum   in my code:  double accum const vector & v ;  The dependence on std::accumulate has disappeared into a .cpp ﬁle that is not seen by the rest of my code.  Also, I suffer the compilation-time overhead of a include  only in that .cpp ﬁle.   698  Templates   Chapter 23  Note that I took the opportunity to simplify the interface to accum   compared to std::accumu- late  . The generality that is a key  attribute of good template libraries can be seen as a source of complexity in a particular application.  I suspect  that  I  would  not  use  this  technique  for  standard-library  templates. Those  are  stable over years and known to the implementations. In particular, I did not bother to try to encapsulate vector . Howev er,  for  more  complex,  esoteric,  or  frequently  changing  template  libraries, such encapsulation can be useful.  23.8  Advice [1]  Use templates to express algorithms that apply to many argument types; §23.1.

In other words, what programming techniques are effective when you use templates?  Templates offer:   cid:129  The  ability  to  pass  types   as  well  as  values  and  templates   as  arguments  without  loss  of information.  This implies excellent opportunities for inlining, of which current implementa- tions take great advantage.   cid:129  Delayed  type  checking   done  at  instantiation  time . This  implies  opportunities  to  weave  together information from different contexts.   cid:129  The ability to pass constant values as arguments.  This implies the ability to do compile-time  computation.  In other words, templates provide a powerful mechanism for compile-time computation and type manipulation that can lead to very compact and efﬁcient code. Remember that types  classes  can contain both code and values.   700  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  The ﬁrst and most common use of templates is to support generic programming, that is, pro- gramming focused on the design, implementation, and use of general algorithms. Here, ‘‘general’’ means that an algorithm can be designed to accept a wide variety of types as long as they meet the algorithm’s requirements on its arguments.  The template is C++’s main support for generic pro- gramming.  Templates provide  compile-time  parametric polymorphism.  There are many deﬁnitions of ‘‘generic programming.’’  Thus, the term can be confusing. How- ev er, in the context of C++, ‘‘generic programming’’ implies an emphasis on the design of general algorithms implemented using templates.  Focusing more on generative techniques  seeing templates as type and function generators  and relying on type functions to express compile-time computation are called template metaprogram- ming, which is the subject of Chapter 28.  The type checking provided for templates checks the use of arguments in the template deﬁnition rather than against an explicit interface  in a template declaration . This provides a compile-time variant of what is often called duck typing  ‘‘If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it’s a duck’’ .  Or – using  more  technical  terminology  –  we  operate  on  values,  and  the  presence  and meaning of an operation depend solely on its operand values.  This differs from the alternative view that objects have types, which determine the presence and meaning of operations. Values ‘‘live’’ in objects.  This is the way objects  e.g., variables  work in C++, and only values that meet an object’s requirements  can  be  put  into  it. What  is  done  at  compile  time  using  templates  does  not  involve objects, only values.  In particular, there are no variables at compile time. Thus, template program- ming resembles programming in dynamically-typed programming languages, but the run-time cost is  zero,  and  errors  that  in  a  run-time  typed  language  manifest  themselves  as  exceptions  become compile-time errors in C++.  A key aspect of generic programming, metaprogramming, and probably all uses of templates is the uniform handling of built-in types and user-deﬁned types. For example, an accumulate   opera- tion  does  not  care  whether  the  types  of  values  it  adds  up  are ints, complex s,  or Matrixes. What it cares about is that they can be added using the + operator. The use of a type as a template argument does not imply or require the use of a class hierarchy or any form of run-time self-identi- ﬁcation  of  the  type  of  an  object. This  is  logically  pleasing  and  essential  for  high-performance applications.  This section focuses on two aspects of generic programming:  cid:129  Lifting: generalizing an algorithm to allow the greatest  reasonable  range of argument types  §24.2 ,  that  is,  to  limit  an  algorithm’s  or  a  class’s   dependency on properties  to  what  is essential   cid:129  Concepts: carefully and precisely specifying the requirements of an algorithm  or a class  on  its arguments  §24.3   24.2  Algorithms and Lifting A function template is a generalization of an ordinary function in the sense that it can perform its actions on a variety of data types and use a variety of operations passed as arguments to implement those actions. An algorithm is a procedure or formula for solving a problem: a ﬁnite series of com- putation steps to produce a result. Thus, a function template is often called an algorithm.   Section 24.2  Algorithms and Lifting  701  How do we get from a function doing speciﬁc operations on speciﬁc data to an algorithm doing more general operations on a variety of data types? The most effective way of getting a good algo- rithm is to generalize from one – and preferably more – concrete example.  Such generalization is called lifting: that is, lifting a general algorithm from speciﬁc functions. It is important to go from the concrete to the abstract while maintaining performance and keeping an eye on what is reason- able.  Overly clever programmers can generalize to an absurd extent to try to cover every eventual- ity. Thus, trying to abstract from ﬁrst principles in the absence of concrete examples typically leads to bloated, hard-to-use code.  I will illustrate the process of lifting by a concrete example.  Consider: double add_all double∗ array, int n      one concrete algorithm on array ofdoubles  Obviously, this computes the sum of the doubles in the argument array. Also consider:  double s {0}; for  int i = 0; i<n; ++i  s = s + array[i];  return s;  struct Node {  Node∗ next; int data;  int sum_elements Node∗ ﬁrst, Node∗ last      another concrete algorithm on list of ints  int s = 0; while  ﬁrst!=last  {  s +=ﬁrst −>data; ﬁrst = ﬁrst−>next;  } return s;  {  }  {  }  };  This computes the sum of the ints in the singly-linked list implemented by the Nodes.  These  two code  fragments  differ  in  detail  and  in  style,  but  an  experienced  programmer  will immediately say, ‘‘Well, this is just two implementations of the accumulate algorithm.’’  This is a popular algorithm. Like most popular algorithms, it has many names, including reduce, fold, sum, and aggregate.  However, let us try to develop a general algorithm from the two concrete examples in stages, so as to get a feel for the process of lifting. First we try to abstract away the data types so that we don’t hav e to be speciﬁc about   cid:129   cid:129   double vs. array vs. linked list.  int, or   702  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  To make this concrete, we need three operations to access the ‘‘container’’ data structure:     somehowparameter izebythe value type and the container type  To do so, I write some pseudo code:     pseudo code:  T sum data   T s = 0 while  not at end  {  s = s + current value get next data element  } return s  Obviously, this is rather imprecise, but we can turn it into code:  For the actual data, we also need three operations:   cid:129  Not at end  cid:129  Get current value  cid:129  Get next data element  Initialize to zero   cid:129   cid:129  Add  cid:129  Return the result     concrete STL-likecode:  template  Val sum Iter ﬁrst, Iter last  {  Val s = 0; while  ﬁrst!=last  { s = s +∗ﬁrst; ++ﬁrst;  } return s;  {  }  }   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   Here, I took advantage of knowing the usual STL way of representing a sequence of values  §4.5 . The sequence is represented as a pair of iterators supporting three operations:  ∗ for accessing the current value ++ for moving forward to the next element != for comparing iterators to check if we are at the end of a sequence  We  now  hav e an algorithm  a function template  that can be used for both arrays and linked lists and for both ints and doubles.  The array example works immediately because double∗ is an exam- ple of an iterator:  double ad[] = {1,2,3,4}; double s = sum  ad,ad+4 ;   Section 24.2  Algorithms and Lifting  703  To  use the handcrafted singly-linked list, we need to provide an iterator for it. Given a few opera- tions, a Node∗ can be the iterator:  struct Node { Node∗ next; int data; };  Node∗ operator++ Node∗ p  { return p−>next; } int operator∗ Node∗ p  { return p−>data; } Node∗ end lst  { return nullptr; }  void test Node∗ lst  {  int s = sum  lst,end lst  ;  I use the nullptr as the end iterator. I use an explicit template argument  here,    to allow a caller to specify the type to use for the accumulator variable.  What we have so far is more general than a lot of real-world code. For example, sum   would work for lists of ﬂoating-point numbers  of all precisions , for arrays of integers  of all ranges , and for many other types, such as a vector . Importantly, sum   is as efﬁcient as the handcrafted functions we started from. We do not want to achieve generality at the cost of performance.  The experienced programmer will note that sum   can be generalized further. In particular, the use of an extra template argument is awkward, and we required the initial value 0. We can solve that by letting the caller supply an initial value and then deduce Val:  template  Val accumulate Iter ﬁrst, Iter last, Val s  {  while  ﬁrst!=last  { s = s +∗ﬁrst; ++ﬁrst;  } return s;  double ad[] = {1,2,3,4}; double s1 = accumulate ad,ad+4,0.0 ;  double s2 = accumulate ad,ad+4,0 ;      accumulate in a double    accumulate in an int  But why +? We sometimes want to multiply elements. In fact, there seem to be quite a few opera- tions we might want to apply to the elements of a sequence. This leads to a further generalization:  template  Val accumulate Iter ﬁrst, Iter last, Val s, Oper op  {  while  ﬁrst!=last  {  s = op s,∗ﬁrst ; ++ﬁrst;  } return s;  }  }  }   704  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  We now use the argument op to combine element values with the accumulator. For example:  double ad[] = {1,2,3,4}; double s1 = accumulate ad,ad+4,0.0,std::plus  ;  double s2 = accumulate ad,ad+4,1.0,std::multiply  ;     as before  The standard library provides common operations, such as plus and multiply, as function objects to be used as arguments.  Here, we see the utility of having the caller supply the initial value: 0 and ∗ don’t go well  together  for  accumulation. The  standard  library  offers  a  further  generalization  of accumulate   that allows a user to provide an alternative to = for combining the result of the ‘‘addi- tion’’ and the accumulator  §40.6 .  Lifting is a skill that requires knowledge of an application domain and some experience.  The most important single guide for designing algorithms is to lift them from concrete examples with- out  adding  features   notation  or  run-time  cost   that  would  impair  their  use. The  standard-library algorithms are the results of lifting done with great attention to performance issues.  24.3  Concepts What are a template’s requirements for its arguments?  In other words, what does the template code assume about its argument types? Or conversely, what must a type provide to be acceptable as an argument to a template? The possibilities are inﬁnite because we can build classes and templates with arbitrary properties, for example:  cid:129  Types that provide − but not +  cid:129  Types that can copy but not move values  cid:129  Types for which copy operations does not copy  §17.5.1.3   cid:129  Types for which == compares equality and others for which compare   does that  cid:129  Types  that  deﬁne  addition  as  a  member  function plus   and  others  that  deﬁne  it  as  a  non-  member function operator+    In that direction lies chaos. If every class has a unique interface, it becomes difﬁcult to write tem- plates that can take many different types. Conversely, if each template’s requirements are unique, it becomes difﬁcult to deﬁne types that can be used with many templates.  We would have to remem- ber and keep track of a multitude of interfaces; that’s feasible for a tiny program, but unmanageable for real-world libraries and programs. What we need to do is to identify a small number of con- cepts  sets of requirements  that can be used for many templates and many types as arguments.  The ideal is a kind of ‘‘plug compatibility’’ as we know it from the physical world, with a small number of standard plug designs.  24.3.1  Discovering a Concept As an example, consider the String class template from §23.2:  template  class String {     ...  };  What is required of a type, X, for it to be used as an argument to String: String ? More generally,   Section 24.3.1  Discovering a Concept  705  what does it take to be a character in such a character string class? An experienced designer will have a small number of likely answers to that question and start the design based on those. How- ev er, let us consider how we might answer it from ﬁrst principles. We proceed through three stages of analysis:  [1]  First, we look at our  initial  implementation and determine which properties  operations, functions, member types, etc.  it uses from its parameter types  and the meaning of those operations .  The resulting  list  is  the  minimal  requirements  for  that  particular  template implementation.  [2]  Next,  we  look  at  plausible  alternative  template  implementations  and  list  their  require- ments on their template arguments.  Doing so, we may decide that we should place more or  stricter  requirements  on  the  template  arguments  to  allow for  alternative  implementa- tions.  Alternatively, we might  decide  to  prefer  an  implementation  that  makes  fewer and or simpler requirements.  [3]  Finally, we look at the resulting list  or lists  of required properties and compare it to lists of requirements  concepts  that we have used for other templates. We  try to ﬁnd simple, preferably common, concepts that can express what would otherwise be many long lists of requirements. The aim here is to make our design beneﬁt from general work on classi- ﬁcation.  The resulting  concepts  are  easier  to  give  meaningful  names  and  easier  to remember. They should  also  maximize  the  degree  of  interoperability  of  templates  and types by limiting variations in concepts to what is essential.  The ﬁrst two steps are – for fundamental reasons – very similar to the way we generalize  ‘‘lift’’  concrete  algorithms  into  generic  algorithms   §24.2 . The  last  step  counteracts  the  temptation  to provide each algorithm with a set of argument requirements that exactly match its implementation. Such requirement lists are overspecialized and not stable: each change to the implementation would imply changes to the requirements documented as part of the algorithm’s interface.  For String , ﬁrst consider the operations actually performed on the parameter C by the imple- mentation of String  §19.3 .  That will be the minimal set of requirements for that implementation of String:  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  Cs are copied by copy assignment and copy initialization. String compares Cs using == and !=. String makes arrays of Cs  that implies default construction of Cs . String takes the address of Cs. Cs are destroyed when a String is destroyed. String has >> and << operators that somehow must read and write Cs.  Requirements [4] and [5] are technical requirements that we usually assume for all data types, and I will not discuss types that fail to meet them; such types are almost all overly clever artifacts.  The ﬁrst  requirement  –  that  values  can  be  copied  –  is  not  true  for  a  few important  types,  such  as std::unique_ptr, that  represent  real  resources   §5.2.1,  §34.3.1 . However,  it is true  for  almost  all ‘‘ordinary types,’’  so we require it. The ability to invoke a copy operation goes together with the semantic requirement that a copy really is a copy of the original, that is, that – except for taking the address  –  the  two copies  behave  identically. Therefore,  the  ability  to  copy usually   as  for  our String  goes together with the requirement to provide == with the usual semantics.  By  requiring  assignment,  we  imply  that  a const type  cannot  be  used  as  a  template  argument. For example, String  is  not  guaranteed  to  work.  That’s ﬁne  in  this  case,  as  in  most   706  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  cases.  Having  assignment  means  that  an  algorithm  can  use  temporary  variables  of  its  argument type, create containers of objects of an argument type, etc. It does not imply that we cannot use const to specify interfaces.  For example:  template  bool operator== const String & s1, const String & s2  {  if  s1.size  !=s2.siz e    return false; for  auto i = 0; i!=s1.size  ; ++i   if  s1[i]!=s2[i]  return false;  return true;  }  For String  we require that objects of type X can be copied. Independently, through the consts in its argument types, operator==   promises not to write to the X elements.  Should we require a move for an element type C? After all, we provide move operations for String . We could, but it’s not essential: what we do with a C can be handled by copying, and if some copy is implicitly turned into a move  e.g., when we returned a C , so much the better. In par- ticular, potentially important examples, such as String >, will work ﬁne  correctly and efﬁciently  without adding move operations to the requirements.  So far, so good, but the last requirement  that we can read and write Cs using >> and <<  seems excessive. Do we really read and write every kind of string? Maybe it would be better to say that if we read and write a String , then X must provide >> and <<? That is, instead of placing a require- ment on C for the whole String, we require it  only  for Strings that we actually read and write.  This is an important and fundamental design choice: we can place a requirement on class tem- plate arguments  so that they apply to all class members  or just to template arguments on individ- ual class function members. The latter is more ﬂexible, but also more verbose  we have to express the requirement for each function that needs it  and harder for a programmer to remember.  Looking at the list of requirements so far, I note the absence of a couple of operations that are  common for ‘‘ordinary characters’’ in ‘‘ordinary strings’’:  [1]  No ordering  e.g., <  [2]  No conversion to an integer value  After  this  initial  analysis  we  can  consider  which  ‘‘well-known  concepts’’  §24.3.2   our  lists  of requirements  relate  to. The  central  concept  for  ‘‘ordinary  types’’ is regular. A regular  type is  a type that   cid:129    cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   you  can  copy  using  assignment  or  initialization   with  the  proper  copy semantics  §17.5.1.3 , you can default construct, doesn’t hav e problems  with  various  minor  technical  requirements   such  as  taking  the address of a variable , you can compare for equality  using == and != .  That  seems  an  excellent  choice  for  our String template  arguments.  I considered  leaving  out  the equality comparisons but decided that copying without equality is rarely useful. Typically, Regular is the safe bet, and thinking about the meaning of == can help avoid errors in the deﬁnition of copy- ing.  All the built-in types are regular.   Section 24.3.1  Discovering a Concept  707  But does it make sense to leave out ordering  <  for String? Consider how we use strings. The desired use of a template  such as String  should determine its requirements on its arguments.  We do  compare  strings  extensively, and  in  addition  we  use  comparisons  indirectly  when  we  sort sequences of strings, we put strings into sets, etc. Also, the standard-library string does provide <. It is usually a good idea to look to the standard for inspiration. So, we require not just Regular for our String, but also ordering. That’s the concept Ordered.  Interestingly, there has been quite some debate on whether Regular should require < or not. It seems that most types related to numbers have a natural order. For example, characters are encoded in bit patterns that can be interpreted as integers, and any sequence of values can be lexicographi- cally  ordered. However,  many types  do  not  have  a  natural  order   e.g.,  complex numbers  and images   even though  we  could  deﬁne  one. Other  types  have  sev eral  natural  orderings,  but  no unique best ordering  e.g., records may be ordered by name or by address . Finally, some  reason- able  types simply don’t hav e an order. For example, consider:  enum class rsp { rock, scissors, paper };  The rock-scissors-and-paper game critically depends on   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   scissors<rock, rock<paper, and paper<scissors.  However, our String is not supposed to take an arbitrary type as its character type; it is supposed to take a type that supports string operations  such as comparisons, sorting, and I O , so I decided to require ordering.  Adding a default constructor and the == and < operator, to our requirements for String’s template argument allows us to provide several useful operations for String. In fact, the more we require of a template argument type, the easier the various tasks become for the template implementer and the more  services  the  template  can  offer  to  its  users. On  the  other  hand,  it  is  important  not  to  load down  a  template  with  requirements  that  are  only  used  rarely  and  by  speciﬁc  operations:  each requirement places a burden on the implementer of argument types and limits the set of types that can be used as arguments.  So, for String  we require:   cid:129  Ordered   cid:129   cid:129  Convertibility to an integer  only  if we deﬁne and use a conversion operation from X  >> and  ’s >> and <<  So far, we hav e expressed our requirement of a character type for String in terms of syntactic prop- erties, such as X must provide copy operations, ==, and <. In addition, we must require that these operations  have  the  right  semantics;  for  example,  a  copy operation  makes  a  copy, ==  equality  compares for equality, and <  less than  provides ordering. Often, this semantics involves relations among the operations. For example, for the standard library, we hav e  §31.2.2.1 :   cid:129  The  result  of  a  copy compares  equal  to  anything  the  original  compares  equal  to   a==b  implies T{a}==T{b}  and the copy is independent of its source  §17.5.1.3 .  cid:129  A less-than comparison  e.g., <  provides a strict weak order  §31.2.2.1 .  The semantics are deﬁned in English text or  better still  mathematics, but unfortunately we have no  way  of  expressing  semantic  requirements  in  C++  itself   but  see  §24.4.1 . For the  standard library, you can ﬁnd the semantic requirements written in formalized English in the ISO standard.   708  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  24.3.2  Concepts and Constraints A concept is not an arbitrary collection of properties. Most lists of properties of a type  or a set of types  do not deﬁne a coherent and useful concept. To be useful as a concept, a list of requirements has to reﬂect the needs of a set of algorithms or a set of operations of a template class. In many ﬁelds of endeavor,  people have  designed or discovered concepts describing the fundamental con- cepts of the ﬁeld  the technical use of the word ‘‘concept’’ in C++ was chosen with this common usage in mind . There seem to be surprisingly few concepts that make sense.  For example, algebra builds on concepts such as monad, ﬁeld, and ring, whereas the STL relies on concepts such as for- ward iterator, bidirectional iterator, and random-access iterator. Finding a new concept in a ﬁeld is a major accomplishment; it is not something you should expect to do every year. Mostly, you ﬁnd concepts by examining the foundational texts of a ﬁeld of study or an application domain. The set of concepts used in this book are described in §24.4.4.  ‘‘Concepts’’ is a very general idea that does not inherently have anything to do with templates. Even K&R C [Kernighan,1978] had concepts in the sense that signed integral type is the language’s generalization of the idea of an integer in memory. Our requirements on template arguments are concepts  however expressed , so most interesting issues related to concepts come in the context of templates.  I see a concept as a carefully crafted entity that reﬂects fundamental properties of an application domain.  Consequently, there should be only few concepts, and these can act as a guideline for the design of algorithms and types. The analogy is with physical plugs and sockets; we want the mini- mal number to simplify our lives and to keep design and construction costs down.  This ideal can conﬂict with the ideal of minimal requirements for each individual generic algorithm  §24.2  and each individual parameterized class. Furthermore, the ideal can conﬂict with the ideal of providing absolutely minimal interfaces to classes  §16.2.3  and even with what some programmers regard as their  right  to  write  their  code  ‘‘exactly  as  they like.’’  Howev er,  we don’t get  plug  compatibility without effort and some form of standard.  I set the bar for being a concept very high: I require generality, some stability, usability across many algorithms, semantic consistency,  and more. In fact, many simple constraints that we’d like for template arguments don’t qualify as concepts according to my criteria. I think that is unavoid- able.  In particular, we write many templates that do not reﬂect general algorithms or widely appli- cable types. Instead, they are implementation details, and their arguments only have to reﬂect the necessary details of a template intended for a single use in a single implementation of something. I call requirements for such template arguments constraints or  if you must  ad hoc concepts. One way to look  at  constraints  is  to  consider  them  incomplete   partial   speciﬁcations  of  an  interface. Often, a partial speciﬁcation can be useful and much better than no speciﬁcation.  As  an  example,  consider  a  library  for  experimenting  with  balancing  strategies  for  balanced  binary trees. The tree takes a Balancer as a template argument:  template  struct node_base {    base of balanced tree     ...  }  A balancer is simply a class that provides three operations on nodes. For example:   Section 24.3.2  Concepts and Constraints  709  struct Red_black_balance {     ... template  static void add_ﬁxup Node∗ x ; template  static void touch Node∗ x ; template  static void detach Node∗ x ;  };  Obviously, we’d like to say what’s required of node_base’s arguments, but a balancer is not meant to be a widely used and easily understood interface; it’s meant to be used only as a detail of a par- ticular implementation of balanced trees. This idea of a balancer  I hesitate to use the word ‘‘con- cept’’   is  unlikely  to  be  used  elsewhere  or  even to survive  a  major  rewrite  of  the  balanced  tree implementation unchanged. It would be hard to pin down the exact semantics of a balancer. For starters,  the  semantics  of Balancer would  critically  depend  on  the  semantics  of Node. In those aspects, a Balancer differs from a proper concept, such as Random_access_iterator. We can, how- ev er, still use the minimal speciﬁcation of a balancer, ‘‘provides those three functions on nodes,’’ as a constraint on arguments to a node_base.  Note the way ‘‘semantics’’ keep cropping up in the discussion of concepts. I ﬁnd that ‘‘Can I write out a semiformal semantics?’’ to be the question that is most helpful when it comes to decid- ing whether something is a concept or simply an ad hoc collection of constraints on a type  or set of types .  If I can write out a meaningful semantic speciﬁcation, I have a concept.  If not, what I have is a constraint that may be useful but shouldn’t be expected to be stable or widely useful.  24.4  Making Concepts Concrete Unfortunately, C++  does  not  have  speciﬁc  language  facilities  for  directly  expressing  concepts. However,  handling  ‘‘concepts’’ as a design  notion  only  and  presenting  them  informally  as  com- ments is not ideal. For starters, compilers do not understand comments, so requirements expressed only as comments must be checked by the programmer and cannot help the compiler provide good error messages. Experience shows that even though concepts cannot be represented perfectly with- out  direct  language  support,  we  can  approximate  them  using  code  that  performs  compile-time checks of template argument properties.  A concept is a predicate; that is, we think of a concept as a compile-time function that looks at a set of template arguments and returns true if they meet the concept’s requirements and false if they don’t.  So, we implement a concept as a constexpr function.  Here, I will use the term constraints check to refer to a call of a constexpr predicate that checks a concept for a set of types and values. In  contrast  to  proper  concepts,  a  constraints  check  does  not  deal  with  semantic  issues;  it  simply checks assumptions about syntactic properties.  Consider our String; its character type argument is supposed to be Ordered:  template  class String {  };  static_assert Ordered   ,"String's character type is not ordered" ;    ...  When String  is instantiated for a type X, the static_assert will be executed by the compiler. If   710  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  Ordered    returns true, the compilation proceeds, generating exactly the code it would have done without the assert. Otherwise, the error message is produced.  At ﬁrst glance, this looks rather reasonable for a workaround.  I’d rather have said:  template  class String {     ...  };  template  constexpr bool Ordered   {  However, that is for the future, so let us see how to deﬁne the predicate Ordered   :  return Regular    && Totally_ordered   ;  That is, a type is Ordered if it is both Regular and Totally_ordered. Let us ‘‘dig down’’ to see what that means:  }  }  }  template  constexpr bool Totally_ordered   {  return Equality_comparable         has == and !=  && Has_less   && Boolean >   && Has_greater    && Boolean >   && Has_less_equal    && Boolean >   && Has_greater_equal    && Boolean >  ;  template  constexpr bool Equality_comparable   {  return Has_equal    && Boolean >    && Has_not_equal    && Boolean >  ;  So, a type T is ordered if it is regular and provides the usual six comparison operations. The com- parison operations have to deliver results that can be converted to bool. The comparison operators are also supposed to have their proper mathematical meaning. The C++ standard precisely speci- ﬁes what that means  §31.2.2.1, §iso.25.4 .  Has_equals is implemented using enable_if and the techniques described in §28.4.4. I capitalize  my  constraints  names   e.g., Regular  even though  doing  so  violates  my  ‘‘house style’’ of capitalizing  type  and  template  names,  but  not  functions. However,  concepts  are  even more fundamental than types, so I feel a need to emphasize them. I also keep them in a separate namespace  Estd  in the hope that very similar names will eventually become part of the language or the standard library.  Digging a bit further into the set of useful concepts, we can deﬁne Regular:   }  }  }  }  Section 24.4  Making Concepts Concrete   711  template  constexpr bool Regular   {  return Semiregular    && Equality_comparable   ;  Equality_comparable gives us == and !=. Semiregular is the concept that express the notion of a type that doesn’t hav e unusual technical restrictions:  template  constexpr bool Semiregular   {  return Destructible     && Default_constructible    && Move_constructible    && Move_assignable    && Copy_constructible    && Copy_assignable   ;  A Semiregular can be both moved and copied. That describes most types, but there are examples of types that cannot be copied, such as unique_ptr. Howev er, I don’t know of useful types that can be copied but not moved.  Types that can neither be moved nor copied, such as type_info  §22.5 , are very rare and tend to reﬂect system properties.  We can also use constraints checks for functions; for example:  template  ostream& operator & s  {  static_assert Streamable   ,"String's character not streamable" ; out << '"'; for  int i=0; i!=s.size  ; ++i  cout << s[i]; out << '"';  The concept Streamable needed by String’s output operator << requires its argument C to provide the output operator <<:  template  constexpr bool Streamable   {  return Input_streamable    && Output_streamable   ;  That is, Streamable tests that we can use the standard stream I O  §4.3, Chapter 38  for a type.  Checking concepts through constraints-check templates has obvious weaknesses:  cid:129  Constraints checks are placed in deﬁnitions, but they really belong in declarations. That is, a concept is part of the interface to an abstraction, but a constraints check can be used only in its implementation.   cid:129  The checking of constraints occurs as part of the instantiation of the constraints-check tem- plate.  Therefore, the checking may occur later than we would like.  In particular, we would   712  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  have  preferred  for  a  constraints  check  to  be  guaranteed  to  be  done  by  the  compiler  at  the point of the ﬁrst call, but that is impossible without language changes.   cid:129  We can forget to insert a constraints check  especially for a function template .  cid:129  The compiler does not check that a template implementation uses only the properties speci- ﬁed in its concepts. Thus, a template implementation may pass the constraints check, yet still fail to type check.   cid:129  We do not specify semantic properties in a way that a compiler can understand  e.g., we use  comments .  Adding  constraints  checks  makes  the  requirements  on  template  arguments  explicit,  and  if  a  con- straints  check  is  well  designed,  it  leads  to  more  comprehensible  error  messages. If  we  forget  to insert constraints checks, we are back to the ordinary type checking of the code generated by tem- plate instantiation. That can be unfortunate, but it is not disastrous. These constraints checks are a technique for making checking of designs based on concepts more robust, rather than an integral part of the type system.  If we want to, we can place constraints checks almost anywhere.  For example, to guarantee that a particular  type  is  checked  against  a  particular  concept,  we  could  place  constraints  checks  in  a namespace scope  e.g., the global scope . For example:  static_assert Ordered ,"std::string is not Ordered" ;  static_assert Ordered >,"String  is not Ordered" ;     will fail     will succeed  The ﬁrst static_assert checks if the standard string is Ordered  it is, because it provides ==, !=, and < .  The second checks if our String is Ordered  it is not, because I ‘‘forgot’’ to deﬁne < .  Using such a global check will perform the constraints check independently of whether we actually use that particular specialization of a template in the program. Depending on our aims, that can be an advantage or a bother. Such a check forces type checking to be done at a speciﬁc point in the pro- gram; that is usually good for error isolation. Also, such checks can help unit testing. However, for programs using a number of libraries, explicit checks quickly become unmanageable.  Being Regular is an ideal for a type. We can copy objects of regular types, put them into vectors and  arrays,  compare  them,  etc. If  a  type  is Ordered, we can  also  use  its  objects  in  sets,  sort sequences of such objects, etc. So, we go back and improve our String to make it Ordered. In par- ticular, we add < to provide a lexicographical ordering:  template  bool operator & s1, const String & s2  {  static_assert Ordered   ,"String's character type not ordered" ; bool eq = true; for  int i=0; i!=s1.size   && i!=s2.size  ; ++i  {  if  s2[i]<s1[i]  return false; if  s1[i]<s2[i]  eq = false;     not s1==s2  } if  s2.size  <s1.siz e    return false; if  s1.size  ==s2.siz e   && eq  return false; return true;     s2 is shorter than s1     s1==s2  }   Section 24.4  Making Concepts Concrete   713  24.4.1  Axioms As in mathematics, an axiom is something we can’t prove. It is something we assume to be true. In  the  context  of  requirements  for  template  arguments,  we  use  ‘‘axiom’’ in that  sense  to  refer  to semantic properties. We use an axiom to state what a class or an algorithm assumes about its set of inputs.  An axiom, however expressed, represents an algorithm’s or class’s expectations of  assump- tions about  its arguments.  We cannot in general test to see whether an axiom holds for values of a type  that is one reason we refer to them as axioms . Furthermore, an axiom is only required to hold for the values actually used by an algorithm. For example, an algorithm can carefully avoid dereferencing  null  pointers  or  copying  a  ﬂoating-point  NaN. If  so,  it  could  have  axioms  that require  pointers  to  be  dereferenceable  and  ﬂoating-point  values  to  be  copyable.  Alternatively, axioms can be written with the general assumption that singular values  e.g., NaN and nullptr  vio- late some precondition, so that they need not be considered.  C++ does not  currently  have any way of expressing axioms, but as for concepts, we can make  our idea of a concept a bit more concrete than a comment or some text in a design document.  Consider how we might express some of the key semantic requirements for a type to be regular:  template  bool Copy_equality T x  {  return T{x}==x;     acopycompares equal to what it is a copyof     semantics of copyconstr uction  template  bool Copy_assign_equality T x, T& y  {     semantics of assignment  return  y=x, y==x ;     the result of an assignment compares equal to the source of the assignment  In other words, copy operations make copies.  template  bool Move_effect T x, T& y  {     semantics of move  return  x==y ? T{std::move x }==y  : true  && can_destroy y ;  template  bool Move_assign_effect T x, T& y, T& z  {     semantics of move assignment  return  y==z ?  x=std::move y , x==z   : true  && can_destroy y ;  In other words, a move operation yields a value that compares equal to whatever the source of the move operation compared equal to, and the source of the move can be destroyed.  These  axioms  are  represented  as  executable  code. We  might  use  them  for  testing,  but  most importantly, we hav e to think harder to express them than we would have to simply write a com- ment.  The resulting axioms are more precisely stated than would have been the case in ‘‘ordinary English.’’  Basically, we can express such pseudo axioms using ﬁrst-order predicate logic.  }  }  }  }   714  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  24.4.2  Multi-argument Concepts When looking at a single-argument concept and applying it to a type, it looks very much as if we are doing conventional type checking and that the concept is the type of a type. That’s part of the story, but only a part. Often, we ﬁnd that relationships among argument types are essential for cor- rect speciﬁcation and use. Consider the standard-library ﬁnd   algorithm:  template  Iter ﬁnd Iter b, Iter e, Val x ;  The Iter template argument must be an input iterator, and we can  relatively  easily deﬁne a con- straints-check template for that concept.  So far, so good, but ﬁnd   depends critically on comparing x to elements of the sequence [b:e . We  need to specify that comparison is required; that is, we need to state that Val and and the value type of the input iterator are equality comparable. That requires a two-argument version of Equal- ity_comparable:  template  constexpr bool Equality_comparable A a, B b  {  return Common     && Totally_ordered    && Totally_ordered    && Totally_ordered >   && Has_less    && Boolean >   && Has_less    && Boolean >   && Has_greater    && Boolean >   && Has_greater    && Boolean >   && Has_less_equal    && Boolean >   && Has_less_equal    && Boolean >   && Has_greater_equal    && Boolean >   && Has_greater_equal    && Boolean >  ;  This is rather verbose for a simple concept. However, I wanted to be explicit about all of the opera- tors and about the symmetry of their use rather than burying the complexity in a generalization.  };  Given that, we can deﬁne ﬁnd  :  template  Iter ﬁnd Iter b, Iter e, Val x  {  while  b!=e  {  if  ∗b==x  return b; ++b;  } return b;  }  static_assert Input_iterator   ,"ﬁnd   requires an input iterator" ; static_assert Equality_comparable ,Val>  ,  "ﬁnd  's iterator and value arguments must match" ;   Section 24.4.2  Multi-argument Concepts  715  Multi-argument concepts are particularly common and useful when specifying generic algorithms. This is also the area where you ﬁnd the greatest number of concepts and the greatest need to spec- ify  new concepts   as  opposed  to  picking  ‘‘standard  ones’’ from  a  catalog  of  common  concepts . The variations among well-deﬁned types appear to be somewhat more limited than the variations among algorithms’ requirements on their arguments.  24.4.3  Value Concepts Concepts can express arbitrary  syntactic  requirements on a set of template arguments.  In particu- lar, a template  argument  can  be  an  integer  value,  so  concepts  can  take integer  arguments.  For example, we can write a constraints check to test that a value template argument is small:  template  constexpr bool Small_size   {  return N<=8;  A more realistic example would be a concept for which the numeric argument was just one among others.  For example:  constexpr int stack_limit = 2048;  template  constexpr bool Stackable    {  return Regular    && sizeof T ∗N<=stack_limit;     Tisregular and N elements of T can ﬁt on a small stack  This implements a notion of ‘‘small enough to be stack allocated.’’  It might be used like this:  }  }  }  template  struct Buffer {     ...  };  template  void fct   {  static_assert Stackable   ,"fct   buffer won't ﬁt on stack" ; Buffer  buf;    ...  Compared to the fundamental concepts for types, value concepts tend to be small and ad hoc.  24.4.4  Constraints Checks The constraints checks used in this book can be found on the book’s support site. They are not part of a standard, and I hope that in the future they will be replaced by a proper language mechanism. However,  they can be useful for thinking about template and type design and reﬂect the de facto   716  Generic Programming   Chapter 24  concepts in the standard library. They should go in a separate namespace to avoid interfering with possible  future  language  features  and  alternative  implementations  of  the  idea  of  concepts. I use namespace Estd, but  that  may  be  an  alias   §14.4.2 . Here  are  a  few constraints  checks  that  you might ﬁnd useful:   cid:129    cid:129   Input_iterator : X is an iterator that we can use only once to traverse a sequence  forward using ++ , reading each element once only.   cid:129  Output_iterator : X is an iterator that we can use only once to traverse a sequence  forward  using ++ , writing each element once only. Forward_iterator : X is an iterator that we can use to traverse a sequence  forward using ++ .  This is what a singly-linked list  e.g., forward_list  naturally supports.   cid:129  Bidirectional_iterator : X is an iterator that we can move both forward  using ++  and back-  ward  using −− .  This is what a doubly-linked list  e.g., list  naturally supports.   cid:129  Random_access_iterator : X is an iterator that we can use to traverse a sequence  forward and backward  and to randomly access elements using subscripting and positioning using += and −=. This is what an array naturally supports. Equality_comparable : An X can be compared with a Y using == and !=. Totally_ordered : X and Y are Equality_comparable and an X can be compared with a Y using   and >=. Semiregular : Xs can be copied, default constructed, allocated on the free store, and are free of minor annoying technical restrictions.   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129  Regular : Xs are Semiregular and  can  be  compared  using  equality. The  standard-library  containers require their elements to be regular.   cid:129  Ordered : Xs are Regular and Totally_ordered. The standard-library associative containers  require their elements to be ordered unless you explicitly provide a comparison operation.   cid:129  Assignable : A Y can be assigned to an X using =.  cid:129   cid:129   cid:129  Movable : An X can be moved; that is, it has a move constructor and a move assignment.  Predicate : An F can be called for an X yielding a bool. Streamable : An X can be read and written using iostreams.  In addition, an X is addressable and destructible.   cid:129  Copyable : An X is Movable and can also be copied.  cid:129  Conver tible : An X can be implicitly converted to a Y.  cid:129  Common : An X and  a Y can  unambiguously  be  converted  to  a  common  type  called Common_type . This is a formalization of the language rule for compatibility of oper- ands  to ?:  §11.1.3 .  For  example, Common_type  is Base∗ and Com- mon_type  is long.   cid:129  Range : An X that can be used by a range-for  §9.5.1 , that is, X must provide members, x.begin   and x.end  , or nonmember  equivalents, begin x  and end x , with  the  required semantics.  Obviously, these  deﬁnitions  are  informal. In  most  cases,  these  concepts  are  based  on  standard- library  type  predicates   §35.4.1 ,  and  the  ISO  C++  standard  provides  formal  deﬁnitions   e.g., §iso.17.6.3 .   Section 24.4.5  Template Deﬁnition Checking  717  24.4.5  Template Deﬁnition Checking A constraints-check template ensures that a type provides the properties required by the concept. If the implementation of a template in fact uses more properties than its concepts guarantee, we may get type errors. For example, the standard-library ﬁnd   requires a pair of input iterators as argu- ments, but we might  incautiously  have deﬁned it like this:  template  Iter ﬁnd Iter b, Iter e, Val x  {  static_assert Input_iterator   ,"ﬁnd  : Iter is not a Forward iterator" ; static_assert Equality_comparable ,Val> , "ﬁnd  : value type doesn't match iterator" ;  while  b!=e  {  if  ∗b==x  return b; b = b+1;   } return b;     note: not ++b  }  }  Now, b+1 is an error unless b is a random-access iterator  and not just a forward iterator as ensured by  the  constraints  check . However,  the  constraints  check  does  not  help  us  detect  that  problem. For example:  void f list & lst, vector & vs  {  auto p = ﬁnd lst.begin  ,lst.end  ,1209 ; auto q = ﬁnd vs.begin  ,vs.end  ,"Cambridge" ;     ...     error :list does not provide +    OK: vector provides +  The call of ﬁnd   for the list will fail  because + is not deﬁned for the forward iterator provided by list  and the call for the vector will succeed  because b+1 is ﬁne for vector ::iterator .  Constraints  checks  primarily  provide  a  service  to  the  user  of  a  template:  the  actual  template arguments are checked against the template’s requirements.  On the other hand, constraints checks do not help a template writer who would like to be sure that the implementation doesn’t use any properties beyond those speciﬁed in the concepts. Ideally, the type system would ensure that, but that requires language features that are still in the future. So, how do we test the implementation of a parameterized class or a generic algorithm?  Concepts provide a strong guideline: the implementation should use no property of an argument that isn’t speciﬁed by the concepts, so we should test the implementation with arguments that pro- vide  the  properties  speciﬁed  by  the  implementation’s concepts,  and  only  those. Such  a  type  is sometimes called an archetype.  So, for the ﬁnd   example, we look at Forward_iterator and Equality_comparable or at the stan- dard’s deﬁnition of the forward-iterator and equal-comparable concepts  §iso.17.6.3.1, §iso.24.2.5 . Then, we decide that we need an Iterator type that provides at least:   718  Generic Programming   Chapter 24   cid:129  A default constructor  cid:129  A copy constructor and a copy assignment  cid:129  Operators == and !=  cid:129  A preﬁx operator ++  cid:129  A type Value_type   cid:129  A preﬁx operator ∗  cid:129  The ability to assign the result of ∗ to a Value_type   cid:129  The ability to assign a Value_type  to the result of ∗  This is slightly simpliﬁed from the standard-library forward iterator, but sufﬁcient for ﬁnd  . Con- structing that list by looking at the concepts is easy.  Given this list, we need to ﬁnd or deﬁne a type that provides only the desired features. For a forward iterator, as needed by ﬁnd  , the standard-library forward_list ﬁts the bill perfectly. This is because ‘‘forward iterator’’ was deﬁned to express the idea of something that allows us to iterate through a singly-linked list. It is not uncommon that a popular type is an archetype for a popular concept.  If we decide to use an existing type, we have to be careful, though, not to pick a type that is more ﬂexible than required. For example, the typical mistake when testing algorithms, such as ﬁnd  , is to use a vector. Howev er,  the very generality and ﬂexibility that make vector so popular make it unusable as an archetype for many simple algorithms.  If we can’t ﬁnd an existing type that ﬁts our needs, we must deﬁne one ourselves.  That is done  by going through the list of requirements and deﬁning suitable members:  template  struct Forward {       forchecking ﬁnd    Forward  ; Forward const Forward& ; Forward operator= const Forward& ; bool operator== const Forward& ; bool operator!= const Forward& ; void operator++  ; Val& operator∗  ;      simpliﬁed: does not handle a proxy for Val  template  using Value_type > = Val;      simpliﬁed; see §28.2.4  };  }  void f   {  Forward  p = ﬁnd Forward {},Forward {},7 ;  At this level of testing, we need not check that these operations actually implement the right seman- tics.  We just check that the template implementation does not rely on properties that it should not.  Here,  I  have  simpliﬁed  the  testing  by  not  introducing  an  archetype  for  the Val argument. Instead,  I  simply  used int. Testing  nontrivial  conversions  between  an  archetype  for Val and  an archetype for Iter would be signiﬁcantly more work and most likely not particularly useful.  Writing a test harness that checks the implementation of ﬁnd   against std::forward_list or X is not  trivial,  but  it  is  not  among  the  most  difﬁcult  tasks  facing  a  designer  of  generic  algorithms.   Section 24.4.5  Template Deﬁnition Checking  719  Using a relatively small and well-speciﬁed set of concepts makes the task manageable. The tests can and should be completely compile-time.  Note  that  this  simple  speciﬁcation  and  checking  strategy  leads  to ﬁnd   requiring  its  iterator argument to have a Value_type type function  §28.2 . That allows pointers to be used as iterators. For many template parameters it is important that built-in types can be used as well as user-deﬁned types  §1.2.2, §25.2.1 .  24.5  Advice [1]  A template can pass argument types without loss of information; §24.1.

In particular, templates are key to techniques for   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   improving type safety  e.g., by eliminating the use of casts; §12.5 ; raising the general level of abstraction of programs  e.g., by using standard containers and algorithms; §4.4, §4.5, §7.4.3, Chapter 31, Chapter 32 ; and providing  more  ﬂexible,  type-safe,  and  efﬁcient  parameterization  of  types  and  algorithms  §25.2.3 .  These techniques all critically rely on the ability of template code to use template arguments with- out overhead and in a type-safe manner. Most techniques also rely on the type deduction mecha- nisms  offered  by  templates   sometimes  called compile-time  polymorphism; §27.2 .  These tech- niques  are  the  backbone  of  C++  use  in  performance-critical  areas,  such  as  high-performance numerical computing and embedded systems programming. For mature examples, see the standard library  Part IV .   722   Specialization  Chapter 25  This chapter and the following two present simple examples of the advanced and or specialized language  features  supporting  techniques  aimed  at  uncompromised  ﬂexibility  and  performance. Many of these techniques are primarily developed for and used by library implementers. Like most programmers, I prefer to forget about the more advanced techniques most of the time. Where I can, I keep my code simple and rely on libraries so that I can beneﬁt from the use of advanced features in the hands of experts in a given application domain.  Templates are introduced in §3.4. This chapter is part of a sequence presenting templates and  their uses:   cid:129  Chapter 23 gives a more detailed introduction to templates.  cid:129  Chapter 24 discusses generic programming, the most common use of templates.  cid:129  Chapter 25  this chapter  shows how to specialize a template with a set of arguments.  cid:129  Chapter 26 focuses on template implementation issues related to name binding.  cid:129  Chapter 27 discusses the relation between templates and class hierarchies.  cid:129  Chapter 28 focuses on templates as a language for generating classes and functions.  cid:129  Chapter 29 presents a larger example of template-based programming techniques.  25.2  Template Parameters and Arguments A template can take parameters:   cid:129  Type parameters of ‘‘type type’’  cid:129  Value parameters of built-in types such as ints  §25.2.2  and pointers to functions  §25.2.3   cid:129  Template parameters of ‘‘type template’’  §25.2.4   Type parameters are by far the most common, but value parameters are essential for many impor- tant techniques  §25.2.2, §28.3 .  A template can take a ﬁxed number of parameters or a variable number. The discussion of vari-  adic templates is postponed until §28.6.  Note that it is common to use short names with initial uppercase letters as names of template type arguments, for example, T, C, Cont, and Ptr. This is acceptable because such names tend to be conventional and restricted to a relatively small scope  §6.3.3 . However,  when using ALL_CAPS, there is always a chance of clashing with macros  §12.6 , so don’t use names that are long enough to clash with likely macro names.  25.2.1  Types as Arguments A template argument is deﬁned to be a type parameter by preﬁxing it with typename or class. The result of using either is completely equivalent.  Every type  built-in or user-deﬁned  is syntactically acceptable to a template declared to take a type parameter. For example:  template  void f T ;  template  class X {    ...  };   Section 25.2.1  Types as Arguments   723  f 1 ;  f  1 ;  f > 1 ;      Tdeduced to be int    Tisdouble    Tiscomplex   X  x1; X > x2;     Tisdouble    Tiscomplex   A type argument is unconstrained; that is, there is nothing in the interface of a class that constrains it to be a certain kind of type or part of a class hierarchy.  The validity of an argument type depends exclusively on its use in the templates, providing a form of duck typing  §24.1 . You can imple- ment general constraints as concepts  §24.3 .  User-deﬁned  and  built-in  types  are  handled  equivalently  when  used  as  template  arguments. This is essential for allowing us to deﬁne templates that work identically for user-deﬁned and built- in types. For example:  vector  x1; vector > x2;     vector of doubles    vector of complex   In particular, there is no space or time overhead implied by using either compared to the other:   cid:129  Values of built-in types are not ‘‘boxed’’ into special container objects.  cid:129  Values of all types are retrieved directly from a vector without use of potentially expensive   e.g., virtual  ‘‘get   functions.’’   cid:129  Values of user-deﬁned types are not implicitly accessed through references.  To be used as a template argument, a type must be in scope and accessible. For example:  class X {  class M {  * ...*  };    ... void mf  ;  void f   {  struct S {  * ...*  }; vector  vs; vector  vm;    ...  void M::mf   {  vector  vs; vector  vm;    ...  };  }  };     OK    error :X::M is private     error :no S in scope    OK   724   Specialization  Chapter 25  25.2.2  Values as Arguments A template parameter that is not a type or a template is called a value parameter and an argument passed to it a value argument. For example, integer arguments come in handy for supplying sizes and limits:  template  class Buffer { T v[max];  public:  Buffer   { }    ...  };  Buffer  cbuf; Buffer  ibuf; Buffer  rbuf;  Simple and constrained containers such as Buffer can be important where run-time efﬁciency and compactness are paramount. They avoid the use of free store implied by the use of a more general string or vector while not suffering from the implicit conversions to a pointer like a built-in array  §7.4 .  The standard-library array  §34.2.1  implements this idea.  An argument for a template value parameter can be  §iso.14.3.2 :  cid:129  An integral constant expression  §10.4   cid:129  A pointer or a reference to an object or a function with external linkage  §15.2   cid:129  A nonoverloaded pointer to member  §20.6   cid:129  A null pointer  §7.2.2   A pointer used as a template argument must be of the form &of, where of is the name of an object or a function, or of the form f, where f is the name of a function. A pointer to member must be of the form &X::of, where of is the name of a member. In particular, a string literal is not acceptable as a template argument:  template  class X {    ...  };  X  x1; char lx2[] = "BMW323Ci"; X  x2;     error :str ingliteral as template argument     OK: lx2 has exter nallinkage  This  restriction,  like the  one  against  ﬂoating-point  template  value  arguments,  exists  to  simplify implementation of separately compiled translation units. It is best to think of template value argu- ments as a mechanism for passing integers and pointers to functions. Resist the temptation to try something more clever.  Unfortunately  for no fundamental reason , literal types  §10.4.3  cannot be used as template value parameters. The value template arguments are the mechanism for some more advanced compile-time computation techniques  Chapter 28 . An integer template argument must be a constant. For example:   Section 25.2.2  Values as Arguments   725     error :constant expression expected    OK: constant expression  Conversely, a value  template  parameter  is  a  constant  within  the  template  so  that  an  attempt  to change the value of a parameter is an error. For example:     error :attempt to assign to template value argument  A type template parameter can be used as a type later in a template parameter list. For example:  constexpr int max = 200;  void f int i  {  Buffer  bx; Buffer  bm;    ...  }  };  };  template  class Buffer { T v[max];  public:  Buffer int i  { max = i; }    ...  template  class Vec {     ...  Vec  c1; Vec  c2;  This becomes particularly useful when combined with a default template argument  §25.2.5 ; for example:  template  class Vec {     ...  };  Vec  c1; Vec  c11; Vec  c2; Vec  c22;     default_value is int{}, that is,0     default_value is string{}; that is,""  25.2.3  Operations as Arguments Consider a slightly simpliﬁed version of the standard-library map  §31.4.3 :  template  class map {     ...  };   726   Specialization  Chapter 25  How do we supply comparison criteria for Keys?   cid:129  We can’t hardwire a comparison criterion into the container because the container can’t  in general  impose its needs on the element types. For example, by default, the map uses < for comparison, but not all Keys hav e a < that we would want to use.   cid:129  We can’t hardwire  an  ordering  criterion  into  the Key type  because   in  general   there  are many different  ways  of  ordering  elements  based  on  a  key. For  example,  one  of  the  most common Key types is string and strings can be ordered based on a variety of criteria  e.g., case sensitive and case insensitive .  Consequently, a sorting  criterion  is  not  built  into  the  container  type  or  into  the  element  type. In principle, the notion of sorting criteria for a map could be represented as:  [1]  A template value argument  e.g., a pointer to a comparison function  [2]  A template  type  argument  to  the map template  determining  the  type  of  a  comparison  At ﬁrst glance, the ﬁrst solution  pass a comparison object of a speciﬁc type  seems simpler. For example:  template  class map { public:  object  map  ;    ...  This map requires a user to supply the comparison as a function:  bool insensitive const string& x, const string& y  {     compare case insensitive e.g., "hello" equals "HellO"   map  m;     compare using insensitive    However, this is not very ﬂexible.  In particular, the designer of map will have to decide whether to compare the  unknown  Key type using a pointer to function or a function object of some speciﬁc type.  Also, because the argument types of the comparison operator must depend on the Key type, it can be hard to provide a default comparison criterion.  Consequently, the second alternative  pass the type of the comparison as a template type param-  eter  is the more common and the one used in the standard library. For example:  template > class map { public:  map   {  * ...*  } map Compare c  :cmp{c} {  * ...*  }    ... Compare cmp {};     use the default comparison    overr idethe default     default comparison  The  most  common  case,  comparing  using  less-than,  is  the  default.  If we  want  a  different  };  }  };   Section 25.2.3  Operations as Arguments   727  comparison criterion, we can supply it as a function object  §3.4.3 :  map  m1;     use the default comparison  less    map > m2;     compare using greater     Function objects can carry state. For example:  Complex_compare f3 {"French",3};  map  m3 {f3};     makeacompar isonobject  §25.2.5     compare using f3    We  can also use pointers to functions, including lambdas that can convert to a pointer to function  §11.4.5 .  For example:  using Cmp = bool ∗  const string&,const string& ; map  m4 {insensitive};     compare using a pointer to function  map  m4 {[] const string& a, const string b  { return a>b; } };  Passing the comparison operations as a function object has signiﬁcant beneﬁts compared to passing pointers to functions:   cid:129  A simple class member function deﬁned in-class is trivial to inline, whereas inlining a call  through a pointer to function requires exceptional attention from a compiler.  cid:129  A function object with no data members can be passed with no run-time cost.  cid:129  Sev eral operations can be passed as a single object with no additional run-time cost.  The comparison criterion for a map is just an example.  However,  the technique used to pass it is general  and  very  widely  used  to  parameterize  classes  and  functions  with  ‘‘policies.’’  Examples include actions for algorithms  §4.5.4, §32.4 , allocators for containers  §31.4, §34.4 , and deleters for unique_ptr  §34.3.1 .  We hav e the same design alternatives when we need to specify arguments for  a  function  template,  such  as sort  , and  the  standard  library  chooses  alternative  [2]  for  those cases also  e.g., see §32.4 .  If we had only one use of a comparison criterion in our program, it might make sense to use a  lambda to express the function object version a bit more tersely:  map  c3 {[] const string& x, const string& y  const { return x<y; }};    error  Unfortunately, that doesn’t work because there is no conversion of a lambda to a function object type.  We could name the lambda and then use that name:  auto cmp = [] const string& x, const string& y  const { return x<y; } map  c4 {cmp};  I ﬁnd  naming  operations  useful  from  a  design  and  maintenance  point  of  view.  Also,  anything named and declared nonlocally might ﬁnd other uses.  25.2.4  Templates as Arguments Sometimes it is useful to pass templates – rather than classes or values – as template arguments. For example:   728   Specialization  Chapter 25  template  class C> class Xrefd {  C  mems; C  refs;    ...  };  template   using My_vec = vector ;     use default allocator  Xrefd  x1;     store cross references for Entrys in a vector  template  class My_container {     ...  };  Xrefd  x2;     store cross references for Records in a My_container  To  declare a template as a template parameter, we must specify its required arguments.  For exam- ple, we specify that Xrefd’s  template parameter C is a template class that takes a single type argu- ment.  If we didn’t, we wouldn’t be able to use specializations of C. The point of using a template as a template parameter is usually that we want to instantiate it with a variety of argument types  such as T and T∗ in the previous example .  That is, we want to express the member declarations of a template in terms of another template, but we want that other template to be a parameter so that it can be speciﬁed by users.  Only class templates can be template arguments. The common case in which a template needs only a container or two is often better handled by  passing the container types  §31.5.1 . For example:  template  class Xrefd2 { C mems; C2 refs;    ...  };  Xrefd2 ,set > x;  Here, the value types of C and C2 can be obtained by a simple type function  §28.2  for obtaining the type of elements of a container, for example, Value_type . This is the technique used for the standard-library container adaptors, such as queue  §31.5.2 .  25.2.5  Default Template Arguments Explicitly  specifying  the  comparison  criterion  for  each  use  of map is  tedious  –  especially  as less  is typically the best choice. We can specify less  to be the default type for the Com- pare template argument, so that only uncommon comparison criteria have to be explicitly speciﬁed:   Section 25.2.5  Default Template Arguments   729  template > class map { public:  explicit map const Compare& comp ={} ;    ...  map  m1; map > m2;     will use less  for comparisons    same type as m1  struct No_case {     deﬁne operator     to do case-insensitivestr ingcompar ison  map  m3;     m3 is of a different type from m1 and m2  Note how the default map constructor creates a default comparison object, Compare{}. That’s the common case. If we want a more elaborate construction, we must do so explicitly. For example:  map  m {Complex_compare{"French",3}};  The semantic checking of a default argument for a template parameter is done only if that default argument is actually used. In particular, as long as we refrain from using the default template argu- ment less , we can compare   values  of  a  type X for  which less  wouldn’t compile.  This point is crucial in the design of the standard containers  e.g., std::map , which rely on a template argument to specify default values  §31.4 .  Just as for default function arguments  §12.2.5 , the default template arguments can be speciﬁed  and supplied for trailing arguments only:  void f1 int x = 0, int y ; void f2 int x = 0, int y = 1 ;     error :default argument not trailing    OK  f2 ,2 ;  f2 2 ;      syntax error    call f 2,1 ;  template  class X1 {    ...     error :default argument not trailing  template  class X2 {    ...     OK  X2  v1; X2  v2;     syntax error    v2 is an X2   Not allowing an ‘‘empty’’ argument to mean ‘‘use the default’’ was a deliberate tradeoff between ﬂexibility and the opportunity for obscure errors.  };  };  };  };   730   Specialization  Chapter 25  The technique of supplying a policy through a template argument and then defaulting that argu- ment  to  supply  the  most  common  policy is almost  universal  in  the  standard  library   e.g.,  §32.4 . Curiously  enough,  it  is  not  used  for basic_string  §23.2,  Chapter  36   comparisons. Instead,  the standard-library string relies on char_traits  §36.2.2 .  Similarly, the standard algorithms rely on iter- ator_traits  §33.1.3  and the standard-library containers rely on allocators  §34.4 .  The use of traits is presented in §28.2.4.  25.2.5.1  Default Function Template Arguments  Naturally, default template arguments can also be useful for function templates. For example:  template  Targ et to Source arg   {     convert Source to Target  stringstream interpreter; Targ et result;  if  ! interpreter << arg     ! interpreter >> result   ! interpreter >> std::ws .eof    throw runtime_error{"to    failed"};     writearg into stream    read result from stream    stuff left in stream?  return result;  }  A function template argument needs to be explicitly mentioned only if it cannot be deduced or if there is no default, so we can write:  auto x1 = to  1.2 ;  auto x2 = to  1.2 ; auto x3 = to  1.2 ; auto x4 = to 1.2 ;     very explicit  and verbose     Source is deduced to double    Target is defaulted to string; Source is deduced to double    the   is redundant  If all function template arguments are defaulted, the   can be left out  exactly as in function tem- plate specializations; §25.3.4.1 .  This  implementation  of to   is  a  bit  heavyweight  for  combinations  of  simple  types,  such  as to  int , but improved implementations can be supplied as specializations  §25.3 . Note that to  int  will not work because char and int do not share a string representation.  For conversion among scalar numeric types, I tend to prefer narrow_cast     §11.5 .  25.3  Specialization By default, a template gives a single deﬁnition to be used for every template argument  or combina- tion of template arguments  that a user can think of. This doesn’t always make sense for someone writing a template. I might want to say, ‘‘If the template argument is a pointer, use this implemen- tation; if it is not, use that implementation,’’  or ‘‘Give  an error unless the template argument is a pointer derived from class My_base.’’ Many such design concerns can be addressed by providing alternative deﬁnitions of the template and having the compiler choose between them based on the   Section 25.3  Specialization   731  template  arguments  provided  where  they are  used. Such  alternative  deﬁnitions  of  a  template  are called user-deﬁned specializations, or simply user specializations. Consider likely uses of a Vector:  template  class Vector {    general vector type  T∗ v; int sz;  public:  Vector  ; explicit Vector int ;  T& elem int i  { return v[i]; } T& operator[] int i ;  void swap Vector& ;    ...  };  Vector  vi; Vector  vps; Vector  vs; Vector  vpc; Vector  vpn;  In such code, most Vectors will be Vectors of some pointer type. There are several reasons for this, but the  primary  reason  is  that  to  preserve run-time  polymorphic  behavior, we must  use  pointers  §3.2.2, §20.3.2 . That is, anyone who practices object-oriented programming and uses type-safe containers  such as the standard-library containers  will end up with a lot of containers of pointers. The default behavior of most C++ implementations is to replicate the code for template func- tions.  This is usually good for run-time performance, but unless care is taken, it leads to code bloat in critical cases such as the Vector example.  Fortunately, there is an obvious solution. Containers of pointers can share a single implementa- tion.  This can be expressed through specialization. First, we deﬁne a version  a specialization  of Vector for pointers to void:  template  class Vector  {    void∗∗ p;    ... void∗& operator[] int i ;  };     complete specialization  This  specialization  can  then  be  used  as  the  common  implementation  for  all Vectors of pointers. Another use would be to implement unique_ptr  based on a single shared implementation class storing a void∗.  The template  preﬁx says that this is a specialization that can be speciﬁed without a template parameter. The template arguments for which the specialization is to be used are speciﬁed in   brackets after the name. That is, the   says that this deﬁnition is to be used as the implemen- tation of every Vector for which T is void∗.   732   Specialization  Chapter 25  The Vector  is a complete specialization. That is, there is no template parameter to spec-  ify or deduce when we use the specialization; Vector  is used for Vectors declared like this:  Vector  vpv;  To  deﬁne a specialization that is used for every Vector of pointers and only for Vectors of pointers, we can write:  template  class Vector  : private Vector  {   public:  using Base = Vector ;  Vector   {} explicit Vector int i  : Base i  {}     par tialspecialization  T∗& elem int i  { return reinterpret_cast  Base::elem i  ; } T∗& operator[] int i  { return reinterpret_cast  Base::operator[] i  ; }     ...  };  The specialization pattern   after the name says that this specialization is to be used for every pointer type; that is, this deﬁnition is to be used for every Vector with a template argument that can be expressed as T∗. For example:  Vector  vps;  Vector  vppi;        is   so T is Shape      is   so T is int*  A specialization with a pattern containing a template parameter is called a partial specialization in contrast to complete specializations  as in the deﬁnition of vector  , where ‘‘the pattern’’ is simply a speciﬁc type.  Note that when a partial specialization is used, a template parameter is deduced from the spe- cialization pattern; the template parameter is not simply the actual template argument.  In particu- lar, for Vector , T is Shape and not Shape∗.  Given this partial specialization of Vector, we hav e a shared implementation for all Vectors of pointers.  The Vector  class  is  simply  an  interface  to Vector  implemented  exclusively through derivation and inline expansion.  It is important that this reﬁnement of the implementation of Vector be achieved without affect- ing the interface presented to users. Specialization is a way of specifying alternative implementa- tions for different uses of a common interface.  Naturally, we could have giv en the general Vector and the Vector of pointers different names. However,  when I tried that, many people who should have known better forgot to use the pointer classes and found their code much larger than expected. In this case, it is much better to hide the crucial implementation details behind a common interface. This technique proved successful in curbing code bloat in real use. People who do not use a technique like this  in C++ or in other languages with similar facilities for type parameterization  have  found that replicated code can cost megabytes of code space even in moderately sized pro- grams.  By eliminating the time needed to compile those additional versions of the Vector opera- tions, this technique can also cut compile and link times dramatically. Using a single specialization   Section 25.3  Specialization   733  to implement all lists of pointers is an example of the general technique of minimizing code bloat by maximizing the amount of shared code.  Some compilers are getting smart enough to perform this particular optimization without help  from the programmer, but the technique is generally applicable and useful.  Variants  of  the  technique  of  using  a  single  run-time  representation  for  values  of  a  number  of types and relying on the  static  type system to ensure that they are used only according to their declared type has been called type erasure. In the context of C++, it was ﬁrst documented in the original template paper [Stroustrup,1988].  25.3.1  Interface Specialization Sometimes, a specialization is not an algorithmic optimization, but a modiﬁcation of an interface  or even a  representation .  For example, the standard library complex uses specializations to adjust the  set  of  constructors  and  the  argument  types  for  important  operations  for  important  specializa- tions   such  as complex  and complex  .  The general   primary   template   §25.3.1.1  looks like this:  template  class complex { public:  complex const T& re = T{}, const T& im = T{} ; complex const complex& ;  template      copyconstr uctor  complex const complex & ;      conversion from complex  to complex   Note that the scalar assignment operators take reference arguments.  That’s not efﬁcient for ﬂoats, so complex  passes those by value:  complex& operator= const complex& ; complex & operator= const T& ; complex & operator+= const T& ;    ... template   complex & operator= const complex & ;  template   complex & operator+= const complex & ;     ...  };  template  class complex  { public:     ... complex & operator=  ﬂoat ; complex & operator+= ﬂoat ;    ... complex & operator= const complex & ;    ...  };   734   Specialization  Chapter 25  For complex , that same optimization applies. In addition, conversions from complex  and complex  are provided  as described in §23.4.6 :  template  class complex  { public:  constexpr complex double re = 0.0, double im = 0.0 ; constexpr complex const complex & ; explicit constexpr complex const complex & ;    ...  Note that these specialized constructors are constexpr, making complex  a literal type. We could not do that for the general complex . Also, this deﬁnition takes advantage of the knowl- edge that conversion from complex  to complex  is safe  it never narrows , so that we can have an implicit constructor from complex . Howev er, the constructor from complex<long double> is explicit to make narrowing less likely.  25.3.1.1  Implementation Specialization  Specialization can be used to provide alternative implementations of a class template for a speciﬁc set of template parameters. In that case, a specialization can even provide a representation that dif- fers from that of the general template. For example:  };  };  };  };  template  class Matrix;     N-dimensional Matrix of Ts  template  class Matrix {     specialization for N==1  T val;    ...  template  class Matrix { T∗ elem; int sz;    ...     number of elements     specialization for N=1     specialization for N=2  template  class Matrix { T∗ elem; int dim1;    number of rows int dim2;    number of columns    ...   Section 25.3.2  The Primary Template   735  25.3.2  The Primary Template When we have both a general deﬁnition of a template and specializations deﬁning implementations for speciﬁc sets of template arguments, we refer to the most general template as the primary tem- plate. The primary template deﬁnes the interface for all specializations  §iso.14.5.5 . That is, the primary template is the one used to determine if a use is valid and takes part in overload resolution. Only after a primary template has been chosen are specializations considered.  The primary template must be declared before any specialization.  For example:  template  class List  {     ...     ...  };  };  };  template  class List {     error :pr imarytemplate after specialization  The critical information supplied by the primary template is the set of template parameters that the user must supply to use it or any of its specializations. If we have deﬁned a constraints check for a template  §24.4 , the primary template is where it belongs because concepts are something a user cares about and must understand to use the template. For example:  template  class List {  static_assert Regular   ,"List : T must be Regular" ;    ...  For technical  reasons   because  the  language  doesn’t recognize  constraints  checks  for  what  they are , a constraints check needs to be replicated in every specialization.  A declaration of the primary template is sufﬁcient to allow the deﬁnition of a specialization:  template  class List;     not a deﬁnition  template  class List  {     ...  };  template  class List {     ...  };  If used, the primary template must be deﬁned somewhere  §23.7 . If the primary template is never instantiated, it need not be deﬁned. This can be used to deﬁne a template for which only a ﬁxed set of alternative arguments are accepted. If a user specializes a template, that specialization must be in scope for every use of the template with the type for which it was specialized. For example:   736   Specialization  Chapter 25  List  li;  template  class List  {       ...  };     error :specialization used before deﬁned  Here, List was specialized for int∗ after List  had been used.  It is essential that every use of a template for a given set of template arguments be implemented by the same specialization. If not, the type system is broken, so that identical uses of a template in different places may yield different results and objects created in different parts of a program may not be compatible. Clearly that would be disastrous, so a programmer must take care that explicit specialization  is  consistent  throughout  a  program. In  principle,  implementations  are  capable  of detecting inconsistent specialization, but the standard does not require them to and some don’t.  All specializations of a template must be declared in the same namespace as the primary tem- plate.  If used, a specialization that is explicitly declared  as opposed to generated from a more gen- eral template  must also be explicitly deﬁned somewhere  §23.7 . In other words, explicitly spe- cializing a template implies that no  other  deﬁnition is generated for that specialization.  25.3.3  Order of Specialization One specialization is more specialized than another if every argument list that matches its special- ization pattern also matches the other, but not vice versa.  For example:  template   class Vector;   template  class Vector ;   template      general; the primar ytemplate     specialized for anypointer  class Vector ;      specialized for void*  Every type can be used as a template argument for the most general Vector, but only pointers can be used for Vector  and only void∗s can be used for Vector .  The most specialized version will be preferred over the others in declarations of objects, point-  ers, etc.  §25.3 .  A specialization  pattern  can  be  speciﬁed  in  terms  of  types  composed  using  the  constructs  allowed for template parameter deduction  §23.5.2 .  25.3.4  Function Template Specialization Specialization  is  also  useful  for  template  functions   §25.2.5.1 . However,  we can  overload  func- tions,  so  we  see  less  specialization. Furthermore,  C++  supports  only  complete  specialization  for functions  §iso.14.7 , so we use overloading where we might have tried partial specialization.   Section 25.3.4.1  Specialization and Overloading   737  25.3.4.1  Specialization and Overloading  Consider the Shell sort from §12.5 and §23.5. Those versions compare elements using < and swap elements using detailed code. A better deﬁnition would be:  template  bool less T a, T b  {  return a<b;  template  void sort Vector & v  {  const size_t n = v.siz e  ;  for  int gap=n 2; 0<gap; gap =2   for  int i=gap; i!=n; ++i   for  int j=i−gap; 0<=j; j−=gap   if  less v[j+gap],v[j]    swap v[j],v[j+gap] ;  This does not improve the algorithm itself, but it allows improvements to its implementation. We now hav e less and swap as  named  entities  for  which  we  can  provide  improved versions.  Such names are often referred to as customization points.  As written, sort   will not sort a Vector  correctly because < will compare the two char∗s. That is, it will compare the addresses of the ﬁrst char in each string. Instead, we would like it to compare the characters pointed to. A simple specialization of less   for const char∗ will take care of that:  template  bool less  const char∗ a, const char∗ b  {  return strcmp a,b <0;  As for classes  §25.3 , the template  preﬁx says that this is a specialization that can be speciﬁed without a template parameter. The   after the template function name means that this specialization is to be used in cases where the template argument is const char∗. Because the tem- plate argument can be deduced from the function argument list, we need not specify it explicitly. So, we can simplify the deﬁnition of the specialization:  template  bool less  const char∗ a, const char∗ b  {  return strcmp a,b <0;  Given the template  preﬁx, the second empty   is redundant, so we would typically simply write:  }  }  }  }   738   Specialization  Chapter 25  template  bool less const char∗ a, const char∗ b  {  return strcmp a,b <0;  bool less const char∗ a, const char∗ b  {  return strcmp a,b <0;  I prefer this shorter form of declaration. We  can go further still. With this last version the distinc- tion between specialization and overloading has become razor thin and largely irrelevant, so we can simply write:  Now that  we  have  ‘‘specialized’’ less   to  a  version  that  is  semantically  correct,  we  can  consider what  we  might  do  for swap  . The  standard-library swap   is  correct  for  our  use  and  has  already been optimized for every type that has efﬁcient move operations.  Therefore, when we used swap   instead  of  the  three  potentially  expensive  copy operations,  we  improved performance  for  a  large number of argument types.  Specialization  comes  in  handy  when  an  irregularity  of  an  argument  type  causes  the  general algorithm to give an undesired result  such as less   for C-style strings . These ‘‘irregular types’’ are often the built-in pointer and array types.  25.3.4.2  Specialization That Is Not Overloading  How does  a  specialization  differ  from  overloading?  From a technical  point  of  view,  they differ because individual functions take part in overloading whereas only the primary template takes part in specialization  §25.3.1.1 . However,  I  can’t think of an example where that makes a practical difference.  There are a few uses of function specializations. For example, we can select among functions  taking no arguments:  template  T max_value  ;      no deﬁnition  template  constexpr int max_value    { return INT_MAX; } template  constexpr char max_value    { return CHAR_MAX; }   ...  template  Iter my_algo Iter p  {  auto x = max_value >  ;     ...     worksfor types with specialized max_value    I used the type function Value_type  to get the type of the object pointed to by an Iter  §24.4.2 .  To  get a roughly equivalent effect with overloading, we would have to pass a dummy  unused   argument.  For example:  }  }  }   Section 25.3.4.2  Specialization That Is Not Overloading   739  int max2 int  { return INT_MAX; } char max2 char  { return INT_MAX; }  template  Iter my_algo2 Iter p  {  auto x = max2 Value_type {} ;     ...  }     worksfor the types for which weoverload max2    25.4  Advice [1]  Use templates to improve type safety; §25.1.

To produce impressive code quality, a compiler combines code  information  from  the template deﬁnition and its lexical environment, the template arguments and their lexical environment, and the environment of the template’s use.  The key to the resulting performance is that the compiler is able to look at code from those contexts simultaneously and weave it together in ways that use all information available.  The problem with this is that code in a template deﬁnition isn’t as localized as we would prefer  all other things being equal .  Sometimes, we can get confused about what a name used in a template deﬁnition refers to:  Is it a local name? Is it a name associated with a template argument?   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   cid:129    742   Instantiation  Chapter 26   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   Is it a name from a base class in a hierarchy? Is it a name from a named namespace? Is it a global name?  This chapter discusses such questions related to name binding and considers their implications for programming styles.   cid:129  Templates were introduced in §3.4.1 and §3.4.2.  cid:129  Chapter 23 gives a detailed introduction to templates and the use of template arguments.  cid:129  Chapter 24 introduces generic programming and the key notion of concepts.  cid:129  Chapter  25  presents  details  of  class  templates  and  function  templates  and  introduces  the  notion of specialization.   cid:129  Chapter  27  discusses  the  relationship  between  templates  and  class  hierarchies   supporting  generic and object-oriented programming .   cid:129  Chapter 28 focuses on templates as a language for generating classes and functions.  cid:129  Chapter 29 presents a larger example of how the language facilities and programming tech-  niques can be used in combination.  26.2  Template Instantiation Given a template deﬁnition and a use of that template, it is the implementation’s job to generate correct code. From a class template and a set of template arguments, the compiler needs to gener- ate the deﬁnition of a class and the deﬁnitions of those of its member functions that were used in the program  and only those; §26.2.1 . From a template function and a set of template arguments, a function needs to be generated. This process is commonly called template instantiation.  The  generated  classes  and  functions  are  called specializations. When  we  need  to  distinguish between generated specializations and specializations explicitly written by the programmer  §25.3 , we refer to generated specializations and explicit specializations, respectively. An explicit special- ization is often referred to as a user-deﬁned specialization, or simply a user specialization.  To  use  templates  in  nontrivial  programs,  a  programmer  must  understand  the  basics  of  how names  used  in  a  template  deﬁnition  are  bound  to  declarations  and  how source  code  can  be organized  §23.7 .  By default, the compiler generates classes and functions from the templates used in accordance with  the  name-binding  rules   §26.3 . That  is,  a  programmer  need  not  state  explicitly  which  ver- sions of which templates must be generated. This is important because it is not easy for a program- mer to know exactly which versions of a template are needed. Often, templates that the program- mer hasn’t even heard of are used in the implementation of libraries, and sometimes templates that the programmer does know of are used with unknown template argument types. For example, the standard-library map  §4.4.3,  §31.4.3   is  implemented  in  terms  of  a  red-black  tree  template  with data types and operations unknown to all but the most curious user. In general, the set of generated functions needed can be known only by recursive examination of the templates used in application code libraries. Computers are better suited than humans for doing such analysis.  On the other hand, it is sometimes important for a programmer to be able to state speciﬁcally where  code  should  be  generated  from  a  template   §26.2.2 . By  doing  so,  the  programmer  gains detailed control over the context of the instantiation.   Section 26.2.1  When Is Instantiation Needed?  743  26.2.1  When Is Instantiation Needed? It is necessary to generate a specialization of a class template only if the class’s deﬁnition is needed  §iso.14.7.1 .  In particular, to declare a pointer to some class, the actual deﬁnition of a class is not needed.  For example:  class X; X∗ p;  X a;     OK: no deﬁnition of X needed    error :deﬁnition of X needed  When deﬁning template classes, this distinction can be crucial. A template class is not instantiated unless its deﬁnition is actually needed. For example:  template  class Link {  Link∗ suc;     ...  };     OK: no deﬁnition of Link needed  yet   Link ∗ pl;      no instantiation of Link  needed  yet   Link  lnk;     nowweneed to instantiate Link   A place where a template is used deﬁnes a point of instantiation  §26.3.3 .  An  implementation  instantiates  a  template  function  only  if  that  function  has  been  used. By ‘‘used’’ we mean ‘‘called or had its address taken.’’  In particular, instantiation of a class template does  not  imply  the  instantiation  of  all  of  its  member  functions. This  allows  the  programmer  an important degree of ﬂexibility when deﬁning a template class. Consider:  template  class List {     ... void sort  ;  };  };  }  class Glob {     ... no comparison operators ...  void f List & lb, List & ls  {  ls.sort  ;    ... use operations on lb,but not lb.sor t  ...  Here, List ::sort   is instantiated, but List ::sort   isn’t.  This both reduces the amount of code generated and saves us from having to redesign the program. Had List ::sort   been gen- erated, we would have had to either add the operations needed by List::sort   to Glob, redeﬁne sort   so that it wasn’t a member of List  the better design anyway , or use some other container for Globs.   744   Instantiation  Chapter 26  26.2.2  Manual Control of Instantiation The language does not require any explicit user action to achieve template instantiation. However, it does provide two mechanisms to help the user take control when needed. The need sometimes arises from a wish to   cid:129   cid:129   optimize the compile-and-link process by eliminating redundant replicated instantiations, or know exactly  which  point  of  instantiation  is  used  to  eliminate  surprises  from  complicated name-binding contexts.  An explicit instantiation request  often simply called an explicit instantiation  is a declaration of a specialization preﬁxed by the keyword template  not followed by < :  template class vector ; template int& vector ::operator[] int ; template int conver t  double ;      class    member function    nonmember function  A template declaration starts with template<, whereas plain template starts an instantiation request. Note that template preﬁxes a complete declaration; just stating a name is not sufﬁcient:  template vector ::operator[]; template conver t ;      syntax error    syntax error  As in template function calls, the template arguments that can be deduced from the function argu- ments can be omitted  §23.5.1 . For example:  template int conver t  double ;  template int conver t  double ;      OK  redundant     OK  When a class template is explicitly instantiated, every member function is also instantiated.  The link-time and recompilation efﬁciency impact of instantiation requests can be signiﬁcant. I have seen examples in which bundling most template instantiations into a single compilation unit cut the compile time from a number of hours to the equivalent number of minutes.  It is an error to have two deﬁnitions for the same specialization. It does not matter if such mul- tiple specializations are user-deﬁned  §25.3 , implicitly generated  §23.2.2 , or explicitly requested. However,  a  compiler  is  not  required  to  diagnose  multiple  instantiations  in  separate  compilation units.  This allows  a  smart  implementation  to  ignore  redundant  instantiations  and  thereby  avoid problems related to composition of programs from libraries using explicit instantiation. However, implementations are not required to be smart. Users of ‘‘less smart’’ implementations must avoid multiple instantiations. The worst that will happen if they don’t is that their program won’t link; there will be no silent changes of meaning.  To  complement  explicit  instantiation  requests,  the  language  provides  explicit  requests not to instantiate  usually called extern  templates .  The obvious use is to have  one explicit instantiation for a specialization and use extern  templates for its use in other translation units. This mirrors the classical use of one deﬁnition and many declarations  §15.2.3 . For example:  include "MyVector.h"  extern template class MyVector ;      suppresses implicit instantiation    explicitly instantiate elsewhere   Section 26.2.2  Manual Control of Instantiation  745  void foo MyVector & v  {     ... use the vector in here ...  }  The ‘‘elsewhere’’ might look something like this:  include "MyVector.h"  template class MyVector ;      instantiate in this translation unit; use this point of instantiation  In addition to generating specializations for all members of a class, the explicit instantiation also determines  a  single  point  of  instantiation  so  that  other  points  of  instantiation   §26.3.3   can  be ignored.  One use of this is to place the explicit instantiation in a shared library.  26.3  Name Binding Deﬁne template functions to minimize dependencies on nonlocal information. The reason is that a template will be used to generate functions and classes based on unknown types and in unknown contexts.  Every subtle context dependency is likely to surface as a problem for somebody – and that somebody is unlikely to want to know the implementation details of the template. The general rule of avoiding global names as much as possible should be taken especially seriously in template code.  Thus, we try to make template deﬁnitions as self-contained as possible and to supply much of what would otherwise have been global context in the form of template arguments  e.g., traits; §28.2.4, §33.1.3 . Use concepts to document dependencies on template arguments  §24.3 .  However, it is not unusual that some nonlocal names must be used to achieve the most elegant formulation of a template. In particular, it is more common to write a set of cooperating template functions  than  to  write  just  one  self-contained  function. Sometimes,  such  functions  can  be  class members, but not always.  Sometimes, nonlocal functions are the best choice. Typical examples of that  are sort  ’s  calls  to swap   and less    §25.3.4 .  The standard-library  algorithms  are  a  large- scale example  Chapter 32 . When something needs to be nonlocal, prefer a named namespace to the global scope. Doing so preserves some locality.  Operations  with  conventional  names  and  semantics,  such  as +, ∗, [], and sort  , are  another  source of nonlocal name use in a template deﬁnition. Consider:  bool tracing;  template  T sum std::vector & v  {  T t {}; if  tracing   t = t + v[i];  return t;  }  cerr << "sum " << &v << " \n";  for  int i = 0; i!=v.siz e  ; i++    746   Instantiation  Chapter 26     ...  }  include   void f std::vector & v  {  Quad c = sum v ;  The  innocent-looking  template  function sum   depends  on  several  names  that  are  not  explicitly speciﬁed in its deﬁnition, such as tracing, cerr, and the + operator. In this example, + is deﬁned in  :  Quad operator+ Quad,Quad ;  Importantly, nothing related to Quad is in scope when sum   is deﬁned, and the writer of sum   can- not be assumed to know about class Quad. In particular, the + may be deﬁned later than sum   in the program text, and even later in time.  The process of ﬁnding the declaration for each name explicitly or implicitly used in a template is called name binding. The general problem with template name binding is that three contexts are involved in a template instantiation and they cannot be cleanly separated:  [1]  The context of the template deﬁnition [2]  The context of the argument type declaration [3]  The context of the use of the template  When deﬁning a function template, we want to assure that enough context is available for the tem- plate  deﬁnition  to  make sense  in  terms  of  its  actual  arguments  without  picking  up  ‘‘accidental stuff’’ from  the  environment  of  a  point  of  use. To  help  with  this,  the  language  separates  names used in a template deﬁnition into two categories:  [1] Dependent names: names that depend on a template parameter. Such names are bound at a point of instantiation  §26.3.3 . In the sum   example, the deﬁnition of + can be found in the instantiation context because it takes operands of the template argument type. Nondependent names: names that don’t depend on a template parameter. Such names are bound at the point of deﬁnition of the template  §26.3.2 . In the sum   example, the tem- plate vector is deﬁned in the standard header  , and the Boolean tracing is in scope when the deﬁnition of sum   is encountered by the compiler.  [2]  To  be considered, both dependent and independent names must either be in scope at their point of use or be found by argument-dependent lookup  ADL; §14.2.4 .  The following subsections go into considerable technical detail about how dependent and non- dependent names in a template deﬁnition are bound for a specialization. For complete details, see §iso.14.6.  26.3.1  Dependent Names The simplest deﬁnition of ‘‘N depends on a template parameter T’’ would be ‘‘N is a member of T.’’ this  doesn’t quite  sufﬁce;  addition  of Quads  §26.3   is  a  counter-example. Unfortunately,   Section 26.3.1  Dependent Names  747  Consequently, a function call is said to depend on a template argument if and only if one of these conditions holds:  [1]  The type of the actual argument depends on a template parameter T according to the type  deduction rules  §23.5.2 , for example, f T 1  , f t , f g t  , and f &t , assuming that t is a T.  [2]  The function  called  has  a  parameter  that  depends  on T according  to  the  type  deduction  rules  §23.5.2 , for example, f T , f list & , and f const T∗ .  Basically, the name of a called function is dependent if it is obviously dependent by looking at its arguments or at its formal parameters. For example:  return g a ;     OK: a is a dependent name and therefore so is g  int z = f Quad{2} ;     f’sgisbound to g Quad   A call that by coincidence has an argument that matches an actual template parameter type is not dependent.  For example:  return gg Quad{1} ;      error :no gg   in scope and gg Quad{1}  doesn’t depend on T  Had gg Quad{1}  been  considered  dependent,  its  meaning  would  have  been  most  mysterious  to  a reader of the template deﬁnition. If a programmer wants gg Quad  to be called, gg Quad ’s declara- tion should be placed before the deﬁnition of ff   so that gg Quad  is in scope when ff   is analyzed. This is exactly the same rule as for non-template function deﬁnitions  §26.3.2 .  By default, a dependent name is assumed to name something that is not a type. So, to use a  dependent name as a type, you have to say so, using the keyword typename. For example:  template  void fct Container& c  {  Container::value_type v1 = c[7]; typename Container::value_type v2 = c[9]; auto v3 = c[11];    ...     syntax error:value_type is assumed to be a non-type name     OK: value_type assumed to name a type    OK: let the compiler ﬁgure it out  template  T f T a  {  class Quad {  * ...*  }; void g Quad ;  class Quad {  * ...*  };  template  T ff T a  {  int gg Quad ;  int zz = ff Quad{2} ;  }  }  }   748   Instantiation  Chapter 26  We can avoid such awkward use of typename by introducing a type alias  §23.6 . For example:  Naming a member template after a .  dot , −>, or :: requires similar use of the keyword template. For example:  template  using Value_type  = typename T::value_type;  template  void fct2 Container& c  {  Value_type  v1 = c[7];    ...     OK  class Pool { public:     some allocator  template  T∗ get  ; template  void release T∗ ;    ...  template  void f Alloc& all  {  int∗ p1 = all.get   ;  int∗ p2 = all.template get   ;     ...  void user Pool& pool { {  f pool ;    ...  }  };  }  }  int x;     syntax error:get is assumed to name a non-template    OK: get   is assumed to be a template  Compared to the use of typename to explicitly state that a name is assumed to name a type, the use of template to explicitly state that a name is assumed to name a template is rare. Note the differ- ence in the placement of the disambiguating keyword: typename appears before the qualiﬁed name and template immediately before the template name.  26.3.2  Point-of-Deﬁnition Binding When the compiler sees a template deﬁnition, it determines which names are dependent  §26.3.1 . If a name is dependent, looking for its declaration is postponed until instantiation time  §26.3.3 .  Names that do not depend on a template argument are treated like names that are not in tem-  plates; they must be in scope  §6.3.4  at the point of deﬁnition. For example:   Section 26.3.2  Point-of-Deﬁnition Binding  749  ++x;  ++y;  return a;     OK: x is in scope    error :no y in scope,and y doesn’t depend on T    OK: a is dependent  If a declaration is found, that declaration is used even if a ‘‘better’’ declaration might be found later. For example:     call g2 double ;    error :no g3   in scope    call g double ; g int  is not in scope  Here, ff   will call g double . The deﬁnition of g int  comes too late to be considered – just as if ff   had not been a template or if g had named a variable.  26.3.3  Point-of-Instantiation Binding The context used to determine the meaning of a dependent name  §26.3.1  is determined by the use of a template with a given set of arguments.  This is called a point of instantiation for that special- ization  §iso.14.6.4.1 . Each use of a template for a given set of template arguments deﬁnes a point of  instantiation. For a function  template,  that  point  is  in  the  nearest  global  or  namespace  scope enclosing its use, just after the declaration that contains that use. For example:  void g int ;  template  void f T a  {  g a ;      gisbound at a point of instantiation  template  T f T a  {  }  int y;  int z = f 2 ;  void g double ; void g2 double ;  template  int ff T a  {  g2 2 ;  g3 2 ;  g 2 ;     ...  void g int ; void g3 int ;  int x = ff a ;  }  }   750   Instantiation  Chapter 26  The point of instantiation for f    is outside h  . This is essential to ensure that the g   called in f   is the global g int  rather than the local g double . An unqualiﬁed name used in a template deﬁni- tion can never be bound to a local name. Ignoring local names is essential to prevent a lot of nasty macro-like behavior.  To enable recursive calls, the point of declaration for a function template is after the declaration  g a ;  if  i  h a−1 ;     gisbound at a point of instantiation    hisbound at a point of instantiation  void h int i  {  extern void g double ; f i ;  }    point of declaration for f   that instantiates it. For example:  void g int ;  template  void f T a  {  }  void h int i  {  extern void g double ; f i ;  }    point of declaration for f   containing its use.  template  class Container { vector  v;    ...  public:     elements  void sort  ;     ...     sor telements  };  }     point of instantiation of Container  void f   {  Container  c; c.sort  ;     point of use  Here, having the point of instantiation after the deﬁnition of h   is necessary to allow the  indirectly recursive  call h a−1 .  For a template class or a class member, the point of instantiation is just before the declaration   Section 26.3.3  Point-of-Instantiation Binding  751  Had the point of instantiation been after f   the call c.sort   would have failed to ﬁnd the deﬁnition of Container .  Relying on template arguments to make dependencies explicit simpliﬁes our thinking about the  template code and even allows us to access local information. For example:  Here, S is a local name, but since we use it as an explicit argument, rather than trying to bury its name in the deﬁnition of vector, we hav e no potentially surprising subtleties.  So  why don’t we completely  avoid  nonlocal  names  in  template  deﬁnitions? That  would  cer- tainly solve the technical problem with name lookup, but – as for ordinary function and class deﬁ- nitions – we want to be able to use ‘‘other functions and types’’ freely in our code. Turning every dependency into an argument can lead to very messy code. For example:  void fff   {  struct S { int a,b; }; vector  vs;    ...  template  void print_sorted vector & v  {  sort v.begin  ,v.end   ; for  const auto T& x : v   cout << x << '\n';  void use vector & vec  {     ... print_sorted vec ;  }  }  }  }  }  template  void print_sorted vector & v, S sor t, ostream& os  {  sort v.begin  ,v.end   ; for  const auto T& x : v   os << x << '\n';  void fct vector & vec  {     ... using Iter = decltype vs.begin   ;  print_sorted some_vec,std::sort ,std::cout ;     vec’siterator type     sor tusing std::sort, then print using std::cout  Here,  we  are  using  just  two nonlocal  names   sort and cout, both  from  the  standard  library . To eliminate those we would need to add parameters:   752   Instantiation  Chapter 26  In this trivial case, there is a lot to be said for removing the dependence on the global name cout. However, in general, as illustrated by sort  , adding parameters can make the code much more ver- bose without necessarily making it easier to understand.  Also, if the name-binding rules for templates were radically more restrictive than the rules for non-template code, writing template code would be a completely separate skill from writing non- template code. Templates and non-template code would no longer interoperate simply and freely.  26.3.4  Multiple Instantiation Points A template specialization may be generated   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   at any point of instantiation  §26.3.3 , at any point subsequent to that in a translation unit, or in a translation unit speciﬁcally created for generating specializations.  This reﬂects three obvious strategies an implementation can use for generating specializations:  [1]  Generate a specialization the ﬁrst time a call is seen. [2]  At the end of a translation unit, generate all specializations needed for it. [3]  Once ev ery  translation  unit  of  a  program  has  been  seen,  generate  all  specializations  needed for the program.  All  three  strategies  have  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  combinations  of  these  strategies  are  also possible.  So, a template used several times with the same set of template arguments has several points of instantiation.  A program is illegal if it is possible to construct two different meanings by choosing different points of instantiation. That is, if the bindings of a dependent or a nondependent name can differ, the program is illegal.  For example:     here,Itakecare of ints  void f int ;  namespace N { class X { }; char g X,int ;  template  void ff T t, double d  {  }  }  }  f d ;  return g t,d ;     fisbound to f int     gmight be bound to g X,int   auto x1 = ff N::X{},1.1 ;     ff ; maybind g to N::g X,int , narrowing 1.1 to 1  Namespace N {  double g X,double ;     reopen N to takecare of doubles  auto x2 = ff N::X,2.2 ;     ff ; binds g to N::g X,double ; the best match   Section 26.3.4  Multiple Instantiation Points   753  For ff   we have two instantiation points. For the ﬁrst call, we could generate the specialization at the initialization of x1 and get g N::X,int  called.  Alternatively, we could wait and generate the spe- cialization  at  the  end  of  the  translation  unit  and  get g N::X,char  called.  Consequently, the  call ff N::X{},1.1  is an error.  It is sloppy programming to call an overloaded function between two of its declarations. How- ev er, looking at a large program, a programmer would have no reason to suspect a problem. In this particular case, a compiler could catch the ambiguity. Howev er, similar problems can occur in sep- arate translation units, and then detection becomes much harder  for both compilers and program- mers .  An implementation is not obliged to catch problems of this kind.  To avoid surprising name bindings, try to limit context dependencies in templates.  26.3.5  Templates and Namespaces When  a  function  is  called,  its  declaration  can  be  found  even if it is not  in  scope,  provided  it  is declared in the same namespace as one of its arguments  §14.2.4 . This is important for functions called in template deﬁnitions because it is the mechanism by which dependent functions are found during instantiation. The binding of dependent names is done  §iso.14.6.4.2  by looking at  [1]  [2]   the names in scope at the point where the template is deﬁned, plus the names in the namespace of an argument of a dependent call  §14.2.4 .  For example:  namespace N {  class A {  * ...*  }; char f A ;  }  }  char f int ;  template  char g T t  {  char f double ;  return f t ;     choose f   depending on what T is  char c1 = g N::A   ; char c2 = g 2 ; char c3 = g 2.1 ;     causes N::f N::A  to be called    causes f int  to be called    causes f int  to be called; f double  not considered  Here, f t  is clearly dependent, so we can’t bind f at the point of deﬁnition. To generate a specializa- tion for g  N::A , the implementation looks in namespace N for functions called f   and ﬁnds N::f N::A .  The f int  is found because it is in scope at the point of deﬁnition of the template. The f double  is not found because it is not in scope at the point of deﬁnition of the template  §iso.14.6.4.1 , and argument-dependent lookup  §14.2.4  does not ﬁnd a global function that takes only arguments of built-in types. I ﬁnd it easy to forget that.   754   Instantiation  Chapter 26  26.3.6  Overaggressive ADL Argument-dependent lookup  often referred to as ADL  is very useful to avoid verbosity  §14.2.4 . For example:  std::cout << "Hello, world" << endl;   OK because of ADL  Without argument-dependent lookup, the endl manipulator would not be found. As it is, the com- piler notices that the ﬁrst argument to << is an ostream deﬁned in std. Therefore, it looks for endl in std and ﬁnds it  in   .  However,  ADL can be ‘‘too aggressive’’  when combined with unconstrained templates. Con-  include    int main   {  }  sider:  include  include     ...  namespace User {  class Customer {  * ...*   }; using Index = std::vector ;  void algo Index& x, Index& y  {     ... copy x,y,false ;    error  }  }  void copy const Index&, Index&, int deep ;     deep or shallowcopydepending on the value of deep  It would be a good guess that the author of User meant for User::alg   to call User::copy  . Howev er, that’s not what happens. The compiler notices that Index really is a vector deﬁned in std and looks to see if a relevant function is available in std. In  , it ﬁnds:  template  Out copy In,In,Out ;  Obviously, this general template is a perfect match for copy x,y,false . On the other hand, the copy   in User can be called only with a bool-to-int conversion.  For this example, as for equivalent exam- ples, the compiler’s resolution is a surprise to most programmers and a source of very obscure bugs. Using ADL to ﬁnd fully general templates is arguably a language design error. After all, std::copy   requires a pair of iterators  not just two arguments of the same type, such as the two Indexes .  The standard says so, but the code does not. Many such problems can be solved by the use of concepts  §24.3,  §24.3.2 . For example,  had  the  compiler  known  that std::copy   required  two iterators,  a nonobscure error would have been the result.   Section 26.3.6  Overaggressive ADL   755  template  Out copy In p1, In p2, Out q  {  static_assert Input_iterator   , "copy  : In is not an input iterator" ; static_assert Output_iterator   , "copy  : Out is not an output iterator" ; static_assert Assignable ,Value_type >  , "copy  : value type mismatch" ;    ...  Better still, the compiler would have noticed that std::copy   wasn’t even a valid candidate for that call and User::copy   would have been invoked.  For example  §28.4 :  template<typename In, typename Out,  typename = enable_if Input_iterator     && Output_iterator    && Assignable ,Value_type >   >  Out copy In p1, In p2, Out q  {     ...  Unfortunately, many such  templates  are  in  libraries  that  a  user  cannot  modify   e.g.,  the  standard library .  It is a good idea to avoid fully general  completely unconstrained  function templates in headers that also contain type deﬁnitions, but that’s hard to avoid.  If you need one, protecting it with a con- straints check is often worthwhile.  What can a user do if a library has trouble-causing unconstrained templates? Often, we know  which namespace our function should come from, so we can be speciﬁc about that. For example:  void User::algo Index& x, Index& y  {  User::copy x,y,false ;     ... std::swap ∗x[i],∗x[j] ;      OK     OK: only std::swapisconsidered  If we don’t want to be speciﬁc about which namespace to use, but want to make sure that a particu- lar  version  of  a  function  is  considered  by  function  overloading,  we  can  use  a using-declaration  §14.2.2 .  For example:  template  void apply const Range& r, Op f  {  using std::begin; using std::end; for  auto& x : r   f x ;  }  }  }  }  Now,  the  standard begin   and end   are  in  the  overload  set  used  by  the  range-for to  traverse  the Range  unless Range has members begin   and end  ; §9.5.1 .   756   Instantiation  Chapter 26  26.3.7  Names from Base Classes When a class template has a base class, it can access names from that base. As for other names, there are two distinct possibilities:   cid:129  The base class depends on a template argument.  cid:129  The base class does not depend on a template argument.  The  latter  case  is  simple  and  treated  just  like base  classes  in  classes  that  are  not  templates. For example:  As ever, local names hide other names, so h 2  binds to X::h int  and B::h char  is never considered. Similarly, the call g 2  is bound to B::g char  without any concern for functions declared outside X. That is, the global g   is never considered.  For base  classes  that  depend  on  a  template  parameter, we hav e to  be  a  bit  more  careful  and  explicit about what we want.  Consider:  void g int ;  struct B {  void g char ; void h char ;  template  class X : public B { public:  void h int ; void f   {  }    ...  g 2 ;  h 2 ;      call B::g char     call X::h int   void g int ;  struct B {  void g char ; void h char ;  template  class X : public T { public:  void f   {  }    ...  g 2 ;      call ::g int   };  };  };  };   Section 26.3.7  Names from Base Classes  757  Why doesn’t g 2  call B::g char   as in the previous example ?  Because g 2  isn’t dependent on the template  parameter T. It is therefore  bound  at  the  point  of  deﬁnition;  names  from  the  template argument T  which happens to be used as a base class  are not  yet  known and therefore not con- sidered.  If we want to have names from a dependent class considered, we must make the depen- dency clear. We hav e three ways of doing that:   cid:129  Qualify a name with a dependent type  e.g., T::g .  cid:129  Say that the name refers an object of this class  e.g., this−>g .  cid:129  Bring the name into scope with a using-declaration  e.g., using T::g .  void h X  x  {  x.f  ;  }  For example:  void g int ; void g2 int ;  struct B {  using Type = int; void g char ; void g2 char   template  class X : public T { public:  };  };  }  void f   {  }    ...  void h X  x  {  x.f  ;  typename T::Type m; Type m2;     OK    error  no Type in scope   using T::g2  ;      bringT::g2   into scope  this−>g 2 ;  g 2 ;  g2 2 ;      call T::g    call ::g int ; surpr ise?    call T::g2  Only at the point of instantiation can we know if the argument used for the parameter T  here B  has the required names.   758   Instantiation  Chapter 26  It is easy to forget to qualify names from a base, and the qualiﬁed code often looks a bit verbose and  messy. Howev er,  the  alternative  would  be  that  a  name  in  a  template  class  would  sometimes bind to a base class member and sometimes to a global entity depending on the template argument. That is not ideal either, and the language rule supports the rule of thumb that a template deﬁnition should be as self-contained as possible  §26.3 .  Qualifying  access  to  dependent  base  members  of  a  template  can  be  a  nuisance. However, explicit qualiﬁcations help maintainers, so the initial author shouldn’t grumble too much about the extra  typing. A common  occurrence  of  this  problem  is  when  a  whole  class  hierarchy is templa- tized.  For example:     memor yformatr ices,operations of all elements  template  class Matrix_base {     ... int size   const { return sz; }  protected: int sz; T∗ elem;     matrixelements     number of elements  };  template  class Matrix : public Matrix_base  {     N-dimensional matrix     ... T∗ data       returnpointer to element storage {  return this−>elem;  }  };  Here, the this−> qualiﬁcation is required.  26.4  Advice [1]  Let the compiler implementation generate specializations as needed; §26.2.1.

The template’s own implementation and those of its specializations can be accessed through that interface.  The source code implementing the template  in the template deﬁnition  is identical for all parameter types. The implementa- tions  of  different  specializations  can  be  very  different,  but  they should  all  implement  the semantics speciﬁed for the primary template. A specialization can add functionality to what the primary template offers.   cid:129  A base class deﬁnes an interface.  The class’s own implementation and those of its derived classes  can   using  virtual  functions   be  accessed  through  that  interface.  The implementa- tions  of  different  derived classes  can  be  very  different,  but  they should  all  implement  the semantics  speciﬁed  for  the  base  class. A derived class  can  add  functionality  to  what  the base class offers.   760  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27  From a design perspective, the two approaches are close enough to deserve a common name. Since both allow an algorithm to be expressed once and applied to a variety of types, people refer to both as polymorphic  from Greek ‘‘many shapes’’ .  To distinguish them, what virtual functions provide is called run-time polymorphism, and what templates offer is called compile-time polymorphism or parametric polymorphism.  The rough duality of the generic and object-oriented approaches can be deceptive. Object-ori- ented programmers tend to focus on the design of hierarchies of classes  types  with an interface being an individual class  Chapter 21 . Generic programmers tend to focus on the design of algo- rithms  with  the  concepts  for  template  arguments  providing  an  interface  that  can  accommodate many types  Chapter 24 . The ideal for a programmer should be mastery of both techniques to the point where either can be used where most appropriate. In many cases, the optimal design contains elements of both. For example vector  is a compile-time polymorphic  generic  container holding elements from a run-time polymorphic  object-oriented  hierarchy  §3.2.4 .  Generally, good  object-oriented  programming  requires  more  foresight  than  good  generic  pro- gramming because all types in a hierarchy must explicitly share an interface deﬁned as a base class. A template will accept any type that meets its concept as an argument, even if there is no explicitly declared commonality among those types. For example accumulate    §3.4.2, §24.2, §40.6.1  will accept vectors of ints and lists of complex  ev en though there are no declared relationship between the two element types and no declared relationship between the two sequence types.  27.2  Parameterization and Hierarchy As shown in §4.4.1 and §27.2.2, combinations of templates and class hierarchies are the basis for many useful techniques. So:   cid:129  When do we choose to use a class template?  cid:129  When do we rely on a class hierarchy?  Consider these questions from a slightly simpliﬁed and abstract point of view:  template  class Ct {     interface expressed in terms of the parameter  X mem;  public:  X f  ; int g  ; void h X ;  };  };  template  class Ct  { A∗ mem;   public:  A f  ; int g  ; void h A ; void k int ;     specialization  for A     the representation can differ from that of the primar ytemplate     added functionality   Section 27.2  Parameterization and Hierarchy  761  Ct  cta; Ct  ctb;     specialization for A    specialization for B  Given that, we can use f  , g  , and h   on the variables cta and ctb, using the implementations of Ct  and Ct , respectively. I used an explicit specialization  §23.5.3.4  to show that implemen- tations can vary from what the primary template offers and that it is possible to add functionality. The simpler case – without added functionality – is by far the more common.  The rough equivalent using a hierarchy is:     interface expressed in terms of types in scope  Class DA : public Cx { public:     derived class  class X {    ...  };  class Cx {  X mem;  public:  virtual X& f  ; virtual int g  ; virtual void h X& ;  };  };  };  X& f  ; int g  ; void h X& ;  Class DB : public Cx {  DB∗ p;   public:  X& f  ; int g  ; void h X& ; void k int ;     added functionality  Cx& cxa {∗new DA};    cxa is an interface to a DA Cx& cxb {∗new DB};    cxb is an interface to a DB     derived class    representation can be more extensivethan what the base provides  Given that, we can use f  , g  , and h   on the variables cxa and cxb, using the implementations of DA and DB, respectively. I use references in the hierarchical version to reﬂect that we must manipulate derived class objects through pointers or references to preserve run-time polymorphic behavior.  In either case, we manipulate objects that share a common set of operations. From this simpli-  ﬁed and abstract point of view we can observe:   cid:129   If the types in the interface to the generated or derived classes need to differ, templates have an advantage.  To gain access to differing interfaces for derived classes through a base, we must use some form of explicit casting  §22.2 .   762  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   cid:129   If the  implementations  of  generated  or  derived classes  differ  only  through  a  parameter  or differ only in a few special cases, templates have an advantage.  Irregular implementations can be expressed through derived classes or specializations. If the  actual  types  of  objects  used  cannot  be  known  at  compile  time,  a  class  hierarchy is essential. If a hierarchical  relationship  is  required  between  generated  or  derived types,  hierarchies have an advantage.  The base class provides a common interface.  Conversions among tem- plate specializations must be explicitly deﬁned by the programmer  §27.2.2 . If explicit use of free store  §11.2  is undesirable, templates have an advantage. If run-time efﬁciency is at such a premium that inlining of operations is essential, templates should be used  because effective use of hierarchy requires the use of pointers or references, which inhibit inlining .  Keeping base classes minimal and type-safe can be a struggle. Expressing the interface in terms of existing types that cannot vary for derived classes can be a struggle. Often the result is a compro- mise that either overconstrains the base class interface  e.g., we pick a class X with a ‘‘rich inter- face’’ which  must  be  implemented  by  all  derived classes  and  ‘‘for  all  time’’   or  underconstrains  e.g., we use void∗ or a minimal Object∗ .  The  combination  of  templates  and  class  hierarchies  provides  design  choices  and  ﬂexibility beyond what either can offer by itself. For example, a pointer to a base class can be used as a tem- plate argument to provide run-time polymorphism  §3.2.4 , and a template parameter can be used to specify a base class interface to provide type safety  §26.3.7, §27.3.1 .  It is not possible to have a virtual function template  §23.4.6.2 .  27.2.1  Generated Types A class template is usefully understood as a speciﬁcation of how particular types are to be created. In  other  words,  the  template  implementation  is  a  mechanism  that  generates  types  when  needed based on a speciﬁcation. Consequently, a class template is sometimes called a type generator.  As far as the C++ language rules are concerned, there is no relationship between two classes  generated from a single class template. For example:  class Shape {     ...  };  };  class Circle : public Shape { {     ...  Given these  declarations,  people  sometimes  think  that  there  must  be  an  inheritance  relationship between set  and set  or at least between set  and set . This is a seri- ous logical error based on a ﬂawed argument: ‘‘A Circle is a Shape, so a set of Circles is also a set of Shapes; therefore, I should be able to use a set of Circles as a set of Shapes.’’  The ‘‘therefore’’ part of this argument doesn’t hold.  The reason is that a set of Circles guarantees that the members of the set are Circles; a set of Shapes does not provide that guarantee. For example:   Section 27.2.1  Generated Types   763  };  }  }  }  }  class Triangle : public Shape {     ...  void f set & s  {     ... s.insert new Triangle{p1,p2,p3} ;  void g set & s  {  f s ;     error,type mismatch: s is a set , not a set   This  won’t compile  because  there  is  no  built-in  conversion  from set & to set &. Nor  should  there  be. The  guarantee  that  the  members  of  a set  are Circles allows  us  to safely and efﬁciently apply Circle-speciﬁc operations, such as determining the radius, to members of the set. If we allowed a set  to be treated as a set , we could no longer maintain inserts  a Triangle∗ into  its set  argument.  If the that  guarantee. For example, set  could have been a set , the fundamental guarantee that a set  contains Circle∗s only would have been violated.  Logically, we could treat an immutable set  as an immutable set  because the problem of inserting an inappropriate element into the set cannot occur when we cannot change the set.  That is,  we  could  provide  a  conversion  from const  set  to const  set<const Shape∗>. The language doesn’t do so by default, but the designer of set could.  f    The combination of an array and a base class is particularly nasty because a built-in array does  not offer the type safety provided by containers. For example:  void maul Shape∗ p, int n  {  for  int i=0; i!=n; ++i      Danger!  p[i].draw  ;      looks innocent; it is not  void user   {  Circle image[10];     ... maul image,10 ;     ...     an image is composed of 10 Circles     ‘‘maul’’10Circles  How can we call maul   with image? First, image’s  type is converted  decays  from Circle[] to Cir- cle∗. Next, Circle∗ is converted to Shape∗. The implicit conversion of an array name to a pointer to the array’s ﬁrst element is fundamental to C-style programming. Similarly, implicit conversion of a pointer to a derived class to a pointer to its base class is fundamental to object-oriented program- ming.  In combination, they offer the opportunity of disaster.   764  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27  In the example above, assume that a Shape is an abstract class with size 4 and that Circle adds a center and a radius. Then sizeof Circle >siz eof Shape  and when we look at the layout of image we ﬁnd something like this:  user   view: maul   view: p[0] p[1] p[2] p[3]  image[0]  image[1]  image[2]  image[3]  When maul   tries to invoke a virtual function on p[1], there is no virtual function pointer where it is expected and the call hopefully fails instantly.  Note that no explicit cast was needed to get this disaster:  cid:129  Prefer containers over built-in arrays.  cid:129  Consider interfaces such as void f T∗ p, int count  highly suspect; when T can be a base class  and count is an element count, trouble awaits.   cid:129  Consider .  dot  suspect when applied to something that is supposed to be run-time poly-  morphic unless it is obviously applied to a reference.  27.2.2  Template Conversions There  cannot  be  any default relationship  between  classes  generated  from  the  same  template  §27.2.1 .  However,  for some templates we would like to express such a relationship. For exam- ple, when we deﬁne a pointer template, we would like to reﬂect inheritance relationships among the objects pointed to. Member templates  §23.4.6  allow us to specify many such relationships where desired.  Consider:  template  class Ptr { T∗ p;     pointer to T  public:  Ptr T∗ ; Ptr const Ptr& ; template      ...  explicit operator Ptr   ;     convert Ptr  to Ptr      copyconstr uctor  };  }  void f Ptr  pc  {  Ptr  ps {pc}; Ptr  pc2 {ps};     should wor k    should giveerror  We  would  like to deﬁne  the  conversion  operators  to  provide  the  inheritance  relationships  we  are accustomed to for built-in pointers for these user-deﬁned Ptrs.  For example:  We want to allow the ﬁrst initialization if and only if Shape really is a direct or indirect public base class of Circle. In general, we need to deﬁne the conversion operator so that the Ptr  to Ptr  conversion is accepted if and only if a T∗ can be assigned to a T2∗. That can be done like this:   Section 27.2.2  Template Conversions   765  template   template   Ptr ::operator Ptr    {  return Ptr {p};  }  The return-statement  will  compile  if  and  only  if p  which  is  a T∗  can  be  an  argument  to  the Ptr  T2∗  constructor. Therefore,  if T∗ can  be  implicitly  converted  into  a T2∗, the Ptr  to Ptr  conversion will work.  For example, we can now write:  void f Ptr  pc  {  Ptr  ps {pc}; Ptr  pc2 {ps};     OK: can convert Circle* to Shape*    error :cannot convert Shape* to Circle*  Be  careful  to  deﬁne  logically  meaningful  conversions  only. If in doubt,  use  a  named  conversion function, rather than a conversion operator. A named conversion function offers fewer opportuni- ties for ambiguities.  The  template  parameter  lists  of  a  template  and  one  of  its  template  members  cannot  be  com-  bined.  For example:  template  Ptr ::operator Ptr    {  return Ptr  p ;     error  }  }  An alternative solution to this problem uses type traits and enable_if    §28.4 .  27.3  Hierarchies of Class Templates Using object-oriented techniques, a base class is often used to provide a common interface to a set of derived classes.  A template can be used to parameterize such an interface, and when that is done it is tempting to parameterize the whole hierarchy of derived classes with the same template param- eters.  For example, we could parameterize the classical shape example  §3.2.4  with types used to provide an abstraction of the target output ‘‘device’’:  template   class Shape {     questionable example     ...     ...  };  };  template  class Circle : public Shape {   766  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27  template  class Triangle : public Shape {     ...  void user   {  };  }  auto p = new Triangle {{0,0},{0,60},{30,sqr t 60∗60−30∗30 }};    ...  Something along this line is often the ﬁrst idea  after seeing something like vector   that a pro- grammer used to object-oriented programming considers. However, caution is recommended when mixing object-oriented and generic techniques.  As  written,  this  parameterized  shape  hierarchy is too  verbose  for  real  use. That  could  be addressed using default template arguments  §25.2.5 . However, the verbosity is not the main prob- lem.  If only  one  combination  of Color_scheme and Canvas is  used  in  a  program,  the  amount  of code generated is almost exactly the same as would have been generated for the unparameterized equivalent.  The ‘‘almost’’ comes because the compiler will suppress code generation for the deﬁni- tions of unused non-virtual member functions of a class template. However, if N combinations of Color_scheme and Canvas are used in a program, the code for every virtual function will be repli- cated N times. Because a graphics hierarchy is likely to have many derived classes, many member functions, and many complicated functions, the result is likely to be massive code bloat. In particu- lar, the compiler cannot know whether a virtual function is used or not, so it must generate code for all such functions and for all functions called by such functions. Parameterizing a huge class hier- archy with many virtual member functions is typically a poor idea.  For this shape example, the Color_scheme and Canvas parameters are unlikely to affect the inter- face much: most member functions will not have them as part of their function type. These param- eters  are  an  ‘‘implementation  detail’’ that  escaped  into  the  interface  –  with  likely  serious  perfor- mance  implications. It  is  not  really  the  whole  hierarchy that  needs  those  parameters;  it  is  a  few conﬁguration functions and  most likely  a few lower-level drawing rendering functions. It is gen- erally not a good idea to ‘‘overparameterize’’  §23.4.6.3 : try to avoid parameters that affect only a few members.  If only a few member functions are affected by a parameter, try to make those func- tion templates with that parameter. For example:  template   void conﬁgure const Color_scheme&, const Canvas& ;  class Shape {     ...  };  How to share the conﬁguration information among different classes and different objects is a sepa- rate issue. Clearly, we cannot simply store a Color_scheme and Canvas in the Shape without param- eterizing Shape itself  with Color_scheme and Canvas. One  solution  would  be  for conﬁgure   to ‘‘translate’’ the information in Color_scheme and Canvas into a standard set of conﬁguration param- eters  e.g., a set of integers .  Another solution is to give a Shape a Conﬁguration∗ member, where Conﬁguration is a base class providing a general interface to conﬁguration information.   Section 27.3.1  Templates as Interfaces  767  27.3.1  Templates as Interfaces A template class can be used to provide a ﬂexible and type-safe interface to a common implementa- tion.  The vector from §25.3 is a good example of this:  template  class Vector   : private Vector   {  };     ...  In  general,  this  technique  can  be  used  to  provide  type-safe  interfaces  and  for  localizing  casts  to implementations, rather than forcing users to write them.  27.4  Template Parameters as Base Classes In classical object-oriented programming using class hierarchies, we place information that can be different  for  different  classes  in  derived classes  and  access  it  through  virtual  functions  in  a  base class  §3.2.4, §21.2.1 . That way, we can write common code without worrying about variations in the implementations. However, this technique does not allow us to vary the types used in the inter- face  §27.2 . Also, those virtual function calls can be expensive  compared to a simple operation from  an  inlined  function. To  compensate,  we  might  pass  the  specialized  information  and  opera- tions to the base class as template arguments.  In fact, a template argument can be used as a base class.  The general problem addressed by the following two subsections is ‘‘How can we combine sep- arately speciﬁed information into a single compact object with a well-speciﬁed interface?’’ This is a fundamental question and the solutions are of general importance.  27.4.1  Composing Data Structures Consider  writing  a  balanced  binary  tree  library. Since  we  are  providing  a  library  to  be  used  by many different users, we can’t build the type of the user’s  application’s  data into our tree nodes. We hav e many alternatives:   cid:129  We could put the user’s data in a derived class and access it using virtual functions. But the virtual  function  calls   or  equivalently, run-time  resolved  and  checked  solutions   are  rela- tively expensive, and our interface to the user’s data is not expressed in terms of the user’s type, so we still need to use casts to access it.   cid:129  We could put a void∗ in our nodes and let the user use that to refer to data allocated outside our nodes. But that could double the number of allocations, add many  potentially expen- sive  pointer dereferences, and add the space overhead of a pointer in each node. We would also need to use a cast to access our user data using its correct type. That cast can’t be type checked.   cid:129  We could  put  a Data∗ into  our  nodes,  where Data is  a  ‘‘universal  base  class’’ for  our  data structures.  That would  solve the  type-checking  problem,  but  that  combines  the  cost  and inconvenience of the previous two approaches.   768  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27  There are more alternatives, but consider:     doesn’t knowabout Val  the user data   template  struct Node_base { N∗ left_child; N∗ right_child;  Node_base  ;  void add_left N∗ p  {  if  left_child==nullptr   left_child = p;  else     ...  }    ...  Val v; Node Val vv ;    ...  };  };  };  equivalent to this:  struct Node_base_double  {  double val; Node_base_double∗ left_child; Node_base_double∗ right_child;  using My_node = Node ;  void user const vector & v  {  My_node root; int i = 0;  for  auto x : v  {  auto p = new My_node{x};  template  struct Node : Node_base > {     use derived class as partofits own base  Here,  we  pass  the  derived class Node  as  a  template  argument  to  its  own  base   Node_base . That allows Node_base to use Node  in its interfaces without even knowing its real name!  Note  that  the  layout  of  a Node is  compact. For example,  a Node  will  look  roughly  Unfortunately, with this design, a user has to be aware of Node_base’s operations and the structure of the resulting tree. For example:   Section 27.4.1  Composing Data Structures   769  if  i++%2      choose where to insert  else  root.add_left p ;  root.add_right p ;  }  }  However,  it is not easy for a user to keep the structure of a tree reasonable. Typically, we would like to let the tree take care of that by implementing a tree-balancing algorithm. However, to bal- ance a tree so that you can search it efﬁciently, the balancer needs to know the user’s values.  How do we add  a  balancer  to  our  design? We  could  hardwire  the  balancing  strategy  into Node_base and let Node_base ‘‘peek’’ at the user data. For example, a balanced tree implementa- tion, such as the standard-library map,  by default  requires that a value type provides a less-than operation.  That way, the Node_base operations can simply use <:  static_assert Totally_ordered   , "Node_base: N must have a <" ;  template  struct Node_base {  N∗ left_child; N∗ right_child; Balancing_info bal;  Node_base  ;  void insert N& n  {  if  n<left_child      ... do something ...  else     ... do something else ...  }    ...  };  This works nicely. In fact, the more information about nodes we build into the Node_base, the sim- pler the implementation becomes. In particular, we could parameterize the Node_base with a value type rather than a node type  as is done for std::map , and we would have the tree in a single com- pact  package. However,  doing  so  doesn’t address  the  fundamental  question  we  are  trying  to address  here:  how to combine  information  from  several  separately  speciﬁed  sources. Writing ev erything in one place dodges that problem.  So let us assume that the user will want to manipulate Nodes  e.g., move a node from one tree to another , so that we can’t simply store user data into an anonymous node. Let us further assume that we would like to be able to use a variety of balancing algorithms, so that we need to make the balancer an argument.  These assumptions force us to face the fundamental question. The simplest solution is to let Node combine the value type with a balancer type. However, Node doesn’t need to use the balancer, so it just passes it on to Node_base:   770  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27  template  struct Search_node : public Node_base , Balance> {  Val val;  search_node Val v : val v  {}     user data  Balance is mentioned twice here because it is part of the node type and because Node_base needs to make an object of type Balance:  template  struct Node_base : Balance {  N∗ left_child; N∗ right_child;  Node_base  ;  void insert N& n  {     ... do something ...     ... do something else ...  else  }    ...  if  this−>compare n,left_child        use compare   from Balance  I could have used Balance to deﬁne a member, rather than using it as a base. However, some impor- tant balancers require no per-node data, so by making Balance a base, I beneﬁt from the empty-base optimization. The  language  guarantees  that  if  a  base  class  has  no  non-static data  members,  no memory will be allocated for it in an object of derived class  §iso.1.8 . Also, this design is with minor stylistic differences that of a real binary tree framework [Austern,2003]. We might use these classes like this:  struct Red_black_balance {     data and operations needed to implement red-blacktrees  template  using Rbnode = Search_node ;     type alias for red-blacktrees  Rbnode  my_root;      ared-blacktree of doubles  using My_node = Rb_node ;  void user const vector & v  {  for  auto x : v   root.inser t ∗new My_node{x} ;  };  };  };  }   Section 27.4.1  Composing Data Structures   771  The layout of a node is compact, and we can easily inline all performance-critical functions. What we achieved by the slightly elaborate set of deﬁnitions was type safety and ease of composition. This  elaboration  delivers  a  performance  advantage  compared  to  every  approach  that  introduces  a void∗ into the data structure or function interfaces.  Such a use of void∗ disables valuable type-based optimization techniques. Choosing a low-level  C-style  programming technique in the key parts of a balanced binary tree implementation implies a signiﬁcant run-time cost.  We passed the balancer as a separate template argument:  template  struct Node_base : Balance {     ...  template  struct Search_node  : public Node_base , Balance>     ...  Some ﬁnd this clear, explicit, and general; others ﬁnd it verbose and confusing. The alternative is to  make the  balancer  an  implicit  argument  in  the  form  of  an  associated  type   a  member  type  of Search_node :  template  struct Node_base : N::balance_type {     use N’sbalance_type     ...  template  struct Search_node  : public Node_base >  using balance_type = Balance;    ...  This technique is heavily used in the standard library to minimize explicit template arguments.  The technique of deriving from a base class is very old. It was mentioned in the ARM  1989  and is sometimes referred to as the Barton-Nackman trick after an early use in mathematical soft- ware  [Barton,1994]. the  curiously  recurring  template  pattern  CRTP  [Coplien,1995].  Jim  Coplien  called  it  27.4.2  Linearizing Class Hierarchies The Search_node example  from  §27.4.1  uses  its  template  to  compress  its  representation  and  to avoid using void∗. The techniques are general and very useful. In particular, many programs that deal  with  trees  rely  on  it  for  type  safety  and  performance. For example,  the  ‘‘Internal  Program Representation’’  IPR  [DosReis,2011] is a general and systematic representation of C++ code as  };  {  };  };  {  };   772  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27  typed  abstract  syntax  trees. It  uses  template  parameters  as  base  classes  extensively, both  as  an implementation aid  implementation inheritance  and to provide abstract interfaces in the classical object-oriented way  interface inheritance . The design addresses a difﬁcult set of criteria, includ- ing compactness of nodes  there can be many millions of nodes , optimized memory management, access  speed   don’t introduce  unnecessary  indirections  or  nodes ,  type  safety, polymorphic  inter- faces, and generality.  The  users  see  a  hierarchy of abstract  classes  providing  perfect  encapsulation  and  clean  func- tional interfaces representing the semantics of a program. For example, a variable is a declaration, which is a statement, which is an expression, which is a node:  Var −> Decl −> Stmt −> Expr −> Node  Clearly, some generalization has been done in the design of the IPR because in ISO C++ statements cannot be used as expressions.  In  addition,  there  is  a  parallel  hierarchy of concrete  classes  providing  compact  and  efﬁcient  implementations of the classes in the interface hierarchy:  impl::Var −> impl::Decl −> impl::Stmt −> impl::Expr −> impl::Node  In all, there are about 80 leaf classes  such as Var, If_stmt, and Multiply  and about 20 generalizations  such as Decl, Unary, and impl::Stmt .  The ﬁrst attempt of a design was a classical multiple-inheritance ‘‘diamond’’ hierarchy  using  solid arrows to represent interface inheritance and dotted arrows for implementation inheritance :  Node  impl::Node  Expr  impl::Expr  Stmt  impl::Stmt  Decl  impl::Decl  Var  impl::Var  That  worked  but  led  to  excessive  memory  overhead:  the  nodes  were  too  large  because  of  data needed  to  navigate  the  virtual  bases. In  addition,  programs  were  seriously  slowed  down  by  the many indirections to access the many virtual bases in each object  §21.3.5 .  The solution was to linearize the dual hierarchy so that no virtual bases were used:   Section 27.4.2  Linearizing Class Hierarchies   773  Node  impl::Node  Expr  impl::Expr  Stmt  impl::Stmt  Decl  impl::Decl  Var  impl::Var  For the full set of classes the chain of derivation becomes:  impl::Var −>  impl::Decl  −>  impl::Stmt  −>  impl::Expr  −>  impl::Node  −>  ipr::Var −>  ipr::Decl −>  ipr::Stmt −>  ipr::Expr −>  ipr::Node  This is represented as a compact object with no internal ‘‘management data’’ except the single vptr  §3.2.3, §20.3.2 .  I will  show how  that  is  done. The  interface  hierarchy,  deﬁned  in  namespace ipr is  described ﬁrst.  Starting from the bottom, a Node holds data used to optimize traversal and Node type identiﬁ- cation  the code_category  and to ease storage of IPR graphs in ﬁles  the node_id .  These are fairly typical ‘‘implementation details’’ hidden from the users. What a user will know is that every node in an IPR graph has a unique base of type Node and that this can be used to implement operations using the visitor pattern [Gamma,1994]  §22.3 :  struct ipr::Node {  const int node_id; const Category_code category;  protected:  };  Node Category_code ;  virtual void accept Visitor&  const = 0;     hook for visitor classes  Node is meant to be used as a base class only, so its constructor is protected. It also has a pure vir- tual function, so it cannot be instantiated except as a base class.   774  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27  An expression  Expr  is a Node that has a type:  struct ipr::Expr : Node {  virtual const Type& type   const = 0;  protected:  };  Expr Category_code c  : Node c  { }  Obviously, this is quite a generalization of C++ because it implies that even statements and types have types: it is an aim of the IPR to represent all of C++ without implementing all of C++’s irregu- larities and limitations.  A statement  Stmt  is an Expr that has a source ﬁle location and can be annotated with various  information:  struct ipr::Stmt : Expr {  virtual const Unit_location& unit_location   const = 0; virtual const Source_location& source_location   const = 0;    ﬁle     line in ﬁle  virtual const Sequence & annotation   const = 0;  protected:  };  Stmt Category_code c  : Expr c  { }  A declaration  Decl  is a Stmt that introduces a name:  struct ipr::Decl : Stmt {  enum Speciﬁer {  * storage class,vir tual,access control, etc.*  };  virtual Speciﬁer speciﬁers   const = 0; virtual const Linkage& lang_linkage   const = 0;  virtual const Name& name   const = 0;  virtual const Region& home_region   const = 0; virtual const Region& lexical_region   const = 0;  virtual bool has_initializer   const = 0; virtual const Expr& initializer   const = 0;     ... protected:  };  Decl Categor y_code c  : Stmt c  { }  As you might expect, Decl is one of the central notions when it comes to representing C++ code. This is where you ﬁnd scope information, storage classes, access speciﬁers, initializers, etc.  Finally, we can deﬁne a class to represent a variable  Var  as a leaf class  most derived class  of  our interface hierarchy:   Section 27.4.2  Linearizing Class Hierarchies   775  struct ipr::Var : Category  { };  Basically, Category is a notational aid with the effect of deriving Var from Decl and giving the Cate- gory_code used to optimize Node type identiﬁcation:  template  struct Category : T { protected:  Category   : T Cat  { }  };  };  };  Every data member is a Var. That includes global, namespace, local, and class static variables and constants.  Compared to representations you ﬁnd in compilers, this interface is tiny.  Except for some data for optimizations in Node, this is just a set of classes with pure virtual functions. Note that it is a single hierarchy with no virtual base classes. It is a straightforward object-oriented design. How- ev er, implementing this simply, efﬁciently, and maintainably is not easy, and IPR’s solution is cer- tainly not what an experienced object-oriented designer would ﬁrst think of.  For each  IPR  interface  class   in ipr ,  there  is  a  corresponding  implementation  class   in impl .  For example:  template  struct impl::Node : T {  using Interface = T;    makethe template argument type available to users void accept ipr::Visitor& v  const override { v.visit ∗this ; }  The ‘‘trick’’ is to establish the correspondence between the ipr nodes and the impl nodes.  In partic- ular, the impl nodes must provide the necessary data members and override the abstract virtual func- tions in the ipr nodes.  For impl::Node, we can see that if T is an ipr::Node or any class derived from ipr::Node, then the accept   function is properly overridden.  Now, we can proceed to provide implementation classes for the rest of the ipr interface classes:  template  struct impl::Expr : impl::Node  {  const ipr::Type∗ constraint;   Expr   : constraint 0  { }     constraint is the type of the expression  const ipr::Type& type   const override { return ∗util::check constraint ; }  If  the Interface argument  is  an ipr::Expr or  any class  derived from ipr::Expr, then impl::Expr is  an implementation for ipr::Expr. We can make sure of that. Since ipr::Expr is derived from ipr::Node, this implies that impl::Node gets the ipr::Node base class that it needs.  In  other  words,  we  have  managed  to  provide  implementations  for  two  different   interface  classes.  We can proceed in this manner:   776  Templates and Hierarchies   Chapter 27  template  struct impl::Stmt : S {  ipr::Unit_location unit_locus; ipr::Source_location src_locus;  ref_sequence  notes;     logical position in translation unit    source ﬁle,line,and column  const ipr::Unit_location& unit_location   const override { return unit_locus; } const ipr::Source_location& source_location   const override { return src_locus; } const ipr::Sequence & annotation   const override { return notes; }  That is, impl:Stmt provides the three data items needed to implement ipr::Stmt’s interface and over- rides ipr::Stmt’s three virtual functions to do so.  Basically, all impl classes follow Stmt’s pattern:  template  struct impl::Decl : Stmt  > { basic_decl_data  decl_data; ipr::Named_map∗ pat; val_sequence  args;  Decl   : decl_data 0 , pat 0  { }  const ipr::Sequence & substitutions   const { return args; } const ipr::Named_map& generating_map   const override { return ∗util::check pat ; } const ipr::Linkage& lang_linkage   const override; const ipr::Region& home_region   const override;  Finally, we can deﬁne the leaf class impl::Var:  struct Var : impl::Decl  {  const ipr::Expr∗ init; const ipr::Region∗ lexreg;  Var  ;  bool has_initializer   const override; const ipr::Expr& initializer   const override; const ipr::Region& lexical_region   const override;  Note that Var is not a template; it is a user-level abstraction in our application. The implementation of Var is an example of generic programming, but its use is classical object-oriented programming.  The combination of inheritance and parameterization is powerful.  This expressive  power can lead  to  confusion  for  beginners  and  occasionally  even for  experienced  programmers  when  faced with  a  new application  area. However,  the  beneﬁts  of  the  combination  are  concrete:  type  safety, performance, and minimal source code size. The extensibility offered by class hierarchies and vir- tual functions is not compromised.  };  };  };   Section 27.5  Advice   777  27.5  Advice [1]  When having to express a general idea in code, consider whether to represent it as a template  or as a class hierachy; §27.1.

I ﬁnd  it  useful  to  think  of  templates  as  generators:  they are  used  to  make classes and functions. This leads to the notion of template programming as an exercise in writing programs that compute at compile time and generate programs. Variations of this idea have been called two-level programming, multilevel programming, generative programming, and – more com- monly – template metaprogramming.   780  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28   cid:129   There are two main reasons for using metaprogramming techniques:  cid:129   Improved type safety: We can compute the exact types needed for a data structure or algo- rithm  so  that  we  don’t need  to  directly  manipulate  low-level data  structures   e.g.,  we  can eliminate many uses of explicit type conversion . Improved run-time performance: We can compute values at compile time and select func- tions to be called at run time. That way, we don’t need to do those computations at run time  e.g., we can resolve many examples of polymorphic behavior to direct function calls . In particular, by taking advantage of the type system, we can dramatically improve the oppor- tunities  for  inlining. Also,  by  using  compact  data  structures   possibly  generated;  §27.4.2, §28.5 , we make better use of memory with positive effects on both the amount of data we can handle and the execution speed.  Templates were designed to be very general and able to generate optimal code [Stroustrup,1994]. They provide arithmetic, selection, and recursion. In fact, they constitute a complete compile-time functional programming language [Veldhuizen,2003].  That is, templates and their template instan- tiation mechanism are Turing complete. One demonstration of this was that Eisenecker and Czar- necki  wrote  a  Lisp  interpreter  in  only  a  few pages  using  templates  [Czarnecki,2000]. The  C++ compile-time mechanisms provide a pure functional programming language: You can create values of  various  types,  but  there  are  no  variables,  assignments,  increment  operators,  etc. The  Turing completeness  implies  the  possibility  of  inﬁnite  compilations,  but  that’s easily  taken  care  of  by translation  limits   §iso.B . For example,  an  inﬁnite  recursion  will  be  caught  by  running  out  of some compile-time resource, such as the number of recursive constexpr calls, the number of nested classes, or the number of recursively nested template instantiations.  Where should we draw the line between generic programming and template metaprogramming?  The extreme positions are:   cid:129    cid:129   It is all  template  metaprogramming:  after  all,  any use  of  compile-time  parameterization implies instantiation that generates ‘‘ordinary code.’’ It is all  generic  programming:  after  all,  we  are  just  deﬁning  and  using  generic  types  and algorithms.  Both of these positions are useless because they basically deﬁne generic programming and template metaprogramming  as  synonyms.  I think  there  is  a  useful  distinction  to  be  made. A distinction helps us decide between alternative approaches to problems and to focus on what is important for a given problem.  When I write a generic type or algorithm, I don’t feel that I am writing a compile- time  program. I am not  using  my  programming  skills  for  the  compile-time  part  of  my  program. Instead,  I  am  focusing  on  deﬁning  requirements  on  arguments   §24.3 . Generic  programming  is primarily a design philosophy – a programming paradigm, if you must  §1.2.1 .  In contrast, metaprogramming is programming. The emphasis is on computation, often involv- ing selection and some form of iteration. Metaprogramming is primarily a set of implementation techniques.  I can think of four levels of implementation complexity:  [1]  No computation  just pass type and value arguments  [2]  Simple computation   on  types  or  values   not  using  compile-time  tests  or  iteration,  for  example, && of Booleans  §24.4  or addition of units  §28.7.1   [3]  Computation using explicit compile-time tests, for example, a compile-time if  §28.3 . [4]  Computation using compile-time iteration  in the form of recursion; §28.3.2 .   Section 28.1  Introduction   781  The ordering indicates the level of complexity, with implications for the difﬁculty of the task, the difﬁculty of debugging, and the likelihood of error.  So, metaprogramming is a combination of ‘‘meta’’ and programming: a metaprogram is a com- pile-time  computation  yielding  types  or  functions  to  be  used  at  run  time. Note  that  I  don’t say ‘‘template  metaprogramming’’ because  the  computation  may  be  done  using constexpr functions. Note also that you can rely on other people’s metaprogramming without actually doing metapro- gramming yourself: calling a constexpr function hiding a metaprogram  §28.2.2  or extracting the type  from  a  template  type  function   §28.2.4   is  not  in  itself  metaprogramming;  it  just  uses  a metaprogram.  Generic programming usually falls into the ﬁrst, ‘‘no computation’’ category, but it is quite pos- sible  to  support  generic  programming  using  metaprogramming  techniques. When  doing  so,  we have to be careful that our interface speciﬁcations are precisely deﬁned and correctly implemented. Once  we  use   meta programming  as  part  of  an  interface,  the  possibility  of  programming  errors creeps in. Without programming, the meaning is directly deﬁned by the language rules.  Generic  programming  focuses  on  interface  speciﬁcation,  whereas  metaprogramming  is  pro-  gramming, usually with types as the values.  Overenthusiastic use of metaprogramming can lead to debugging problems and excessive com- pile times that render some uses unrealistic. As ever, we hav e to apply common sense. There are many simple uses of metaprogramming that lead to better code  better type safety, lower memory footprint, and lower run time  without exceptional compile-time overhead.  Many standard-library components, such as function  §33.5.3 , thread  §5.3.1, §42.2.2 , and tuple  §34.2.4.2 , are examples of relatively simple application of metaprogramming techniques.  This  chapter  explores  the  basic  metaprogramming  techniques  and  presents  the  basic  building  blocks of metaprograms. Chapter 29 offers a more extensive example.  28.2  Type Functions A type function is a function that either takes at least one type argument or produces at least one type  as  a  result. For example, sizeof T  is  a  built-in  type  function  that  given a type  argument T returns the size of an object  measured in chars; §6.2.8 .  Type functions don’t hav e to look like conventional functions. In fact, most don’t.  For exam- ple, the standard library’s is_polymorphic  takes its argument as a template argument and returns its result as a member called value:  if  is_polymorphic ::value  cout << "Big surprise!";  The value member of is_polymorphic is either true or false. Similarly, the standard-library conven- tion is that a type function that returns a type does so by a member called type. For example:  enum class Axis : char { x, y, z }; enum ﬂags { off, x=1, y=x<<1, z=x<<2, t=x<<3 };  typename std::underlying_type ::type x; typename std::underlying_type ::type y;     xisachar    yisprobably an int  §8.4.2   A type function can take more than one argument and return several result values.  For example:   782  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  template  struct Array_type { using type = T; static const int dim = N;    ...  };  using Array = Array_type ;  Array::type x; constexpr int s = Array::dim;     sis3     xisanint  This Array_type is not a standard-library function or even a particularly useful function. I just used it as an excuse to show how to write a simple multi-argument, multi-return-value type function. It can be used like this:  Type functions are compile-time functions. That is, they can only take arguments  types and val- ues  that are known at compile time and produce results  types and values  that can be used at com- pile time.  Most type functions take at least one type argument, but there are useful ones that don’t.  For  example, here is a type function that returns an integer type of the appropriate number of bytes:  template  struct Integer {  using Error = void; using type = Select ;  typename Integer ::type i4 = 8; typename Integer ::type i1 = 9;     4-byte integer    1-byte integer  Select is deﬁned and explained in §28.3.1.3. It is of course possible to write templates that take val- ues only and produce values only. I don’t consider those type functions. Also, constexpr functions  §12.1.6  are usually a better way of expressing compile-time computations on values.  I can com- pute a square root at compile time using templates, but why would I want to when I can express the algorithm more cleanly using constexpr functions  §2.2.3, §10.4, §28.3.2 ?  So,  C++  type  functions  are  mostly  templates. They can  perform  very  general  computations using types and values.  They are the backbone of metaprogramming. For example, we might want to allocate an object on the stack provided that it is small and on the free store otherwise:  constexpr int on_stack_max = sizeof std::string ;     max sizeofobject wewant on the stack  template  struct Obj_holder {  using type = typename std::conditional< sizeof T <=on_stack_max ,  Scoped ,  On_heap       ﬁrst alternative    second alternative  >::type;  };  };   Section 28.2  Type Functions  783  The standard-library template conditional is a compile-time selector between two alternatives.  If its ﬁrst argument evaluates to true, the result  presented as the member type  is the second argument; otherwise,  the  result  is  the  third  argument.  §28.3.1.1 shows  how conditional is  implemented. In this case, Obj_holder ’s type is deﬁned to be Scoped  if an object of X is small and On_heap  if it is large. Obj_holder can be used like this:  void f   {  }  typename Obj_holder ::type v1; typename Obj_holder >::type v2;     ... ∗v1 = 7.7; v2[77] = 9.9;    ...     Scoped provides pointer-likeaccess  * and []     On_heap provides pointer-likeaccess  * and []      the double goes on the stack    the array goes on the free store  The Obj_holder example is not hypothetical.  For example, the C++ standard contains the following comment in its deﬁnition of the function type  §33.5.3  for holding function-like entities: ‘‘Imple- mentations  are  encouraged  to  avoid  the  use  of  dynamically  allocated  memory  for  small  callable objects, for example, where f’s  target is an object holding only a pointer or reference to an object and a member function pointer’’  §iso.20.8.11.2.1 .  It would be hard to follow that advice without something like Obj_holder.  How are Scoped and On_heap implemented?  Their implementations  are  trivial  and  do  not  involve any metaprogramming, but here they are:  template  struct On_heap {  On_heap   :p new T  { }      allocate ˜On_heap   { delete p; }     deallocate  T& operator∗   { return ∗p; } T∗ operator−>   { return p; }  On_heap const On_heap&  = delete; On_heap operator= const On_heap&  = delete;     prevent copying  private:  T∗ p;   };     pointer to object on the free store  template  struct Scoped {  T& operator∗   { return x; } T∗ operator−>   { return &x; }  private: T x;  };     the object  Scoped const Scoped&  = delete; Scoped operator= const Scoped&  = delete;     prevent copying   784  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  On_heap and Scoped provide good examples of how generic programming and template metapro- gramming  require  us  to  devise  uniform  interfaces  to  different  implementations  of  a  general  idea  here, the idea of allocation of an object .  Both On_heap and Scoped can be used as members as well as local variables. On_heap always  places its object on the free store, whereas Scoped contains its object.  §28.6 shows how we can implement versions of On_heap and Scoped for types that take con-  structor arguments.  28.2.1  Type Aliases Note how the implementation details of Obj_holder  as for Int  shine through when we use typename and ::type to extract the member type. This is a consequence of the way the language is speciﬁed and used, this is the way template metaprogramming code has been written for the last 15 years, and this is the way it appears in the C++11 standard. I consider it insufferable.  It reminds me of the bad old days in C, where every occurrence of a user-deﬁned type had to be preﬁxed with the struct keyword.  By introducing  a  template  alias   §23.6 ,  we  can  hide  the ::type implementation details and make a type function look much more like a function returning a type  or like a type . For example:  template  using Holder = typename Obj_holder ::type;  void f2   {  }  Holder  v1;     the double goes on the stack  Holder > v2;     ... ∗v1 = 7.7; v2[77] = 9.9;    ...     the array goes on the free store     Scoped provides pointer-likeaccess  * and []     On_heap provides pointer-likeaccess  * and []   Except when explaining an implementation or what the standard speciﬁcally offers, I use such type aliases  systematically. When  the  standard  provides  a  type  function   called  something  like ‘‘type property predicate’’ or ‘‘composite type category predicate’’ , such as conditional, I deﬁne a corre- sponding type alias  §35.4.1 :  template  using Conditional = typename std::conditional ::type;  Please note that these aliases are unfortunately not part of the standard.  28.2.1.1  When Not to Use an Alias  There is one case in which it is signiﬁcant to use ::type directly, rather than an alias. If only one of the alternatives is supposed to be a valid type, we should not use an alias. Consider ﬁrst a simple analogy:   Section 28.2.1.1  When Not to Use an Alias  785  if  p  {  p−>f 7 ;    ...  }  conditional<  is_integral ::value , make_unsigned , Error   >::type  It is important that we don’t enter the block if p is the nullptr. We are using the test to see if p is valid.  Similarly, we might want to test to see if a type is valid.  For example:  Here,  we  test  if T is  an  integral  type   using  the std::is_integral type  predicate   and  make the unsigned variant of that type if it is  using the std::make_unsigned type function . If that succeeds, we have an unsigned type; otherwise, we will have to deal with the Error indicator.  Had we written Make_unsigned  meaning  typename make_unsigned ::type  and tried to use it for a nonintegral type, say std::string, we would have tried to make a nonexistent type  make_unsigned ::type .  The result would have been a compile-time error.  In the rare cases where we can’t use aliases consistently to hide ::type, we can fall back on the more  explicit,  implementation-oriented ::type style.  Alternatively, we can  introduce  a Delay type function to delay evaluation of a type function until its use:  Conditional<  is_integral ::value , Delay , Error   >  The implementation of a perfect Delay function is nontrivial, but for many uses this will do:  template  class F, typename ... Args> using Delay = F ;  This uses a template template argument  §25.2.4  and variadic templates  §28.6 .  Independently of which solution we choose to avoid the undesired instantiation, this is the kind  of expert territory that I enter only with some trepidation.  28.2.2  Type Predicates A predicate is a function that returns a Boolean value.  If you want to write functions that take argu- ments that are types, it seems obvious that you’ll like to ask questions about the arguments’ types. For example: Is this a signed type? Is this type polymorphic  i.e., does it have at least one virtual function ?  Is this type derived from that type?  The answers to many such questions are known to the compiler and exposed to the programmer  through a set of standard-library type predicates  §35.4.1 . For example:   786  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  template  void copy T∗ p, const T∗ q, int n  {  if  std::is_pod ::value   else  for  int i=0; i!=n; ++i   memcpy p,q,n ;      use optimized memorycopy  p[i] = q[i];     copyindividual values  }  }  }  }  Here, we try to optimize the copy by using the  supposedly optimal  standard-library function mem- cpy   when we can treat the objects as ‘‘plain old data’’  POD; §8.2.6 . If not, we copy the objects one by one  potentially  using their copy constructor. We determine whether the template argument type is a POD by the standard-library type predicate is_pod. The result is presented by the member value. This standard-library convention is similar to the way type functions present their result as a member type.  The std::is_pod predicate is one of the many provided by the standard library  §35.4.1 . Since the rules for being a POD are tricky, is_pod is most likely a compiler intrinsic rather than imple- mented in the library as C++ code.  Like the ::type convention, the value ::value causes verbosity and is a departure from conven- tional notation that lets implementation details shine through: a function returning a bool should be called using   :  template  void copy T∗ p, const T∗ q, int n  {  if  is_pod        ...  template  void do_something   {  template  constexpr bool Is_pod   {  return std::is_pod ::value;  Fortunately, the standard supports that for all standard-library type predicates. Unfortunately, for language-technical reasons, this resolution is not available in the context of a template argument. For example:  Conditional   ,On_heap ,Scoped   x;    ..     error :is_pod    is a type  In particular, is_pod  is interpreted as the type of a function taking no argument and returning an is_pod   §iso.14.3[2] .  My solution is to add functions to provide the conventional notation in all contexts:   Section 28.2.2  Type Predicates   787  I capitalize the names of these type functions to avoid confusion with the standard-library versions. In addition, I keep them in a separate namespace  Estd . We can deﬁne our own type predicates. For example:  template  constexpr bool Is_big   {  return 100<sizeof T ;  }  We could use this  rather crude  notion of ‘‘big’’ like this:  template  using Obj_holder = Conditional    , Scoped , On_heap >;  It is rarely necessary to deﬁne predicates that directly reﬂect basic properties of types because the standard library provides many of those.  Examples are is_integral, is_pointer, is_empty, is_polymor- phic, and is_move_assignable  §35.4.1 .  When we have  to deﬁne such predicates, we have  rather powerful techniques available.  For example, we can deﬁne a type function to determine whether a class has a member of a given name and of an appropriate type  §28.4.4 .  Naturally, type predicates with more than one argument can also be useful. In particular, this is how we represent  relations  between  two types,  such  as is_same, is_base_of, and is_conver tible. These are also from the standard library.  I use Is_∗ constexpr functions to support the usual    calling syntax for all of these is_∗ functions.  28.2.3  Selecting a Function A function object is an object of some type, so the techniques for selecting types and values can be used to select a function. For example:  struct X {    writeX  void operator   int x  { cout <<"X" << x << "!"; }    ...  struct Y {    writeY  void operator   int y  { cout <<"Y" << y << "!"; }    ...  };  };  }  void f   {  Conditional 4 ,X,Y>{} 7 ;     makeanXoraYand call it  using Z = Conditional    ,X,Y>; Z zz;  zz 7 ;      makeanXoraY    call an X or a Y  As shown, a selected function object type can be used immediately or ‘‘remembered’’ for later use.   788  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  Classes with member functions computing some value are the most general and ﬂexible mechanism for computation in template metaprogramming.  Conditional is  a  mechanism  for  compile-time  programming. In  particular, this  means  that  the condition must be a constant expression.  Note the parentheses around sizeof int >4; without those, we would have gotten a syntax error because the compiler would have interpreted the > as the end of the template argument list. For that reason  and others , I prefer to use    greater than . Also, I sometimes use parentheses around conditions for readability.  28.2.4  Traits The standard library relies heavily on traits. A trait is used to associate properties with a type. For example, the properties of an iterator are deﬁned by its iterator_traits  §33.1.3 :  template  struct iterator_traits {  using difference_type = typename Iterator::difference_type; using value_type = typename Iterator::value_type; using pointer = typename Iterator::pointer; using reference = typename Iterator::reference; using iterator_category = typename Iterator::iterator_category;  You can see a trait as a type function with many results or as a bundle of type functions.  The  standard  library  provides allocator_traits  §34.4.2 , char_traits  §36.2.2 ,  iterator_traits  §33.1.3 , regex_traits  §37.5 , pointer_traits  §34.4.3 .  In addition, it provides time_traits  §35.2.4  and type_traits  §35.4.1 , which confusingly are simple type functions.  Given iterator_traits for a pointer, we can talk about the value_type and the difference_type of a  pointer even though pointers don’t hav e members:  template  Iter search Iter p, Iter q, typename iterator_traits ::value_type val  {  typename iterator_traits ::difference_type m = q−p;    ...  This is a most useful and powerful technique, but:  It is verbose. It often bundles otherwise weakly related type functions. It exposes implementation details to users.  Also,  people  sometimes  throw in type  aliases  ‘‘just  in  case,’’  leading  to  unneccesary  complexity. Consequently, I prefer to use simple type functions:  using Value_type = typename std::iterator_trait ::value_type;  template   template   using Difference_type = typename std::iterator_trait ::difference_type;  };  }   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129    Section 28.2.4  Traits   789  using Iterator_category= typename std::iterator_trait ::iterator_category;  template   The example cleans up nicely:  template  Iter search Iter p, iter q, Value_type  val  {  Difference_type  m = q−p;    ...  I suspect that traits are currently overused.  Consider how to write the previous example without any mention of traits or other type functions:  template  Iter search Iter p, iter q, Val val  {  auto x = ∗p;  auto m = q−p;     if wedon’t need to name *p’stype    if wedon’t need to name q-p’stype  using value_type = decltype ∗p ;  using difference_type = decltype q−p ;      if wewant to name *p’stype    if wewant to name q-p’stype  }  }     ...  Of  course, decltype   is  a  type  function,  so  all  I  did  was  to  eliminate  user-deﬁned  and  standard- library  type  functions. Also, auto and decltype are  new in C++11,  so  older  code  could  not  have been written this way.  We need a trait  or equivalent, such as decltype    to associate a type with another type, such as a value_type with a T∗. For that, a trait  or an equivalent  is indispensable for non-intrusively adding type names needed for generic programming or metaprogramming. When a trait is used simply to provide  a  name  for  something  that  already  has  a  perfectly  good  name,  such  as pointer for value_type∗ and reference for value_type&, the  utility  is  less  clear  and  the  potential  for  confusion greater. Don’t blindly deﬁne traits for everything ‘‘just in case.’’  28.3  Control Structures To do general computation at compile time, we need selection and recursion.  28.3.1  Selection In addition to what is trivially done using ordinary constant expressions  §10.4 , I use:  cid:129  Conditional: a way of choosing between two types  an alias for std::conditional   cid:129   Select: a way of choosing among several types  deﬁned in §28.3.1.3   These type functions return types. If you want to choose among values, ?: is sufﬁcient; Conditional   790  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  and Select are for selecting types. They are not simply compile-time equivalents to if and switch ev en though they can appear to be when they are used to choose among function objects  §3.4.3, §19.2.2 .  28.3.1.1  Selecting between Two Types  It is surprisingly simple to implement Conditional, as used in §28.2. The conditional template is part of  the  standard  library   in   ,  so  we  don’t hav e to  implement  it,  but  it  illustrates  an important technique:  template     general template struct conditional { using type = T;  template  struct conditional  {  using type = F;     specialization for false  };  };  The primary template  §25.3.1.1  simply deﬁnes its type to be T  the ﬁrst template parameter after the condition . If the condition is not true, the specialization for false is chosen and type is deﬁned to be F. For example:  typename conditional ::value ,X,Y>::type z;  Obviously, the syntax leaves a bit to be desired  §28.2.2 , but the underlying logic is beautiful.  Specialization is used to separate the general case from one or more specialized ones  §25.3 . In this example, the primary template takes care of exactly half of the functionality, but that fraction can vary from nothing  every nonerroneous case is handled by a specialization; §25.3.1.1  to all but a single terminating case  §28.5 . This form of selection is completely compile-time and doesn’t cost a byte or a cycle at run time.  To improve the syntax, I introduce a type alias:  template  using Conditional = typename std::conditional ::type;  Given that, we can write:  Conditional    ,X,Y> z;  I consider that a signiﬁcant improvement.  28.3.1.2  Compile Time vs. Run Time  Looking at something like  Conditional ::value ,X,Y> z;  for the ﬁrst time, it is not uncommon for people to think, ‘‘Why don’t we just write a normal if?’’ Consider having to choose between two alternatives, Square and Cube:   Section 28.3.1.2  Compile Time vs. Run Time   791  struct Square {  constexpr int operator   int i  { return i∗i; }  struct Cube {  constexpr int operator   int i  { return i∗i∗i; }  };  };  else  We might try the familiar if-statement:  if  My_cond      using Type = Square;     error :declaration as if-statement branch  using Type = Cube;     error :declaration as if-statement branch  Type x;     error :Type is not in scope  A declaration cannot be the only statement of a branch of an if-statement  §6.3.4, §9.4.1 , so this will not work even though My_cond    is computed at compile time. Thus, an ordinary if-state- ment is useful for ordinary expressions, but not for type selection. Let us try an example that doesn’t inv olve deﬁning a variable:  Conditional   ,Square,Cube>{} 99 ;     invoke Square{} 99  or Cube{} 99   That is, select a type, construct a default object of that type, and call it. That works.  Using ‘‘con- ventional control structures,’’ this would become:    My_cond    ?Square:Cube {} 99 ;  This example doesn’t work because Square{} 99  and Cube{} 99  do not yield types, rather than val- ues of types that are compatible in a conditional expression  §11.1.3 . We could try   My_cond   ?Square{}:Cube{}  99 ;      error :incompatible arguments for ?:  Unfortunately, this version still suffers from the problem that Square{} and Cube{} are not of com- patible  types  acceptable  as  alternatives in a ?: expression.  The restriction  to  compatible  types  is often  unacceptable  in  metaprogramming  because  we  need  to  choose  between  types  that  are  not explicitly related.  Finally, this works:  My_cond   ?Square{} 99 :Cube{} 99 ;  Furthermore, it is not signiﬁcantly more readable than  Conditional   ,Square,Cube>{} 99 ;  28.3.1.3  Selecting among Several Types  Selecting among N alternatives is very similar to choosing between two.  Here is a type function returning its Nth argument type:   792  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  class Nil {};  template  struct select;  template  using Select = typename select ::type;     Specializations for 0-3:  template  struct select  { using type = T1; };     specializefor N==0  template  struct select  { using type = T2; };     specializefor N==1  template  struct select  { using type = T3; };     specializefor N==2  template  struct select  { using type = T4; };     specializefor N==3  The general version of select should never be used, so I didn’t deﬁne it. I chose zero-based num- bering  to  match  the  rest  of  C++. This  technique  is  perfectly  general:  such  specializations  can present any aspect of the template arguments.  We don’t really want to pick a maximum number of alternatives  here, four , but that problem can be addressed using variadic templates  §28.6 . The result of picking a nonexisting alternative is to use the primary  general  template. For example:  Select  x;  In this case, that would lead to an immediate compile-time error as the general Select isn’t deﬁned.  A realistic use would be to select the type for a function returning the Nth element of a tuple:  template  Select  get Tuple & t ;     see §28.5.2  auto x = get  t ;      assume that t is a Tuple  Here, the type of x will be whatever T3 is for the Tuple called t. Indexing into tuples is zero-based.  Using variadic templates  §28.6 , we can provide a far simpler and more general select:  template  struct select;     general case; neverinstantiated  template  struct select  :select  { };   Section 28.3.1.3  Selecting among Several Types   793  template   struct select  {     ﬁnal case: N==0  using type = T;  };  template  using Select = typename select ::type;  28.3.2  Iteration and Recursion The basic techniques for calculating a value at compile time can be illustrated by a factorial func- tion template:  template  constexpr int fac   {  return N∗fac   ;  template  constexpr int fac    {  return 1;  constexpr int x5 = fac   ;  constexpr int fac int i  {  return  i<2 ?1:fac i−1 ;  constexpr int x6 = fac 6 ;  }}  }  }  The factorial is implemented using recursion, rather than using a loop. Since we don’t hav e vari- ables at compile time  §10.4 , that makes sense. In general, if we want to iterate over a set of val- ues at compile time, we use recursion.  Note the absence of a condition: there is no N==1 or N<2 test.  Instead, the recursion is termi- nated when the call of fac   selects the specialization for N==1. In template metaprogramming  as in functional programming , the idiomatic way of working your way through a sequence of values is to recurse until you reach a terminating specialization.  In this case, we could also do the computation in the more conventional way:  I ﬁnd this clearer than the function template expression of the idea, but tastes vary and there are algorithms that are best expressed by separating the terminating case from the general case. The non-template version is marginally easier for a compiler to handle. The run-time performance will, of course, be identical.  The constexpr version can be used for both compile-time and run-time evaluation.  The template   metaprogramming  version is for compile-time use only.   794  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  28.3.2.1  Recursion Using Classes  Iteration involving more complicated state or more elaborate parameterization can be handled using classes.  For example, the factorial program becomes:  template  struct Fac {  static const int value = N∗Fac ::value;  };  };  template  struct Fac  {  static const int value = 1;  constexpr int x7 = Fac ::value;  For a more realistic example, see §28.5.2.  28.3.3  When to Use Metaprogramming Using the control structures described here, you can compute absolutely everything at compile time  translation  limits  permitting . The  question  remains:  Why would  you  want  to? We  should  use these  techniques  if  and  when  they yield  cleaner, better-performing,  and  easier-to-maintain  code than alternative techniques.  The most obvious constraint on metaprogramming is that code depend- ing on complicated uses of templates can be hard to read and very hard to debug.  Nontrivial uses of templates can also impact compile times. If you have a hard time understanding what is going on in code requiring complicated patterns of instantiation, so might the compiler. Worse still, so may the programmer who gets to maintain your code. Template metaprogramming attracts clever people:  cid:129  Partly, that’s because  metaprogramming  allows  us  to  express  things  that  simply  can’t be done at the same level of type safety and run-time performance. When the improvements are  signiﬁcant  and  the  code  maintainable,  these  are  good  –  sometimes  even compelling  – reasons.   cid:129  Partly, that’s because  metaprogramming  allows  us  to  show off  our  cleverness.  Obviously,  that is to be avoided.  How would you know that you have gone too far with metaprogramming? One warning sign that I use  is  an  urge  to  use  macros   §12.6   to  hide  ‘‘details’’ that  have  become  too  ugly  to  deal  with directly. Consider:  deﬁne IF c,x,y  typename std::conditional ::type  Is this going too far?  It allows us to write  IF cond,Cube,Square  z;  rather than  typename std::conditional ::type z;  I hav e biased  the  question  by  using  the  very  short  name IF and  the  long  form std::conditional.   Section 28.3.3  When to Use Metaprogramming   795  Similarly, a more  complex condition  would  almost  equalize  the  number  of  characters  used. The fundamental difference is that I have to write typename and ::type to use the standard’s terminology. That exposes the template implementation technique. I would like to hide that, and the macro does. However, if many people need to collaborate and programs get large, a bit of verbosity is preferable to a divergence of notations.  Another serious argument against the IF macro is that its name is misleading: conditional is not a ‘‘drop-in replacement’’ for a conventional if. That ::type represents a signiﬁcant difference: condi- tional selects between types; it does not directly alter control ﬂow.  Sometimes it is used to select a function and thus represent a branch in a computation; sometimes it is not. The IF macro hides an essential aspect of its function. Similar objections can be leveled at many other ‘‘sensible’’ macros: they are named for some programmer’s particular idea of their use, rather than reﬂecting fundamen- tal functionality.  In this case, the problems of verbosity, of the implementation details leaking out, and of poor naming are easily handled by a type alias  Conditional; §28.2.1 .  In general, look hard for ways to clean up the syntax presented to users without inventing a private language. Prefer systematic tech- niques, such as specialization and the use of aliases, to macro hackery. Prefer constexpr functions to  templates  for  compile-time  computation,  and  hide  template  metaprogramming  implementation details in constexpr functions whenever feasible  §28.2.2 .  Alternatively, we can look at the fundamental complexity of what we are trying to do: [1]  Does it require explicit tests? [2]  Does it require recursion? [3]  Can we write concepts  §24.3  for our template arguments?  If the answer to question [1] or [2] is ‘‘yes’’ or the answer to question [3] is ‘‘no,’’  we should con- sider whether there may be maintenance problems. Maybe some form of encapsulation is possible? Remember  that  complexities  of  a  template  implementation  become  visible  to  users   ‘‘leak  out’’  whenever an instantiation  fails.  Also, many programmers  do  look  into  header  ﬁles  where  every detail of a metaprogram is immediately exposed.  28.4  Conditional Deﬁnition: Enable_if When  we  write  a  template,  we  sometimes  want  to  provide  an  operation  for  some  template  argu- ments, but not for others. For example:  template  class Smart_pointer {     ... T& operator∗  ;  T∗ operator−>  ;     ...  }     returnreference to whole object    select a member  for classes only   If T is a class, we should provide operator−>  , but if T is a built-in type, we simply cannot do so  with the usual semantics . Therefore, we want a language mechanism for saying, ‘‘If this type has this property, deﬁne the following.’’  We might try the obvious:   796  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  template  class Smart_pointer {     ... T& operator∗  ;  if  Is_class     T∗ operator−>  ;     ...     returnreference to whole object    syntax error  However,  that does not work.  C++ does not provide an if that can select among deﬁnitions based on a general condition. But, as with Conditional and Select  §28.3.1 , there is a way. We can write a somewhat curious type function to make the deﬁnition of operator−>   conditional.  The standard library  in    provides enable_if for that. The Smart_pointer example becomes:  template  class Smart_pointer {     ... T& operator∗  ;  Enable_if   ,T>∗ operator−>  ;     ...     returnreference to whole object    select a member  for classes only   As usual, I have used type aliases and constexpr functions to simplify the notation:  template  using Enable_if = typename std::enable_if ::type;  template  bool Is_class   {  return std::is_class ::value;  If Enable_if’s  condition evaluates to true, its result is its second argument  here, T .  If Enable_if’s condition  evaluates  to false, the  whole  function  declaration  of  which  it  is  part  is  completely ignored.  In this case, if T is a class, we get a deﬁnition of operator−>   returning a T∗, and if it is not, we don’t declare anything.  Given the deﬁnition of Smart_pointer using Enable_if, we get:  void f Smart_pointer  p, Smart_pointer > q  {  auto d0 = ∗p;  auto c0 = ∗q;  auto d1 = q−>real  ; auto d2 = p−>real  ;    ...     OK    OK    OK    error :pdoesn’t point to a class object  You may consider Smart_pointer and operator−>   exotic, but providing  deﬁning  operations condi- tionally is very common. The standard library provides many examples of conditional deﬁnition, such as Alloc::size_type  §34.4.2  and pair being movable if both of their elements are  §34.2.4.1 . The language itself deﬁnes −> only for pointers to class objects  §8.2 .  }  }  }  }   Section 28.4  Conditional Deﬁnition: Enable_if  797  In this case, the elaboration of the declaration of operator−>   with Enable_if simply changes the  kind of error we get from examples, such as p−>real  :   cid:129    cid:129   If we unconditionally declare operator−>  , we get a ‘‘−> used on a non-class pointer’’ error at instantiation time for the deﬁnition of Smart_pointer ::operator−>  . If we conditionally declare operator−>   using Enable_if, if we use −> on a smart_ptr , we  get  a  ‘‘Smart_ptr ::operator−>   not  deﬁned’’ error  at  the  point  of  use  of Smart_ptr ::operator−>  .  In either case, we do not get an error unless we use −> on a smart_ptr  where T is not a class.  We  hav e moved the  error  detection  and   implementation  of smart_pointer ::operator−>   to its declaration. Depending on the compiler and especially on how deep in a nest of template instantiations the error happens, this can make a signiﬁcant difference. In general, it is preferable to specify templates precisely so as to detect errors early rather than rely- ing on bad instantiations being caught. In this sense, we can see Enable_if as a variant of the idea of a concept  §24.3 : it allows a more precise speciﬁcation of the requirements of a template.  reporting   from   the   28.4.1  Use of Enable_if For many uses, the functionality of enable_if is pretty ideal. However, the notation we have to use is often awkward.  Consider:  Enable_if   ,T>∗ operator−>  ;  The  implementation  shows  through  rather  dramatically. Howev er,  what  is  actually  expressed  is pretty close to the minimal ideal:  declare_if  Is_class     T∗ operator−>  ;      not C++  However, C++ does not have a declare_if construct for selecting declarations.  Using Enable_if to decorate the return type places it up front where you can see it and where it logically  belongs,  because  it  affects  the  whole  declaration   not  just  the  return  type . However, some declarations do not have a return type. Consider two of vector’s constructors:  template  class vector  { public:  vector size_t n, const T& val ;    nelements of type T with value val  template   vector Iter b, Iter e ;    initializefrom [b:e      ...  };  This  looks  innocent  enough,  but  the  constructor  taking  a  number  of  elements  wrecks  its  usual havoc.  Consider:  vector  v 10,20 ;  Is that 10 elements with the value 20 or an attempt to initialize from [10:20]?  The standard requires the former, but the code above would naively pick the latter because an int-to-size_t conversion is required  for  the  ﬁrst  constructor  whereas  the  pair  of ints is a perfect  match  for  the  template   798  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  constructor. The problem is that I ‘‘forgot’’ to tell the compiler that the Iter type should be an itera- tor. Howev er, that can be done:  vector size_t n, const T& val ;      nelements of type T with value val  template   ,Iter>>  vector Iter b, Iter e ;     initializefrom [b:e   That  unused  default template argument will be instantiated because we certainly can’t deduce that unused template parameter. This implies that the declaration of vector Iter,Iter  will fail unless Iter is an Input_iterator  §24.4.4 .  I introduced the Enable_if as a default template argument because that is the most general solu- tion.  It can be used for templates without arguments and or without return types. However, in this case, we could alternatively apply it to the constructor argument type:  vector size_t n, const T& val ;      nelements of type T with value val  template   vector Enable_if   ,Iter>> b, Iter e ;     initializefrom [b:e   The Enable_if techniques  work  for  template  functions   including  member  functions  of  class  tem- plates  and  specializations   only. The  implementation  and  use  of Enable_if rely  on  a  detail  in  the rules  for  overloading  function  templates   §23.5.3.2 . Consequently, it cannot  be  used  to  control declarations of classes, variables, or non-template functions. For example:  Enable_if ∗ make_default      error :not a template {  return new Mystruct{};  template  class vector  { public:     ...  };  template  class vector  { public:     ...  };  template  void f const T& x  {  }  }  Enable_if  ,T> tmp = x; Enable_if  ,T&> tmp = ∗new T{x};     ...     error :tmp is not a function    error :tmp is not a function  For tmp, using Holder  §28.2   would  almost  certainly  be  cleaner  anyway:  if  you  had  managed  to construct that free-store object, how would you delete it?   Section 28.4.2  Implementing Enable_if  799  28.4.2  Implementing Enable_if The implementation of Enable_if is almost trivial:  template  struct std::enable_if {  typedef T type;  };  template  struct std::enable_if  {};     no ::type if B==false  template  using Enable_if = typename std::enable_if ::type;  Note that we can leave out the type argument and get void by default.  For a language-technical explanation of how these simple declarations become useful as a fun-  damental construct see §23.5.3.2.  28.4.3 Enable_if and Concepts We  can  use Enable_if for  a  wide  variety  of  predicates,  including  many tests  of  type  properties  §28.3.1.1 .  Concepts are  among  the  most  general  and  useful  predicates  we  have. Ideally, we would like to overload based on concepts, but lacking language support for concepts, the best we can do is to use Enable_if to select based on constraints. For example:  template  Enable_if   > fct T∗,T∗ ;      optimized implementation  template  Enable_if   > fct T∗,T∗ ;      nonoptimized implementation  Note that Enable_if defaults to void, so fct   is a void function.  I’m not sure that using that default increases readability, but we can use fct   like this:  void f vector & vi, vector >& vc  {  if  vi.size  ==0  vc.size  ==0  throw runtime_error "bad fct arg" ; fct &vi.front  ,&vi.back   ;  fct &vc.front  ,&vc.back   ;      call optimized    call nonoptimized  }  These calls are resolved as described because we can use  . Enable_if resolves to void if we don’t provide a type argument.  28.4.4  More Enable_if Examples When using Enable_if, sooner or later we want to ask if a class has a member with a speciﬁc name and  an  appropriate  type. For many of the  standard  operations,  such  as  constructors  and  assign- ments,  the  standard  library  provides  a  type  property  predicate,  such  as is_copy_assignable and is_default_constructible  §35.4.1 .  However,  we can  build  our  own  predicates. Consider  the   800  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  question  ‘‘Can  we  call f x  if x is  of  type X?’’ Deﬁning has_f to  answer  that  question  gives an opportunity  to  demonstrate  some  of  the  techniques  used  and  some  of  the  scaffolding boilerplate code provided internally in many template metaprogramming libraries  including parts of the stan- dard library . First, deﬁne the usual class plus specialization to represent an alternative:  struct substitution_failure { };    represent a failure to declare something  template  struct substitution_succeeded : std::true_type { };  template  struct substitution_succeeded  : std::false_type { };  Here, substitution_failure is  used  to  represent  a  substitution  failure   §23.5.3.2 . We  derive  from std::true_type unless  the  argument  type  is substitution_failure. Obviously, std::true_type and std::false_type are types that represent the values true and false, respectively:  std::true_type::value == true std::false_type::value == false  We use substitution_succeeded to deﬁne the type functions we really want.  For example, we might be looking for a function f that we can call as f x . For that, we can deﬁne has_f:  template  struct has_f  { };  : substitution_succeeded ::type>  So, if get_f_result  yields a proper type  presumably the return type of a call of f , has_f::value is true_type::value, which is true. If get_f_result  doesn’t compile, it returns substitution_failure and has_f::value is false.  So  far, so good,  but  how do we get get_f_result  to  be substitution_failure if  somehow f x   doesn’t compile for a value x of type X? The deﬁnition that achieves that looks innocent enough:  template  struct get_f_result { private:  template   static auto check X const& x  −> decltype f x  ;   static substitution_failure check ... ;      can call f x     cannot call f x   public:  };  using type = decltype check std::declval     ;  We simply declare a function check so that check x  has the same return type as f x . Obviously, that won’t compile unless we can call f x . So, that declaration of check fails if we can’t call f x . In that case, because substitution failure is not an error  SFINAE; §23.5.3.2 , we get the second deﬁnition of check  , which has substitution_failure as its return type. And, yes, this elaborate piece of trickery fails if our function f was declared to return a substitution_failure.   Section 28.4.4  More Enable_if Examples   801  Note that decltype   does not evaluate its operand. We  managed to turn what looked like a type error into the value false. It would have been sim- pler  if  the  language  had  provided  a  primitive   built-in   operation  for  doing  that  conversion;  for example:  is_valid   ;      can f x  be compiled?  However,  a  language  cannot  provide  everything  as  a  language  primitive. Giv en the  scaffolding code, we just have to provide conventional syntax:  template  constexpr bool Has_f   {  return has_f ::value;  }  Now, we can write:  template  class X {    ... Enable_if   > use_f const T&  {     ... f t ;    ...  }    ...  };  X  has a member use_f   if and only if f t  can be called for a T value t.  Note that we cannot simply write:  if  Has_f     f t ;  The call f t  will be type checked  and fail type checking  even if Has_f    returns false.  Given the technique used to deﬁne Has_f, we can deﬁne Has_foo for any operation or member foo we can think of. The scaffolding is 14 lines of code for each foo. This can get repetitive but is not difﬁcult.  This  implies  that Enable_if  allows  us  to  choose  among  overloaded  templates  based  on  just about any logical criteria for argument types. For example, we can deﬁne a Has_not_equals   type function to check if != is available and use it like this:  template  Enable_if   ,Iter> ﬁnd Iter ﬁrst, Iter last, Val v  {  while  ﬁrst!=last && ! ∗ﬁrst==v    ++ﬁrst; return ﬁrst;  }   802  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  template  Enable_if   ,Iter> ﬁnd Iter ﬁrst, Iter last, Val v  {  while  ! ﬁrst==last  && ! ∗ﬁrst==v    ++ﬁrst; return ﬁrst;  }  }  Such ad hoc overloading easily gets messy and unmanageable. For example, try adding versions that use != for the value comparison  that is, ∗ﬁrst!=v, rather than ! ∗ﬁrst==v  , when possible. Con- sequently, I recommend  relying  on  the  more  structured  standard  overloading  rules   §12.3.1   and specialization rules  §25.3  when there is a choice. For example:  template  auto operator!= const T& a, const T& b  −> decltype ! a==b   {  return ! a==b ;  The rules ensure that if a speciﬁc != has already been deﬁned for a type T  as a template or as a non- template function , this deﬁnition will not be instantiated. I use decltype   partly to show how  in general to derive the return type from a previously deﬁned operator, and partly to handle the rare cases where != returns something different from bool.  Similarly, we can conditionally deﬁne >,  =, etc., given a <.  28.5  A Compile-Time List: Tuple Here, I’ll demonstrate the basic template metaprogramming techniques in a single simple, but real- istic, example.  I will deﬁne a Tuple with an associated access operation and an output operation. Tuples deﬁned like this have been used industrially for more than a decade. The more elegant and more general std::tuple is presented in §28.6.4 and §34.2.4.2.  The idea is to allow code like this:  Tuple  x {1.1, 42, 'a'}; cout << x << "\n"; cout   x  << "\n";  The resulting output is:  { 1.1, 42, 'a'}; 42  The deﬁnition of Tuple is fundamentally simple:  template  struct Tuple : Tuple  {     layout: {T2,T3,T4} before T1  T1 x;  using Base = Tuple ;   Section 28.5  A Compile-Time List: Tuple  803  Base∗ base   { return static_cast  this ; } const Base∗ base   const { return static_cast  this ; }  Tuple const T1& t1, const T2& t2, const T3& t3, const T4& t4  :Base{t2,t3,t4}, x{t1} { }  So, a Tuple of four elements  often referred to as a 4-tuple  is a Tuple of three elements  a 3-tuple  followed by a fourth element.  We  construct a Tuple of four elements with a constructor that takes four values  potentially of four different types . It uses its last three elements  its tail  to initialize its base 3-tuple and the ﬁrst  its head  to initialize its member x.  Manipulation of the tail of a Tuple – that is of the base class of the Tuple – is important and com- mon in the implementation of the Tuple. Consequently, I provided an alias Base and a pair of mem- ber functions base   to simplify manipulation of the base tail.  Obviously, this  deﬁnition  handles  only  tuples  that  really  have  four  elements. Furthermore,  it leaves much of the work to the 3-tuple. Tuples with fewer than four elements are deﬁned as spe- cializations:  template  struct Tuple  { Tuple   {} };  template  struct Tuple  : Tuple  {  T1 x;     0-tuple     1-tuple  using Base = Tuple ; Base∗ base   { return static_cast  this ; } const Base∗ base   const { return static_cast  this ; }  Tuple const T1& t1  :Base{}, x{t1} { }  template  struct Tuple  : Tuple  {     2-tuple,lay out: T2 before T1  using Base = Tuple ; Base∗ base   { return static_cast  this ; } const Base∗ base   const { return static_cast  this ; }  Tuple const T1& t1, const T2& t2  :Base{t2}, x{t1} { }  T1 x;  T1 x;  template  struct Tuple  : Tuple  {     3-tuple,lay out: {T2,T3} before T1  };  };  };   804  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  using Base = Tuple ; Base∗ base   { return static_cast  this ; } const Base∗ base   const { return static_cast  this ; }  Tuple const T1& t1, const T2& t2, const T3& t3  :Base{t2, t3}, x{t1} { }  };  These declarations are rather repetitive and follow the simple pattern of the ﬁrst Tuple  the 4-tuple . That deﬁnition of a 4-tuple, Tuple, is the primary template and provides the interface to Tuples of all sizes  0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 . That is why I had to provide those Nil default template arguments.  In fact, they will never be used.  Specialization will choose one of the simpler Tuples rather than use Nil.  The way I deﬁned Tuple as a ‘‘stack’’ of derived classes is fairly conventional  e.g., std::tuple is deﬁned similarly; §28.5 . It has the curious effect that the ﬁrst element of a Tuple will  given the usual  implementation  techniques   get  the  highest  address  and  that  the  last  element  will  have  the same address as the whole Tuple. For example:  tuple {3.14,string{"Bob"},127,'c'}  can be graphically represented like this:  char  int  'c'  127  string  "Bob"  double  3.14  This opens some interesting optimization possibilities. Consider:  class FO {  * function object with no data members*  };  typedef Tuple  T0; typedef Tuple  T1; typedef Tuple  T2;  On  my  implementation,  I  got sizeof T0 ==8, sizeof T1 ==4, and sizeof T2 ==4 as  the  compiler  opti- mizes away the empty base classes. This is called the empty-base optimization and is guaranteed by the language  §27.4.1 .  28.5.1  A Simple Output Function The deﬁnition of Tuple has a nice regular, recursive structure that we can use to deﬁne a function for displaying the list of elements. For example:  template  void print_elements ostream& os, const Tuple & t  {  os  << t.x << ", "; print_elements os,∗t.base   ;     t’sx  }   Section 28.5.1  A Simple Output Function  805  template  void print_elements ostream& os, const Tuple & t  {  os  << t.x << ", "; print_elements os,∗t.base   ;  template  void print_elements ostream& os, const Tuple & t  {  os  << t.x << ", "; print_elements os,∗t.base   ;  template  void print_elements ostream& os, const Tuple & t  {  os << t.x;  template  void print_elements ostream& os, const Tuple & t  {  os << " ";  }  }  }  }  }  os << "{ "; print_elements os,t ; os << " }"; return os;  We can now write:  Tuple  x {1.1, 42, 'a'}; cout << x << "\n";  cout  {1.2,3,5,7} << "\n"; cout  {1.2,3,5} << "\n"; cout  {1.2,3} << "\n"; cout  {1.2} << "\n"; cout  {} << "\n";  Unsurprisingly, the output is:  The similarity of the print_elements   for the 4-tuple, 3-tuple, and 2-tuple hints at a better solution  §28.6.4 , but for now I’ll just use these print_elements   to deﬁne a << for Tuples:  template  ostream& operator & t  {   806  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  { 1.1 42, a } { 1.2,3,5,7 } { 1.2,3,5 } { 1.2,3 } { 1.2 } {  }  28.5.2  Element Access As deﬁned, Tuple has a variable number of elements of potentially differing types. We  would like to access those elements efﬁciently and without the possibility of type system violations  i.e., with- out using casts . We  can imagine a variety of schemes, such as naming the elements, numbering the elements, and accessing elements by recursing though the elements until we reach a desired ele- ment.  The last  alternative  is what  we  will  use  to  implement  the  most  common  access  strategy: index the elements. In particular, I want to implement a way to subscript a tuple. Unfortunately, I am unable to implement an appropriate operator[], so I use a function template get  :  Tuple  x {1.1, 42, 'a'};  cout << "{ "    x  << ", "   x  << ", "   x  << " }\n";     write{1.1, 42, a }  auto xx = get  x ;    xx is a double  The idea is to index the elements, starting from 0, in such a way that the element selection is done at compile time and we preserve all type information.  The get   function constructs an object of type getNth . The job of getNth  is to return a reference  to  the Nth  element,  which  is  assumed  to  have  type X. Given such  a  helper, we can deﬁne get  :  template  Select & get Tuple & t  {  return getNth ,N>::get t ;  The deﬁnition of getNth is a variant of the usual recursion from N down to the specialization for 0:  template  struct getNth {  template  static Ret& get T& t  {     getNth   remembers the type  Ret  of the Nth element     get the value element N from t’sBase  return getNth ::g et ∗t.base   ;  }  }  };   Section 28.5.2  Element Access  807  template  struct getNth  {  template  static Ret& get T& t  {  return t.x;  }  };  Basically, getNth is a special-purpose for-loop, implemented by recursing N−1 times.  The member functions  are static because  we  don’t really  want  any objects  of  class getNth. That  class  is  only used as a place to hold Ret and N in a way that allows the compiler to use them.  This is quite a bit of scaffolding to index into a Tuple, but at least the resulting code is type-safe and efﬁcient.  By ‘‘efﬁcient,’’  I  mean that given a reasonably good compiler  as is common , there is no run-time overhead for accessing a Tuple member.  Why must we write get  x  rather than just x[2]? We could try:  template  constexpr auto operator[] T t,int N  {  return get  t ;  Unfortunately, this does not work:  }   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   28.5.2.1 const Tuples  operator[]   must be a member, but we could handle that by deﬁning it within Tuple. Inside operator[]  , the argument N is not known to be a constant expression. I ‘‘forgot’’ that  only  lambdas  can  deduce  their  result  type  from  their return-statement  §11.4.4 , but that could be handled by adding a −>decltype g et  t  .  To get that, we need some language lawyering and for now, we hav e to make do with get  x .  As  deﬁned, get   works  for  non-const  Tuple elements  and  can  be  used  on  the  left-hand  side  of assignments.  For example:  Tuple  x {1.1, 42, 'a'};  get  x  = 'b';     OK  However, it can’t be used for consts:  const Tuple  xx {1.1, 42, 'a'};  get  xx  = 'b'; char cc = get  xx ;      error :xx is const    error :xx is const  surpr ise?   The problem is that get   takes its argument by non-const reference.  But xx is a const, so it is not an acceptable argument.  Naturally, we also want to be able to have const Tuples.  For example:   808  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  const Tuple  xx {1.1, 422, 'a'}; char cc = get  xx ;  cout << "xx: " << xx << "\n"; get  xx  = 'x';     error :xx is const     OK: reading from const  To handle const Tuples, we have to add const versions of get   and getNth’s get  . For example:  template  struct getNth {  template  static Ret& get T& t  {     getNth   remembers the type  Ret  of the Nth element     get the value element N from t’sBase  return getNth ::g et ∗t.base   ;  template  static const Ret& get const T& t  {  return getNth ::g et ∗t.base   ;     get the value element N from t’sBase  }  }  };  };  }  }  template  struct getNth  {  template  static Ret& get T& t  { return t.x; } template  static const Ret& get const T& t  { return t.x; }  template  Select & get Tuple & t  {  return getNth ,N>::get t ;  template  const Select & get const Tuple & t  {  return getNth ,N>::get t ;  Now, we can handle both const and non-const arguments.  28.5.3 make_tuple A class template cannot deduce its template arguments, but a function template can deduce them from its function arguments.  This implies that we can make a Tuple type implicit in code by having a function construct it for us:   Section 28.5.3  make_tuple  809  template  Tuple  make_tuple const T1& t1, const T2& t2, const T3& t3, const T4& t4  {  return Tuple {t1, t2, t3,t4};  }     ... and the other four make_Tuples ...  Given make_tuple  , we can write:  auto xxx = make_Tuple 1.2,3,'x',1223 ; cout << "xxx: " << xxx << "\n";  Other useful functions, such as head   and tail  , are easily implemented. The standard-library tuple provides a few such utility functions  §28.6.4 .  28.6  Variadic Templates Having to deal with an unknown number of elements is a common problem. For example, an error- reporting function may take between zero and ten arguments, a matrix may have between one and ten dimensions, and a tuple can have zero to ten elements. Note that in the ﬁrst and the last exam- ple, the elements may not necessarily be of the same type. In most cases, we would prefer not to deal with each case separately. Ideally, a single piece of code should handle the cases for one ele- ment, two elements, three elements, etc. Also, I pulled the number ten out of a hat: ideally, there should be no ﬁxed upper limit on the number of elements.  Over the years, many solutions have been found. For example, default arguments  §12.2.5  can be used to allow a single function to accept a variable number of arguments, and function overload- ing  §12.3  can be used to provide a function for each number of arguments.  Passing a single list of elements  §11.3  can be an alternative to having a variable number of arguments as long as the ele- ments are all of the same type. However,  to elegantly handle the case of an unknown number of arguments of unknown  and possibly differing  types, some additional language support is needed. That language feature is called a variadic template.  28.6.1  A Type-Safe printf   Consider  the  archetypical  example  of  a  function  needing  an  unknown  number  of  arguments  of  a variety of types: printf  . As provided by the C and C++ standard libraries, printf   is ﬂexible and performs nicely  §43.3 . However, it is not extensible to user-deﬁned types and not type-safe, and it is a popular target for hackers.  The  ﬁrst  argument  to printf   is  a  C-style  string  interpreted  as  a  ‘‘format  string.’’  Additional arguments  are  used  as  required  by  the  format  string. Format  speciﬁers,  such  as %g for  ﬂoating- point  and %s for  zero-terminated  arrays  of  characters,  control  the  interpretation  of  the  additional arguments.  For example:  printf "The value of %s is %g\n","x",3.14 ;   810  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  string name = "target"; printf "The value of %s is %P\n",name,Point{34,200} ;  printf "The value of %s is %g\n",7 ;  The ﬁrst call of printf   works as intended, but the second call has two problems: the format speciﬁ- cation %s refers to C-style strings, and printf   will not interpret the std::string argument correctly. Furthermore, there is no %P format and in general no direct way of printing values of user-deﬁned types, such as Point. In the third call of printf  , I provided an int as the argument for %s and I ‘‘for- got’’ to provide an argument for %g. In general, a compiler is not able to compare the number and types of arguments required by the format string with the number and types of arguments provided by the programmer. The output of that last call  if any  would not be pretty.  Using variadic templates, we can implement an extensible and type-safe variant of printf  . As  is common for compile-time programming, the implementation has two parts: [1]  Handle the case where there is just one argument  the format string . [2]  Handle the case where there is at least one ‘‘additional’’ argument that, suitably format-  ted, needs to output at an appropriate point indicated by the format string.  The simplest case is the one with only one argument, the format string:  void printf const char∗ s  {  if  s==nullptr  return;  while  ∗s  {  }  }  if  ∗s=='%' && ∗++s!='%'     makesure no more arguments are expected  throw runtime_error "invalid format: missing arguments" ;     %% represents plain % in a for matstr ing  std::cout << ∗s++;  That  prints  out  the  format  string. If  a  format  speciﬁer  is  found,  this printf   throws  an  exception because there is no argument to be formatted. A format speciﬁer is deﬁned to be a % not followed by another %  %% is printf  ’s  notation for a % that does not start a type speciﬁer . Note that ∗++s does not overﬂow even if a % is the last character in a string. In that case, ∗++s refers to the termi- nating zero.  That done, we must handle printf   with more arguments.  Here is where a template, and in par-  ticular a variadic template, comes into play:  template   void printf const char∗ s, T value , Args... args   {  while  s && ∗s  {  if  ∗s=='%' && ∗++s!='%'  {     variadic template argument list: one or more arguments     function argument list: twoormore arguments  std::cout << value;  return printf ++s, args... ;      afor matspeciﬁer  ignore which one it is     use ﬁrst non-for matargument    do a recursivecall with the tail of the argument list  }   Section 28.6.1  A Type-Safe printf    811  std::cout << ∗s++;  } throw std::runtime_error "extra arguments provided to printf" ;  }  This printf   ﬁnds  and  prints  the  ﬁrst  non-format  argument,  ‘‘peels  off’’ that  argument,  and  then calls itself recursively. When there are no more non-format arguments, it calls the ﬁrst  simpler  printf  . Ordinary characters  i.e., not % formal speciﬁers  are simply printed.  The overloading of << replaces the use of the  possibly erroneous  ‘‘hint’’ in the format speci- ﬁer. If an argument has a type for which << is deﬁned, that argument is printed; otherwise, that call does not type check and the program will never run.  A formatting character after a % is not used. I can imagine type-safe uses for such characters, but the purpose of this example is not to design the perfect printf   but to explain variadic templates.  The Args... deﬁnes  what  is  called  a parameter  pack. A parameter  pack  is  a  sequence  of  type value  pairs from which you can ‘‘peel off’’ arguments starting with the ﬁrst. When printf   is called with two or more arguments  void printf const char∗ s, T value , Args... args ;  is chosen, with the ﬁrst argument as s, the second as value, and the rest  if any  bundled into the parameter pack args for later use. In the call printf ++s,args...  the parameter pack args is expanded so that the ﬁrst element of args is selected as value and args is one element shorter than in the previ- ous call. This carries on until args is empty, so that we call:  void printf const char∗ ;  If we really wanted to, we could check printf   format directives, such as %s. For example:  template   void printf const char∗ s, T value , Args... args   {     variadic template argument list: one or more arguments     function argument list: twoormore arguments  while  s && ∗s  { if  ∗s=='%'  {     afor matspeciﬁer or %%     not for matspeciﬁer  switch  ∗++s  { case '%':  break;  case 's':  if  !Is_C_style_string    && !Is_string      throw runtime_error "Bad printf   format" ;  break;  case 'd':  case 'g':  }  if  !Is_integral     throw runtime_error "Bad printf   format" ; break;  if  !Is_ﬂoating_point     throw runtime_error "Bad printf   format" ; break;   812  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  std::cout << value;  return printf ++s, args... ;      use ﬁrst non-for matargument    do a recursivecall with the tail of the argument list  } std::cout << ∗s++;  } throw std::runtime_error "extra arguments provided to printf" ;  }  The  standard  library  provides std::is_integral and std::is_ﬂoating_point, but  you’d hav e to  craft Is_C_style_string yourself.  28.6.2  Technical Details If  you  are  familiar  with  functional  programming,  you  should  ﬁnd  the printf   example   §28.6   an unusual notation for a pretty standard technique. If not, here are minimal technical examples that might help. First, we can declare and use a simple variadic template function:  template  void f Types... args ;      variadic template function  That is, f   is a function that can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments of arbitrary types:  f  ;  f 1 ;  f 2, 1.0 ; f 2, 1.0, "Hello" ;     OK: args contains no arguments    OK: args contains one argument: int    OK: args contains twoarguments: int and double    OK: args contains three arguments: int, double,and const char*  A variadic template is deﬁned with the ... notation:  template  void f Types... args ;      variadic template function  The typename... in the declaration of Types speciﬁes that Types is a template parameter pack. The ... in the type of args speciﬁes that args is a function parameter pack. The type of each args func- tion  argument  is  the  corresponding Types template  argument.  We can  use class... with  the  same meaning as typename.... The ellipsis  ...  is a separate lexical token, so you can place whitespace before or after it. That ellipsis can appear in many different places in the grammar, but it always means ‘‘zero or more occurrences of something’’ .  Think of a parameter pack as a sequence of val- ues for which the compiler has remembered the types. For example, we could graphically represent a parameter pack for {'c',127,string{"Bob"},3.14}:  char  int  'c'  127  string  "Bob"  double  3.14  This  is  typically  called  a tuple. The  memory  layout  is  not  speciﬁed  by  the  C++  standard. For example, it might be the reverse of what is shown here  last element at the lowest memory address; §28.5 .  However, it is a dense, not a linked, representation. To get to a value, we need to start from   Section 28.6.2  Technical Details  813  the beginning and work our way through to what we want.  The implementation of Tuple demon- strates  that  technique   §28.5 . We  can  ﬁnd  the  type  of  the  ﬁrst  element  and  access  it  using  that, then we can  recursively  proceed to the next argument.  If we want to, we can give the appearance of indexed access using something like get  for Tuple  and for std::tuple; §28.6.4 , but unfortu- nately there is no direct language support for that.  If you have a parameter pack, you can expand it into its sequence of elements by placing a ...     do a recursivecall with the elements of args as arguments  Expansion of a parameter pack into its elements is not restricted to function calls. For example:  after it. For example:  template  void printf const char∗ s, T value , Args... args  {     ... return printf ++s, args... ;     ...  template  class X : public Bases... { public:  X const Bases&... b  : Bases b ... { }  X  x0; X  x1 1 ; X  x2 2,3 ; X  x3 2,3,4 ;   cid:129  A template argument list  cid:129  A function argument list  cid:129  An initializer list  cid:129  A base speciﬁer list  cid:129  A base or member initializer list  cid:129  A sizeof... expression  }  };  };  Here, Bases... says that X has zero or more bases. When it comes to initializing an X, the construc- tor requires zero or more values of types speciﬁed in the Bases variadic template argument.  One by one those values are passed to the corresponding base initializer.  We  can use the ellipsis to mean ‘‘zero or more elements of something’’ in most places where a  list of elements is required  §iso.14.5.3 , such as in:  A sizeof... expression is used to obtain the number of elements in a parameter pack. For example, we can deﬁne a constructor for a tuple given a pair provided the number of tuple elements is two:  template  class tuple {     ... template   tuple const pair >& ;   814  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  28.6.3  Forwarding One of the major uses of variadic templates is forwarding from one function to another. Consider how to write a function that takes as arguments something to be called and a possibly empty list of arguments to give to the ‘‘something’’ as arguments:  template  void call F&& f, T&&... t  {  f forward  t ... ;  That is pretty simple and not a hypothetical example.  The standard-library thread has constructors using this technique  §5.3.1, §42.2.2 . I use pass-by-rvalue-reference of a deduced template argu- ment type to be able to correctly distinguish between rvalues and lvalues   §23.5.2.1  and std::for- ward   to  take advantage  of  that   §35.5.1 . The ... is  read  as  ‘‘accept  zero  or  more && arguments, each of the type of the corresponding T.’’ The ... in forward  t ... is read ‘‘forward the zero or more arguments from t.’’  in T&&...  I used a template argument for the type of the ‘‘something’’ to be called, so that call   can accept  functions, pointers to functions, function objects, and lambdas.  }  }  }  }  }  We can test call  :  void g0   {  cout << "g0  \n";  template  void g1 const T& t  {  cout << "g1  : " << t << '\n';  void g1d double t  {  cout << "g1d  : " << t << '\n';  template  void g2 const T& t, T2&& t2  {  cout << "g2  : " << t << ' ' << t2 << '\n';  void test   {  call g0 ; call g1 ;      error :too few arguments   Section 28.6.3  Forwarding   815  call g1 ,1 ; call g1 ,"hello" ; call g1 ,1.2 ; call g1d,1.2 ; call g1d,"No way!" ;  call g1d,1.2,"I can't count" ; call g2 ,1,"world!" ;     error :wrong argument type for g1d      error :too manyarguments for g1d    int i = 99; const char∗ p = "Tr ying"; call g2 ,i,p ;     testing with lvalues  call []  { cout <<"l1  \n"; } ; call [] int i { cout <<"l0  : " << i << "\n";},17 ; call [i]  { cout <<"l1  : " << i << "\n"; } ;  }   *  *   I hav e to be speciﬁc about which specialization of a template function to pass because call   cannot deduce which one to use from the types of the other arguments.  28.6.4  The Standard-Library tuple The simple Tuple in §28.5 has an obvious weakness: it can handle at most four elements. This sec- tion presents the deﬁnition of the standard-library tuple  from  ; §34.2.4.2  and explains the techniques used to implement it. The key difference between std::tuple and our simple Tuple is that the former uses variadic templates to remove the limitation on the number of elements. Here are the key deﬁnitions:  template  class tuple   : private tuple  {     here is the recursion  Basically,atuple stores its head  ﬁrst  type,value  pairs  and derives from the tuple of its tail  the rest of the  type value  pairs . Note that the type is encoded in the type,not stored as data  typedef tuple  inherited;  public:  constexpr tuple   { }    default: the empty tuple     Constructtuple from separate arguments: tuple Add_const_reference  v, Add_const_reference ... vtail   : m_head v , inherited vtail...  { }     Constructtuple from another tuple: template  tuple const tuple & other   : m_head other.head   , inherited other.tail    { }   816  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  template  tuple& operator= const tuple & other     assignment {  m_head = other.head  ; tail   = other.tail  ; return ∗this;  }    ...  protected:  private:  Head m_head;  Add_reference  head   { return m_head; } Add_const_reference  head   const { return m_head; }  inherited& tail   { return ∗this; } const inherited& tail   const { return ∗this; }  };  }  }  There is no guarantee that std::tuple is implemented as hinted here. In fact, several popular imple- mentations derive from a helper class  also a variadic class template , so as to get the element lay- out in memory to be the same as a struct with the same member types.  The  ‘‘add  reference’’ type  functions  add  a  reference  to  a  type  if  it  isn’t a  reference  already.  They are used to avoid copying  §35.4.1 .  Curiously, std::tuple does not provide head   and tail   functions, so I made them private.  In fact, tuple does not provide any member functions for accessing an element. If you want to access an element of a tuple, you must  directly or indirectly  call a function that splits it into a value and .... If I want head   and tail   for the standard-library tuple, I can write them:  template  Head head tuple & t  {  return std::get  t ;      get ﬁrst element of t  §34.2.4.2   template  tuple  tail tuple & t  {  return  * details* ;  The  ‘‘details’’ of the  deﬁnition  of tail   are  ugly  and  complicated. If  the  designers  of tuple had meant for us to use tail   on a tuple, they would have provided it as a member.  Given tuple, we can make tuples and copy and manipulate them:  tuple  tt "hello",{1,2,3,4},1.2 ; string h = head tt.head ; tuple ,double> t2 = tail tt.tail ;     "hello"    {{1,2,3,4},1.2};  It can get tedious to mention all of those types. Instead, we can deduce them from argument types,   Section 28.6.4  The Standard-Library tuple  817  for example, using the standard-library make_tuple  :  template  tuple  make_tuple Types&&... t  {  return tuple  t... ;  }  string s = "Hello"; vector  v = {1,22,3,4,5}; auto x = make_tuple s,v,1.2 ;     simpliﬁed  §iso.20.4.2.4   The standard-library tuple has many more members than listed in the implementation above  hence the    ... .  In addition, the standard provides several helper functions. For example, get   is provided for element access  like get   from §28.5.2 , so we can write:  auto t = make_tuple "Hello tuple", 43, 3.15 ; double d = get  t ;      dbecomes 3.15  So std::get   provides compile-time zero-based subscripting of std::tuples.  Every member of std::tuple is useful to someone and most are useful to many, but none adds to our  understanding  of  variadic  templates,  so  I  do  not  go  into  details. There  are  constructors  and assignments  from  the  same  type   copy and  move ,  from  other  tuple  types   copy and  move ,  and from pairs  copy and move .  The operations taking a std::pair argument use sizeof...  §28.6.2  to ensure that their target tuples hav e exactly two elements.  There are  nine  constructors and assign- ments taking allocators  §34.4  and a swap    §35.5.2 .  Unfortunately, the  standard  library  does  not  offer  > for tuple. Worse,  writing  a << for std::tuple is amazingly complicated because there is no simple and general way of iterating through the elements of a standard-library tuple. First we need a helper; it is a struct with two print   func- tions.  One print   recurses through a list printing elements, and the other stops the recursion when there is no more elements to print:  template      printelement N and following elements struct print_tuple {  template  typename enable_if ::type print ostream& os, const tuple & t  const {     nonempty tuple  os   t ;  print_tuple    os,t ;      printan element    printthe rest of the elements  template  typename enable_if ::type  print ostream&, const tuple &  const { }     empty tuple  }  };  The pattern is that of a recursive function with a terminating overload  like printf   from §28.6.1 .   818  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  However, note how it wastefully lets get    count from 0 to N.  We can now write a << for tuple:  std::ostream& operator  &  {     the empty tuple  return os << "{}";  template  ostream& operator & t     anonempty tuple {  os   t ;  print_tuple ::print os,t ;     printthe rest of the elements return os << '}';     printﬁrst element  We can now print a tuple:  void user   {  cout << make_tuple   << '\n'; cout << make_tuple "One meatball!"  << '\n'; cout << make_tuple 1,1.2,"Tail!"  << '\n';  }  }  }  28.7  SI Units Example Using constexpr and  templates,  we  can  compute  just  about  anything  at  compile  time. Providing input for such computations can be tricky,  but we can always include data into the program text. However,  I  prefer  simpler  examples  that  in  my  opinion  stand  a  better  chance  when  it  comes  to maintenance.  Here, I will show an example that provides a reasonable tradeoff between implemen- tation complexity and utility. The compilation overhead is minimal and there is no run-time over- head.  The example is to provide a small library for computations using units, such as meters, kilo- grams, and seconds. These MKS units are a subset of the international standard  SI  units used uni- versally in science. The example is chosen to show how the simplest metaprogramming techniques can be used in combination with other language features and techniques.  We want to attach units to our values, so as to avoid meaningless computations. For example:  auto distance = 10_m; auto time = 20_s; auto speed = distance time;     10 meters    20 seconds    .5 m s  meters per second   if  speed == 20     ... if  speed == distance     ...     error :20 is dimensionless     error :can’t compare m to m s   Section 28.7  SI Units Example  819  if  speed == 10_m 20_s     ... Quantity  acceleration = distance square time ;    MpS2 means m  s*s      OK: the units match  cout << "speed==" << speed << " acceleration==" << acceleration << "\n";  Units provide a type system for physical values.  As shown, we can use auto to hide types when we want to  §2.2.2 , user-deﬁned literals to introduce typed values  §19.2.6 , and a type Quantity for use when we want to be explicit about Units.  A Quantity is a numeric value with a Unit.  28.7.1 Units First, I will deﬁne Unit:  template  struct Unit {  enum { m=M, kg=K, s=S };  };   cid:129  Meters for length  cid:129  Kilograms for mass  cid:129  Seconds for time  A Unit has components representing the three units of measurement that we are interested in:  Note that the unit values are encoded in the type. A Unit is meant for compile-time use.  We can provide more conventional notation for the most common units:  using M = Unit ; using Kg = Unit ; using S = Unit ; using MpS = Unit ; using MpS2 = Unit ;     meters    kilograms    seconds    meters per second  m s     meters per square second  m  s*s    Negative unit values indicate division by a quantity with that unit. This three-value representation of a unit is very ﬂexible.  We can represent the proper unit of any computation involving distance, mass,  and  time. I doubt  we  will  ﬁnd  much  use  for Quantity , that  is, 123 distances multiplied, divided by 15 masses multiplied, and then multiplied by 1024 time measurements multi- plied – but it is nice to know that the system is general. Unit  indicates a dimensionless entity, a value without a unit.  When we multiply two quantities, their units are added. Thus, addition of Units is useful:  template  struct Uplus {  using type = Unit ;  };  template  using Unit_plus = typename Uplus ::type;  Similarly, when we divide two quantities, their units are subtracted:   820  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  template  struct Uminus {  using type = Unit ;  template  using Unit_minus = typename Uminus ::type;  Unit_plus and Unit_minus are simple type functions  §28.2  on Units.  28.7.2 Quantitys A Quantity is a value with an associated Unit:  template  struct Quantity { double val; explicit Quantity double d  : val{d} {}  A further reﬁnement would have made the type used to represent the value a template parameter, possibly defaulted to double. We can deﬁne Quantitys with a variety of units:  Quantity  x {10.5}; Quantity  y {2};     xis10.5 meters    yis2seconds  I made  the Quantity constructor explicit to  make it less  likely  to  get  implicit  conversions  from dimensionless entities, such as plain C++ ﬂoating-point literals:  Quantity  s = 7;     error :attempt to convert anint to meters second  Quantity  comp Quantity  ;    ... Quantity  n = comp 7 ;     error :comp   requires a distance  Now we can start thinking about computations. What do we do to physical measurements? I’m not going to review a whole physics textbook, but certainly we need addition, subtraction, multipli- cation, and division.  You can only add and subtract values with the same units:  template  Quantity  operator+ Quantity  x, Quantity  y     same dimension {  return Quantity {x.val+y.val};  template  Quantity  operator− Quantity  x, Quantity  y     same dimension {  return Quantity {x.val−y.val};  Quantity’s constructor is explicit, so we hav e to convert the resulting double value back to Quantity.  };  };  }  }   Section 28.7.2  Quantitys  821  Multiplication Quantitys require addition of their Units.  Similarly, division of Quantitys subtrac-  tion of their Units.  For example:  template  Quantity > operator∗ Quantity  x, Quantity  y  {  return Quantity >{x.val∗y.val};  template  Quantity > operator  Quantity  x, Quantity  y  {  return Quantity >{x.val y.val};  Given these arithmetic operations, we can express most computations. However, we ﬁnd that real- world computations contain a fair number of scaling operations, that is, multiplications and divi- sions by dimensionless values.  We could use Quantity > but that gets tedious:  Quantity  speed {10}; auto double_speed = Quantity >{2}∗speed;  To  eliminate  that  verbosity, we can  either  provide  an  implicit  conversion  from double to Quan- tity > or add a couple of variants to the arithmetic operations. I chose the latter:  }  }  }  }  template  Quantity  operator∗ Quantity  x, double y  {  return Quantity {x.val∗y};  template  Quantity  operator∗ double x, Quantity  y  {  return Quantity {x∗y.val};  We can now write:  Quantity  speed {10}; auto double_speed = 2∗speed;  The main reason I do not deﬁne an implicit conversion from double to Quantity > is that we do not want that conversion for addition or subtraction:  Quantity  speed {10}; auto increased_speed = 2.3+speed;     error :can’t add a dimensionless scalar to a speed  It is nice to have the detailed requirement for the code precisely dictated by the application domain.   822  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  28.7.3 Unit Literals Thanks to the type aliases for the most common units, we can now write:  auto distance = Quantity {10}; auto time = Quantity {20}; auto speed = distance time;     10 meters    20 seconds    .5 m s  meters per second   That’s not bad, but it is still verbose compared to code that conventionally simply leaves the units in the heads of the programmers:  auto distance = 10.0; double time = 20; auto speed = distance time;     10 meters    20 seconds    .5 m s  meters per second   We  needed the .0 or the explicit double to ensure that the type is double  and get the correct result for the division .  The code generated for the two examples should be identical, and we can do better still nota-  tionally. We can introduce user-deﬁned literals  UDLs; §19.2.6  for the Quantity types:  constexpr Quantity  operator"" _m double d  { return Quantity {d}; } constexpr Quantity  operator"" _kg double d  { return Quantity {d}; } constexpr Quantity  operator"" _s double d  { return Quantity {d}; }  That gives us the literals from our original example:  auto distance = 10_m; auto time = 20_s; auto speed = distance time;     10 meters    20 seconds    .5 m s  meters per second   if  speed == 20     ... if  speed == distance     ... if  speed == 10_m 20_s      error :20 is dimensionless     error :can’t compare m to m s     OK: the units match  I deﬁned ∗ and   for combinations of Quantitys and dimensionless values, so we can scale the units using multiplication or division.  However, we could also provide more of the conventional units as user-deﬁned literals:  constexpr Quantity  operator"" _km double d  { return 1000∗d; } constexpr Quantity  operator"" _g double d  { return d 1000; } constexpr Quantity  operator"" _mg double d  { return d 10000000; } constexpr Quantity  operator"" _ms double d  { return d 1000; } constexpr Quantity  operator"" _us double d  { return d 1000; } constexpr Quantity  operator"" _ns double d  { return d 1000000000; }    ...     milligram    milliseconds    microseconds    nanoseconds  Obviously, this could really get out of control through overuse of nonstandard sufﬁxes  e.g., us is suspect even though it is widely used because u looks a bit like a Greek μ .  I could have provided the various magnitudes as more types  as is done for std::ratio; §35.3  but  thought it simpler to keep the Unit types simple and focused on doing their primary task well.   Section 28.7.3  Unit Literals   823  I use underscores in my units _s and _m so as not to get in the way of the standard library pro-  viding the shorter and nicer s and m sufﬁxes.  28.7.4  Utility Functions To ﬁnish the job  as deﬁned by the initial example , we need the utility function square  , the equal- ity operator, and the output operator. Deﬁning square   is trivial:  template  Quantity > square Quantity  x  {  return Quantity > x.val∗x.val ;  That basically shows how to write arbitrary computational functions. I could have constructed the Unit right there in the return value deﬁnition, but using the existing type function was easier. Alter- natively, we could easily have deﬁned a type function Unit_double.  The == looks more or less like all ==s.  It is deﬁned for values of the same Units only:  template  bool operator== Quantity  x, Quantity  y  {  return x.val==y.val;  template  bool operator!= Quantity  x, Quantity  y  {  return x.val!=y.val;  Note that I pass Quantitys by value.  At run time, they are represented as doubles.  The output functions just do conventional character manipulation: string sufﬁx int u, const char∗ x   {     helper function  }  }  }  }  string suf; if  u  {  suf += x; if  1<u  suf += '0'+u;  if  u<0  {  suf += '−'; suf += '0'−u;  }  } return suf;   824  Metaprogramming   Chapter 28  template  ostream& operator  v  {  return os << v.val << sufﬁx U::m,"m"  << sufﬁx U::kg,"kg"  << sufﬁx U::s,"s" ;  }  Finally, we can write:  auto distance = 10_m; auto time = 20_s; auto speed = distance time;     10 meters    20 seconds    .5 m s  meters per second   if  speed == 20     ... if  speed == distance     ... if  speed == 10_m 20_s     ...     error :20 is dimensionless     error :can’t compare m to m s     OK: the units match  Quantity  acceleration = distance square time ;    MpS2 means m  s*s   cout << "speed==" << speed << " acceleration==" << acceleration << "\n";  Such code will, given a reasonable compiler, generate exactly the same code as would have been generated using doubles directly. Howev er, it is ‘‘type checked’’  at compile time  according to the rules for physical units. It is an example of how we can add a whole new set of application-speciﬁc types with their own checking rules to a C++ program.  28.8  Advice [1]  Use metaprogramming to improve type safety; §28.1.

This chapter demonstrates how features can be used in combination to address a challenging design task: a general N-dimensional matrix.  I hav e never seen a perfect matrix class. In fact, given the wide variety of uses of matrices, it is doubtful whether one could exist.  Here, I present the programming and design techniques needed to write a simple N-dimensional dense matrix. If nothing else, this Matrix is far easier to use, and just as compact and fast, as anything a programmer would have time to write using vectors or built- in arrays directly. The design and programming techniques used for Matrix are widely applicable.   828  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  29.1.1  Basic Matrix Uses Matrix  is an N-dimensional matrix of some value type T. It can be used like this:  Matrix  m0 {1}; Matrix  m1 {1,2,3,4}; Matrix  m2 {     zero dimensions: a scalar    one dimension: a vector  4 elements     twodimensions  4*3 elements   {00,01,02,03},  {10,11,12,13},  {20,21,22,23}      row0    row1    row2  }; Matrix  m3 4,7,9 ;  Matrix ,17> m17;    17 dimensions  no elements so far      three dimensions  4*7*9 elements , all 0-initialized  The element type must be something we can store. We  do not require every property that we have for a ﬂoating-point number from every element type. For example:  Matrix  md;  Matrix  ms;     OK    OK: just don’t tryarithmetic operations  Matrix ,2> mm {    3-by-2 matrix of 2-by-2 matrices    amatr ixis a plausible "number"  {{1, 2}, {3, 4}},    col 0 {{4, 5}, {6, 7}},    col 1  {{8, 9}, {0, 1}},    col 0 {{2, 3}, {4, 5}},    col 1  {    row0  }, {    row1  }, {    row2  {{1, 2}, {3, 4}},    col 0 {{4, 5}, {6, 7}},    col 1  }  };  Matrix  arithmetic  doesn’t hav e exactly  the  same  mathematical  properties  as  integer  or  ﬂoating- point arithmetic  e.g., matrix multiplication is not commutative , so we must be careful how we use such a matrix.  As for vector, we use    to specify sizes and {} to specify element values  §17.3.2.1, §17.3.4.1 . The number rows must match the speciﬁed number of dimensions and the number of elements in each dimension  each column  must match. For example:  Matrix  mc1 2,3,4 ; Matrix  mc2 {  {'1','2','3'}   }; Matrix  mc2 {  {'1','2','3'}, {'4','5'}   };     error :too manydimension sizes     error :initializer missing for second dimension     error :element missing for third column   Section 29.1.1  Basic Matrix Uses   829  Matrix  has its number of dimensions  its order    speciﬁed as a template argument  here, N . Each dimension has a number of elements  its extent    deduced from the initializer list or speciﬁed as a Matrix constructor argument using the    notation.  The total number of elements is referred to as its size  . For example:  Matrix  m1 100 ;  Matrix  m2 50,6000 ;      one dimension: a vector  100 elements     twodimensions: 50*6000 elements  auto d1 = m1.order  ;  auto d2 = m2.order  ;      1    2  auto e1 = m1.extent 0 ;  auto e1 = m1.extent 1 ;      100    error :m1 is one-dimensional  auto e2 = m2.extent 0 ;  auto e2 = m2.extent 1 ;   auto s1 = m1.size  ;  auto s2 = m2.size  ;      50    6000     100    50*6000  We can access Matrix elements by several forms of subscripting. For example:  Matrix  m {       twodimensions  4*3 elements   {00,01,02,03},  {10,11,12,13},  {20,21,22,23}      row0    row1    row2  };  }  double d1 = m 1,2 ; double d2 = m[1][2]; Matrix  m1 = m[1]; double d3 = m1[2];     d==12    d==12    row1:{10,11,12,13}    d==12  We can deﬁne an output function for use in debugging like this:  template   Enable_if   ,ostream&>  operator<< ostream& os, const M& m  {  os << '{'; for  siz e_t i = 0; i!=rows m ; ++i  {  os << m[i]; if  i+1!=rows m   os << ',';  } return os << '}';  Here, Matrix_type is a concept  §24.3 . Enable_if is an alias for enable_if’s type  §28.4 , so this oper- ator<<   returns an ostream&.  Given that, cout<<m prints: {{0,1,2,3},{10,11,12,13},{20,21,22,23}}.   830  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  29.1.2 Matrix Requirements Before proceeding with an implementation, consider what properties we might like to hav e:   cid:129  N dimensions,  where N is  a  parameter  that  can  vary  from 0 to  many,  without  specialized   cid:129  N-dimensional storage is useful in general, so the element type can be anything we can store   cid:129  The mathematical operations should apply to any type that can reasonably be described as a   cid:129  Fortran-style  subscripting  using  one  index per  dimension,  for  example, m 1,2,3  for  a  3-D   cid:129  C-style subscripting, for example, m[7], yielding a row  a row is an N−1-D sub-Matrix of an  code for every dimension.   like a vector element .  number, including a Matrix.

Instead, facilities are provided for users to make their own.   Section 29.2  A Matrix Template   831  29.2  A Matrix Template To giv e an overview, here is the declaration of Matrix with its most interesting operations:  template  class Matrix { public:  static constexpr size_t order = N; using value_type = T; using iterator = typename std::vector ::iterator; using const_iterator = typename std::vector ::const_iterator;  Matrix   = default; Matrix Matrix&&  = default; Matrix& operator= Matrix&&  = default; Matrix Matrix const&  = default; Matrix& operator= Matrix const&  = default; ˜Matrix   = default;     move     copy  template   template   Matrix const Matrix_ref & ;      constructfrom Matrix_ref  Matrix& operator= const Matrix_ref & ;      assign from Matrix_ref  template    explicit Matrix Exts... exts ;     specify the extents  Matrix Matrix_initializer  ;  Matrix& operator= Matrix_initializer  ;      initializefrom list    assign from list  Matrix initializer_list   = delete;      don’t use {} except for elements  template   template   Matrix& operator= initializer_list   = delete;  static constexpr size_t order   { return N; } size_t extent siz e_t n  const { return desc.extents[n]; } size_t siz e   const { return elems.size  ; } const Matrix_slice & descriptor   const { return desc; }     number of dimensions    elements in the nth dimension    total number of elements    the slice deﬁning subscripting  T∗ data   { return elems.data  ; } const T∗ data   const { return elems.data  ; }     ‘‘ﬂat’’element access     ...  private:  };  Matrix_slice  desc; vector  elems;     slice deﬁning extents in the N dimensions    the elements   832  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  Using  a vector  to  hold  the  elements  relieves us from  concerns  of  memory  management  and exception  safety. A Matrix_slice holds  the  sizes  necessary  to  access  the  elements  as  an N-dimen- sional matrix  §29.4.2 . Think of it as a gslice  §40.5.6  specialized for our Matrix.  A Matrix_ref  §29.4.3  behaves just like a Matrix except that it refers to a Matrix, typically a sub- Matrix such as a row or a column, rather than owning its own elements. Think of it as a reference to a sub-Matrix.  A Matrix_initializer  is a suitably nested initializer list for a Matrix   §29.4.4 .  29.2.1  Construction and Assignment The default copy and move operations have just the right semantics: memberwise copy or move of the desc  slice descriptor deﬁning subscripting  and the elements. Note that for management of the storage for elements, Matrix gets all the beneﬁts from vector. Similarly, the default constructor and destructor have just the right semantics.  The constructor that takes extents  numbers of elements in dimensions  is a fairly trivial exam-  ple of a variadic template  §28.6 :  template  template  Matrix ::Matrix Exts... exts   :desc{exts...},  elems desc.size      copyextents    allocate desc.sizeelements and default initializethem  { }  The constructor that takes an initializer list requires a bit of work:  template  Matrix ::Matrix Matrix_initializ er  init  {  Matrix_impl::derive_extents init,desc.extents ;  elems.reserve desc.size ; Matrix_impl::insert_ﬂat init,elems ; assert elems.size   == desc.size ;  }     deduce extents from initializer list  §29.4.4     makeroom for slices    initializefrom initializer list  §29.4.4   The Matrix_initializer is  a  suitably  nested initializer_list  §29.4.4 .  The extents  are  deduced  by  the Matrix_slice constructor, checked,  and  stored  in desc. Then,  the  elements  are  stored  in elems by insert_ﬂat   from the Matrix_impl namespace.  To  ensure  that {} initialization  is  only  used  for  lists  of  elements,  I =deleted the  simple initial-  izer_list constructor. This is to enforce the use of    initialization for extents.  For example:  enum class Piece { none, cross, naught };  Matrix  board1 {  {Piece::none, Piece::none , Piece::none}, {Piece::none, Piece::none , Piece::none}, {Piece::none, Piece::none , Piece::cross}  }; Matrix  board2 3,3 ;  Matrix  board3 {3,3};    error :constr uctorfrom initializer_list  deleted     OK   {  }  }  Section 29.2.1  Construction and Assignment  833  Without that =delete, that last deﬁnition would have been accepted.  Finally, we hav e to be able to construct from a Matrix_ref, that is, from a reference to a Matrix or  a part of a Matrix  a submatrix :  template   template  Matrix ::Matrix const Matrix_ref & x   :desc{x.desc}, elems{x.begin  ,x.end  }     copydesc and elements  static_assert Conver tible   ,"Matrix constructor: incompatible element types" ;  The use of a template allows us to construct from a Matrix with a compatible element type.  As usual, the assignments resemble the constructors. For example:  template   template  Matrix & Matrix ::operator= const Matrix_ref & x  {  static_assert Conver tible   ,"Matrix =: incompatible element types" ;  desc = x.desc; elems.assign x.begin  ,x.end   ; return ∗this;  That is, we copy the members of Matrix.  29.2.2  Subscripting and Slicing A Matrix can be accessed through subscripting  to elements or rows , through rows and columns, or through slices  parts of rows or columns .  m.row i  m.column i  m[i] m i,j   m slice i,n ,slice j    Matrix  Access Row i of m; a Matrix_ref  Column i of m; a Matrix_ref  C-style subscripting: m.row i  Fortran-style element access: m[i][j]; a T&; the number of subscripts must be N Submatrix access with slicing: a Matrix_ref ; slice i,n  is elements [i:i+n  of the subscript’s dimension; slice j  is elements [i:max  of the subscript’s dimension; max is the dimension’s extent; the number of subscripts must be N  These are all member functions:  template  class Matrix { public:     ...   834  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  template       m i,j,k  subscripting with integers  Enable_if   , T&> operator   Args... args ; template   Enable_if   , const T&> operator   Args... args  const;  template       m s1,s2,s3  subscripting with slices  Enable_if   , Matrix_ref > operator   const Args&... args ;  template   Enable_if   , Matrix_ref > operator   const Args&... args  const;  Matrix_ref  operator[] size_t i  { return row i ; } Matrix_ref  operator[] size_t i  const { return row i ; }     m[i] rowaccess  Matrix_ref  row siz e_t n ;  Matrix_ref  row siz e_t n  const;  Matrix_ref  col size_t n ; Matrix_ref  col size_t n  const;     ...     rowaccess     column access  C-style subscripting is done by m[i] selecting and returning the ith row:  template  Matrix_ref  Matrix ::operator[] siz e_t n  {  return row n ;      §29.4.5  Think of a Matrix_ref  §29.4.3  as a reference to a sub-Matrix.  Matrix_ref  is specialized so that it refers to a single element  §29.4.6 . Fortran-style subscripting is done by listing an index for each dimension, for example, m i,j,k ,  };  }  };  yielding a scalar:  Matrix  m2 {  {01,02,03}, {11,12,13}  m 1,2  = 99; auto d1 = m 1 ; auto d2 = m 1,2,3 ;     overwr itethe element in row1column 2; that is 13    error :too few subscr ipts    error :too manysubscr ipts  In addition to subscripting with integers, we can subscript with slices.  A slice describes a subset of the  elements  of  a  dimension   §40.5.4 . In  particular, slice{i,n} refers  to  elements  [i:i+n  of the dimension to which it applies. For example:   Section 29.2.2  Subscripting and Slicing  835  The  ﬁrst   row   subscript slice{1,2} selects  the  last  two rows,  and  the  second   column   subscript slice{0,3} selects all elements in the columns.  The return type for a    with slice subscripts is a Matrix_ref, so we can use it as the target of an  Matrix  m2 { {01,02,03}, {11,12,13}, {21,22,23}  };  {11,12,13}, {21,22,23}  auto m22 = m slice{1,2},slice{0,3} ;  Now m22 is a Matrix  with the value  {  }  }  {  }  assignment.  For example:  m slice{1,2},slice{0,3}  = {  {111,112,113}, {121,122,123}  Now m has the value  {01,02,03}, {111,112,113}, {121,122,123}  Matrix  m3 { {01,02,03}, {11,12,13}, {21,22,23}  };  Selecting all elements from a point onward is so common that there is a shorthand: slice{i} means slice{i,max} where max is larger than the  largest subscript  in the dimension. So, we can simplify m slice{1,2},slice{0,3}  to the equivalent m slice{1,2},slice{0} .  The other simple common case is to select all elements of a single row or column, so a plain  integer subscript i among a set of slice subscripts is interpreted as slice{i,1}. For example:  auto m31 = m slice{1,2},1 ; auto m32 = m slice{1,2},0 ; auto x = m 1,2 ;     m31 becomes {{12},{22}}    m33 becomes {{11},{21}}    x==13  The notion of slicing subscripts is supported in essentially all languages used for numeric program- ming, so hopefully it is not too unfamiliar.   836  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  The  implementations  of row  , column  , and operator     are  presented  in  §29.4.5. The  imple- mentations of const versions of these functions are basically the same as those of their non-const versions.  The key difference is that const versions return results with const elements.  29.3 Matrix Arithmetic Operations So, we can create Matrixes, copy them, access their elements and rows.  However,  what we often want is to have  mathematical operations that save  us from expressing our algorithms in terms of accesses to individual elements  scalars . For example:  Matrix  mi {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6 }}; Matrix  m2 {mi}; mi∗=2;  Matrix  m3 = mi+m2; Matrix  m4 {{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}}; Matrix  v = mi∗m4;      2-by-3    copy    scale: {{2,4,6},{8,10,12}}    add: {{3,6,9},{12,15,18}}    3-by-2    multiply: {{18,24,30},{38,52,66},{58,80,102}}  The mathematical operations are deﬁned like this:  template  class Matrix {     ...  template  Matrix& apply F f ;     f x  for every element x  template  Matrix& apply const M& m, F f ;     f x,mx  for corresponding elements  Matrix& operator= const T& value ;      assignment with scalar  Matrix& operator+= const T& value ;  Matrix& operator−= const T& value ;  Matrix& operator∗= const T& value ;  Matrix& operator = const T& value ;  Matrix& operator%= const T& value ;      scalar addition    scalar subtraction    scalar multiplication    scalar division    scalar modulo  template      matrixaddition  Matrix& operator+= const M& x ;  template      matrixsubtraction  Matrix& operator−= const M& x ;     ...  };     Binar y+, -, * are provided as nonmember functions   Section 29.3.1  Scalar Operations  837  29.3.1  Scalar Operations A scalar arithmetic operation simply applies its operation and right-hand operand to each element. For example:  template  Matrix & Matrix ::operator+= const T& val  {  return apply [&] T& a  { a+=val; }  ;    using a lambda  §11.4   This apply   applies a function  or a function object  to each element of its Matrix:  template   template  Matrix & Matrix ::apply F f  {  for  auto& x : elems  f x ; return ∗this;     this loop uses stride iterators  As usual, returning ∗this enables chaining. For example:  m.apply abs .apply sqr t ;     m[i] = sqrt abs m[i]   for all i  As usual  §3.2.1.1, §18.3 , we can deﬁne the ‘‘plain operators,’’  such as +, outside the class using the assignment operators, such as +=. For example:  template  Matrix  operator+ const Matrix & m, const T& val  {  Matrix  res = m; res+=val; return res;  Without the move constructor, this return type would be a bad performance bug.  29.3.2  Addition Addition of two Matrixes is very similar to the scalar versions:  template   template  Enable_if   ,Matrix &> Matrix ::operator+= const M& m  {  static_assert m.order  ==N,"+=: mismatched Matrix dimensions" ; assert same_extents desc,m.descriptor    ;      makesure sizes match  return apply m, [] T& a,Value_type &b  { a+=b; } ;  }  }  }  }  Matrix::apply m,f  is the two-argument version of Matrix::apply f . It applies its f to its two Matrixes  m and ∗this :   838  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  template   template  Enable_if   ,Matrix &> Matrix ::apply M& m, F f  {  assert same_extents desc,m.descriptor    ;  for  auto i = begin  , j = m.begin  ; i!=end  ; ++i, ++j      makesure sizes match  f ∗i,∗j ; return ∗this;  }  Now operator+   is easily deﬁned:  template  Matrix  operator+ const Matrix & a, const Matrix & b  {  Matrix  res = a; res+=b; return res;  }  }  };  }  This deﬁnes + for two Matrixes of the same type yielding a result of that type. We could generalize:  template<typename T, typename T2, size_t N,  typename RT = Matrix ,Value_type >,N>  Matrix  operator+ const Matrix & a, const Matrix & b  {  Matrix  res = a; res+=b; return res;  If, as is common, T and T2 are the same type, Common_type is that type. The Common_type type function is derived from std::common_type  §35.4.2 .  For built-in types it, like ?:, giv es a type that best preserves values of arithmetic operations. If Common_type is not deﬁned for a pair of types we want to use in combination, we can deﬁne it. For example:  template  struct common_type  {  using type = Quad;  Now Common_type  is Quad.  We also need operations involving Matrix_refs  §29.4.3 .  For example:  template  Matrix  operator+ const Matrix_ref & x, const T& n  {  Matrix  res = x; res+=n; return res;   Section 29.3.2  Addition   839  Such  operations  look  exactly  like their Matrix equivalents.  There is  no  difference  between Matrix and Matrix_ref element  access:  the  difference  between Matrix and Matrix_ref is  in  the  initialization and ownership of elements.  Subtraction, multiplication, etc., by scalars and the handling of Matrix_refs are just repetition of  the techniques used for addition.  29.3.3  Multiplication Matrix multiplication is not as simple as addition: the product of an N-by-M matrix and a M-by-P matrix is an N-by-P matrix. For M==1 we get that the product of two vectors is a matrix, and from P==1 we get that the product of a matrix and a vector is a vector. We can generalize matrix multi- plication into higher dimensions, but to do that we have to introduce tensors [Kolecki,2002], and I don’t want to divert this discussion of programming techniques and how to use language features into a physics and engineering math lesson. So, I’ll stick to one and two dimensions.  Treating one Matrix  as an N-by-1 matrix and another as a 1-by-M matrix, we get:  template  Matrix  operator∗ const Matrix & u, const Matrix & v  {  const size_t n = u.extent 0 ; const size_t m = v.extent 0 ; Matrix  res n,m ; for  siz e_t i = 0; i!=n; ++i   for  siz e_t j = 0; j!=m; ++j   res i,j  = u[i]∗v[j];  return res;     an n-by-m matrix  This is the simplest case: matrix element res i,j  is u[i]∗v[j]. I have not tried to generalize to handle the  cases  where  the  element  types  of  the  vectors  are  different.  If necessary, the  techniques  dis- cussed for addition can be used.  Note that I’m writing to each element of res twice: once to initialize to T{} and once to assign u[i]∗v[j]. This roughly doubles the cost of the multiplication. If that bothers you, write a multiplica- tion without that overhead and see if the difference matters in your program.  Next, we can multiply an N-by-M matrix with a vector seen as an M-by-1 matrix. The result is  an N-by-1 matrix:  template  Matrix  operator∗ const Matrix & m, const Matrix & v  {  assert m.extent 1 ==v.extent 0  ;  const size_t n = m.extent 0 ; Matrix  res n ; for  siz e_t i = 0; i!=n; ++i   for  siz e_t j = 0; j!=n; ++j  res i  += m i,j ∗v j ;  return res;  }  }   840  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  Note that the declaration of res initializes its elements to T{}, which is zero for numeric types, so that the += starts out from zero.  The N-by-M matrix times M-by-P matrix is handled similarly:  template  Matrix  operator∗ const Matrix & m1, const Matrix & m2  {     columns must match rows  const size_t n = m1.extent 0 ; const size_t m = m1.extent 1 ; assert m==m2.extent 0  ;   const size_t p = m2.extent 1 ; Matrix  res n,p ; for  siz e_t i = 0; i!=n; ++i   for  siz e_t j = 0; j!=m; ++j   for  siz e_t k = 0; k!=p; ++k   res i,j  = m1 i,k ∗m2 k,j ;  return res;  }  }  There are numerous ways of optimizing this important operation.  That innermost loop could be more elegantly expressed as:  res i,j  = dot_product m1[i],m2.column j    Here, dot_product   is simply an interface to the standard-library inner_product    §40.6.2 :  template  T dot_product const Matrix_ref & a, const Matrix_ref & b  {  return inner_product a.begin  ,a.end  ,b.begin  ,0.0 ;  29.4 Matrix Implementation So  far, I hav e delayed  the  presentation  of  the  most  complicated   and  for  some  programmers  the most  interesting   ‘‘mechanical’’ parts  of  the Matrix implementation.  For  example:  What  is  a Matrix_ref? What is a Matrix_slice? How do you initialize a Matrix from a nest of initializer_lists and make sure the dimensions are reasonable? How do we ensure that we don’t instantiate a Matrix with an unsuitable element type?  The easiest way to present this code is to place all of Matrix in a header ﬁle. In that case, add  inline the deﬁnition of every nonmember function.  The deﬁnitions of functions that are not members of Matrix, Matrix_ref, Matrix_slice, or part of  the general interface are placed in namespace Matrix_impl.   Section 29.4.1  slice    841  29.4.1 slice   A simple slice as used for slice subscripting describes a mapping from an integer  subscript  to an element location  index  in terms of three values:  struct slice {  slice   :start −1 , length −1 , stride 1  { } explicit slice size_t s  :start s , length −1 , stride 1  { } slice size_t s, size_t l, size_t n = 1  :start s , length l , stride n  { }  size_t operator   siz e_t i  const { return start+i∗stride; }  static slice all;  size_t star t; size_t length;  size_t stride;      ﬁrst index    number of indices included  can be used for range checking     distance between elements in sequence  };  };  There is a standard-library version of slice; see §40.5.4 for a more thorough discussion. This ver- sion provides notational convenience  e.g., the default values provided by the constructors .  29.4.2 Matrix Slices A Matrix_slice is the part of the Matrix implementation that maps a set of subscripts to the location of an element. It uses the idea of generalized slices  §40.5.6 :  template  struct Matrix_slice {  Matrix_slice   = default;     an empty matrix: no elements  Matrix_slice size_t s, initializer_list  exts ;     extents Matrix_slice size_t s, initializer_list  exts, initializer_list  strs ;   extents and strides  template    Matrix_slice Dims... dims ;  template<typename... Dims,     Nextents  typename = Enable_if   ... >>  size_t operator   Dims... dims  const;     calculate indexfrom a set of subscripts  size_t siz e; size_t star t; array  extents;  array  strides;      total number of elements    star tingoffset    number of elements in each dimension    offsets between elements in each dimension  In other words, a Matrix_slice describes what is considered rows and columns in a region of mem- ory. In the usual C C++ row-major layout of a matrix, the elements of rows are contiguous, and the elements of a column are separated by a ﬁxed number of elements  a stride . A Matrix_slice is a function object, and its operator     does a stride calculation  §40.5.6 :   842  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  template   template  size_t Matrix_slice ::operator   Dims... dims  const {  static_assert sizeof... Dims  == N, "" ;  size_t args[N] { size_t dims ... };     Copyarguments into an array  return inner_product args,args+N,strides.begin  ,siz e_t 0  ;  Subscripting must be efﬁcient.  This is a simpliﬁed algorithm that needs to be optimized. If nothing else, specialization can be used to eliminate the simplifying copy of subscripts out of the variadic template’s parameter pack. For example:  template  struct Matrix_slice  {  size_t operator   siz e_t i  const {  return i;  template  struct Matrix_slice  {  }  }  }     ...     ...  }  }  size_t operator   siz e_t i, size_t j  const {  return i∗stides[0]+j;  The Matrix_slice is fundamental for deﬁning the shape of a Matrix  its extents  and for implementing N-dimensional subscripting. However, it is also useful for deﬁning submatrices.  29.4.3 Matrix_ref A Matrix_ref is  basically  a  clone  of  the Matrix class  used  to  represent  sub-Matrixes.  However,  a Matrix_ref does not own its elements. It is constructed from a Matrix_slice and a pointer to elements:  template  class Matrix_ref { public:  Matrix_ref const Matrix_slice & s, T∗ p  :desc{s}, ptr{p} {}    ... mostly likeMatr ix...   Section 29.4.3  Matrix_ref  843  A Matrix_ref simply points to the elements of ‘‘its’’ Matrix. Obviously, a Matrix_ref should not out- live its Matrix. For example:  The great similarity between Matrix and Matrix_ref leads to duplication. If that becomes a bother, we can derive both from a common base:  private:  Matrix_slice  desc; T∗ ptr;      the shape of the matrix    the ﬁrst element in the matrix  };  }  };  };  };  Matrix_ref  user   {  Matrix  m = {{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}}; return m.row 1 ;  auto mr = user  ;     trouble  template  class Matrix_base {     ... common stuff ...  template  class Matrix : public Matrix_base  {     ... special to Matrix ...  private:  Matrix_slice  desc; vector  elements;     the shape of the matrix  template  class Matrix_ref : public Matrix_base  {     ... special to Matrix_ref ...  private:  Matrix_slice  desc; T∗ ptr;     the shape of the matrix  29.4.4 Matrix List Initialization The Matrix constructor  that  constructs  from  an initializer_list takes  as  its  argument  type  the  alias Matrix_initializer:  template  using Matrix_initializer = typename Matrix_impl::Matrix_init ::type;  Matrix_init describes the structure of a nested initializer_list.   844  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  Matrix_init  simply has Matrix_init  as its member type:  template  struct Matrix_init {  using type = initializer_list ::type>;  The N==1 is special. That is where we get to the  most deeply nested  initializer_list :  template  struct Matrix_init  {  using type = initializer_list ;  To avoid surprises, we deﬁne N=0 to be an error:  template  struct Matrix_init ;      undeﬁned on purpose  template  Matrix ::Matrix Matrix_initializ er  init  {  Matrix_impl::derive_extents init,desc.extents ;  elems.reserve desc.size ; Matrix_impl::insert_ﬂat init,elems ; assert elems.size   == desc.size ;  We can now complete the Matrix constructor that takes a Matrix_initializer:     deduce extents from initializer list  §29.4.4     makeroom for slices    initializefrom initializer list  §29.4.4   To do so, we need two operations that recurse down a tree of initializer_lists for a Matrix :  derive_extents   determines the shape of the Matrix:  cid:129  Checks that the tree really is N deep  cid:129  Checks that each row  sub-initialize_list  has the same number of elements  cid:129  Sets the extent of each row insert_ﬂat   copies the elements of the tree of initializer_list s into the elems of a Matrix.  The derived_extents   called from a Matrix constructor to initialize its desc looks like this:  template  array  derive_extents const List& list  {  array  a; auto f = a.begin  ; add_extents  f,list ;  return a;     put extents from list into f[]  };  };  }   cid:129    cid:129   }  You giv e it an initializer_list and it returns an array of extents.  The recursion is done from N to the ﬁnal 1 where the initializer_list is an initializer_list .   Section 29.4.4  Matrix List Initialization  845  template  Enable_if 1 ,void> add_extents I& ﬁrst, const List& list  {  assert check_non_jagged list  ; ∗ﬁrst = list.size  ; add_extents  ++ﬁrst,∗list.begin   ;  template  Enable_if  add_extents I& ﬁrst, const List& list  {  ∗ﬁrst++ = list.size  ;      we reached the deepest nesting  template  bool check_non_jagged const List& list  {  auto i = list.begin  ; for  auto j = i+1; j!=list.end  ; ++j   if  i−>size  !=j−>siz e     return false;  return true;  The check_non_jagged   function checks that all rows have the same number of elements:  We need insert_ﬂat   to take a possibly nested initializer list and present its elements to Matrix  as a vector . It takes the initializer_list given to a Matrix as the Matrix_initializer and provides the ele- ments as the target:  template  void insert_ﬂat initializ er_list  list, Vec& vec  {  add_list list.begin  ,list.end  ,vec ;  Unfortunately, we can’t rely on the elements being allocated contiguously in memory, so we need to build the vector through a set of recursive calls.  If we have a list of initializer_lists, we recurse through each:  template   void add_list const initializer_list ∗ ﬁrst, const initializer_list ∗ last, Vec& vec  {     nested initializer_lists  for  ;ﬁrst!=last;++ﬁrst   add_list ﬁrst−>begin  ,ﬁrst−>end  ,vec ;  When we reach a list with non-initializer_list elements, we insert those elements into our vector:  }  }  }  }  }   846  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  template  void add_list const T∗ ﬁrst, const T∗ last, Vec& vec  {  vec.insert vec.end  ,ﬁrst,last ;  I use vec.insert vec.end  ,ﬁrst,last  because there is no push_back   that takes a sequence argument.  29.4.5 Matrix Access A Matrix provides  access  by  row,  column,  slice   §29.4.1 ,  and  element   §29.4.3 . A row   or col- umn   operation returns a Matrix_ref , the    subscript operation with integers returns a T&, and the    subscript operation with slices returns a Matrix .  The row of a Matrix  is a Matrix_ref  as long as 1<N:  }  }  }  }  template  Matrix_ref  Matrix ::row siz e_t n  {  assert n<rows   ; Matrix_slice  row; Matrix_impl::slice_dim  n,desc,row ; return {row,data  };  We need specializations for N==1 and N==0:  template  T& Matrix ::row siz e_t i  {  return &elems[i];  template  T& Matrix ::row siz e_t n  = delete;  template  Matrix_ref  Matrix ::column siz e_t n  {  assert n<cols   ; Matrix_slice  col; Matrix_impl::slice_dim  n,desc,col ; return {col,data  };  Selecting  a column   is  essentially  the  same  as  selecting  a row  . The  difference  is  simply  in  the construction of the Matrix_slice:  The const versions are equivalent.  Requesting_element   and Requesting_slice   are concepts for a set of integers used for subscript- ing  with  a  set  of  integers  and  subscripting  by  a  slice,  respectively   §29.4.5 . They check  that  a sequence of access-function arguments are of suitable types for use as subscripts.   Section 29.4.5  Matrix Access   847  Subscripting with integers is deﬁned like this:  template   template  Enable_if   ,T&> Matrix ::operator   Args... args  {     subscriptingwith integers  assert Matrix_impl::check_bounds desc, args...  ; return ∗ data   + desc args...  ;  }  The check_bounds   predicate  checks  that  the  number  of  subscripts  equals  the  number  of  dimen- sions and that the subscripts are within bounds:  template  bool check_bounds const Matrix_slice & slice, Dims... dims  {  size_t indexes[N] {size_t dims ...}; return equal indexes, indexes+N, slice.extents, less  {} ;  The actual location of the element in the Matrix is calculated by invoking the Matrix’s Matrix_slice’s generalized slice calculation presented as a function object: desc args... . Add that to the start of the data  data    and we have our location:  return ∗ data   + desc args...  ;  This leaves the most mysterious part of the declaration for last. The speciﬁcation of operator    ’s return type looks like this:  Enable_if   ,T&>  So the return type is T& provided that  Matrix_impl::Requesting_element     is true  §28.4 .  This predicate simply checks that every subscript can be converted to the required size_t by using a concept version of the standard-library predicate is_conver tible  §35.4.1 :  All   simply applies its predicate to every element of a variadic template:  template  constexpr bool Requesting_element   {  return All Conver tible   ... ;  constexpr bool All   { return true; }  template  constexpr bool All bool b, Args... args  {  return b && All args... ;  }  }  }   848  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  The reason for using a predicate  Requesting_element  and the Enable_if   ‘‘hidden’’ within Request is to choose between the element and the slice subscript operators. The predicate used by the slice subscript operator looks like this:  template  constexpr bool Requesting_slice   {  return All  Conver tible     Same    ...   && Some Same   ... ;  That is, if there is at least one slice argument and if all arguments are either convertible to slice or size_t, we hav e something that can be used to describe a Matrix :  template   template      subscriptingwith slices  Enable_if   , Matrix_ref >  Matrix ::operator   const Args&... args  {  matrix_slice  d; d.start = matrix_impl::do_slice desc,d,args... ; return {d,data  };  }  The slices represented  as  extents  and  strides  in  a Matrix_slice and  used  for slice subscripting  are computed like this:  template  size_t do_slice const Matrix_slice & os, Matrix_slice & ns, const T& s, const Args&... args  {  size_t m = do_slice_dim  os,ns,s ; size_t n = do_slice os,ns,args... ; return m+n;  As usual, the recursion is terminated by a simple function:  template  size_t do_slice const Matrix_slice & os, Matrix_slice & ns  {  return 0;  }  }  }  The do_slice_dim   is a tricky bit of computation  to get the slice values right  but illustrates no new programming techniques.  29.4.6  Zero-Dimensional Matrix The Matrix code contains a lot of occurrences of N−1 where N is the number of dimensions. Thus, N==0 could easily become a nasty special case  for the programming as well as for the mathemat- ics .  Here, we solve the problem by deﬁning a specialization:   Section 29.4.6  Zero-Dimensional Matrix  849  template  class Matrix  { public:  static constexpr size_t order = 0; using value_type = T;  Matrix const T& x  : elem x  { } Matrix& operator= const T& value  { elem = value; return ∗this; }  T& operator     { return elem; } const T& operator     const { return elem; }  operator T&   { return elem; } operator const T&   { return elem; }  private:  T elem;  };  Matrix  is not really a matrix. It stores a single element of type T and can only be converted to a reference to that type.  29.5  Solving Linear Equations The code for a numerical computation makes sense if you understand the problem being solved and the math used to express the solution and tends to appear to be utter nonsense if you don’t. The example used here should be rather trivial if you have learned basic linear algebra; if not, just see it as an example of transcribing a textbook solution into code with minimal rewording.  The example here is chosen to demonstrate a reasonably realistic and important use of Matrixes.  We will solve a set  any set  of linear equations of this form: a1,1 x1 + . . . + a1,n xn = b1  . . .  an,1 x1 + . . . + an,n xn = bn  Here, the xs designate the n unknowns; as and bs are given constants.  For simplicity, we assume that  the  unknowns  and  the  constants  are  ﬂoating-point  values.  The  goal  is  to  ﬁnd  values  for  the unknowns that simultaneously satisfy the n equations.  These equations can compactly be expressed in terms of a matrix and two vectors:  Ax =b  Here, A is the square n-by-n matrix deﬁned by the coefﬁcients: ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦  . . . . . . . . .  a1,n . . . an,n  a1,1 . . . an,1  A =  ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣  The vectors x and b are the vectors of unknowns and constants, respectively:   850  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  This system may have zero, one, or an inﬁnite number of solutions, depending on the coefﬁcients of the matrix A and the vector b. There are various methods for solving linear systems. We  use a classic scheme, called Gaussian elimination [Freeman,1992], [Stewart,1998], [Wood,1999].  First, we transform A and b so that A is an upper-triangular matrix. By ‘‘upper-triangular,’’ we mean all the coefﬁcients below the diagonal of A are zero. In other words, the system looks like this:  x =  , and b =  ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣  x1 . . . xn  ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦  ⎡ b1 ⎢ . . . ⎢ ⎣ bn  ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦  ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣  a1,1 0 0  . . . . . . 0  a1,n . . . an,n  ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦  ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣  x1 . . . xn  ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦  =  ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣  b1 . . . bn  ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦  This is easily done. A zero for position a i,j  is obtained by multiplying the equation for row i by a constant so that a i,j  equals another element in column j, say a k,j . That done, we just subtract the two equations, and a i,j ==0 and the other values in row i change appropriately.  If we can get all the diagonal coefﬁcients to be nonzero, then the system has a unique solution,  which can be found by ‘‘back substitution.’’  The last equation is easily solved:  an,n xn = bn  Obviously, x[n] is b[n] a n,n . That done, eliminate row n from the system and proceed to ﬁnd the value of x[n−1], and so on, until the value for x[1] is computed. For each n, we divide by a n,n  so the diagonal values must be nonzero. If that does not hold, the back substitution method fails, meaning that the system has zero or an inﬁnite number of solutions.  29.5.1  Classical Gaussian Elimination Now let us look at the C++ code to express this. First, we’ll simplify our notation by convention- ally naming the two Matrix types that we are going to use:  using Mat2d = Matrix ; using Vec = Matrix ;  Next, we will express our desired computation:  Vec classical_gaussian_elimination Mat2d A, Vec b  {  classical_elimination A, b ; return back_substitution A, b ;  }  That is, we make copies of our inputs A and b  using call-by-value , call a function to solve the sys- tem, and then calculate the result to return by back substitution. The point is that our breakdown of the problem and our notation for the solution are right out of the textbook. To complete our solu- tion, we have to implement classical_elimination   and back_substitution  . Again, the solution is in the textbook:   Section 29.5.1  Classical Gaussian Elimination  851  void classical_elimination Mat2d& A, Vec& b  {  const size_t n = A.dim1  ;     traverse from 1st column to the next-to-last, ﬁlling zeros into all elements under the diagonal: for  siz e_t j = 0; j!=n−1; ++j  {  const double pivot = A j, j ; if  pivot==0  throw Elim_failure j ;    ﬁll zeros into each element under the diagonal of the ith row: for  siz e_t i = j+1; i!=n; ++i  {  const double mult = A i,j    pivot; A[i] slice j   = scale_and_add A[j] slice j  , −mult,A[i] slice j   ; b i  −= mult∗b j ;    makethe corresponding change to b  }  }  The pivot is the element that lies on the diagonal of the row we are currently dealing with. It must be nonzero because we need to divide by it; if it is zero, we give up by throwing an exception:  }  }  Vec back_substitution const Mat2d& A, const Vec& b  {  const size_t n = A.dim1  ; Vec x n ;  for  siz e_t i = n−1; i>=0; −−i  {  double s = b i −dot_product A[i] slice i+1  ,x slice i+1   ; if  double m = A i,i    x i  = s m;  throw Back_subst_failure i ;  else  } return x;  29.5.2  Pivoting We  can avoid the divide-by-zero problem and also achieve  a  more robust solution by sorting the rows to get zeros and small values away from the diagonal. By ‘‘more robust’’ we mean less sensi- tive to rounding errors. However, the values change as we go along placing zeros under the diago- nal, so we have to also reorder to get small values away from the diagonal  that is, we can’t just reorder the matrix and then use the classical algorithm :  void elim_with_partial_pivot Mat2d& A, Vec& b  {  const size_t n = A.dim1  ;  for  siz e_t j = 0; j!=n; ++j  { size_t pivot_row = j;   852  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29     look for a suitable pivot:  for  siz e_t k = j+1; k!=n; ++k   if  abs A k,j   > abs A pivot_row,j     pivot_row = k;     swapthe rows if wefound a better pivot: if  pivot_row!=j  {  A.swap_rows j,pivot_row ; std::swap b j ,b pivot_row  ;  }  }  }  }     elimination: for  siz e_t i = j+1; i!=n; ++i  {  const double pivot = A j,j ; if  pivot==0  error "can't solve: pivot==0" ; const double mult = A i,j  pivot; A[i].slice j  = scale_and_add A[j].slice j , −mult, A[i].slice j  ; b i  −= mult∗b j ;  We  use swap_rows   and scale_and_multiply   to  make the  code  more  conventional  and  to  save  us from writing an explicit loop.  29.5.3  Testing Obviously, we hav e to test our code. Fortunately, there is a simple way to do that:  void solve_random_system size_t n  {  Mat2d A = random_matrix n ;    generate random Mat2d Vec b = random_vector n ;      generate random Vec  cout << "A = " << A << endl; cout << "b = " << b << endl;  try {  Vec x = classical_gaussian_elimination A, b ; cout << "classical elim solution is x = " << x << endl;  Vec v = A ∗ x;  cout << " A ∗ x = " << v << endl;  } catch const exception& e  {  cerr << e.what   << endl;  }  }  We can get to the catch-clause in three ways:   Section 29.5.3  Testing   853   cid:129  A bug in the code  but, being optimists, we don’t think there are any   cid:129  An input that trips up classical_elimination    using elim_with_partial_pivot   would minimize  the chances of that    cid:129  Rounding errors  However, our test is not as realistic as we’d like because genuinely random matrices are unlikely to cause problems for classical_elimination  .  To  verify our solution, we print out A∗x, which had better equal b  or close enough for our pur-  pose, given rounding errors . The likelihood of rounding errors is the reason we didn’t just do:  if  A∗x!=b  error "substitution failed" ;  Because ﬂoating-point numbers are just approximations to real numbers, we have to accept approx- imately correct answers. In general, using == and != on the result of a ﬂoating-point computation is best  avoided:  ﬂoating-point  is  inherently  an  approximation. Had  I  felt  the  need  for  a  machine check,  I  would  have  deﬁned  an equal   function  with  a  notion  of  which  error  ranges  to  consider acceptable and then written:  if  equal A∗x,b   error "substitution failed" ;  The random_matrix   and random_vector   are simple uses of random numbers and are left as simple exercises for the reader.  29.5.4  Fused Operations In  addition  to  providing  efﬁcient  primitive  operations,  a  general  matrix  class  must  handle  three related problems to satisfy performance-conscious users: [1]  The number of temporaries must be minimized. [2]  Copying of matrices must be minimized. [3]  Multiple loops over the same data in composite operations must be minimized.  Consider U=M∗V+W, where U, V, and W are  vectors   Matrix   and M is  a Matrix . A naive implementation introduces temporary vectors for M∗V and M∗V+W and copies the results of M∗V and M∗V+W. A smart  implementation  calls  a  function mul_add_and_assign &U,&M,&V,&W  that  intro- duces no temporaries, copies no vectors, and touches each element of the matrices the minimum number of times.  The move constructor helps: the temporary used for M∗V is used for  M∗V +W. If we had written Matrix  U=M∗V+W;  we would have eliminated all element copies: the elements allocated in the local variable in M∗V are the ones ending up in U.  That leaves the problem of merging the loops: loop fusion. This degree of optimization is rarely necessary for more than a few kinds of expressions, so a simple solution to efﬁciency problems is to  provide  functions  such  as mul_add_and_assign   and  let  the  user  call  those  where  it  matters. However,  it is possible to design a Matrix so that such optimizations are applied automatically for expressions of the right form. That is, we can treat U=M∗V+W as a use of a single operator with four operands.  The basic technique was demonstrated for ostream manipulators  §38.4.5.2 . In general, it can be used to make a combination of n binary operators act like an  n+1 -ary operator. Handling U=M∗V+W requires the introduction of two auxiliary classes. However,  the technique can result in   854  A Matrix Design  Chapter 29  impressive  speedups   say, 30 times   on  some  systems  by  enabling  more  powerful  optimization techniques.  First, for  simplicity, let  us  restrict  ourselves  to  two-dimensional  matrices  of  double- precision ﬂoating-point numbers:  using Mat2d = Matrix ; using Vec = Matrix ;  We deﬁne the result of multiplying a Mat2d by a Vec:  struct MVmul {  const Mat2d& m; const Vec& v;  MVmul const Mat2d& mm, const Vec &vv  :m{mm}, v{vv} { }  operator Vec  ;    evaluate and returnresult  inline MVmul operator∗ const Mat2d& mm, const Vec& vv  {  return MVmul mm,vv ;  };  }  };  }  This ‘‘multiplication’’ should replace the one from §29.3 and does nothing except store references to its operands; the evaluation of M∗V is deferred. The object produced by ∗ is closely related to what is called a closure in many technical communities. Similarly, we can deal with what happens if we add a Vec:  struct MVmulVadd {  const Mat2d& m; const Vec& v; const Vec& v2;  MVmulVadd const MVmul& mv, const Vec& vv  :m mv.m , v mv.v , v2 vv  { }  operator Vec  ;    evaluate and returnresult  inline MVmulVadd operator+ const MVmul& mv, const Vec& vv  {  return MVmulVadd mv,vv ;  This defers the evaluation of M∗V+W. We now hav e to ensure that it all gets evaluated using a good algorithm when it is assigned to a Vec:  template  class Matrix  {     ...     specialization  just for this example    Section 29.5.4  Fused Operations  855  Matrix const MVmulVadd& m  {     allocate elements,etc. mul_add_and_assign this,&m.m,&m.v,&m.v2 ;     initializebyresult of m  Matrix& operator= const MVmulVadd& m  {  mul_add_and_assign this,&m.m,&m.v,&m.v2 ; return ∗this;     assign the result of m to *this  public:  }  }    ...  };  Now U=M∗V+W is automatically expanded to  U.operator= MVmulVadd MVmul M,V ,W    which because of inlining resolves to the desired simple call  mul_add_and_assign &U,&M,&V,&W   this  eliminates  the  copying  and  the  temporaries.  Clearly, In  addition,  we  might  write mul_add_and_assign   in an optimized fashion.  However, if we just wrote it in a fairly simple and unoptimized fashion, it would still be in a form that offered great opportunities to an optimizer.  The  importance  of  this  technique  is  that  most  really  time-critical  vector  and  matrix  computa- tions are done using a few relatively simple syntactic forms. Typically, there is no real gain in opti- mizing expressions of half a dozen operators. For that we typically want to write a function any- way.  This technique is based on the idea of using compile-time analysis and closure objects to trans- fer  evaluation  of  a  subexpression  into  an  object  representing  a  composite  operation. It  can  be applied to a variety of problems with the common attribute that several pieces of information need to be gathered into one function before evaluation can take place.  I refer to the objects generated to defer evaluation as composition closure objects, or simply compositors.  If  this  composition  technique  is  used  to  delay  execution  of  all  operations,  it  is  referred  to  as expression templates [Vandevoorde,2002] [Veldhuizen,1995].  Expression templates systematically use function objects to represent expressions as abstract syntax trees  ASTs .  29.6  Advice [1]  List basic use cases; §29.1.1.

And,  of  course,  if  you  use  an  alternative, you   or  your  organization   will  be  responsible  for  the maintenance and evolution of the alternative ‘‘forever.’’  In general: try not to reinvent the wheel.   860   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  The  standard  library  is  rather  large:  its  speciﬁcation  in  the  ISO  C++  standard  is  785  dense pages.  And that is without describing the ISO C standard library, which is a part of the C++ stan- dard library  another 139 pages . To  compare, the C++ language speciﬁcation is 398 pages. Here, I summarize, relying heavily on tables, and give a few examples.  Details can be found elsewhere, including online copies of the standard, complete online documentation of implementations, and  if you  like to read  code   open  source  implementations. Rely  on  the  references  to  the  standard  for complete details.  The standard-library chapters are not intended to be read in their order of presentation. Each chapter and typically each major subsection can be read in isolation. Rely on cross-references and the index if you encounter something unknown.  30.1.1  Standard-Library Facilities What ought to be in the standard C++ library? One ideal is for a programmer to be able to ﬁnd ev ery  interesting,  signiﬁcant,  and  reasonably  general  class,  function,  template,  etc.,  in  a  library. However, the question here is not ‘‘What ought to be in some library?’’ but ‘‘What ought to be in the standard library?’’ ‘‘Everything!’’ is a reasonable ﬁrst approximation to an answer to the for- mer  question  but  not  to  the  latter. A standard  library  is  something  that  every  implementer  must supply so that every programmer can rely on it.  The C++ standard library provides:  cid:129  Support for language features, such as memory management  §11.2 , the range-for statement   cid:129    §9.5.1 , and run-time type information  §22.2  Information about implementation-deﬁned aspects of the language, such as the largest ﬁnite ﬂoat value  §40.2    cid:129  Primitive operations that cannot be easily or efﬁciently implemented in the language itself,  such as is_polymorphic, is_scalar, and is_nothrow_constructible  §35.4.1    cid:129  Facilities for low-level  ‘‘lock-free’’  concurrent programming  §41.3   cid:129  Support for thread-based concurrency  §5.3, §42.2   cid:129  Minimal support for task-based concurrency, such as future and async    §42.4   cid:129  Functions that most programmers cannot easily implement optimally and portably, such as  uninitialized_ﬁll    §32.5  and memmove    §43.5    cid:129  Minimal support for  optional  reclamation of unused memory  garbage collection , such as  declare_reachable    §34.5    cid:129  Nonprimitive  foundational facilities that a programmer can rely on for portability, such as  lists  §31.4 , maps  §31.4.3 , sort    §32.6 , and I O streams  Chapter 38    cid:129  Frameworks for extending the facilities it provides, such as conventions and support facili- ties  that  allow a user  to  provide  I O  of  a  user-deﬁned  type  in  the  style  of  I O  for  built-in types  Chapter 38  and the STL  Chapter 31   A few facilities are provided by the standard library simply because it is conventional and useful to do so. Examples are the standard mathematical functions, such as sqrt    §40.3 , random number generators  §40.7 , complex arithmetic  §40.4 , and regular expressions  Chapter 37 .  The standard library aims to be the common foundation for other libraries. In particular, combi-  nations of its facilities allow the standard library to play three supporting roles:   Section 30.1.1  Standard-Library Facilities   861   cid:129  A foundation for portability  cid:129  A set  of  compact  and  efﬁcient  components  that  can  be  used  as  the  foundation  for  perfor-  mance-sensitive libraries and applications   cid:129  A set of components enabling intra-library communications  The  design  of  the  library  is  primarily  determined  by  these  three  roles. These  roles  are  closely related.  For  example,  portability  is  commonly  an  important  design  criterion  for  a  specialized library, and common container types such as lists and maps are essential for convenient communi- cation between separately developed libraries.  The last role is especially important from a design perspective because it helps limit the scope of the standard library and places constraints on its facilities.  For example, string and list facilities are provided in the standard library. If they were not, separately developed libraries could commu- nicate only by using built-in types. However, advanced linear algebra and graphics facilities are not provided.  Such facilities are obviously widely useful, but they are rarely directly involved in com- munication between separately developed libraries.  Unless a facility is somehow needed to support these roles, it can be left to some library outside the standard. For good and bad, leaving something out of the standard library opens the opportu- nity for different libraries to offer competing realizations of an idea. Once a library proves itself widely useful in a variety of computing environments and application domains, it becomes a candi- date for the standard library. The regular expression library  Chapter 37  is an example of this.  A reduced standard library is available for freestanding implementations, that is, implementa-  tions running with minimal or no operating system support  §6.1.1 .  30.1.2  Design Constraints The roles of a standard library impose several constraints on its design. The facilities offered by the C++ standard library are designed to be:   cid:129  Valuable and affordable to essentially every student and professional programmer, including  the builders of other libraries.   cid:129  Used directly or indirectly by every programmer for everything within the library’s scope.  cid:129  Efﬁcient enough to provide genuine alternatives to hand-coded functions, classes, and tem-  plates in the implementation of further libraries.   cid:129  Either policy free or with an option to supply policies as arguments.  cid:129  Primitive  in the mathematical sense. That is, a component that serves two weakly related roles will almost certainly suffer overhead compared to individual components designed to perform only a single role.   cid:129  Convenient, efﬁcient, and reasonably safe for common uses.  cid:129  Complete  in  what  they do.  The standard  library  may  leave  major  functions  to  other libraries,  but  if  it  takes  on  a  task,  it  must  provide  enough  functionality  so  that  individual users or implementers need not replace it to get the basic job done.   cid:129  Easy to use with built-in types and operations.  cid:129  Type safe by default, and therefore in principle checkable at run time.  cid:129  Supportive of commonly accepted programming styles.  cid:129  Extensible to deal with user-deﬁned types in ways similar to the way built-in types and stan-  dard-library types are handled.   862   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  For example, building the comparison criteria into a sort function is unacceptable because the same data can be sorted according to different criteria. This is why the C standard-library qsort   takes a comparison  function  as  an  argument  rather  than  relying  on  something  ﬁxed,  say, the < operator  §12.5 .  On the other hand, the overhead imposed by a function call for each comparison compro- mises qsort   as a building block for further library building.  For almost every data type, it is easy to do a comparison without imposing the overhead of a function call.  Is that overhead serious? In most cases, probably not. However, the function call overhead can dominate the execution time for some algorithms and cause users to seek alternatives.  The tech- nique  described  in  §25.2.3  of  supplying  comparison  criteria  through  a  template  argument  solves that problem for sort   and many other standard-library algorithms. The sort example illustrates the tension  between  efﬁciency and  generality. It is also  an  example  of  how such  tensions  can  be resolved.  A standard library is not merely required to perform its tasks. It must also perform them so efﬁciently that users are not tempted to supply their own alternatives to what the standard offers. Otherwise,  implementers  of  more  advanced  features  are  forced  to  bypass  the  standard  library  in order to remain competitive. This would add a burden to the library developer and seriously com- plicate the lives of users wanting to stay platform-independent or to use several separately devel- oped libraries.  The  requirements  of  ‘‘primitiveness’’ and  ‘‘convenience  of  common  uses’’ can  conﬂict. The former requirement precludes exclusively optimizing the standard library for common cases. How- ev er, components serving common, but nonprimitive, needs can be included in the standard library in addition to the primitive facilities, rather than as replacements. The cult of orthogonality must not prevent us from making life convenient for the novice and the casual user. Nor should it cause us to leave the default behavior of a component obscure or dangerous.  30.1.3  Description Style A full  description  of  even a simple  standard-library  operation,  such  as  a  constructor  or  an  algo- rithm, can take pages. Consequently, I use an extremely abbreviated style of presentation. Sets of related operations are typically presented in tables:  Some Operations  p=op b,e,x  foo x   bar b,e,x   op does something to the range [b:e  and x, returning p foo does something to x but returns no result Does x have something to do with [b:e ?  I try to be mnemonic when choosing identiﬁers, so b and e will be iterators specifying a range, p a pointer or an iterator, and x some value, all depending on context.  In this notation, only the com- mentary  distinguishes  no  result  from  a  Boolean  result,  so  you  can  confuse  those  if  you  try  hard enough.  For an operation returning a Boolean, the explanation usually ends with a question mark. Where an algorithm follows the usual pattern of returning the end of an input sequence to indicate ‘‘failure,’’ ‘‘not found,’’ etc.  §4.5.1, §33.1.1 , I do not mention that explicitly.  Usually, such an abbreviated description is accompanied with a reference to the ISO C++ stan-  dard, some further explanation, and examples.   Section 30.2  Headers   863  30.2  Headers The  facilities  of  the  standard  library  are  deﬁned  in  the std namespace  and  presented  as  a  set  of headers.  The headers identify the major parts of the library. Thus, listing them gives an overview of the library.  The rest of this subsection is a list of headers grouped by function, accompanied by brief expla- nations and annotated by references to where they are discussed. The grouping is chosen to match the organization of the standard.  A standard header with a name starting with the letter c is equivalent to a header in the C stan- dard library. For every header   deﬁning part of the C standard library in the global namespace and also in namespace std, there is a header   deﬁning the same names. Ideally, the names from a   header do not pollute the global namespace  §15.2.4 , but unfortunately  due to complexities of maintaining multilanguage, multi-operating-system environments  most do.

The C++ standard library provides access to all such facilities:  C Compatibility                Aliases for common integer types C bool   Floating-point environment C alignment C ‘‘type generic math’’:   and    §43.7  The   header will not deﬁne macros bool, true, or false. The   header will not deﬁne  a  macro alignas. The .h equivalents  to  ,  ,  , and   approximate C++ facilities for C. Av oid them if you can.  The   header provides types  such as fenv_t and fexcept_t , ﬂoating-point status ﬂags, and  control modes describing an implementation’s ﬂoating-point environment.  A user or a library implementer is not allowed to add or subtract declarations from the standard headers.  Nor is it acceptable to try to change the contents of a header by deﬁning macros to change the meaning of declarations in a header  §15.2.3 . Any program or implementation that plays such games  does  not  conform  to  the  standard,  and  programs  that  rely  on  such  tricks  are  not  portable. Even if they work today, the next release of any part of an implementation may break them. Av oid such trickery.  For a standard-library facility to be used, its header must be included. Writing out the relevant declarations yourself is not a standards-conforming alternative. The reason is that some implemen- tations  optimize  compilation  based  on  standard  header  inclusion,  and  others  provide  optimized implementations  of  standard-library  facilities  triggered  by  the  headers. In  general,  implementers use standard headers in ways programmers cannot predict and shouldn’t hav e to know about.  A programmer can, however, specialize utility templates, such as swap    §35.5.2 , for non-stan-  dard-library, user-deﬁned types.  30.3  Language Support A small but essential part of the standard library is language support, that is, facilities that must be present for a program to run because language features depend on them.   Section 30.3  Language Support  867  Library Supported Language Features             new and delete typeid   and type_info Range-for initializ er_list  §11.2 §22.5 §30.3.2 §30.3.1  30.3.1 initializer_list Support A {}-list is converted into an object of type std::initializer_list  according to the rules described in §11.3.  In  , we ﬁnd initializer_list:     note const: initializer_list elements are immutable  template  class initializer_list { public:     §iso.18.9  using value_type = T; using reference = const T&; using const_reference = const T&; using size_type = size_t; using iterator = const T∗; using const_iterator = const T∗;  initializer_list   noexcept;  size_t siz e   const noexcept;  const T∗ begin   const noexcept;  const T∗ end   const noexcept;      number of elements    ﬁrst element    one-past-last element  template   template   const T∗ begin initializer_list  lst  noexcept { return lst.begin  ; }  const T∗ end initializer_list  lst  noexcept { return lst.end  ; }  Unfortunately, initializer_list does not offer a subscript operator. If you want to use [] rather than ∗, subscript a pointer:  void f initializer_list  lst  {  for int i=0; i<lst.size  ; ++i   cout << lst[i] << '\n';     error  const int∗ p = lst.begin  ; for int i=0; i<lst.size  ; ++i   cout << p[i] << '\n';     OK  Naturally, an initializer_list can also be used by a range-for. For example:  };  }   868   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  void f2 initializer_list  lst  {  for  auto x : lst   cout << x << '\n';  }  30.3.2  Range-for Support A range-for statement is mapped to a for-statement using an iterator as described in §9.5.1.  In  , the standard library provides std::begin   and std::end   functions for built-in arrays  and for every type that provides member begin   and end  ; see §33.3.  All  standard-library  containers   e.g., vector and unordered_map  and  strings  support  iteration using range-for; container adaptors  such as stack and priority_queue  do not.  The container head- ers, such as  , include , so the user rarely has to do so directly.  30.4  Error Handling The standard library consists of components developed over a period of almost 40 years. Thus, their style and approaches to error handling are not consistent:   cid:129  C-style libraries consist of functions, many of which set errno to indicate that an error hap-  pened; see §13.1.2 and §40.3.   cid:129  Many algorithms operating on a sequence of elements return an iterator to the one-past-the-  last element to indicate ‘‘not found’’ or ‘‘failure’’; see §33.1.1.   cid:129  The I O streams library relies on a state in each stream to reﬂect errors and may  if the user  requests it  throw exceptions to indicate errors; see §38.3.   cid:129  Some  standard-library  components,  such  as vector, string, and bitset, throw exceptions  to  indicate errors.  The standard library is designed so that all facilities obey ‘‘the basic guarantee’’  §13.2 ; that is, ev en if an exception is thrown, no resource  such as memory  is leaked and no invariant for a stan- dard-library class is broken.  30.4.1  Exceptions Some standard-library facilities report errors by throwing exceptions:  Standard-Library Exceptions  continues  Throws invalid_argument, out_of_range, overﬂow_error Throws ios_base::failure if exceptions are enabled Throws regex_error Throws length_error, out_of_range Throws out_of_range  bitset iostream regex string vector   Section 30.4.1  Exceptions   869  Standard-Library Exceptions  continued   new T dynamic_cast  r  typeid   thread call_once   mutex condition_variable async   packaged_task future and promise  Throws bad_alloc if it cannot allocate memory for a T Throws bad_cast if it cannot convert the reference r to a T Throws bad_typeid if it cannot deliver a type_info Throws system_error Throws system_error Throws system_error Throws system_error Throws system_error Throws system_error Throws future_error  These exceptions may be encountered in any code that directly or indirectly uses these facilities.  In addition, any operation that manipulates an object that may throw an exception must be assumed to throw  that exception  unless care has been taken to avoid that. For example, a packaged_task will throw an exception if the function it is required to execute throws.  Unless you know that no facility is used in a way that could throw an exception, it is a good idea  to  always  catch  one  of  the  root  classes  of  the  standard-library  exception  hierarchy  such  as exception  as well as any exception  ...  somewhere  §13.5.2.3 , for example, in main  .  30.4.1.1  The Standard exception Hierarchy  Do not throw built-in types, such as int and C-style strings. Instead, throw objects of types speciﬁ- cally deﬁned to be used as exceptions.  This hierarchy of standard exception classes provides a classiﬁcation of exceptions:  exception  logic_error  runtime_error  length_error  range_error  domain_error  bad_exception  bad_cast  overﬂow_error  out_of_range  invalid_argument  future_error  bad_alloc  bad_typeid  underﬂow_error  system_error  bad_array_new_length  ios_base::failure  This hierarchy attempts to provide a framework for exceptions beyond the ones deﬁned by the stan- dard  library. Logic  errors  are  errors  that  in  principle  could  be  caught  either  before  the  program starts  executing  or  by  tests  of  arguments  to  functions  and  constructors. Run-time  errors  are  all other errors. The system_error is described in §30.4.3.3.   870   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  The standard-library exception hierarchy is rooted in class exception:  class exception { public:  exception  ; exception const exception& ; exception& operator= const exception& ; virtual ˜exception  ; virtual const char∗ what   const;  The what   function can be used to obtain a string that is supposed to indicate something about the error that caused the exception.  A programmer can deﬁne an exception by deriving from a standard-library exception like this:  struct My_error : runtime_error {  My_error int x  :runtime_error{"My_error"}, interesting_value{x} { } int interesting_value;  Not  all  exceptions  are  part  of  the  standard-library exception hierarchy.  Howev er,  all  exceptions thrown by the standard library are from the exception hierarchy.  Unless you know that no facility is used in a way that could throw an exception, it is a good  idea to somewhere catch all exceptions.  For example:  };  };  int main   try {     ...  } catch  My_error& me  {     aMy_error happened    we can use me.interesting_value and me.what       aruntine_error happened  } catch  runtime_error& re  {    we can use re.what    } catch  exception& e  {     we can use e.what    } catch  ...  {  }     we can do local cleanup     some standard-librar yexception happened     Some unmentioned exception happened  As for function arguments, we use references to avoid slicing  §17.5.1.4 .  30.4.1.2  Exception Propagation  In  , the standard library provides facilities for making propagation of exceptions acces- sible to programmers:   Section 30.4.1.2  Exception Propagation   871  Exception Propagation  §iso.18.8.5   exception_ptr ep=current_exception     rethrow_exception ep   ep=make_exception_ptr e    Unspeciﬁed type used to point to exceptions ep is an exception_ptr to the current exception, or to no exception if there is no currently active exception; noexcept Re-throw the exception pointed to by ep; ep’s contained pointer must not be nullptr; noreturn  §12.1.7  ep is an exception_ptr to exception e; noexcept  An exception_ptr can  point  to  any exception,  not  just  exceptions  from  the exception hierarchy. Think of exception_ptr as a smart pointer  like shared_ptr  that keeps its exception alive for as long as an exception_ptr points to it. That way, we can pass an exception_pointer to an exception out of a function that caught it and re-throw elsewhere.  In particular, an exception_ptr can be used to imple- ment  a  re-throw of an exception  in  a  different  thread  from  the  one  in  which  the  exception  was caught.  This is what promise and future  §42.4  rely on. Use of rethrow_exception   on an excep- tion_ptr  from different threads  does not introduce a data race.  The make_exception_ptr   could be implemented as:  template  exception_ptr make_exception_ptr E e  noexcept; try {  throw e;  } catch ...  {  }  return current_exception  ;  A nested_exception is class that stores an exception_ptr obtained from a call of current_exception  :  nested_exception ne {};  nested_exception ne {ne2};  ne2=ne  ne.˜nested_exception   ne.rethrow_nested    ep=ne.nested_ptr   throw_with_nested e   rethrow_if_nested e    nested_exception  §iso.18.8.6   Default constructor: ne holds an exception_ptr to the current_exception  ; noexcept Copy constructor: both ne and ne2 hold an exception_ptr to the stored exception Copy assignment: both ne and ne2 hold an exception_ptr to the stored exception Destructor; virtual Rethrow ne’s stored exception; terminate   if no exception is stored in ne; noreturn ep is an exception_ptr pointing to ne’s stored exception; noexcept Throw an exception of type derived from nested_exception and e’s type; e must not be derived from nested_exception; noreturn dynamic_cast  e .rethrow_nested  ; e’s type must be derived from nested_exception   872   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  The intended use of nested_exception is as a base class for a class used by an exception handler to pass  some  information  about  the  local  context  of  an  error  together  with  a exception_ptr to  the exception that caused it to be called. For example:  struct My_error : runtime_error {  My_error const string& ;    ...  };  void my_code   {  try {     ...  } catch  ...  {  }  }  void user   {  try {  my_code  ;  } catch My_error& err  {     ... clear up My_error problems ...  try {  My_error err {"something went wrong in my_code  "};    ... throw_with_nested err ;  Now My_error information is passed along  rethrown  together with a nested_exception holding an exception_ptr to the exception caught.  Further up the call chain, we might want to look at the nested exception:  rethrow_if_nested err ;      re-throwthe nested exception, if any  } catch  Some_error& err2  {     ... clear up Some_error problems ...  }  }  }  30.4.1.3 terminate    This assumes that we know that some_error might be nested with My_error. An exception cannot propagate out of a noexcept function  §13.5.1.1 .  In  , the standard library provides facilities for dealing with unexpected exceptions:   Section 30.4.1.3  terminate    873  terminate  §iso.18.8.3, §iso.18.8.4   h=get_terminate   h2=set_terminate h    terminate   uncaught_exception    h is the current terminate handler; noexcept h becomes the current terminate handler; h2 is the previous terminate handler; noexcept Terminate the program; noreturn; noexcept Has an exception been thrown on the current thread and not yet been caught? noexcept  Av oid using these functions, except very occasionally set_terminate   and terminate  . A call of ter- minate   terminates a program by calling a terminate handler set by a call of set_terminate  . The – almost always correct – default is to immediately terminate the program. For fundamental operat- ing system reasons, it is implementation-deﬁned whether destructors for local objects are invoked when terminate   is called. If terminate   is invoked as the result of a noexcept violation, the system is  allowed   important   optimizations  that  imply  that  the  stack  may  even be partially  unwound  §iso.15.5.1 .  It  is  sometimes  claimed  that uncaught_exception   can  be  useful  for  writing  destructors  that behave differently depending on whether a function is exited normally or by an exception.  How- ev er, uncaught_exception   is also true during stack unwinding  §13.5.1  after the initial exception has been caught. I consider uncaught_exception   too subtle for practical use.  Assertions  §iso.7   static_assert e,s  assert e   Evaluate e at compile time; give s as a compiler error message if !e If the macro NDBUG is not deﬁned, evaluate e at run time and if !e, write a message to cerr and abort  ; if NDBUG is deﬁned, do nothing  static_assert Is_base_of   ,"non−Shape type for draw_all  " ;  30.4.2  Assertions The standard provides:  For example:  template  void draw_all vector & v  {  for  auto p : v  {  assert p!=nullptr ;    ...  }  }  The assert   is a macro found in  . The error message produced by assert   is implementa- tion-deﬁned  but  should  contain  the  source  ﬁle  name   __FILE__ ,  and  the  source  line  number  __LINE__  containing the assert  .  Asserts are  as they should be  used more frequently in production code than in small illustra-  tive textbook examples.   874   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  The name of the function  __func__  may also be included in the message. It can be a serious mistake to assume that the assert   is evaluated when it is not. For example, given a usual compiler setup, assert p!=nullptr  will catch an error during debugging, but not in the ﬁnal shipped product.  For a way to manage assertions, see §13.4.  30.4.3 system_error In  , the standard library provides a framework for reporting errors from the operating system and lower-level system components. For example, we may write a function to check a ﬁle name and then open a ﬁle like this:  ostream& open_ﬁle const string& path  {  auto dn = split_into_directory_and_name path ;      split into {path,name}  error_code err {does_directory_exist dn.ﬁrst };  if  err  {     err!=0 means error     ask "the system" about the path     ... see if anything can be done ...  if  cannot_handle_err   throw system_error err ;  }  }     ... return ofstream{path};  Assuming  that  ‘‘the  system’’ doesn’t know about  C++  exceptions,  we  have  no choice  about whether  to  deal  with  error  codes  or  not;  the  only  questions  are  ‘‘where?’’ and  ‘‘how?’’ In <sys- tem_error>, the standard library provides facilities for classifying error codes, for mapping system- speciﬁc error codes into more portable ones, and for mapping error codes into exceptions:  System Error Types  error_code  error_categor y  system_error error_condition  errc  future_errc io_errc  Holds a value identifying an error and the category of that error; system-speciﬁc  §30.4.3.1  A base class for types used to identify the source and encoding of a particular kind  category  of error code  §30.4.3.2  A runtime_error exception containing an error_code  §30.4.3.3  Holds a value identifying an error and the category of that error; potentially portable  §30.4.3.4  enum class with enumerators for error codes from    §40.3 ; basically POSIX error codes enum class with enumerators for error codes from    §42.4.4  enum class with enumerators for error codes from    §38.4.4    Error Codes  875  When an error ‘‘bubbles up’’ from a lower level as an error code, we must handle the error it repre- sents or turn it into an exception.  But ﬁrst we must classify it: different systems use different error codes for the same problem, and different systems simply have different kinds of errors.  Section 30.4.3.1  30.4.3.1  Error Codes  error_code ec {}; error_code ec {n,cat};  error_code ec {n};  ec.assign n,cat    ec=n   ec.clear    n=ec.value    cat=ec.category   s=ec.message     bool b {ec};  ec==ec2  ec!=ec2  ec<ec2  e=ec.default_error_condition     os<<ec ec=make_error_code e    error_code  §iso.19.5.2  Default constructor: ec={0,&generic_category}; noexcept ec={n,cat}; cat is an error_categor y and n is an int representing an error in cat; noexcept ec={n,&g eneric_category}; n represents an error; n is a value of type EE for which is_error_code_enum ::value==true; noexcept ec={n,cat}; cat is an error_categor y; n represents an error; n is a value of type EE for which is_error_code_enum ::value==true; noexcept ec={n,&generic_categor y}: ec=make_error_code n ; n represets an error; n is a value of type EE for which is_error_code_enum ::value==true; noexcept ec={0,&generic_categor y  }; noexcept n is ec’s stored value; noexcept cat is a reference to ec’s stored category; noexcept s is a string representing ec potentially used as an error message: ec.category  .message ec.value    Convert ec to bool; b is true if ec represents an error; that is, b==false means ‘‘no error’’; explicit Either or both of ec and ec2 can be an error_code; to compare equal ec and ec2 must have equivalent category  s and equivalent value  s; if ec and ec2 are of the same type, equivalence is deﬁned by ==; if not, equivalence is deﬁned by category  .equivalent  . ! ec==ec2  An order ec.category  <ec2.category     ec.category  ==ec2.categor y   && ec.value  <ec2.value    e is a reference to an error_condition: e=ec.category  .default_error_condition ec.value    Write ec.name   to the ostream os e is an errc; ec=error_code static_cast  e ,&g eneric_category     For a type representing the simple idea of an error code, error_code provides a lot of members. It is basically as simple map from an integer to a pointer to an error_categor y:   876   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  class error_code { public:  };     representation: {value,categor y}of type {int,const error_category*}  An error_categor y is an interface to an object of a class derived from error_categor y. Therefore, an error_categor y is passed by reference and stored as a pointer. Each separate error_categor y is repre- sented by a unique object.  Consider again the open_ﬁle   example:  ostream& open_ﬁle const string& path  {  auto dn = split_into_directory_and_name path ;      split into {path,name}  if  error_code err {does_directory_exist dn.ﬁrst }  {     ask "the system" about the path  if  err==errc::permission_denied  {  } else if  err==errc::not_a_director y  {     ...     ...  } throw system_error err ;    can’t do anything locally  }  }     ... return ofstream{path};  The errc error codes are described in §30.4.3.6. Note that I used an if-then-else chain rather than the more obvious switch-statement.  The reason is that == is deﬁned in terms of equivalence, taking both the error category   and the error value   into account.  The operations on error_codes are system-speciﬁc. In some cases, error_codes can be mapped into error_conditions  §30.4.3.4  using the mechanisms described in §30.4.3.5. An error_condition is  extracted  from  an error_code using default_error_condition  . An error_condition typically  con- tains less information than an error_code, so it is usually a good idea to keep the error_code avail- able and only extract its error_condition when needed.  Manipulating error_codes does  not  change  the  value  of errno  §13.1.2,  §40.3 . The  standard  library leaves the error states provided by other libraries unchanged.  30.4.3.2  Error Categories  An error_categor y represents  a  classiﬁcation  of  errors. Speciﬁc  errors  are  represented  by  a  class derived from class error_categor y:  class error_categor y { public:  };     ... interface to speciﬁc categories derived from error_category...   Section 30.4.3.2  Error Categories  877  error_categor y  §iso.19.5.1.1   cat.˜error_categor y   s=cat.name     ec=cat.default_error_condition n   cat.equivalent n,ec   cat.equivalent ec,n   s=cat.message n   cat==cat2 cat!=cat2  cat<cat2  Destructor; virtual; noexcept s is the name of cat; s is a C-style string; virtual; noexcept ec is the error_condition for n in cat; virtual; noexcept Is ec.category  ==cat and ec.value  ==n? ec is an error_condition; virtual; noexcept Is ec.category  ==cat and ec.value  ==n? ec is an error_code; virtual; noexcept s is a string describing the error n in cat; virtual Is cat the same category as cat2? noexcept ! cat==cat2 ; noexcept Is cat<cat2 in an order based on error_categor y addresses: std::less    cat, cat2 ? noexcept  Because error_categor y is designed to be used as a base class, no copy or move operations are pro- vided.  Access an error_categor y through pointers or references.  There are four named standard-library categories:  Standard-library Error Categories  §iso.19.5.1.1   ec=generic_category   ec=system_category    ec=future_category    iostream_category    ec.name  =="g eneric"; ec is a reference to an error_categor y ec.name  =="system" ec is a reference to an error_categor y; represents system errors: if ec corresponds to a POSIX error then ec.value   equals that error’s errno ec.name  =="future"; ec is a reference to an error_categor y; represents errors from   ec.name  =="iostream"; ec is a reference to an error_categor y; represents errors from the iostream library  These categories are necessary because a simple integer error code can have different meanings in different  contexts   categorys .  For  example, 1 means  ‘‘operation  not  permitted’’  EPERM  in POSIX,  is  a  generic  code   state  for  all  errors  as  an iostream error, and  means  ‘‘future  already retrieved’’  future_already_retrieved  as a future error.  30.4.3.3  Exception system_error  A system_error is used to report errors that ultimately originate in the parts of the standard library that deal with the operating system. It passes along an error_code and optionally an error-message string:  class system_error : public runtime_error { public:     ...  };   878   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  Exception Class system_error  §iso.19.5.6   se holds {ec,s}; ec is an error_code; s is a string or a C-style string intended as part of an error message se holds {ec}; ec is an error_code se holds {error_code{n,cat},s}; cat is an error_categor y and n is an int representing an error in cat; s is a string or a C-style string intended as part of an error message se holds error_code{n,cat}; cat is an error_categor y and n is an int representing an error in cat ec is a reference to se’s error_code; noexcept p is a C-style string version of se’s error string; noexcept  system_error se {ec,s};  system_error se {ec}; system_error se {n,cat,s};  system_error se {n,cat};  ec=se.code   p=se.what    try {     something  } catch  system_error& err  {  Code catching a system_error has its error_code available.  For example:  cout << "caught system_error " << err.what   <<'\n';     error message  auto ec = err.code  ; cout << "category: " << ec.category  .what   <<'\n'; cout << "value: " << ec.value   <<'\n'; cout << "message: " << ec.message   <<'\n';  }  };  Naturally, system_errors can be used by code that is not part of the standard library. A system-spe- ciﬁc error_code is passed, rather than a potentially portable error_condition  §30.4.3.4 .  To get an error_condition from an error_code use default_error_condition    §30.4.3.1 .  30.4.3.4  Potentially Portable Error Conditions  Potentially portable error codes  error_conditions  are represented almost identically to the system- speciﬁc error_codes:  class error_condition { public:     potentially portable  §iso.19.5.3      likeerror_code but    no output operator  <<  and    no default_error_condition    The general idea is that each system has a set of speciﬁc  ‘‘native’’  codes that are mapped into the potentially  portable  ones  for  the  convenience  of  programmers  of  programs   often  libraries   that need to work on multiple platforms.   Section 30.4.3.5  Mapping Error Codes  879  30.4.3.5  Mapping Error Codes  Making an error_categor y with a set of error_codes and at least one error_condition starts with deﬁn- ing an enumeration with the desired error_code values.  For example:  enum class future_errc { broken_promise = 1, future_already_retrieved, promise_already_satisﬁed, no_state  };  };  }  }  }  The meaning of these values is completely category-speciﬁc.  The integer values of these enumera- tors are implementation-deﬁned.  The future error category is part of the standard, so you can ﬁnd it in your standard library. The  details are likely to differ from what I describe.  Next, we need to deﬁne a suitable category for our error codes:  class future_cat : error_categor y { public:     to be returned from future_category    const char∗ name   const noexcept override { return "future"; }  string message int ec  const override;  const error_categor y& future_categor y   noexcept {  static future_cat obj; return &obj;  The mapping from integer values to error message   strings is a bit tedious. We hav e to invent a set of messages that are likely to be meaningful to a programmer. Here, I’m not trying to be clever:  string future_error::message int ec  const {  switch  ec  { default:  future_errc::broken_promise:  future_errc::future_already_retrieved:  future_errc::promise_already_satisﬁed:  return "future_error: promise already satisﬁed"; future_errc::no_state:  }  return "bad future_error code"; return "future_error: broken promise"; return "future_error: future already retrieved";  return "future_error: no state";  We can now make an error_code out of a future_errc:  error_code make_error_code future_errc e  noexcept {  return error_code{int e ,future_categor y  };   880   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  For the error_code constructor and assignment that take a single error value, it is required that the argument be of the appropriate type for the error_categor y. For example, an argument intended to become  the value   of  an error_code of future_category   must  be  a future_errc. In particular, we can’t just use any int. For example:  error_code ec1 {7}; error_code ec2 {future_errc::no_state};      error    OK  ec1 = 9; ec2 = future_errc::promise_already_satisﬁed;  ec2 = errc::broken_pipe;      error    OK    error :wrong error category  To help the implementer of error_code, we specialize the trait is_error_code_enum for our enumera- tion:  template  struct is_error_code_enum  : public true_type { };  The standard already provides the general template:  template  struct is_error_code_enum : public false_type { };  This states that anything we don’t deem an error code value isn’t.  For error_condition to work for our category, we must repeat what we did for error_code. For example:  error_condition make_error_condition future_errc e  noexcept;  template  struct is_error_condition_enum  : public true_type { };  For a  more  interesting  design,  we  could  use  a  separate enum for  the error_condition and  have make_error_condition   implement a mapping from future_errc to that.  30.4.3.6 errc Error Codes  Standard error_codes for  the system_category   are  deﬁned  by enum  class  errc with  values  equiv- alent to the POSIX-derived contents of  :  enum class errc Enumerators   §iso.19.5   continues   address_family_not_suppor ted address_in_use  address_not_available  already_connected  argument_list_too_long  argument_out_of_domain  bad_address  bad_ﬁle_descriptor  bad_message   EAFNOSUPPORT EADDRINUSE EADDRNOTA VAIL EISCONN E2BIG EDOM EFAULT EBADF EBADMSG   Section 30.4.3.6  errc Error Codes  881  enum class errc Enumerators  §iso.19.5   continued, continues   broken_pipe  connection_aborted connection_already_in_progress  connection_refused  connection_reset  cross_device_link  destination_address_required  device_or_resource_busy  directory_not_empty executable_format_error  ﬁle_exists  ﬁle_too_large  ﬁlename_too_long  function_not_supported host_unreachable  identiﬁer_removed  illegal_byte_sequence  inappropriate_io_control_operation  interrupted  invalid_argument  invalid_seek  io_error  is_a_directory message_siz e network_down  network_reset  network_unreachable  no_buffer_space  no_child_process  no_link  no_lock_available  no_message  no_message_available  no_protocol_option  no_space_on_device  no_stream_resources  no_such_device  no_such_device_or_address  no_such_ﬁle_or_director y no_such_process  not_a_directory  EPIPE ECONNABORTED EALREADY ECONNREFUSED ECONNRESET EXDEV EDESTADDRREQ EBUSY ENOTEMPTY ENOEXEC EEXIST EFBIG ENAMETOOLONG ENOSYS EHOSTUNREACH EIDRM EILSEQ ENOTTY EINTR EINVAL ESPIPE EIO EISDIR EMSGSIZE ENETDOWN ENETRESET ENETUNREACH ENOBUFS ECHILD ENOLINK ENOLCK ENOMSG ENODATA ENOPROTOOPT ENOSPC ENOSR ENODEV ENXIO ENOENT ESRCH ENOTDIR   882   Standard-Library Overview   Chapter 30  enum class errc Enumerators  §iso.19.5   continued   not_a_socket  not_a_stream  not_connected  not_enough_memory not_supported operation_canceled  operation_in_progress  operation_not_permitted  operation_not_supported operation_would_block owner_dead  permission_denied  protocol_error  protocol_not_suppor ted read_only_ﬁle_system  resource_deadlock_would_occur  resource_unavailable_tr y_again  result_out_of_range state_not_recoverable  stream_timeout  text_ﬁle_busy  timed_out  too_many_ﬁles_open  too_many_ﬁles_open_in_system  too_many_links  too_many_symbolic_link_levels  value_too_large  wrong_protocol_type   ENOTSOCK ENOSTR ENOTCONN ENOMEM ENOTSUP ECANCELED EINPROGRESS EPERM EOPNOTSUPP EWOULDBLOCK EOWNERDEAD EACCES EPROTO EPROTONOSUPPORT EROFS EDEADLK EAGAIN ERANGE ENOTRECOVERABLE ETIME ETXTBSY ETIMEDOUT EMFILE ENFILE EMLINK ELOOP EOVERFLOW EPROTOTYPE  These  codes  are  valid  for  the "system" category: system_category  .

The rest of the STL is presented in Chapter 32 and Chapter 33.  31.2  Container Overview A container  holds  a  sequence  of  objects. This  section  summarizes  the  types  of  containers  and brieﬂy outlines their properties. Operations on containers are summarized in §31.3.   886   STL Containers   Chapter 31  Containers can be categorized like this:  cid:129   cid:129  Associative containers provide associative lookup based on a key.  Sequence containers provide access to  half-open  sequences of elements.  In addition, the standard library provides types of objects that hold elements while not offering all of the facilities of sequence containers or associative containers:   cid:129  Container adaptors provide specialized access to underlying containers.  cid:129  Almost containers are sequences of elements that provide most, but not all, of the facilities  of a container.  The STL containers  the sequence and associative  containers  are all resource handles with copy and move operations  §3.3.1 . All operations on containers provide the basic guarantee  §13.2  to ensure that they interact properly with exception-based error handling.  Sequence Containers  vector   list   forward_list  deque   A contiguously allocated sequence of Ts; the default choice of container A doubly-linked list of T; use when you need to insert and delete elements without moving existing elements A singly-linked list of T; ideal for empty and very short sequences A double-ended queue of T; a cross between a vector and a list; slower than one or the other for most uses  The A template  argument  is  the  allocator  that  the  container  uses  to  acquire  and  release  memory  §13.6.1, §34.4 . For example:  template > class vector {     ...  };  A is defaulted to std::allocator   §34.4.1  which uses operator new   and operator delete   when it needs to acquire or release memory for its elements.  These containers are deﬁned in  ,  , and  . The sequence containers are con- tiguously allocated  e.g., vector  or linked lists  e.g., forward_list  of elements of their value_type  T in the notation used above .  A deque  pronounced ‘‘deck’’  is a mixture of linked-list and contigu- ous allocation.  Unless  you  have  a  solid  reason  not  to,  use  a vector. Note  that vector provides  operations  for inserting  and  erasing   removing   elements,  allowing  a vector to  grow and  shrink  as  needed. For sequences of small elements, a vector can be an excellent representation for a data structure requir- ing list operations.  When inserting and erasing elements of a vector, elements may be moved.  In contrast, elements of a list or an associative container do not move when new elements are inserted or other elements are erased.  A forward_list  a singly-linked list  is basically a list optimized for empty and very short lists. An  empty forward_list takes  up  only  one  word.  There are  surprisingly  many uses  for  lists  where most are empty  and the rest are very short .   Section 31.2  Container Overview   887  Ordered Associative Containers  §iso.23.4.2   C is the type of the comparison; A is the allocator type  map  multimap  set  multiset   An ordered map from K to V; a sequence of  K,V  pairs An ordered map from K to V; duplicate keys allowed An ordered set of K An ordered set of K; duplicate keys allowed  These containers are usually implemented as balanced binary trees  usually red-black trees .  The default ordering criterion for a key, K, is std::less   §33.4 . As for sequence containers, the A template argument is the allocator that the container uses to acquire and release memory  §13.6.1, §34.4 . The A template argument is defaulted to std::alloca- tor >  §31.4.3  for maps and std::allocator  for sets.  Unordered Associative Containers  §iso.23.5.2   H is the hash function type; E is the equality test; A is the allocator type  unordered_map  unordered_multimap  unordered_set  unordered_multiset   An unordered map from K to V An unordered map from K to V; duplicate keys allowed An unordered set of K An unordered set of K; duplicate keys allowed  These containers are implemented as hash tables with linked overﬂow.  The default hash function type, H, for a type K is std::hash   §31.4.3.2 .  The default for the equality function type, E, for a type K is std::equal_to   §33.4 ; the equality function is used to decide whether two objects with the same hash code are equal.  The  associative  containers  are  linked  structures   trees   with  nodes  of  their value_type  in  the notation used above, pair  for maps and K for sets . The sequence of a set, map, or mul- timap is ordered by its key value  K .  An unordered container need not have an ordering relation for its elements  e.g., <  and uses a hash function instead  §31.2.2.1 . The sequence of an unordered container does not have a guaranteed order. A multimap differs from a map in that a key value may occur many times.  Container adaptors are containers providing specialized interfaces to other containers:  Container Adaptors C is the container type  priority_queue  queue  stack   Priority queue of Ts; Cmp is the priority function type Queue of Ts with push   and pop   Stack of Ts with push   and pop    The default for a priority_queue’s  priority function, Cmp, is std::less . The default for the con- tainer type, C, is std::deque  for queue and std::vector  for stack and priority_queue. See §31.5. Some  data  types  provide  much  of  what  is  required  of  a  standard  container, but  not  all. We  sometimes refer to those as ‘‘almost containers.’’  The most interesting of those are:   888   STL Containers   Chapter 31  T[N]  array   basic_string   string  u16string  u32string  wstring  valarray   bitset  vector   ‘‘ Almost Containers’’  A ﬁxed-size built-in array: N contiguous elements of type T; no siz e   or other member functions A ﬁxed-size array of N contiguous elements of type T; like the built-in array, but with most problems solved A contiguously allocated sequence of characters of type C with text manipulation operations, e.g., concatenation  + and += ; basic_string is typically optimized not to require free store for short strings  §19.3.3  basic_string  basic_string  basic_string  basic_string  A numerical vector with vector operations, but with restrictions to encourage high-performance implementations; use only if you do a lot of vector arithmetic A set of N bits with set operations, such as & and  A specialization of vector  with compactly stored bits  For basic_string, A is the allocator  §34.4  and Tr is the character traits  §36.2.2 .  Prefer a container, such as vector, string, or array, over an array when you have a choice.  The implicit array-to-pointer conversion and the need to remember the size for a built-in array are major sources of errors  e.g., see §27.2.1 .  Prefer the standard strings to other strings and to C-style strings. The pointer semantics of C- style strings imply an awkward notation and extra work for the programmer, and they are a major source of errors  such as memory leaks   §36.3.1 .  31.2.1  Container Representation The  standard  doesn’t prescribe  a  particular  representation  for  a  standard  container. Instead,  the standard speciﬁes the container interfaces and some complexity requirements. Implementers will choose appropriate and often cleverly optimized implementations to meet the general requirements and  common  uses. In  addition  to  what  is  needed  to  manipulate  elements,  such  a  ‘‘handle’’ will hold an allocator  §34.4 .  For a vector, the element data structure is most likely an array:  vector:  rep  elements  free space  The vector will hold a pointer to an array of elements, the number of elements, and the capacity  the number of allocated, currently unused slots  or equivalent  §13.6 .   A list is most likely represented by a sequence of links pointing to the elements and the number  Container Representation   889  Section 31.2.1  of elements:  list:  rep  elements:  v  v  v  A forward_list is most likely represented by a sequence of links pointing to the elements:  forward_list:  rep  elements:  v  v  v  A map is most likely implemented as a  balanced  tree of nodes pointing to  key,value  pairs:  map:  rep  An unordered_map is most likely implemented as a hash table:  unordered_map:  rep  hash table:  k v  k v  k v  k v  k v  k v  k v  k v  k v   890   STL Containers   Chapter 31  A string might be implemented as outlined in §19.3 and §23.2; that is, for short strings the charac- ters are stored in the string handle itself, and for longer strings the elements are stored contiguously on the free-store  like vector elements .  Like vector, a string can grow into ‘‘free space’’ allocated to avoid repeated reallocations:  string:  rep  Like a built-in array  §7.3 , an array is simply a sequence of elements, with no handle:  characters  free space  array:  elements  This implies that a local array does not use any free store  unless it is allocated there  and that an array member of a class does not imply any free store operations.  31.2.2  Element Requirements To  be an element of a container, an object must be of a type that allows the container implementa- tion to copy or move it, and to swap elements. If a container copies an element using a copy con- structor  or  copy assignment,  the  result  of  the  copy must  be  an  equivalent  object. This  roughly means that any test for equality that you can devise on the value of the objects must deem the copy equal to the original. In other words, copying an element must work much like an ordinary copy of an int. Similarly, a move constructor and a move assignment must have the conventional deﬁnitions and move semantics  §17.5.1 . In addition, it must be possible to swap   elements with the usual semantics.  If a type has copy or move, the standard-library swap   will work.  The details of the element requirements are scattered over the standard and quite hard to read  §iso.23.2.3, §iso.23.2.1, §iso.17.6.3.2 , but basically a container can hold elements of a type that has conventional copy or move operations.  Many basic algorithms, such as copy  , ﬁnd  , and sor t   will work as long as the requirements for being a container element are met as well as the algo- rithm’s speciﬁc requirements  such as elements being ordered; §31.2.2.1 .  Some violations of the rules for standard containers can be detected by a compiler, but others cannot  and  might  then  cause  unexpected  behavior. For  example,  an  assignment  operation  that throws  an  exception  might  leave  a  partially  copied  element  behind. That  would  be  bad  design  §13.6.1  and would violate the rules of the standard by not providing the basic guarantee  §13.2 . An element in an invalid state could cause serious trouble later.  When copying objects is not reasonable, an alternative is to put pointers to objects into contain- ers  instead  of  the  objects  themselves.  The most  obvious  example  is  polymorphic  types   §3.2.2, §20.3.2 .  For  example,  we  use vector > or vector  rather  than vector  to preserve polymorphic behavior.   Section 31.2.2.1  Comparisons   891  31.2.2.1  Comparisons  Associative containers require that their elements can be ordered. So do many operations that can be applied to containers  e.g., sort   and merge   .  By default, the < operator is used to deﬁne the order. If < is not suitable, the programmer must provide an alternative  §31.4.3, §33.4 . The order- ing  criterion  must  deﬁne  a strict  weak  ordering. Informally, this  means  that  both  less-than  and equality  if deﬁned  must be transitive. That is, for an ordering criterion cmp  think of it as ‘‘less than’’  we require:  Irreﬂexivity: cmp x,x  is false.  [1]  [2]  Antisymmetry: cmp x,y  implies !cmp y,x . [3]  Transitivity: If cmp x,y  and cmp y,z , then cmp x,z . [4]  Transitivity of equivalence: Deﬁne equiv x,y  to be ! cmp x,y cmp y,x  . If equiv x,y  and  equiv y,z , then equiv x,z .  The last rule is the one that allows us to deﬁne equality  x==y  as ! cmp x,y cmp y,x   if we need ==.  Standard-library operations that require a comparison come in two versions.  For example:  template   void sort Ran ﬁrst, Ran last ;     use < for comparison  template   void sort Ran ﬁrst, Ran last, Cmp cmp ;    use cmp  The  ﬁrst  version  uses < and  the  second  uses  a  user-supplied  comparison cmp. For  example,  we might  decide  to  sort fruit using  a  comparison  that  isn’t case  sensitive. We do that  by  deﬁning  a function object  §3.4.3, §19.2.2  that does the comparison when invoked for a pair of strings:  class Nocase { public:     case-insensitivestr ingcompare  bool operator   const string&, const string&  const;  };  {  }  fruit:  bool Nocase::operator   const string& x, const string& y  const     returntr ueif x is lexicographically less than y,not taking case into account  while  p!=x.end   && q!=y.end   && toupper ∗p ==toupper ∗q   {  auto p = x.begin  ; auto q = y.begin  ;  ++p; ++q;  } if  p == x.end    return q != y.end  ; if  q == y.end    return false; return toupper ∗p  < toupper ∗q ;  We can call sort   using that comparison criterion. Consider:  apple  pear  Apple  Pear   lemon   892   STL Containers   Chapter 31  Sorting using sort fruit.begin  ,fruit.end  ,Nocase    would yield something like  in  which  uppercase   letters  precede   lowercase   letters,  plain  fruit:  fruit:  Apple  apple   lemon  Pear  pear  Assuming  a  character  set  sort fruit.begin  ,fruit.end    would give:  Apple  Pear  apple   lemon  pear  Beware that < on C-style strings  i.e., const char∗s  compares pointer values  §7.4 . Thus, associa- tive  containers  will  not  work  as  most  people  would  expect  them  to  if  C-style  strings  are  used  as keys.  To make them work properly, a less-than operation that compares based on lexicographical order must be used. For example:  struct Cstring_less {  };  bool operator   const char∗ p, const char∗ q  const { return strcmp p,q <0; }  map  m;     map that uses strcmp   to compare const char* keys  31.2.2.2  Other Relational Operators  By default, containers and algorithms use < when they need to do a less-than comparison. When the default isn’t right, a programmer can supply a comparison criterion. However, no mechanism is provided for also passing an equality test. Instead, when a programmer supplies a comparison cmp, equality is tested using two comparisons.  For example:  if  x == y      not done where the user supplied a comparison  if  !cmp x,y  && !cmp y,x        done where the user supplied a comparison cmp  This saves the user from having to provide an equality operation for every type used as the value type for an associative container or by an algorithm using a comparison. It may look expensive, but the library doesn’t check for equality very often, in about 50% of the cases only a single call of cmp   is needed, and often the compiler can optimize away the double check.  Using  an  equivalence  relationship  deﬁned  by  less-than   by  default <  rather  than  equality   by default ==  also  has  practical  uses. For example,  associative  containers   §31.4.3   compare  keys using an equivalence test ! cmp x,y cmp y,x  . This implies that equivalent keys need not be equal. For example, a multimap  §31.4.3  that uses case-insensitive comparison as its comparison criterion will consider the strings Last, last, lAst, laSt, and lasT equivalent, even though == for strings deems them different.  This allows us to ignore differences we consider insigniﬁcant when sorting.  If equals  by default ==  always gives the same result as the equivalence test ! cmp x,y cmp y,x     by default cmp   is < , we say that we have a total order.  Given < and ==, we can easily construct the rest of the usual comparisons. The standard library  deﬁnes them in the namespace std::rel_ops and presents them in    §35.5.3 .   Section 31.3  Operations Overview   893  31.3  Operations Overview The operations and types provided by the standard containers can be summarized like this:  Container:  value_type, size_type, difference_type, pointer, const_pointer, reference, const_reference  iterator, const_iterator, ?reverse_iterator, ?const_reverse_iterator, allocator_type begin  , end  , cbegin  , cend  , ?rbegin  , ?rend  , ?crbegin  , ?crend  , =, ==, !=  swap  , ?size  , max_size  , empty  ,clear  , get_allocator  , constructors, destructor  ? , ?>=, ?insert  , ?emplace  , ?erase    Sequence container:  Assocative container:  assign  , front  , resize   ?back  , ?push_back    ?pop_back  , ?emplace_back    key_type, mapped_type, ?[], ?at    lower_bound  , upper_bound   equal_range    ﬁnd  , count  , emplace_hint    push_front  , pop_front    [], at    emplace_front    shrink_to_ﬁt    List:  remove    remove_if  , unique    merge  , sort    reverse    deque  Ordered container:  Hashed container:  key_compare key_comp   value_comp    key_equal  , hasher  hash_function    key_equal    bucket interface  data    capacity   reserve    map  set  unordered_map  multimap  insert_after  , erase_after    emplace_after  , splice_after    vector  splice    list  unordered_set  multiset  unordered_multimap  forward_list  unordered_multiset  An arrow indicates that a set of operations is provided for a container; it is not an inheritance opera- tion.  A question mark  ?  indicates a simpliﬁcation: I have included operations that are provided for only some of the containers. In particular:   894   STL Containers   Chapter 31   cid:129  A multi∗ associative container or a set does not provide [] or at  .  cid:129  A forward_list does not provide insert  , erase  , or emplace  ; instead, it provides the ∗_after  operations.   cid:129  A forward_list does not provide back  , push_back  , pop_back  , or emplace_back  .  cid:129  A forward_list does not provide reverse_iterator, const_reverse_iterator, rbegin  , rend  , crbe-  gin  , crend  , or size  .   cid:129  A unordered_∗ associative container does not provide  , or >=.  The [] and at   operations are replicated simply to reduce the number of arrows.  The bucket interface is described in §31.4.3.2. Where meaningful, an access operation exists in two versions: one for const and one for non-  const objects.  The standard-library operations have complexity guarantees:  Standard Container Operation Complexity  []  §31.2.2  const   const   List §31.3.7 O n + const  const  O n   Front  §31.4.2   const const const   Iterators §33.1.2 Ran Bi For Ran  Back §31.3.6  const+  const   const  const const  const  O log n    O log n    vector list forward_list deque stack queue priority_queue map multimap set multiset unordered_map unordered_multimap unordered_set unordered_multiset string array built-in array valarray bitset  O log n    O log n  + O log n  +  O log n  +  O log n  +  const+ const+  const+  const+  O n +  const+   const  const  const  const  const  Bi Bi Bi Bi For For For For Ran Ran Ran Ran  O n +   const+  ‘‘Front’’ operations refer to insertion and deletion before the ﬁrst element. Similarly, ‘‘Back’’ oper- ations refer to insertion and deletion after the last element, and ‘‘List’’ operations refer to insertion and deletion not necessarily at the ends of a container.  In the Iterators column, ‘‘Ran’’ means ‘‘random-access iterator,’’ ‘‘For’’ means ‘‘forward itera-  tor,’’ and ‘‘Bi’’ means ‘‘bidirectional iterator’’  §33.1.4 .   Section 31.3  Operations Overview   895  Other entries are measures of the efﬁciency of the operations. A const entry means the opera- tion  takes  an  amount  of  time  that  does  not  depend  on  the  number  of  elements  in  the  container; another conventional notation for constant time is O 1 . O n  means the operation takes time propor- tional to the number of elements involved.  A + sufﬁx indicates that occasionally a signiﬁcant extra cost  is  incurred. For example,  inserting  an  element  into  a list has  a  ﬁxed  cost   so  it  is  listed  as const , whereas the same operation on a vector involves moving the elements following the inser- tion  point   so  it  is  listed  as O n  .  Occasionally, all  elements  of  a vector must  be  relocated   so  I added a + .  The ‘‘big O’’ notation is conventional.  I added the + for the beneﬁt of programmers who care about predictability in addition to average performance. A conventional term for O n + is amortized linear time.  Naturally, if a  constant  is  large,  it  can  dwarf  a  small  cost  proportional  to  the  number  of  ele- ments.  However, for large data structures const tends to mean ‘‘cheap,’’ O n  to mean ‘‘expensive,’’ and O log n   to mean ‘‘fairly cheap.’’  For even moderately large values of n, O log n  , where log is the binary logarithm, is far closer to constant time than to O n . For example:  Logarithm Examples  n log n   n∗n  16 4 256   128  7 802,816   1,024  10 1,048,576   16,384 14 268,435,456   1,048,576 20 1.1e+12  People who care about cost must take a closer look. In particular, they must understand what ele- ments  are  counted  to  get  the n. Howev er,  the  message  is  clear:  don’t mess  with  quadratic  algo- rithms for larger values of n.  The measures of complexity and cost are upper bounds. The measures exist to give users some guidance as to what they can expect from implementations. Naturally, implementers will try to do better in important cases.  Note that the ‘‘Big O’’ complexity measures are asymptotic; that is, it could require a lot of ele- ments before complexity differences matter. Other factors, such as the cost of an individual opera- tion on an element, may dominate. For example, traversing a vector and a list both have complexity O n . Howev er, giv en modern machine architectures, getting to the next element through a link  in a list  can be very much more expensive than getting to the next element of a vector  where the ele- ments  are  contiguous . Similarly, a  linear  algorithm  may  take signiﬁcantly  more  or  signiﬁcantly less than ten times as long for ten times as many elements because of the details of memory and processor  architecture. Don’t just  trust  your  intuition  about  cost  and  your  complexity  measures; measure.  Fortunately, the container interfaces are so similar that comparisons are easy to code.  The size   operation  is  constant  time  for  all  operations. Note  that forward_list does  not  have size  , so if you want to know the number of elements, you must count them yourself  at the cost of O n  .  A forward_list is optimized for space and does not store its size or a pointer to its last ele- ment.  The string estimates are for longer strings. The ‘‘short string optimization’’  §19.3.3  makes all  operations of short strings  e.g., less than 14 characters  constant time.  The entries for stack and queue reﬂect the cost for the default implementation using a deque as  the underlying container  §31.5.1, §31.5.2 .   896   STL Containers   Chapter 31  31.3.1  Member Types A container deﬁnes a set of member types:  Member types  §iso.23.2, §iso.23.3.6.1   value_type allocator_type size_type difference_type iterator const_iterator reverse_iterator const_reverse_iterator reference  const_reference  pointer const_pointer key_type mapped_type key_compare hasher key_equal local_iterator const_local_iterator  Type of element Type of memory manager Unsigned type of container subscripts, element counts, etc. Signed type of difference between iterators Behaves like value_type∗ Behaves like const_value_type∗ Behaves like value_type∗ Behaves like const_value_type∗ value_type& const_value_type& Behaves like value_type∗ Behaves like const_value_type∗ Type of key; associative containers only Type of mapped value; associative containers only Type of comparison criterion; ordered containers only Type of hash function; unordered containers only Type of equivalence function; unordered containers only Type of bucket iterator; unordered containers only Type of bucket iterator; unordered containers only  Every  container  and  ‘‘almost  container’’ provides  most  of  these  member  types. However,  they don’t provide types that are not meaningful. For example, array does not have an allocator_type and vector does not have a key_type.  31.3.2  Constructors, Destructor, and Assignments Containers provide a variety of constructors and assignment operations. For a container called C  e.g., vector  or map   we hav e:  Constructors, Destructor, and Assignment  continues   C is a container; by default, a C uses the default allocator C::allocator_type{}  C c {}; C c {a}; C c n ;   C c n,x ; C c n,x,a ;  Default constructor: c is an empty container Default construct c; use allocator a c initialized with n elements with the value value_type{}; not for associative containers Initialize c with n copies of x; not for associative containers Initialize c with n copies of x; use allocator a; not for associative containers   Section 31.3.2  Constructors, Destructor, and Assignments  897  Constructors, Destructor, and Assignment  continued   C is a container; by default, a C uses the default allocator C::allocator_type{}  C c {elem};  C c {c2}; C c {move c2 }; C c {{elem},a}; C c {b,e}; C c {b,e ,a}; c.˜C   c2=c c2=move c  c={elem} c.assign n,x  c.assign b,e  c.assign {elem}   Initialize c from elem; if C has an initializer-list constructor, prefer that; otherwise, use another constructor Copy constructor: copy c2’s elements and allocator into c Move constructor: move c2’s elements and allocator into c Initialize c from the initializer_list {elem}; use allocator a Initialize c with elements from [b:e  Initialize c with elements from [b:e ; use allocator a Destructor: destroy c’s elements and release all resources Copy assignment: copy c’s elements into c2 Move assignment: move c’s elements into c2 Assign to c from initializer_list {elem} Assign n copies of x; not for associative containers Assign to c from [b:e  Assign to c from initializer_list {elem}  Additional constructors for associative containers are described in §31.4.3.  Note that an assignment does not copy or move allocators.  A target container gets a new set of elements but retains its old container, which it uses to allocate space for the new elements  if any . Allocators are described in §34.4.  Remember that a constructor or an element copy may throw an exception to indicate that it can-  The potential ambiguities for initializers are discussed in §11.3.3 and §17.3.4.1. For example:  not perform its tasks.  void use   {  vector  vi {1,3,5,7,9}; vector  vs 7 ;     vector initialized byﬁve ints    vector initialized bysev enempty strings  vector  vi2; vi2 = {2,4,6,8}; vi2.assign &vi[1],&vi[4] ;      assign sequence of four ints to vi2    assign the sequence 3,5,7 to vi2  vector  vs2; vs2 = {"The Eagle", "The Bird and Baby"};  vs2.assign "The Bear", "The Bull and Vet" ;      assign twostr ingsto vs2    run-time error  }  The error in the assignment to vs2 is that a pair of pointers are passed  not an initializer_list  and the two pointers do not point into the same array. Use    for size initializers and {} for every other kind of iterator.  Containers are often large, so we almost always pass them by reference. However, because they are resource handles  §31.2.1 , we can return them  implicitly using move  efﬁciently. Similarly, we can move them as arguments when we don’t want aliasing. For example:   898   STL Containers   Chapter 31  void task vector && v ;  vector  user vector & large  {  vector  res;    ... task move large  ;     ... return res;  }     transfer ownership of data to task    31.3.3  Size and Capacity The size is the number of elements in the container; the capacity is the number of elements that a container can hold before allocating more memory:  x=c.size   c.empty   x=c.max_size   x=c.capacity    c.reserve n  c.resize n   c.resize n,v   Size and Capacity x is the number of elements of c Is c empty? x is the largest possible number of elements of c x is the space allocated for c; vector and string only Reserve space for n elements for c; vector and string only Change size of c to n; use the default element value for added elements; sequence containers only  and string  Change size of c to n; use v for added elements; sequence containers only  and string   c.shrink_to_ﬁt   Make c.capacity   equal to c.size  ; vector, deque, and string only c.clear    Erase all elements of c  When changing the size or the capacity, the elements may be moved to new storage locations. That implies that iterators  and pointers and references  to elements may become invalid  i.e., point to the old element locations . For an example, see §31.4.1.1.  An iterator to an element of an associative container  e.g., a map  is only invalidated if the ele- ment to which it points is removed from the container  erase  d; §31.3.7 . To contrast, an iterator to an element of a sequence container  e.g., a vector  is inv alidated if the elements are relocated  e.g., by a resize  , reserve  , or push_back    or if the element to which it points is moved within the con- tainer  e.g., by an erase   or insert   of an element with a lower index .  It is tempting to assume that reserve   improves performance, but the standard growth strategies for vector  §31.4.1.1   are  so  effective  that  performance  is  rarely  a  good  reason  to  use reserve  . Instead,  see reserve   as  a  way  of  increasing  the  predictability  of  performance  and  for  avoiding invalidation of iterators.   Section 31.3.4  Iterators   899  31.3.4  Iterators A container can be viewed as a sequence either in the order deﬁned by the containers iterator or in the reverse order. For an associative container, the order is based on the containers comparison cri- terion  by default < :  p=c.begin    p=c.end    cp=c.cbegin    p=c.cend    p=c.rbegin    p=c.rend    p=c.crbegin    p=c.crend     Iterators p points to ﬁrst element of c p points to one-past-last element of c p points to constant ﬁrst element of c p points to constant one-past-last element of c p points to ﬁrst element of reverse sequence of c p points to one-past-last element of reverse sequence of c p points to constant ﬁrst element of reverse sequence of c p points to constant one-past-last element of reverse sequence of c  The most common form of iteration over elements is to traverse a container from its beginning to its end. The simplest way of doing that is by a range-for  §9.5.1  which implicitly uses begin   and end  . For example:  for  auto& x : v      implicit use of v.begin   and v.end    cout << x << '\n';  When we need to know the position of an element in a container or if we need to refer to more than one element at a time, we use iterators directly. In such cases, auto is useful to minimize source code size and eliminate opportunities for typos. For example, assuming a random-access iterator:  for  auto p = v.begin  ; p!=end  ; ++p  {  if  p!=v.begin   && ∗ p−1 ==∗p   cout << "duplicate " << ∗p << '\n';  When we don’t need to modify elements, cbegin   and cend   are appropriate. That is, I should have written:  for  auto p = v.cbegin  ; p!=cend  ; ++p  {  if  p!=v.cbegin   && ∗ p−1 ==∗p   cout << "duplicate " << ∗p << '\n';     use const iterators  For most containers and most implementations, using begin   and end   repeatedly is not a perfor- mance problem, so I did not bother to complicate the code like this:  auto beg = v.cbegin  ; auto end = v.cend  ;  for  auto p = beg; p!=end; ++p  { if  p!=beg && ∗ p−1 ==∗p   cout << "duplicate " << ∗p << '\n';  }  }  }   900   STL Containers   Chapter 31  31.3.5  Element Access Some elements can be accessed directly:  Element Access  c.front   c.back   c[i]  c.at i   c[k]  c.at k   Reference to ﬁrst element of c; not for associative containers Reference to last element of c; not for forward_list or associative containers Reference to the ith element of c; unchecked access; not for lists or associative containers Reference to the ith element of c; throw an out_of_range if i is out of range; not for lists or associative containers Reference to the element with key k of c; insert  k,mapped_type{}  if not found; for map and unordered_map only Reference to the ith element of c; throw an out_of_range if k is not found; for map and unordered_map only  Some  implementations  –  especially  debug  versions  –  always  do  range  checking,  but  you  cannot portably rely on that for correctness or on the absence of checking for performance. Where such issues are important, examine your implementations.  The associative  containers map and unordered_map have [] and at   that take arguments of the  key type, rather than positions  §31.4.3 .  31.3.6  Stack Operations The standard vector, deque, and list  but not forward_list or the associative containers  provide efﬁ- cient operations at the end  back  of their sequence of elements:  Stack Operations  c.push_back x  c.pop_back   c.emplace_back args   Add x to c  using copy or move  after the last element Remove the last element from c Add an object constructed from args to c after the last element  A c.push_back x  moves or copies x into c, increasing c’s size by one. If we run out of memory or x’s  copy constructor throws an exception, c.push_back x  fails.  A failed push_back   has no effect on the container: the strong guarantee is offered  §13.2 .  Note that pop_back   does not return a value.  Had it done so, a copy constructor throwing an  exception could seriously complicate the implementation.  In  addition,  list and deque provide  the  equivalent  operations  on  the  start   front   of  their  sequences  §31.4.2 . So does forward_list.  The push_back   is a perennial favorite for growing a container without preallocation or chance  of overﬂow, but emplace_back   can be used similarly. For example:  vector > vc; for  double re,im; cin>>re>>im;    vc.emplace_back re ,im ;     read twodoubles    add complex {re,im} at the end   Section 31.3.7  List Operations  901  31.3.7  List Operations Containers provide list operations:  List Operations  q=c.insert p,x  q=c.insert p,n,x   q=c.insert p,ﬁrst,last   q=c.insert p,{elem}   q=c.emplace p,args   q=c.erase p  q=c.erase ﬁrst,last  c.clear    Add x before p; use copy or move Add n copies of x before p; if c is an associative container, p is a hint of where to start searching Add elements from [ﬁrst:last  before p; not for associative containers Add elements from initializer_list {elem} before p; p is a hint of where to start searching for a place to put the new element; for ordered associative containers only Add element constructed from args before p; not for associative containers Remove element at p from c Erase [ﬁrst:last  of c Erase all elements of c  For insert   functions,  the  result, q, points  to  the  last  element  inserted. For erase   functions, q points to the element that followed the last element erased.  For containers  with  contiguous  allocation,  such  as vector and deque, inserting  and  erasing  an element  can  cause  elements  to  be  moved.  An iterator  pointing  to  a  moved element  becomes invalid.  An element is moved if its position is after the insertion deletion point or if all elements are moved because the new size exceeds the previous capacity. For example:  vector  v {4,3,5,1}; auto p = v.begin  +2;  v.push_back 6 ;  p = v.begin  +2;  auto p2 = v.begin  +4;  v.erase v.begin  +3 ;      points to v[2], that is,the 5    pbecomes invalid; v == {4,3,5,1,6}    points to v[2], that is,the 5    p2 points to v[4], that is,the 6    v=={4,3,5,6}; p is still valid; p2 is invalid  Any operation that adds an element to a vector may cause every element to be reallocated  §13.6.4 . The emplace   operation is used when it is notationally awkward or potentially inefﬁcient to ﬁrst  create an object and then copy  or move  it into a container. For example:  void user list >& lst  {  auto p = lst.begin  ; while  p!=lst.end  && p−>ﬁrst!="Denmark"     * do nothing*  ;     ﬁnd an insertion point  p=lst.emplace p,"England",7.5 ;  p=lst.insert p,make_pair "France",9.8  ; p=lst.insert p,pair >{"Greece",3.14} ;      nice and terse    helper function    verbose  }  The forward_list does not provide operations, such as insert  , that operate before an element identi- ﬁed by an iterator. Such an operation could not be implemented because there is no general way of   902   STL Containers   Chapter 31  ﬁnding the previous element in a forward_list given only an iterator. Instead, forward_iterator pro- vides operations, such as insert_after  , that operate after an element identiﬁed by an iterator. Simi- larly, unordered containers use emplace_hint   to provide a hint rather than ‘‘plain’’ emplace  .  31.3.8  Other Operations Containers can be compared and swapped:  Comparisons and Swap  c1==c2 c1!=c2  c1<c2 c1<=c2  c1>c2  c1>=c2  c1.swap c2  swap c1,c2    Do all corresponding elements of c1 and c2 compare equal? ! c1==c2  Is c1 lexicographically before c2? ! c2<c1  c2<c1 ! c1<c2  Exchanges values of c1 and c2; noexcept c1.swap c2   When comparing containers with an operator  e.g., <= , the elements are compared using the equiv- alent element operator generated from == or  b is done using ! b<a  .  The swap   operations exchange both elements and allocators.  31.4  Containers This section goes into more detail about:  vector, the default container  §31.4.1    cid:129   cid:129  The linked lists: list and forward_list  §31.4.2   cid:129  The associative containers, such as map and unordered_map  §31.4.3   31.4.1 vector The STL vector is the default container. Use it unless you have a good reason not to. If your sug- gested alternative is a list or a built-in array, think twice.  §31.3 describes the operations on vector and implicitly contrasts them with what is provided for other containers. However,  giv en the importance of vector, this section takes a second look with more emphasis on how the operations are provided.  The vector’s template argument and member types are deﬁned like this:  template > class vector { public:  using reference = value_type&; using const_reference = const value_type&; using iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using const_iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned* ;   Section 31.4.1  vector  903  using size_type =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using difference_type =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using value_type = T; using allocator_type = Allocator; using pointer = typename allocator_traits ::pointer; using const_pointer = typename allocator_traits ::const_pointer; using reverse_iterator = std::reverse_iterator ; using const_reverse_iterator = std::reverse_iterator ;     ...  };  31.4.1.1 vector and Growth  Consider the layout of a vector object  as described in §13.6 :  vector:  elem space last alloc  elements  extra space  The use of both a size  number of elements  and a capacity  the number of available slots for ele- ments without reallocation  makes growth through push_back   reasonably efﬁcient: there is not an allocation operation each time we add an element, but only every time we exceed capacity  §13.6 . The standard does not specify by how much capacity is increased when it is exceeded, but adding half the size is common. I used to be careful about using reser ve   when I was reading into a vector. I was surprised to ﬁnd that for essentially all of my uses, calling reser ve   did not measurably affect performance.  The default growth strategy worked just as well as my estimates, so I stopped trying to improve performance using reser ve  . Instead, I use it to increase predictability of reallocation delays and to prevent invalidation of pointers and iterators.  The notion of capacity allows for iterators into a vector to be valid unless a reallocation actually  happens.  Consider reading letters into a buffer and keeping track of word boundaries:     input "buffer" for characters     pointers to startofwords  vector  chars;  constexpr int max = 20000; chars.reser ve max ; vector  words;   bool in_word = false; for  char c; cin.get c   {  if  isalpha c   {  if  !in_word  {     found beginning of word  in_word = true;   904   STL Containers   Chapter 31  chars.push_back 0 ;  chars.push_back c ; words.push_back &chars.back   ;     end of previous word  } else  chars.push_back c ;  } else  } if  in_word   in_word = false;  chars.push_back 0 ;      terminatelast word  if  max<chars.siz e    {     oops: chars grewbeyond capacity; the words are invalid     ...  } chars.shrink_to_ﬁt  ;      release anysur pluscapacity  Had  I  not  used reserve   here,  the  pointers  in words would  have  been  invalidated  if chars.push_back   caused  a  relocation. By  ‘‘invalidated,’’  I  mean  that  any use  of  those  pointers would be undeﬁned behavior. They may – or may not – point to an element, but almost certainly not to the elements they pointed to before the relocation.  The ability to grow a vector using push_back   and related operations implies that low-level C-  style use of malloc   and realloc    §43.5  is as unnecessary as it is tedious and error-prone.  31.4.1.2 vector and Nesting  A vector  and similar contiguously allocated data structures  has three major advantages compared to other data structures:   cid:129  The elements of a vector are compactly stored: there is no per-element memory overhead. type roughly is  about  12  bytes,  which  is  The  amount  of  memory  consumed  by  a vec of  sizeof vector  +vec.size  ∗sizeof X . The sizeof vector   insigniﬁcant for larger vectors.  vector   is    cid:129  Traversal of a vector is very fast.  To get to the next element, the code does not have to indi- rect through a pointer, and modern machines are optimized for consecutive access through a vector-like structure.  This makes  linear  scans  of vector elements,  as  in ﬁnd   and copy  , close to optimal. vector supports simple and efﬁcient random access. This is what makes many algorithms on vectors, such as sort   and binary_search  , efﬁcient.   cid:129   It is easy to underestimate these beneﬁts. For example, a doubly-linked list, such as list, usually incurs a four-words-per-element memory overhead  two links plus a free-store allocation header , and traversing it can easily be an order of magnitude more expensive than traversing a vector con- taining equivalent data. The effect can be so spectacular and surprising that I suggest you test it yourself [Stroustrup,2012a].   Section 31.4.1.2  vector and Nesting  905  The  beneﬁts  of  compactness  and  efﬁciency of access  can  be  unintentionally  compromised.  Consider how to represent a two-dimensional matrix. There are two obvious alternatives:   cid:129  A vector of vectors: vector > accessed by C-style double subscripting: m[i][j]  cid:129  A speciﬁc  matrix  type, Matrix   Chapter  29 ,  that  stores  elements  contiguously  e.g., in a vector   and computes locations in that vector from a pair of indices: m i,j   The memory layout for a 3-by-4 vector > looks like this:  The memory layout for Matrix  looks like this:  To  construct the vector >, we need four constructor calls with four free-store alloca- tion operations. To access an element, we need to do a double indirection.  To  construct the Matrix , we need one constructor call with one free-store allocation.  To access an element, we need a single indirection.  Once we reach an element of a row, we don’t need a further indirection to access its successor, so access to the vector > is not always twice as costly as access to Matrix . However,  for  algorithms  that  require  high  performance,  the  allocation,  deallocation,  and  access costs implied by the linked structure of vector > could be a problem.  The vector > solution  implies  the  possiblity  of  the  row having  different  sizes. There are cases where that is an advantage, but more often it is simply an opportunity for errors and a burden for testing.  The problems and overhead get worse when we need higher dimensions: compare the number  of added indirections and allocations for a vector >> and a Matrix .  In  summary, I note  that  the  importance  of  compactness  of  data  structures  is  often  underesti- mated or compromised. The advantages are logical as well as performance related. Combine this with a tendency to overuse pointers and new and we have a widespread problem. For example, con- sider the development complexities, run-time costs, memory costs, and opportunities for errors in an implementation of a two-dimensional structure when the rows are implemented as independent objects on the free store: vector ∗>.   906   STL Containers   Chapter 31  31.4.1.3 vector and Arrays  A vector is  a  resource  handle. This  is  what  allows  it  to  be  resized  and  enables  efﬁcient  move semantics.  However, that occasionally puts it at a disadvantage compared to data structures  such as built-in arrays and array  that do not rely on storing elements separately from a handle. Keeping a sequence of elements on the stack or in another object can give a performance advantage, just as it can be a disadvantage.  A vector deals with properly initialized objects. This is what allows us to use them simply and rely on proper destruction of elements. However,  that occasionally puts it at a disadvantage com- pared to data structures  such as built-in arrays and array  that allow uninitialized elements.  As an example, we need not initialize array elements before reading into them:  void read   {  array  a; for  auto& x : a  cin.get &x ;  }  For vector, we might  use emplace_back   to  achieve  a  similar  effect   without  having  to  specify  a MAX .  31.4.1.4 vector and string  A vector  is  a  resizable,  contiguous  sequence  of chars,  and  so  is  a string. So how  do we choose between the two?  A vector is a general mechanism for storing values.  It makes no assumptions about the relation- ships among the values stored in it. To a vector , the string Hello, World! is just a sequence of 13 elements of type char. Sorting them into !,HWdellloor  preceded by a space  makes sense. To contrast, a string is intended to hold character sequences. The relationships among the characters are assumed to be important. So, for example, we rarely sort the characters in a string because that destroys meaning. Some string operations reﬂect that  e.g., c_str  , >>, and ﬁnd   ‘‘know’’ that C- style strings are zero-terminated . The implementations of string reﬂect assumptions about the way we use strings.  For example, the short-string optimization  §19.3.3  would be a pure pessimization if it wasn’t for the fact that we use many short strings, so that minimizing free-store use becomes worthwhile.  Should  there  be  a  ‘‘short-vector optimization’’?  I suspect  not,  but  it  would  require  a  massive  empirical study to be sure.  31.4.2  Lists The STL provides two linked-list types:   cid:129   cid:129   list: a doubly-linked list forward_list: a singly-linked list  A list is a sequence optimized for insertion and deletion of elements. When you insert into a list or delete an element from a list, the locations of other elements of the list are not affected.  In particu- lar, iterators referring to other elements are not affected.   Section 31.4.2  Lists   907  Compared  to vector, subscripting  could  be  painfully  slow,  so subscripting  is  not  provided  for lists.  If necessary, use advance   and similar operations to navigate lists  §33.1.4 . A list can be tra- versed  using  iterators: list provides  bidirectional  iterators   §33.1.2   and forward_list provides  for- ward  iterators  hence the name of that type of list .  By default, list elements are individually allocated in memory and include predecessor and suc- cessor pointers  §11.2.2 . Compared to a vector, a list uses more memory per element  usually at least four words more per element , and traversals  iteration  are signiﬁcantly slower because they involve indirection through pointers rather than simple consecutive access.  A forward_list is a singly-linked list. Think of it as a data structure optimized for empty or very short  lists  that  you  typically  traverse  starting  from  the  beginning.  For  compactness, forward_list doesn’t even provide a size  ; an empty forward_list takes up just one word of memory. If you need to know the number of elements of a forward_list, just count them. If there are enough elements to make counting them expensive, maybe you should use a different container.  With  the  exception  of  subscripting,  capacity  management,  and size   for forward_list, the  STL lists provide the member types and operations offered by vector  §31.4 .  In addition, list and for- ward_list provide speciﬁc list member functions:  lst.push_front x  lst.pop_front   lst.emplace_front args  lst.remove v  lst.remove_if f  lst.unique   lst.unique f  lst.merge lst2   Operations for Both list  and forward_list   §iso.23.3.4.5, §iso.23.3.5.4  Add x to lst  using copy or move  before the ﬁrst element Remove the ﬁrst element from lst Add T{args} to lst before the ﬁrst element Remove all elements of lst with value v Remove all elements of lst for which f x ==true Remove adjacent duplicate elements of lst Remove adjacent duplicate elements of lst using f for equality Merge the ordered lists lst and lst2 using < as the order; lst2 is merged into lst and emptied in the process Merge the ordered lists lst and lst2 using f as the order; lst2 is merged into lst and emptied in the process Sort lst using < as the order Sort lst using f as the order Reverse the order of the elements of lst; noexcept  lst.sort   lst.sort f  lst.reverse    lst.merge lst2,f   As opposed to the general remove   and unique   algorithms  §32.5 , the member algorithms really do affect the size of a list. For example:  void use   {  }  list  lst {2,3,2,3,5}; lst.remove 3 ;  lst.unique  ;  cout << lst.size   << '\n';     lst is now{2,2,5}    lst is now{2,5}    writes2  The merge   algorithm is stable; that is, equivalent elements keep their relative order.   908   STL Containers   Chapter 31  Operations for list   §iso.23.3.5.5  p points to an element of lst or lst.end    lst.splice p,lst2  lst.splice p,lst2,p2   lst.splice p,lst2,b,e   Insert the elements of lst2 before p; lst2 becomes empty Insert the element pointed to by p2 in lst2 before p; the element pointed to by p2 is removed from lst2 Insert the elements [b:e  from lst2 before p; the elements [b:e  are removed from lst2  A splice   operation does not copy element values and does not invalidate iterators to elements. For example:  list  lst1 {1,2,3}; list  lst2 {5,6,7};  auto p = lst1.begin  ; ++p;      ppoints to 2  auto q = lst2.begin  ; ++q;      qpoints to 6  lst1.splice p,lst2 ;      lst1 is now{1,5,6,7,2,3}; lst2 is now{}    pstill points to 2 and q still points to 6  A forward_list cannot access the element before one pointed to by an iterator  it does not have a pre- decessor link , so its emplace  , insert  , erase  , and splice   operations operate on the position after an iterator:  Operations for forward_list   §iso.23.3.4.6   p2=lst.emplace_after p,args   p2=lst.insert_after p,x  p2=lst.insert_after p,n,x   p2=lst.insert_after p,b,e  p2=lst.insert_after p,{elem}   p2=lst.erase_after p   p2=lst.erase_after b,e  lst.splice_after p,lst2  lst.splice_after p,b,e  lst.splice_after p,lst2,p2  lst.splice_after p,lst2,b,e   Emplace element constructed from args after p; p2 points to the new element Insert x after p; p2 points to the new element Insert n copies of x after p; p2 points to the last new element Insert [b:e  after p; p2 points to the last new element Insert {elem} after p; p2 points to the last new element; elem is an initializer_list Erase the element after p; p2 points to the element after p or lst.end   Erase [b:e ; p2=e Splice in lst2 after p Splice in [b:e  after p Splice in p2 after p; remove p2 from lst2 Splice in [b:e  after p; remove [b:e  from lst2  These list operations  are  all stable; that  is,  they preserve the  relative  order  of  elements  that  have equivalent values.   Section 31.4.3  Associative Containers   909  31.4.3  Associative Containers Associative containers provide lookup based on keys.  They come in two variants:   cid:129  Ordered associative containers do lookup based on an ordering criterion, by default <  less  than .  They are implemented as balanced binary trees, usually red-black trees.   cid:129  Unordered  associative  containers do  lookup  based  on  a  hash  function. They are  imple-  mented as hash tables with linked overﬂow.  Both come as   cid:129  maps: sequences of {key,value} pairs  cid:129   sets: maps without values  or you could say that the key is also the value   Finally, maps and sets, whether ordered or unordered, come in two variants:   cid:129   cid:129   ‘‘Plain’’ sets or maps with a unique entry for each key ‘‘Multi’’ sets or maps for which multiple entries can exist for each key  The  name  of  an  associate  container  indicates  its  place  in  this  3-dimensional  space:  {setmap, plainunordered, plainmulti}. ‘‘Plain’’ is nev er spelled out, so the associative containers are:  Associative Containers  §iso.23.4.1, §iso.23.5.1   multiset   set  map  multimap   unordered_set  unordered_map   unordered_multiset unordered_multimap  Their template arguments are described in §31.4.  Internally, a map and an unordered_map are very different.  See §31.2.1 for graphical representa- tions.  In particular, map uses its comparison criterion  typically <  on a key to search through a bal- anced tree  an O log n   operation , whereas unordered_map applies a hash function on a key to ﬁnd a slot in a hash table  an O 1  operation for a good hash function .  31.4.3.1  Ordered Associative Containers  Here are the template arguments and member types for map:  template<typename Key,  typename  T, typename  Compare = less , typename  Allocator = allocator >>  class map { public:  using key_type = Key; using mapped_type = T; using value_type = pair ; using key_compare = Compare; using allocator_type = Allocator; using reference = value_type&; using const_reference = const value_type&; using iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned*  ; using const_iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned*  ; using size_type =  * implementation-deﬁned*  ; using difference_type =  * implementation-deﬁned*  ;   910   STL Containers   Chapter 31  using pointer = typename allocator_traits ::pointer; using const_pointer = typename allocator_traits ::const_pointer; using reverse_iterator = std::reverse_iterator ; using const_reverse_iterator = std::reverse_iterator ;  class value_compare {  * operator   k1,k2  doesakey_compare   k1,k2 *  };    ...  };  In addition to the constructors mentioned in §31.3.2, the associative  containers have  constructors allowing a programmer to supply a comparator:  map  Constructors  §iso.23.4.4.2   map m {cmp,a}; map m {cmp}; map m {}; map m {b,e,cmp,a};  map m {b,e,cmp};  map m {b,e}; map m {m2}; map m {a}; map m {m2,a}; map m {{elem},cmp,a};  map m {{elem},cmp}; map m {{elem}};  Construct m to use comparator cmp and allocator a; explicit map m {cmp, A{}}; explicit map m {C{}}; explicit Construct m to use comparator cmp and allocator a; initialize with the elements from [b:e  map m {b,e ,cmp, A{}}; map m {b,e,C{}}; Copy and move constructors Construct default map; use allocator a; explicit Copy or move construct m from m2; use allocator a Construct m to use comparator cmp and allocator a; initialize with the elements from initializer_list {elem} map m {{elem},cmp,A{}}; map m {{elem},C{}};  For example:  {  };  map > locations  {"Copenhagen",{"55:40N","12:34E"}}, {"Rome",{"41:54N","12:30E"}}, {"New York",{"40:40N","73:56W"}  The associative containers offer a variety of insertion and lookup operations:  Associative Container Operations  §iso.23.4.4.1   v=c[k]   v=c.at k    v is a reference to the element with key k; if k is not found, {k,mapped_type{}} is inserted into c; only for map and unordered_map v is a reference to the element with key k; if k is not found, an out_of_range is thrown; only for map and unordered_map   Section 31.4.3.1  Ordered Associative Containers   911  Associative Container Operations  continued   §iso.23.4.4.1   p=c.ﬁnd k   p=c.lower_bound k    p=c.upper_bound k    pair p1,p2 =c.equal_range k  pair p,b =c.insert x   p2=c.insert p,x   c.insert b,e  c.insert {args}   p=c.emplace args    p=c.emplace_hint h,args    r=c.key_comp     r=c.value_comp     n=c.count k    p points to the ﬁrst element with key k or c.end   p points to the ﬁrst element with key >=k or c.end  ; ordered containers only p points to the ﬁrst element with key >k or c.end  ; ordered containers only p1=c.lower_bound k ; p2=c.upper_bound k  x is a value_type or something that can be copied into a value_type  e.g., a two-element tuple ; b is true if x was inserted and false if there already was an entry with x’s key; p points to the  possibly new  element with x’s key x is a value_type or something that can be copied into a value_type  e.g., a two-element tuple ; p is a hint of where to start looking for an element with x’s key; p2 points to the  possibly new  element with x’s key c.inser t ∗p  for every p in [b:e  Insert each element of the initializer_list args; an element is of type pair  p points to an object of c’s value_type constructed from args and inserted into c p points to an object of c’s value_type constructed from args and inserted into c; h is an iterator into c, possibly used as a hint of where to start to search for a place for the new entry r is a copy of the key comparison object; ordered containers only r is a copy of the value comparison object; ordered containers only n is the number of elements with key k  Operations speciﬁc to unordered containers are presented in §31.4.3.5.  If a key, k, is not found by a subscript operation, m[k], a default value is inserted. For example:  map  dictionary;  dictionary["sea"]="large body of water";      inser tor assign to element  cout << dictionary["seal"];      read value  If seal is not in the dictionary, nothing is printed: the empty string was entered as the value for seal and returned as the result of the lookup.   912   STL Containers   Chapter 31  If that is not the desired behavior, we can use ﬁnd   and insert   directly:  auto q = dictionary.ﬁnd "seal" ;      lookup; don’t insert  if  q==dictionary.end    {  cout << "entry not found"; dictionary.inser t make_pair "seal","eats ﬁsh"  ;  } else  cout q−>second;  In fact, [] is little more than a convenient notation for insert  . The result of m[k] is equivalent to the result of  ∗ m.insert make_pair k,V{}  .ﬁrst  .second, where V is the mapped type.  The insert make_pair    notation is rather verbose.  Instead, we could use emplace  :  dictionary.emplace "sea cow","extinct" ;  Depending on the quality of the optimizer, this may also be more efﬁcient.  If you try to insert a value into a map and there already is an element with its key, the map is  unchanged.  If you want to have more than one value for a single key, use a multimap.  The ﬁrst iterator of the pair  §34.2.4.1  returned by equal_range   is lower_bound   and the sec- ond upper_bound  . You  can  print  the  value  of  all  elements  with  the  key "apple" in  a mul- timap  like this:  multimap  mm {{"apple",2}, { "pear",2}, {"apple",7}, {"orange",2}, {"apple",9}};  const string k {"apple"}; auto pp = mm.equal_range k ; if  pp.ﬁrst==pp.second   cout << "no element with value '" << k << "'\n";  cout << "elements with value '" << k << "':\n"; for  auto p=pp.ﬁrst; p!=pp.second; ++p   cout  second << ' ';  else {  }  This prints 2 7 9.  I could equivalently have written:  auto pp = make_pair m.lower_bound  ,m.upper_bound   ;    ...  key_type. Consider:  struct Record {  string label; int value;  };  However,  that  would  imply  an  extra  traversal  of  the map. The equal_range  , lower_bound  , and upper_bound   are also provided for sorted sequences  §32.6 .  I tend to think of a set as a map with no separate value_type. For a set, the value_type is also the   Section 31.4.3.1  Ordered Associative Containers   913  To hav e a set , we need to provide a comparison function. For example:  bool operator< const Record& a, const Record& b  {  return a.label<b.label;  Given that, we can write:  set  mr {{"duck",10}, {"pork",12}};  void read_test   {  for  auto& r : mr  {  } cout << endl;  cout << '{' << r.label << ':' << r.value << '}';  The key of an element in an associative container is immutable  §iso.23.2.4 . Therefore, we cannot change the values of a set. We cannot even change a member of an element that takes no part in the comparison.  For example:  void modify_test   {  for  auto& r : mr   ++r.value;      error :set elements are immutable  If you need to modify an element, use a map. Don’t try to modify a key: if you were to succeed, the underlying mechanism for ﬁnding elements would break.  31.4.3.2  Unordered Associative Containers  The  unordered  associative  containers   unordered_map, unordered_set, unordered_multimap, unordered_multiset  are hash tables. For simple uses, there are few differences from  ordered  con- tainers because the associative containers share most operations  §31.4.3.1 . For example:  unordered_map  score1 {  {"andy", 7}, {"al",9}, {"bill",−3}, {"barbara",12}  map  score2 {  {"andy", 7}, {"al",9}, {"bill",−3}, {"barbara",12}  template  ostream& operator & p  {  return os << '{' << p.ﬁrst << ',' << p.second << '}';  }  }  }  };  };  }   914   STL Containers   Chapter 31  void user   {  cout <<"unordered: "; for  const auto& x : score1   cout << x << ", ";  cout << "\nordered: "; for  const auto& x : score2   cout << x << ", ";  }  The visible difference is that iteration through a map is ordered and for an unordered_map it is not:  unordered: {andy,7}, {al,9}, {bill,−3}, {barbara,12}, ordered: {al,9}, {andy, 7}, {barbara,12}, {bill,−3},  Iteration over an unordered_map depends on the order of insertion, the hash function, and the load factor. In particular, there is no guarantee that elements are printed in the order of their insertion.  31.4.3.3  Constructing unordered_maps  The unordered_map has a lot of template arguments and member type aliases to match:  template<typename Key,  typename  T, typename  Hash = hash , typename  Pred = std::equal_to , typename  Allocator = std::allocator >>  class unordered_map { public:  using key_type = Key; using value_type = std::pair ; using mapped_type = T; using hasher = Hash; using key_equal = Pred; using allocator_type = Allocator; using pointer = typename allocator_traits ::pointer; using const_pointer= typename allocator_traits ::const_pointer; using reference = value_type&; using const_reference = const value_type& using size_type =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using difference_type =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using const_iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using local_iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using const_local_iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned* ;     ...  };  By default, an unordered_map  uses hash  for hashing and equal_to  to compare keys.   Section 31.4.3.3  Constructing unordered_maps  915  The default equal_to   §33.4  simply compares X values using ==. The general  primary  template hash doesn’t hav e a deﬁnition.  It is up to users of a type X to deﬁne hash  if needed. For common types, such as string, standard hash specializations are pro- vided, so the user need not provide them:  Types with hash   §iso.20.8.12  Supplied by the Standard Library  string  C-style string ﬂoating-point types error_code   u16string bool pointers bitset   u32string  characters  type_index unique_ptr    wstring integers thread::id shared_ptr   A hash function  e.g., a specialization of hash for a type T or a pointer to function  must be callable with an argument of type T and return a size_t  §iso.17.6.3.4 .  Two calls of a hash function for the same value must give the same result, and ideally such results are uniformly distributed over the set of size_t values so as to minimize the chances that h x ==h y  if x!=y.  There is a potentially bewildering set of combinations of template argument types, constructors,  and defaults for an unordered container. Fortunately, there is a pattern:  unordered_map  Constructors  §iso.23.5.4   unordered_map m {n,hf,eql,a};  unordered_map m {n,hf,eql};  unordered_map m {n,hf}; unordered_map m {n}; unordered_map m {};  Construct m with n buckets, the hash function hf, the equality function eql, and the allocator a; explicit unordered_map m{n,hf,eql,allocator_type{}}; explicit unordered_map m {n,hf,key_eql{}}; explicit unordered_map m {n,hasher{}}; explicit unordered_map m {N}; the bucket count N is implementation-deﬁned; explicit  Here, n is an element count for an otherwise empty unordered_map.  unordered_map  Constructors  §iso.23.5.4   unordered_map m {b,e,n,hf,eql,a};  unordered_map m {b,e,n,hf,eql};  unordered_map m {b,e,n,hf};  unordered_map m {b,e,n};  unordered_map m {b,e};  Construct m with n buckets from the elems of [b:e , using hash function hf, the equality function eql, and the allocator a; unordered_map m {b,e,n,hf,eql,allocator_type{}}; unordered_map m {b,e,n,hf,key_equal{}}; unordered_map m {b,e,n,hasher{}}; unordered_map m {b,e,N}; the bucket count N is implementation-deﬁned  Here, we get the initial elements from a sequence [b:e .  The number of elements will be then num- ber of elements in [b:e , distance b,e .   916   STL Containers   Chapter 31  unordered_map  Constructors  §iso.23.5.4   unordered_map m {{elem},n,hf,eql,a};  unordered_map m {{elem},n,hf,eql};  unordered_map m {{elem},n,hf}; unordered_map m {{elem},n}; unordered_map m {{elem}};  Construct m from the elems of an initializer_list, using n buckets, the hash function hf, the equality function eql, and the allocator a unordered_map m {{elem},n,hf,eql,allocator_type{}}; unordered_map m {{elem},n,hf,key_equal{}}; unordered_map m {{elem},n,hasher{}}; unordered_map m {{elem},N}; the bucket count N is implementation-deﬁned  Here, we get the initial elements from a sequence from a {}-delimited initializer list of elements. The number of elements in the unordered_map will be the number of elements in the initializer list. Finally, unordered_map has copy and move constructors, and also equivalent constructors that  supply allocators:  unordered_map  Constructors  §iso.23.5.4   unordered_map m {m2}; unordered_map m {a}; unordered_map m {m2,a};  Copy and move constructors: construct m from m2 Default construct m and give it allocator a; explicit Construct m from m2 and give it allocator a  Be careful when constructing an unordered_map with one or two arguments.  There are many possi- ble combinations of types, and mistakes can lead to strange error messages. For example:  map  m {My_comparator}; unordered_map  um {My_hasher};     OK    error  A single constructor argument must be another unordered_map  for a copy or move constructor , a bucket count, or an allocator. Try something like:  unordered_map  um {100,My_hasher};     OK  31.4.3.4  Hash and Equality Functions  Naturally, a user can deﬁne a hash function. In fact, there are several ways to do that. Different techniques serve different needs. Here, I present several versions, starting with the most explicit and ending with the simplest. Consider a simple Record type:  struct Record {  string name; int val;  };  I can deﬁne Record hash and equality operations like this:  struct Nocase_hash {  int d = 1;     shift code d number of bits in each iteration   Section 31.4.3.4  Hash and Equality Functions  917  size_t operator   const Record& r  const {  size_t h = 0; for  auto x : r.name  {  h <<= d; h ˆ= toupper x ;  }  return h;  struct Nocase_equal {  bool operator   const Record& r,const Record& r2  const {  if  r.name .size  !=r2.name .size    return false; for  int i = 0; i<r.name .size  ; ++i   if  toupper r.name[i] !=toupper r2.name[i]    return false;  return true;  Given that, I can deﬁne and use an unordered_set of Records:  unordered_set  m {  { {"andy", 7}, {"al",9}, {"bill",−3}, {"barbara",12} }, Nocase_hash{2}, Nocase_equal{}  for  auto r : m   cout << "{" << r.name << ',' << r.val << "}\n";  }  }  };  };  };  };  If,  as  is  most  common,  I  wanted  to  use  the  default  values  for  my  hash  and  equality  functions,  I could  do  that  by  simply  not  mentioning  them  as  constructor  arguments.  By default,  the unordered_set uses the default versions:  unordered_set  m {  {"andy", 7}, {"al",9}, {"bill",−3}, {"barbara",12}    use Nocase_hash{} and Nocase_equal{}  Often, the easiest way of writing a hash function is to use the standard-library hash functions pro- vided as specializations of hash  §31.4.3.2 .  For example:  size_t hf const Record& r  { return hash    r.name ˆhash    r.val ; };  bool eq  const Record& r, const Record& r2  { return r.name==r2.name && r.val==r2.val; };  Combining hash values using exclusive OR  ˆ  preserves their distributions over the set of values of type size_t  §3.4.5, §10.3.1 .   918   STL Containers   Chapter 31  Given this hash function and equality function, we can deﬁne an unordered_set:  unordered_set  m {  { {"andy", 7}, {"al",9}, {"bill",−3}, {"barbara",12} }, hf, eq  for  auto r : m   cout << "{" << r.name << ',' << r.val << "}\n";  };  }  I used decltype to avoid having to explicitly repeat the types of hf and eq.  If we don’t hav e an initializer list handy, we can give an initial size instead:  unordered_set  m {10,hf,eq};  That also makes it a bit easier to focus on the hash and equality operations.  If we wanted to avoid separating the deﬁnitions of hf and eq from their point of use, we could  try lambdas:  unordered_set<Record,   function ,  function       value type    hash type    equal type  > m { 10, [] const Record& r  { return hash {} r.name ˆhash {} r.val ; }, [] const Record& r, const Record& r2  { return r.name==r2.name && r.val==r2.val; } };  The point about using  named or unnamed  lambdas instead of functions is that they can be deﬁned locally in a function, next to their use.  However,  here, function may  incur  overhead  that  I  would  prefer  to  avoid  if  the unordered_set  was heavily used. Also, I consider that version messy and prefer to name the lambdas:  auto hf = [] const Record& r  { return hash    r.name ˆhash    r.val ; }; auto eq = [] const Record& r, const Record& r2  { return r.name==r2.name && r.val==r2.val; };  unordered_set  m {10,hf,eq};  Finally, we may prefer to deﬁne the meaning of hash and equality once for all unordered containers of Record by specializing the standard-library hash and equal_to templates used by unordered_map:  namespace std { template  struct hash {  size_t operator   const Record &r  const {  return hash {} r.name ˆhash {} r.val ;  }  };   Section 31.4.3.4  Hash and Equality Functions  919  template  struct equal_to  {  bool operator   const Record& r, const Record& r2  const {  return r.name==r2.name && r.val==r2.val;  }  };  }  unordered_set  m1; unordered_set  m2;  The default hash and hashes obtained from it by using exclusive-or are often pretty good. Don’t rush to use homemade hash functions without experimentation.  31.4.3.5  Load and Buckets  Signiﬁcant parts of the implementation of an unordered container are made visible to the program- mer. Keys with the same hash value are said to be ‘‘in the same bucket’’  see §31.2.1 . A program- mer can examine and set the size of the hash table  known as ‘‘the number of buckets’’ :  h=c.hash_function    eq=c.key_eq    d=c.load_factor     d=c.max_load_factor    c.max_load_factor d   c.rehash n  c.reserve n   Hash Policy  §iso.23.2.5   h is c’s hash function eq is c’s equality test d is the number of elements divided by the number of buckets: double c.siz e    c.bucket_count  ; noexcept d is the maximum load factor for c; noexcept Set c’s maximum load factor to d; if c’s load factor gets close to its maximum load factor, c will resize the hash table  increase the number of buckets  Make c’s bucket count >= n Make room for n entries  taking the load factor into account : c.rehash ceil n c.max_load_factor      The load factor of an unordered associative container is simply the fraction of the capacity that has been used. For example, if the capacity   is 100 elements and the size   is 30, the load_factor   is 0.3. Note that setting the max_load_factor, calling rehash  , or calling reserve   can be very expensive operations   worst  case O n∗n   because  they can  –  and  in  realistic  scenarios  typically  do  –  cause rehashing  of  all  elements. These  functions  are  used  to  ensure  that  rehashing  takes  place  at  rela- tively convenient times in a program’s execution.  For example:  unordered_set  people;    ... constexpr int expected = 1000000; people.max_load_factor 0.7 ; people.reserve expected ;      expected maximum number of elements    at most 70% full    about 1,430,000 buckets   920   STL Containers   Chapter 31  You need to experiment to ﬁnd a suitable load factor for a given set of elements and a particular hash function, but 70%  0.7  is often a good choice.  n=c.bucket_count     n=c.max_bucket_count     m=c.bucket_siz e n  i=c.bucket k  p=c.begin n   p =c.end n   p=c.cbegin n    p =c.cend n    Bucket Interface  §iso.23.2.5  n is the number of buckets in c  the size of the hash table ; noexcept n is the largest possible number of elements in a bucket; noexcept m is the number of elements in the nth bucket An element with key k would be in the ith bucket p points to the ﬁrst element in bucket n p points to the one-past-the-last element in bucket n p points to the ﬁrst element in bucket n; p is a const iterator p points to the one-past-the-last element in bucket n; p is a const iterator  Use of an n for which c.max_bucket_count  <=n as an index into a bucket is undeﬁned  and probably disastrous .  One use for the bucket interface is to allow experimentation with hash functions: a poor hash function will lead to large bucket_count  s for some key values.  That is, it will lead to many keys being mapped to the same hash value.  31.5  Container Adaptors A container adaptor provides a different  typically restricted  interface to a container. Container adaptors are intended to be used only through their specialized interfaces.  In particular, the STL container adaptors do not offer direct access to their underlying container. They do not offer itera- tors or subscripting.  The techniques used to create a container adaptor from a container are generally useful for non-  intrusively adapting the interface of a class to the needs of its users.  31.5.1 stack The stack container adaptor is deﬁned in  . It can be described by a partial implementation:  template > class stack {   public:     §iso.23.6.5.2  using value_type = typename C::value_type; using reference = typename C::reference; using const_reference = typename C::const_reference; using size_type = typename C::size_type; using container_type = C;   Section 31.5.1  public:  stack  921  explicit stack const C& ;    copyfrom container explicit stack C&& = C{} ;     move from container     default copy, move, assignment, destructor  template   template   explicit stack const A& a ;     default container,allocator a  stack const C& c, const A& a ;     elements from c,allocator a  template   stack C&&, const A& ;  template   stack const stack&, const A& ;  template   stack stack&&, const A& ;  bool empty   const { return c.empty  ; } size_type siz e   const { return c.size  ; } reference top   { return c.back  ; } const_reference top   const { return c.back  ; } void push const value_type& x  { c.push_back x ; } void push value_type&& x  { c.push_back std::move x  ; } void pop   { c.pop_back  ; }    pop the last element  template  void emplace Args&&... args  {  c.emplace_back std::forward  args ... ;  void swap stack& s  noexcept noexcept swap c, s.c    {     be sure to use the standard swap    using std::swap;  swap c,s.c ;  }  }  protected: C c;  };  That is, a stack is an interface to a container of the type passed to it as a template argument.  A stack eliminates the non-stack operations on its container from the interface, and provides the con- ventional names: top  , push  , and pop  .  In addition, stack provides the usual comparison operators  ==, <, etc.  and a nonmember swap  . By default, a stack makes a deque to hold its elements, but any sequence that provides back  ,  push_back  , and pop_back   can be used. For example:  stack  s1; stack > s2;     uses a deque  to store elements    uses a vector  to store elements   922   STL Containers   Chapter 31  Often, vector is faster than deque and uses less memory.  Elements are added to a stack using push_back   on the underlying container. Consequently, a stack cannot ‘‘overﬂow’’ as long as there is memory available on the machine for the container to acquire.  On the other hand, a stack can underﬂow:  void f   {  stack  s; s.push 2 ; if  s.empty    {     don’t pop  } else {  }  s.pop  ;  s.pop  ;      underﬂowispreventable     butnot impossible    ﬁne: s.size   becomes 0    undeﬁned effect, probably bad  }  }  };  We  do not pop   an element to use it. Instead, the top   is accessed and then pop  ed when it is no longer needed. This is not too inconvenient, can be more efﬁcient when a pop   is not necessary, and greatly simpliﬁes the implementation of exception guarantees. For example:  void f stack & s  {  if  s.top  =='c'  s.pop  ;    ...     optionally remove optional initial ’c’  By default, a stack relies on the allocator from its underlying container. If that’s not enough, there are a handful of constructors for supplying another.  31.5.2 queue Deﬁned in  , a queue is an interface to a container that allows the insertion of elements at the back   and the extraction of elements at the front  :  template  > class queue {    §iso.23.6.3.1     ... likestack... void pop   { c.pop_front  ; }     pop the ﬁrst element  Queues seem to pop up somewhere in every system. One might deﬁne a server for a simple mes- sage-based system like this:  void server queue & q, mutex& m  {  while  !q.empty    {  Message mess; {  lock_guard  lck m ;  if  q.empty    return;     lockwhile extracting message     somebody else got the message   Section 31.5.2  queue  923  mess = q.front  ; q.pop  ;  }    ser verequest  }  }  31.5.3 priority_queue A priority_queue is  a  queue  in  which  each  element  is  given a priority  that  controls  the  order  in which the elements get to be the top  . The declaration of priority_queue is much like the declara- tion of queue with additions to deal with a comparison object and a couple of constructors initializ- ing from a sequence:  template , typename Cmp = less > class priority_queue { protected: C c; Cmp comp;     §iso.23.6.4  priority_queue const Cmp& x, const C& ; explicit priority_queue const Cmp& x = Cmp{}, C&& = C{} ; template   priority_queue In b, In e, const Cmp& x, const C& c ;     inser t[b:e  into c  The declaration of priority_queue is found in  .  By default, the priority_queue simply compares elements using the < operator, and top   returns  the largest element:  struct Message { int priority; bool operator< const Message& x  const { return priority < x.priority; }    ...  void server priority_queue & q, mutex& m  {  while  !q.empty    {  Message mess; {  lock_guard  lck m ;  if  q.empty    return; mess = q.top  ; q.pop  ;  }    ser vehighest prior ityrequest     hold lockwhile extracting message    somebody else got the message  public:     ...  };  };  }  }   924   STL Containers   Chapter 31  This differs from the queue version  §31.5.2  in that Messages with higher priority will get served ﬁrst.  The order in which elements with equal priority come to the head of the queue is not deﬁned. Tw o elements  are  considered  of  equal  priority  if  neither  has  higher  priority  than  the  other  §31.2.2.1 .  Keeping  elements  in  order  isn’t free,  but  it  needn’t be expensive  either. One  useful  way  of implementing a priority_queue is to use a tree structure to keep track of the relative positions of ele- ments.  This gives an O log n   cost of both push   and pop  . A priority_queue is almost certainly implemented using a heap  §32.6.4 .  31.6  Advice [1]  An STL container deﬁnes a sequence; §31.2. [2]  Use vector as your default container; §31.2, §31.4.

The STL consists of the iterator, container, algorithm, and function object parts of the standard library. The rest of the STL is presented in Chapter 31 and Chapter 33.  32.2  Algorithms There are about 80 standard algorithms deﬁned in  . They operate on sequences deﬁned by a pair of iterators  for inputs  or a single iterator  for outputs . When copying, comparing, etc., two sequences, the ﬁrst is represented by a pair of iterators, [b:e , but the second by just a single   928   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  iterator, b2, which  is  considered  the  start  of  a  sequence  holding  sufﬁcient  elements  for  the  algo- rithm, for example, as many elements as the ﬁrst sequence: [b2:b2+ e−b  .  Some algorithms, such as sort  , require random-access iterators, whereas many,  such as ﬁnd  , only read their elements in order so that they can make do with a forward iterator. Many algorithms follow the usual conven- tion of returning the end of a sequence to represent ‘‘not found’’  §4.5 .  I don’t mention that for each algorithm.  Algorithms, both the standard-library algorithms and the users’ own ones, are important:  cid:129  Each names a speciﬁc operation, documents an interface, and speciﬁes semantics.  cid:129  Each can be widely used and known by many programmers.  For correctness, maintainability, and performance, these can be immense advantages compared to ‘‘random code’’ with less well-speciﬁed functions and dependencies. If you ﬁnd yourself writing a piece of code with several loops, local variables that don’t seem to relate to each other, or compli- cated  control  structures,  consider  if  the  code  could  be  simpliﬁed  by  making  a  part  into  a  func- tion algorithm with a descriptive name, a well-deﬁned purpose, a well-deﬁned interface, and well- deﬁned dependencies.  Numerical algorithms in the style of the STL algorithms are presented in §40.6.  32.2.1  Sequences The ideal for a standard-library algorithm is to provide the most general and ﬂexible interface to something that can be implemented optimally. The iterator-based interfaces are a good, but not per- fect,  approximation  to  that  ideal   §33.1.1 . For example,  an  iterator-based  interface  does  not directly represent the notion of a sequence, leading to the possibility of confusion and difﬁculties in detecting some range errors:  void user vector & v1, vector & v2  {  copy v1.begin  ,v1.end  ,v2.begin   ;  sort v1.begin  ,v2.end   ;     mayoverﬂowv2     oops!  Many such problems can be alleviated by providing container versions of the standard-library algo- rithms.  For example:  }  }  template  void sort Cont& c  {  std::sort begin c ,end c  ;  static_assert Range   , "sort  : Cont argument not a Range" ; static_assert Sortable >  , "sort  : Cont argument not Sortable" ;  template  void copy const Cont1& source , Cont2& target  {  static_assert Range   , "copy  : Cont1 argument not a Range" ; static_assert Range   , "copy  : Cont2 argument not a Range" ;   Section 32.2.1  Sequences   929  if  target.siz e  <source .size    throw out_of_rang e{"copy target too small"};  std::copy source .begin  ,source .end  ,target.begin   ;  This would simplify the deﬁnition of user  , make the second error impossible to express, and catch the ﬁrst at run time:  }  }  void user vector & v1, vector & v2  {     overﬂows will be caught  copy v1,v2 ;  sort v1 ;  However, the container versions are also less general than the versions that use iterators directly. In particular, you cannot use the container sort   to sort half a container, and you cannot use the con- tainer copy   to write to an output stream.  A complementary approach is to deﬁne a ‘‘range’’ or ‘‘sequence’’ abstraction that allows us to deﬁne sequences when needed. I use the concept Range to denote anything with begin   and end   iterators   §24.4.4 . That  is,  there  is  no Range class  holding  data  –  exactly  as  there  is  no Iterator class or Container class in the STL. So, in the ‘‘container sort  ’’ and ‘‘container copy  ’’ examples, I called  the  template  argument Cont  for  ‘‘container’’ ,  but  they will  accept  any sequence  with  a begin   and an end   that meets the rest of the requirements for the algorithm.  The standard-library containers mostly return iterators. In particular, they do not return contain- ers of results  except in a few rare examples, a pair .  One reason for that is that when the STL was designed, there was no direct support for move semantics.  So, there was no obvious and efﬁcient way to return a lot of data from an algorithm. Some programmers used explicit indirection  e.g., a pointer, reference, or iterator  or some clever trickery. Today, we can do better:  static_assert Range   , "ﬁnd_all  : Cont argument not a Range" ; static_assert Predicate   , "ﬁnd_all  : Pred argument not a Predicate" ;  template  vector ∗> ﬁnd_all Cont& c, Pred p  {  vector ∗> res; for  auto& x : c   if  p x   res.push_back &x ;  return res;  }  In C++98, this ﬁnd_all   would have been a bad performance bug whenever the number of matches was large.  If the choice of standard-library algorithms seems restrictive or insufﬁcient, extension with new versions of STL algorithms or new algorithms is often a viable and superior alternative to just writing ‘‘random code’’ to work around the problem.  Note  that  whatever an STL  algorithm  returns,  it  cannot  be  an  argument  container. The  argu- ments to STL algorithms are iterators  Chapter 33 , and an algorithm has no knowledge of the data   930   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  structure  those  iterators  point  into. structure on which they operate, and vice versa.  Iterators  exist  primarily  to  isolate  algorithms  from  the  data  32.3  Policy Arguments Most standard-library algorithms come in two versions:   cid:129  A ‘‘plain’’ version that performs its action using conventional operations, such as < and ==  cid:129  A version that takes key operations as arguments  For example:  template  void sort Iter ﬁrst, Iter last  {     ... sortusing e1<e2 ...  template  void sort Iter ﬁrst, Iter last, Pred pred  {     ... sortusing pred e1,e2  ...  }  }  }  This greatly increases the ﬂexibility of the standard library and its range of uses.  The usual two versions of an algorithm can be implemented as two  overloaded  function tem-  plates or as a single function template with a default argument.  For example:  template >>  sort Ran ﬁrst, Ran last, Pred pred ={}  {     ... use pred x,y  ...     use a default template argument  The  difference  between  having  two functions  and  having  one  with  a  default  argument  can  be observed by someone taking pointers to functions. However,  thinking of many of the variants of the standard algorithms as simply ‘‘the version with the default predicate’’ roughly halves the num- ber of template functions you need to remember.  In some cases, an argument could be interpreted as either a predicate or a value.  For example:  bool pred int ;  auto p = ﬁnd b,e,pred ;      ﬁnd element pred or apply predicate’pred  ?  the latter   In general, a compiler cannot disambiguate such examples, and programmers would get confused ev en in the cases where the compiler could disambiguate.  To simplify the task for the programmer, the _if sufﬁx is often used to indicate that an algorithm takes  a  predicate. The  reason  to  distinguish  by  using  two names  is  to  minimize  ambiguities  and confusion.  Consider:  using Predicate = bool ∗  int ;   Section 32.3  Policy Arguments   931  void f vector & v1, vector & v2  {  auto p1 = ﬁnd v1.begin  ,v1.end  ,pred ; auto p2 = ﬁnd_if v2.begin  ,v2.end  ,pred ;     ﬁnd element with the value pred    count elements for which pred   returns true  Some operations passed as arguments to an algorithm are meant to modify the element to which they are applied  e.g., some operations passed to for_each  ; §32.4.1 , but most are predicates  e.g., a comparison object for sort   .  Unless otherwise stated, assume that a policy argument passed to an algorithm should not modify an element. In particular, do not try to modify elements through predicates:  int n_even vector & v      don’t do this     count the number of evenvalues in v  return ﬁnd_if v.begin  ,v.end  ,[] int& x  {++x; return x&1; } ;  }  {  }  Modifying an element through a predicate obscures what is being done. If you are really sneaky, you could even modify the sequence  e.g., by inserting or removing an element using the name of a container being iterated over , so that the iteration would fail  probably in obscure ways .  To avoid accidents, you may pass arguments to predicates by const reference.  Similarly, a predicate  should  not  carry  state  that  changes  the  meaning  of  its  operation. The implementation of an algorithm may copy a predicate, and we rarely want repeated uses of a predi- cate on the same value to give different results. Some function objects passed to algorithms, such as random number generators, do carry mutable state. Unless you are really sure that an algorithm doesn’t copy,  keep  a  function  object  argument’s mutable  state  in  another  object  and  access  it through a pointer or a reference.  The == and < operations on pointer elements are rarely appropriate for an STL algorithm: they compare machine addresses rather than the values pointed to. In particular, do not sort or search containers of C-style strings using the default == and <  §32.6 .  32.3.1  Complexity As  for  containers   §31.3 ,  the  complexity  of  algorithms  is  speciﬁed  by  the  standard. Most  algo- rithms are linear, O n , for some n, which is usually the length of an input sequence.  Algorithm Complexity  §iso.25   O 1   O log n    O n∗log n     O n∗n   O n   swap  , iter_swap   lower_bound  , upper_bund  , equal_range  , binary_search  , push_heap  , pop_heap   inplace_merge    worst case , stable_par tition    worst case , sort  , stable_sor t  , partial_sort  , partial_sort_copy  , sort_heap   ﬁnd_end  , ﬁnd_ﬁrst_of  , search  , search_n   All the rest  As ever, these are asymptotic complexities, and you have to know what n measures to have an idea of the implications. For example, if n<3, a quadratic algorithm may be the best choice. The cost of each  iteration  can  vary  dramatically. For  example,  traversing  a  list  can  be  much  slower  than   932   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  traversing a vector, even though the complexity in both cases is linear  O n  .  Complexity measures are  not  a  substitute  for  common  sense  and  actual  time  measurements;  they are  one  tool  among many to ensure quality code.  32.4  Nonmodifying Sequence Algorithms A nonmodifying algorithm just reads the values of elements of its input sequences; it does not rear- range the sequence and does not change the values of the elements. Typically, user-supplied opera- tions to an algorithm don’t change the values of elements either; they tend to be predicates  which may not modify their arguments .  32.4.1 for_each   The simplest algorithm is for_each  , which just applies an operation to each element of a sequence:  for_each  §iso.25.2.4   f=for_each b,e ,f   Do f x  for each x in [b:e ; return f  When possible, prefer a more speciﬁc algorithm.  The operation passed to for_each   may modify elements. For example:  void increment_all vector & v     increment each element of v {  for_each v.begin  ,v.end  , [] int& x  {++x;} ;  32.4.2  Sequence Predicates  Sequence Predicates  §iso.25.2.1   all_of b,e,f  any_of b,e ,f  none_of b,e,f   Is f x  true for all x in [b:e ? Is f x  true for any x in [b:e ? Is f x  false for all x in [b:e ?  For example:  vector  scale const vector & val, const vector & div  {  assert val.siz e  <div.siz e   ; assert all_of div.begin  ,div.end  ,[] double x { return 0<x; } ;  vector res val.siz e   ; for  int i = 0; i<val.siz e  ; ++i   res[i] = val[i] div[i];  return res;  }  }  When one of these sequence predicates fails, it does not tell which element caused the failure.   Section 32.4.3  32.4.3 count    count    933  count  §iso.25.2.9   x=count b,e,v  x=count_if b,e,v,f    x is the number of elements ∗p in [b:e  such that v==∗p x is the number of elements ∗p in [b:e  such that f ∗p   For example:  void f const string& s  {  auto n_space = count s.begin  ,s.end  ,' ' ; auto n_whitespace = count_if s.begin  ,s.end  ,isspace ;    ...  }  }  The isspace   predicate  §36.2  lets us count all whitespace characters, rather than just space.  32.4.4 ﬁnd   The ﬁnd   family of algorithms do linear searches for some element or predicate match:  p=ﬁnd b,e,v  p=ﬁnd_if b,e,f  p=ﬁnd_if_not b,e,f  p=ﬁnd_ﬁrst_of b,e ,b2,e2   p=ﬁnd_ﬁrst_of b,e ,b2,e2,f   p=adjacent_ﬁnd b,e   p=adjacent_ﬁnd b,e,f  p=ﬁnd_end b,e,b2,e2   p=ﬁnd_end  b,e,b2,e2,f    The ﬁnd Family  §iso.25.2.5  p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  such that ∗p==v p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  such that f ∗p  p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  such that !f ∗p  p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  such that ∗p==∗q for some q in [b2:e2  p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  such that f ∗p,∗q  for some q in [b2:e2  p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  such that ∗p==∗ p+1  p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  such that f ∗p,∗ p+1   p points to the last ∗p in [b:e  such that ∗p==∗q for an element ∗q in [b2:e2  p points to the last ∗p in [b:e  such that f ∗p,∗q  for an element ∗q in [b2:e2   The algorithms ﬁnd   and ﬁnd_if   return an iterator to the ﬁrst element that matches a value and a predicate, respectively.  void f const string& s  {  auto p_space = ﬁnd s.begin  ,s.end  ,' ' ; auto p_whitespace = ﬁnd_if s.begin  ,s.end  , isspace ;    ...  The ﬁnd_ﬁrst_of   algorithms  ﬁnd  the  ﬁrst  occurrence  in  a  sequence  of  an  element  from  another sequence.  For example:   934   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  array  x = {1,3,4 }; array  y = {0,2,3,4,5};  void f   {  }  auto p = ﬁnd_ﬁrst_of x.begin  ,x.end  ,y.begin  ,y.end ;  auto q = ﬁnd_ﬁrst_of p+1,x.end  ,y.begin  ,y.end   ;      p=&x[1]    q=&x[2]  The iterator p will point to x[1] because 3 is the ﬁrst element of x with a match in y. Similarly, q will point to x[2].  32.4.5 equal   and mismatch   The equal   and mismatch   algorithms compare pairs of sequences:  equal and mismatch    §iso.25.2.11, §iso.25.2.10   equal b,e,b2   equal b,e,b2,f   pair p1,p2 =mismatch b,e ,b2   pair p1,p2 =mismatch b,e ,b2,f   Is v==v2 for all corresponding elements of [b:e  and [b2:b2+ e−b  ? Is f v,v2  for all corresponding elements of [b:e  and [b2:b2+ e−b  ? p1 points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  and p2 points to the ﬁrst element in [b2:b2+ e−b   such that ! ∗p1==∗p2  or p1==e p1 points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  and p2 points to the ﬁrst element in [b2:b2+ e−b   such that !f ∗p1,∗p2  or p1==e  The mismatch   looks  for  the  ﬁrst  pair  of  elements  of  two sequences  that  compare  unequal  and returns iterators to those elements. No end is speciﬁed for the second sequence; that is, there is no last2. Instead, it is assumed that there are at least as many elements in the second sequence as in the  ﬁrst,  and ﬁrst2+ last−ﬁrst  is  used  as last2. This  technique  is  used  throughout  the  standard library, where pairs of sequences are used for operations on pairs of elements. We could implement mismatch   like this:  template >> pair  mismatch In ﬁrst, In last, In2 ﬁrst2, Pred p ={}  {  while  ﬁrst != last && p ∗ﬁrst,∗ﬁrst2   {  ++ﬁrst; ++ﬁrst2;  } return {ﬁrst,ﬁrst2};  }  I used the standard function object equal_to  §33.4  and the type function Value_type  §28.2.1 .   Section 32.4.6  search    935  32.4.6 search   The search   and search_n   algorithms ﬁnd one sequence as a subsequence in another:  Searching for Sequences  §iso.25.2.13   p=search b,e ,b2,e2   p=search b.e ,b2,e2,f   p=search_n b,e ,n,v   p=search_n b,e ,n,v,f    p points to the ﬁrst ∗p in [b:e  such that [p:p+ e−b   equals [b2:e2  p points to the ﬁrst ∗p in [b:e  such that [p:p+ e−b   equals [b2:e2 , using f for element comparison p points to the ﬁrst element of [b:e  such that each element of [p:p+n  has the value v p points to the ﬁrst element of [b:e  such that for each element ∗q in [p:p+n  we hav e f ∗p,v   The search   algorithm looks for its second sequence as a subsequence of its ﬁrst. If that second sequence is found, an iterator for the ﬁrst matching element in the ﬁrst sequence is returned. As usual, the end of the sequence is used to represent ‘‘not found.’’  For example:  string quote {"Why waste time learning, when ignorance is instantaneous?"};  bool in_quote const string& s  {  auto p = search quote .begin  ,quote.end  ,s.begin  ,s.end   ;    ﬁnd s in quote return p!=quote.end  ;  void g   {  }  }  bool b1 = in_quote "learning" ; bool b2 = in_quote "lemming" ;     b1 = true    b2 = false  Thus, search   is a useful algorithm for ﬁnding a substring generalized to all sequences.  Use ﬁnd   or binary_search    §32.6  to look for just a single element.  32.5  Modifying Sequence Algorithms The modifying algorithms  also called mutating sequence algorithms  can  and often do  modify elements of their argument sequences.  p=transform b,e ,out,f   p=transform b,e ,b2,out,f   transform  §iso.25.3.4   Apply ∗q=f ∗p1  to every ∗p1 in [b:e , writing to the corresponding ∗q in [out:out+ e−b  ; p=out+ e−b  Apply ∗q=f ∗p1,∗p2  to every element in ∗p1 in [b:e  and the corresponding ∗p2 in [b2:b2+ e−b  , writing to the corresponding ∗q in [out:out+ e−b  ; p=out+ e−b    936   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  Somewhat confusingly, transform   doesn’t necessarily change its input. Instead, it produces an out- put that is a transformation of its input based on a user-supplied operation. The one-input-sequence version of transform   may be deﬁned like this:  template  Out transform In ﬁrst, In last, Out res, Op op  {  while  ﬁrst!=last   ∗res++ = op ∗ﬁrst++ ;  return res;  The output sequence may be the same as the input sequence:  void toupper string& s  {     remove case  transform s.begin  ,s.end  ,s.begin  ,toupper ;  This really transforms the input s.  32.5.1 copy   The copy   family of algorithms copy elements from one sequence into another. The following sec- tions list versions of copy   combined with other algorithms, such as replace_copy    §32.5.3 .  p=copy b,e ,out  p=copy_if b,e ,out,f  p=copy_n b,n,out  p=copy_backward b,e ,out   The copy Family  §iso.25.3.1   Copy all elements in [b:e  to [out:p ; p=out+ e−b  Copy elements x in [b:e  for which f x  to [out:p  Copy the ﬁrst n elements in [b:b+n  to [out:p ; p=out+n Copy all elements in [b:e  to [out:p , starting with its last element; p=out+ e−b  Move all elements in [b:e  to [out:p ; p=out+ e−b   p=move b,e ,out  p=move_backward b,e ,out  Move all elements in [b:e  to [out:p ,  starting with its last element; p=out+ e−b   The target of a copy algorithm need not be a container. Anything that can be described by an out- put iterator  §38.5  will do. For example:  void f list & lc, ostream& os  {  copy lc.begin  ,lc.end  ,ostream_iterator  os  ;  To  read a sequence, we need a pair of iterators describing where to begin and where to end. To write, we need only an iterator describing where to write to. However,  we must take care not to write beyond the end of the target.  One way to ensure that we don’t do this is to use an inserter  §33.2.2  to grow the target as needed. For example:  }  }  }   Section 32.5.1  copy    937  void f const vector & vs, vector & v  {  copy vs.begin  ,vs.end  ,v.begin   ;  copy vs.begin  ,vs.end  ,back_inser ter v  ;     might overwr iteend of v    add elements from vs to end of v  The input sequence and the output sequence may overlap.  We use copy   when the sequences do not overlap or if the end of the output sequence is in the input sequence.  We use copy_if   to copy only elements that fulﬁll some criterion. For example:  void f list &ld, int n, ostream& os  {  copy_if ld.begin  ,ld.end  ,  ostream_iterator  os , [] int x  { return x>n ; } ;  See also remove_copy_if  .  32.5.2 unique   The unique   algorithm removes adjacent duplicate elements from a sequence:  The unique Family  §iso.25.3.9   p=unique b,e  p=unique b,e,f   p=unique_copy b,e ,out  p=unique_copy b,e ,out,f   Move elements in [b:e  such that [b:p  has no adjacent duplicates Move elements in [b:e  such that [b:p  has no adjacent duplicates; f ∗p,∗ p+1   deﬁnes ‘‘duplicate’’ Copy [b:e  to [out:p ; don’t copy adjacent duplicates Copy [b:e  to [out:p ; don’t copy adjacent duplicates; f ∗p,∗ p+1   deﬁnes ‘‘duplicate’’  The unique   and unique_copy   algorithms eliminate adjacent duplicate values.  For example:  void f list & ls, vector & vs  {  ls.sort  ; unique_copy ls.begin  ,ls.end  ,back_inser ter vs  ;     list sort §31.4.2   This copies ls to vs, eliminating duplicates in the process. I used sort   to get equal strings adjacent. Like other standard algorithms, unique   operates on iterators. It does not know which container these iterators point into, so it cannot modify that container. It can only modify the values of the elements.  This implies that unique   does not eliminate duplicates from its input sequence in the way we naively might expect.  Therefore, this does not eliminate duplicates in a vector:  void bad vector & vs  {     warning: doesn’t do what it appears to do!  sort vs.begin  ,vs.end   ; unique vs.begin  ,vs.end   ;      sor tvector    eliminate duplicates  no it doesn’t!   }  }  }  }   938   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  Rather, unique   moves unique elements toward the front  head  of a sequence and returns an itera- tor to the end of the subsequence of unique elements. For example:  int main   {  string s ="abbcccde";  auto p = unique s.begin  ,s.end   ; cout << s << ' ' << p−s.begin   << '\n';  produces  abcdecde 5  }  }  That is, p points to the second c  that is, the ﬁrst of the duplicates .  Algorithms  that  might  have  removed elements   but  can’t   generally  come  in  two forms:  the ‘‘plain’’ version that reorders elements in a way similar to unique   and a _copy version that pro- duces a new sequence in a way similar to unique_copy  .  To eliminate duplicates from a container, we must explicitly shrink it:  template  void eliminate_duplicates C& c  {  sort c.begin  ,c.end   ; auto p = unique c.begin  ,c.end   ;    compact c.erase p,c.end   ;      shrink     sor t  I could  equivalently  have  written c.erase unique c.begin  ,c.end   ,c.end   , but  I  don’t think  such terseness improves readability or maintainability.  32.5.3 remove   and replace   The remove   algorithm ‘‘removes’’ elements to the end of a sequence:  remove  §iso.25.3.8   p=remove b,e ,v   p=remove_if b,e ,v,f   p=remove_copy b,e ,out,v  p=remove_copy_if b,e ,out,f  reverse b,e  p=reverse_copy b,e ,out   Remove elements with value v from [b:e , such that [b:p  becomes the elements for which ! ∗q==v  Remove elements ∗q from [b:e , such that [b:p  becomes the elements for which !f ∗q  Copy elements from [b:e  for which ! ∗q==v  to [out:p  Copy elements from [b:e  for which !f ∗q  to [out:p  Reverse the order of elements in [b:e  Copy [b:e  into [out:p  in rev erse order  The replace   algorithm assigns new values to selected elements:   Section 32.5.3  remove   and replace    939  replace b,e,v,v2  replace_if b,e,f,v2  p=replace_copy b,e ,out,v,v2   p=replace_copy_if b,e ,out,f,v2   replace  §iso.25.3.5  Replace elements ∗p in [b:e  for which ∗p==v with v2 Replace elements ∗p in [b:e  for which f ∗p  with v2 Copy [b:e  to [out:p , replacing elements for which ∗p==v with v2 Copy [b:e  to [out:p , replacing elements for which f ∗p,v  with v2  These algorithms cannot change the size of their input sequence, so even remove   leaves the size of its  input  sequence  unchanged. Like unique  , it ‘‘removes’’ by moving  elements  to  the  left. For example:  string s {"∗CamelCase∗IsUgly∗"}; cout << s << '\n'; auto p = remove s.begin  ,s.end  ,'∗' ; copy s.begin  ,p,ostream_iterator {cout} ;  cout << s << '\n';     *CamelCase*IsUgly*     CamelCaseIsUgly    CamelCaseIsUglyly*  32.5.4 rotate  , random_shufﬂe  , and partition   The rotate  , random_shufﬂe  , and partition   algorithms  provide  systematic  ways  of  moving  ele- ments around in a sequence:  p=rotate b,m,e   p=rotate_copy b,m,e ,out   rotate    §iso.25.3.11   Left-rotate elements: treat [b:e  as a circle with the ﬁrst element right after the last; move ∗ b+i  to ∗  b+ i+ e−m  % e−b  ; note: ∗b moves to ∗m; p=b+ e−m  Copy [b:e  into a rotated sequence [out:p   The movement of elements done by rotate    and by the shufﬂe and partition algorithms  is done using swap  .  random_shufﬂe    §iso.25.3.12   random_shufﬂe b,e   random_shufﬂe b,e,f   shufﬂe b,e,f   Shufﬂe elements of [b:e , using the default random number generator Shufﬂe elements of [b:e , using the random number generator f Shufﬂe elements of [b:e , using the uniform random number generator f  A shufﬂe algorithm shufﬂes its sequence much in the way we would shufﬂe a pack of cards. That is, after a shufﬂe, the elements are in a random order, where ‘‘random’’ is deﬁned by the distribu- tion produced by the random number generator.  By default, random_shufﬂe   shufﬂes its sequence using a uniform distribution random number generator. That  is,  it  chooses  a  permutation  of  the  elements  of  the  sequence  so  that  each   940   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  permutation has the same chances of being chosen. If you want a different distribution or a better random  number  generator, you  can  supply  one. For a call random_shufﬂe b,e,r , the  generator  is called with the number of elements in the sequence  or a subsequence  as its argument.  For exam- ple, for a call r e−b  the generator must return a value in the range [0,e−b . If My_rand is such a gen- erator, we might shufﬂe a deck of cards like this:  void f deque & dc, My_rand& r  {  random_shufﬂe dc.begin  ,dc.end  ,r ;    ...  }  The partition algorithm separates a sequence into two parts based on a partition criterion:  partition    §iso.25.3.13   p=partition b,e,f   p=stable_par tition b,e,f   p=partition_point b,e,f   is_partitioned b,e,f   pair p1,p2 =partition_copy b,e ,out1,out2,f   Place elements for which f ∗p1  in [b:p  and other elements in [p:e  Place elements for which f ∗p1  in [b:p  and other elements in [p:e ; preserve relative order Copy elements of [b:e  for which f ∗p  into [out1:p1  and elements of [b:e  for which !f ∗p  into [out2:p2  For [b:e  p is the point such that all_of b,p,f  and none_of p,e,f  Does every element of [b:e  for which f ∗p  precede every element for which !f ∗p ?  32.5.5  Permutations The permutation algorithms provide a systematic way of generating all permutations of a sequence.  Permutations  §iso.25.4.9, §iso.25.2.12   x is true if the next_∗ operation succeeded, otherwise false  Make [b:e  the next permutation in lexicographical order x=next_permutation b,e  x=next_permutation b,e ,f  Make [b:e  the next permutation, using f for comparison Make [b:e  the previous permutation in lexicographical order x=prev_permutation b,e  x=prev_permutation b,e ,f  Make [b:e  the previous permutation, using f for comparison is_permutation b,e ,b2   Is there a permutation of [b2:b2+ e−b   that compares equal to [b,e ? Is there a permutation of [b2:b2+ e−b   that compares equal to [b,e , using f ∗p,∗q  as the element comparison?  is_permutation b,e ,b2,f   Permutations are used to generate combinations of elements of a sequence. For example, the per- mutations of abc are acb, bac, bca, cab, and cba.   Section 32.5.5  Permutations   941  The next_permutation   takes a sequence [b:e  and transforms it into the next permutation. The next permutation is found by assuming that the set of all permutations is lexicographically sorted. If such a permutation exists, next_permutation   returns true; otherwise, it transforms the sequence into the smallest permutation, that is, the ascendingly sorted one  abc in the example , and returns false. So, we can generate the permutations of abc like this:  vector  v {'a','b','c'}; while next_permutation v.begin  ,v.end      cout << v[0] << v[1] << v[2] << ' ';  Similarly, the return value for prev_permutation   is false if [b:e  already contains the ﬁrst permuta- tion  abc in the example ; in that case, it returns the last permutation  cba in the example .  32.5.6 ﬁll   The ﬁll   family of algorithms provide ways of assigning to and initializing elements of a sequence:  The ﬁll Family  §iso.25.3.6, §iso.25.3.7, §iso.20.6.12   ﬁll b,e,v  p=ﬁll_n b,n,v  generate b,e ,f  p=generate_n b,n,f  uninitialized_ﬁll b,e,v  p=uninitialized_ﬁll_n b,n,v  p=uninitialized_copy b,e ,out   p=uninitialized_copy_n b,n,out   Assign v to each element of [b:e  Assign v to each element of [b:b+n ; p=b+n Assign f   to each element of [b:e  Assign f   to each element of [b:b+n ; p=b+n Initialize each element in [b:e  with v Initialize each element in [b:b+n  with v; p=b+n Initialize each element of [out:out+ e−b  ; p=b+n with its corresponding element from [b:e  Initialize each element of [out:out+n  with its corresponding element from [b:b+n ; p=b+n  The ﬁll   algorithm  repeatedly  assigns  the  speciﬁed  value,  whereas generate   assigns  values obtained by calling its function argument repeatedly. For example, using the random number gen- erators Randint and Urand from §40.7:  int v1[900]; array  v2; vector v3;  void f   {  ﬁll begin v1 ,end v1 ,99 ;  generate begin v2 ,end v2 ,Randint{} ;      set all elements of v1 to 99    set to random values  §40.7      output 200 random integers in the interval[0:100 : generate_n ostream_iterator {cout},200,Urand{100} ;      see §40.7  ﬁll_n back_inser ter{v3},20,99 ;     add 20 elements with the value 99 to v3  }  The generate   and ﬁll   functions  assign  rather  than  initialize.  If  you  need  to  manipulate  raw   942   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  storage, say, to turn a region of memory into objects of well-deﬁned type and state, you use one of the uninitialized_ versions  presented in   .  Uninitialized  sequences should  only occur at the lowest level of programming,  usually inside the  implementation  of  containers.  Elements  that  are  targets  of uninitialized_ﬁll   or uninitial- ized_copy   must be of built-in type or uninitialized. For example:  vector  vs {"Breugel","El Greco","Delacroix","Constable"}; vector  vs2 {"Hals","Goya","Renoir","Turner"}; copy vs.begin  ,vs.end  ,vs2.begin   ;  uninitialized_copy vs.begin  ,vs.end  ,vs2.begin   ;      OK    leaks!  A few more facilities for dealing with uninitialized memory are described in §34.6.  32.5.7 swap   A swap   algorithm exchanges the values of two objects:  The swap Family  §iso.25.3.3   swap x,y  p=swap_rang es b,e,b2  iter_swap p,q    Exchange the values of x and y swap v,v2  corresponding elements in [b:e  and [b2,b2+ e−b   swap ∗p,∗q   for example:  void use vector & v, int∗ p  {  swap_rang es v.begin  ,v.end  ,p ;      exchange values  }  The pointer p had better point to an array with at least v.siz e   elements.  The swap   algorithm  is  possibly  the  simplest  and  arguably  the  most  crucial  algorithm  in  the standard  library. It is used  as  part  of  the  implementaton  of  many of the  most  widely  used  algo- rithms.  Its implementation is used as an example in §7.7.2 and the standard-library version is pre- sented in §35.5.2.  32.6  Sorting and Searching Sorting and searching in sorted sequences are fundamental, and the needs of programmers are quite varied.  Comparison is by default done using the < operator, and equivalence of values a and b is determined by ! a<b &&! b<a  rather than requiring operator ==.  The sort Family  §iso.25.4.1   continues   sort b,e  sort b,e,f   Sort [b:e  Sort [b:e , using f ∗p,∗q  as the sorting criterion  In addition to the ‘‘plain sort’’ there are many variants:   Section 32.6  Sorting and Searching   943  The sort Family  continued  §iso.25.4.1   stable_sor t b,e  stable_sor t b,e,f   partial_sort b,m,e   partial_sort b,m,e,f   p=partial_sort_copy b,e ,b2,e2   p=partial_sort_copy b,e ,b2,e2,f   is_sorted b,e  is_sorted b,e,f  p=is_sorted_until b,e  p=is_sorted_until b,e,f    nth_element b,n,e   nth_element b,n,e,f   Sort [b:e  maintaining order of equal elements Sort [b:e , using f ∗p,∗q  as the sorting criterion, maintaining order of equal elements Sort enough of [b:e  to get [b:m  into order; [m:e  need not be sorted Sort enough of [b:e  to get [b:m  into order, using f ∗p,∗q  as the sorting criterion; [m:e  need not be sorted Sort enough of [b:e  to copy the ﬁrst e2−b2 elements into [b2:e2 ; p is the smaller of b2 and b2+ e−b  Sort enough of [b:e  to copy the ﬁrst e2−b2 elements into [b2:e2 , using f for comparison; p is the smaller of b2 and b2+ e−b  Is [b:e  sorted? Is [b:e  sorted, using f for comparison? p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  that is not in order p points to the ﬁrst element in [b:e  that is not in order, using f for comparison ∗n is in the position it would be in if [b:e  was sorted; elements in [b:n  are <= ∗n and ∗n <= elements in [n:e  ∗n is in the position it would be in if [b:e  was sorted; elements in [b:n  are <= ∗n and ∗n <= elements in [n:e , using f for comparison  The sort   algorithms require random-access iterators  §33.1.2 .  Despite its name, is_sorted_until   returns an iterator, rather than a bool. The  standard list  §31.3   does  not  provide  random-access  iterators,  so lists should  be  sorted using the speciﬁc list operations  §31.4.2  or by copying their elements into a vector, sorting that vector, and then copying the elements back into the list:  template  void sort_list List& lst  {  vector v {lst.begin  ,lst.end  }; sort v ; copy v,lst ;     initializefrom lst    use container sort §32.2   }  The basic sort   is efﬁcient  on average N∗log N  .  If a stable sort is required, stable_sor t   should be used, that is, an N∗log N ∗log N  algorithm that improves tow ard N∗log N  when the system has sufﬁ- cient extra memory. The get_temporar y_buffer   function may be used for getting such extra mem- ory  §34.6 . The relative order of elements that compare equal is preserved by stable_sor t   but not by sort  .  Sometimes, only the ﬁrst elements of a sorted sequence are needed. In that case, it makes sense to sort the sequence only as far as is needed to get the ﬁrst part in order, that is, a partial sort. The   944   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  plain partial_sort b,m,e  algorithms  put  the  elements  in  the  range  [b:m  in order. The par- tial_sort_copy   algorithms produce N elements, where N is the lower of the number of elements in the output sequence and the number of elements in the input sequence. We need to specify both the start and the end of the result sequence because that’s what determines how many elements we need to sort. For example:  void f const vector & sales     ﬁnd the top ten books {  vector  bestsellers 10 ; partial_sort_copy sales.begin  ,sales.end  ,  bestsellers.begin  ,bestsellers.end  , [] const Book& b1, const Book& b2  { return b1.copies_sold  >b2.copies_sold  ; } ;  copy bestsellers.begin  ,bestsellers.end  ,ostream_iterator {cout,"\n"} ;  }  Because the target of partial_sort_copy   must be a random-access iterator, we cannot sort directly to cout.  If the number of elements desired to be sorted by a partial_sort   is small compared to the total number of elements, these algorithms can be signiﬁcatly faster than a complete sort  . Then, their complexity approaches O N  compared to sort  ’s O N∗log N  .  The nth_element   algorithm sorts only as far as is necessary to get the Nth element to its proper place  with  no  element  comparing  less  than  the Nth  element  placed  after  it  in  the  sequence. For example:  vector  v; for  int i=0; i<1000; ++i   v.push_back randint 1000  ;      §40.7  constexpr int n = 30; nth_element v.begin  , v.begin  +n, v.end   ; cout << "nth: " << v[n] < '\n'; for  int i=0; i<n; ++i   cout << v[i] << ' ';  This produces:  nth: 24 10 8 15 19 21 15 8 7 6 17 21 2 18 8 1 9 3 21 20 18 10 7 3 3 8 11 11 22 22 23  The nth_element   differs from partial_sort   in that the elements before n are not necessarily sorted, just  all  less  than  the nth  element. Replacing nth_element with partial_sort in  that  example   and using the same seed for the random number generator to get the same sequence , I got:  nth: 995 1 2 3 3 3 6 7 7 8 8 8 8 9 10 10 11 11 15 15 17 18 18 19 20 21 21 21 22 22 23  The nth_element   algorithm is particularly useful for people – such as economists, sociologists, and teachers – who need to look for medians, percentiles, etc.  Sorting C-style strings requires an explicit sorting criterion. The reason is that C-style strings are  simply  pointers  with  a  set  of  conventions  for  their  use,  so < on  pointers  compares  machine addresses rather than character sequences. For example:   Section 32.6  Sorting and Searching   945  vector  vs = {"Helsinki","Copenhagen","Oslo","Stockholm"}; vector  vcs = {"Helsinki","Copenhagen","Oslo","Stockholm"};     Ihavedeﬁned a range version of sort    void use   {  sort vs ; sort vcs ;  for  auto& x : vs   cout << x << ' '  cout << '\n'; for  auto& x : vcs   cout << x << ' ';  This prints:  Copenhagen Helsinki Stockholm Oslo Helsinki Copenhagen Oslo Stockholm  Naively, we might  have  expected  the  same  output  from  both vectors.  However,  to sort  C-style strings by string value rather than by address we need a proper sort predicate. For example:  sort vcs, [] const char∗ p, const char∗ q { return strcmp p,q <0; } ;  The standard-library function strcmp   is described in §43.4.  Note that I did not have to supply a == to sort C-style strings. To simplify the user interface, the  standard library uses ! x y<x  rather than x==y to compare elements  §31.2.2.2 .  32.6.1  Binary Search The binary_search   family of algorithms provide binary searches of ordered  sorted  sequences:  Binary Search  §iso.25.4.3   p=lower_bound b,e ,v  p=lower_bound b,e ,v,f    p=upper_bound b,e,v  p=upper_bound b,e,v,f    binary_search b,e ,v  binary_search b,e ,v,f  pair p1,p2 =equal_range b,e,v   pair p1,p2 =equal_range b,e,v,f   p points to the ﬁrst occurrence of v in [b:e  p points to the ﬁrst occurrence of v in [b:e , using f for comparison p points to the ﬁrst value larger than v in [b:e  p points to the ﬁrst value larger than v in [b:e , using f for comparison Is v in the sorted sequence [b:e ? Is v in the sorted sequence [b:e , using f for comparison? [p1,p2  is the subsequence of [b:e  with the value v; basically, a binary search for v [p1,p2  is the subsequence of [b:e  with the value v, using f for comparison; basically, a binary search for v  A sequential search such as ﬁnd    §32.4  is terribly inefﬁcient for large sequences, but it is about the best we can do without sorting or hashing  §31.4.3.2 . Once a sequence is sorted, however, we can use a binary search to determine whether a value is in a sequence. For example:   946   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  if  binary_search c.begin  ,c.end  ,7   {     is 7 in c?  void f vector & c  {     ...  }    ...  }  }  A binary_search   returns a bool indicating whether a value is present. As with ﬁnd  , we often also want to know where the elements with that value are in that sequence. However, there can be many elements with a given value in a sequence, and we often need to ﬁnd either the ﬁrst or all such ele- ments.  Consequently, algorithms are provided for ﬁnding a range of equal elements, equal_range  , and  algorithms  for  ﬁnding  the lower_bound   and upper_bound   of  that  range. These  algorithms correspond to the operations on multimaps  §31.4.3 .  We can think of lower_bound   as a fast ﬁnd   and ﬁnd_if   for sorted sequences. For example:  void g vector & c  {  auto p = ﬁnd c.begin  ,c.end  ,7 ; auto q = lower_bound c.begin  ,c.end  ,7 ;     ...     probably slow: O N ; c needn’t be sorted    probably fast: O log N  ; c must be sorted  If lower_bound ﬁrst,last,k  doesn’t ﬁnd k, it returns an iterator to the ﬁrst element with a key greater than k, or last if  no  such  greater  element  exists.  This way of reporting  failure  is  also  used  by upper_bound   and equal_range  . This means that we can use these algorithms to determine where to  insert  a  new element  into  a  sorted  sequence  so  that  the  sequence  remains  sorted:  just  insert before the second of the returned pair.  Curiously enough, the binary search algorithms do not require random-access iterators: a for-  ward iterator sufﬁces.  32.6.2 merge   The merge algorithms combine two ordered  sorted  sequences into one:  p=merge b,e ,b2,e2,out  p=merge b,e ,b2,e2,out,f  Merge two sorted sequences [b2:e2  and [b:e   The merge Family  §iso.25.4.4  Merge two sorted sequences [b2:e2  and [b:e  into [out:p   inplace_merge b,m,e   inplace_merge b,m,e ,f   into [out,out+p , using f as the comparison Merge two sorted subsequences [b:m  and [m:e  into a sorted sequence [b:e  Merge two sorted subsequences [b:m  and [m:e  into a sorted sequence [b:e , using f as the comparison  The merge   algorithm can take different kinds of sequences and elements of different types. For example:   Section 32.6.2  merge    947  vector  v {3,1,4,2}; list  lst {0.5,1.5,2,2.5};     lst is in order  sort v.begin  ,v.end   ;      put v in order  vector  v2; merge v.begin  ,v.end  ,lst.begin  ,lst.end  ,back_inser ter v2  ; for  double x : v2   cout << x << ", ";     merger v and lst into v2  For inserters, see §33.2.2. The output is:  0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2, 2.5, 3, 4,  32.6.3  Set Algorithms These algorithms treat a sequence as a set of elements and provide the basic set operations. The input sequences are supposed to be sorted and the output sequences are also sorted.

The largest element is extracted by reading through b  e.g., x=∗b  and then doing a pop_heap  . A new element is inserted by writing through e  e.g., ∗e=x  and then doing a push_heap  . For example:  string s = "herewego"; make_heap s.begin  ,s.end   ;  pop_heap s.begin  ,s.end   ;  pop_heap s.begin  ,s.end  −1 ;  pop_heap s.begin  ,s.end  −2 ;   ∗ s.end  −3 ='f'; push_heap s.begin  ,s.end  −2 ;  ∗ s.end  −2 ='x'; push_heap s.begin  ,s.end  −1 ;  ∗ s.end  −1 ='y'; push_heap s.begin  ,s.end   ;  sort_heap s.begin  ,s.end   ; reverse s.begin  ,s.end   ;      rogheeew    rogheeew    ohgeeerw    hegeeorw     hegeefrw     xeheefge     yxheefge    eeefghxy    yxhgfeee  The way to understand the changes to s is that a user reads only s[0] and writes only s[x] where x is the index of the current end of the heap. The heap removes an element  always s[0]  by swapping it with s[x].  The point of a heap is to provide fast addition of elements and fast access to the element with  the highest value.  The main use of heaps is to implement priority queues.  32.6.5 lexicographical_compare   A lexicographical compare is the rule we use to order words in dictionaries.  Lexicographical Compare  §iso.25.4.8   lexicographical_compare b,e ,b2,e2  lexicographical_compare b,e ,b2,e2,f   Is [b:e <[b2:e2 ? Is [b:e <[b2:e2 , using f for element comparison?  We might implement lexicographical_compare b,e ,b2,e2  like this:  template  bool lexicographical_compare In ﬁrst, In last, In2 ﬁrst2, In2 last2  {  for  ; ﬁrst!=last && ﬁrst2!=last2; ++ﬁrst,++last  {  if  ∗ﬁrst<∗ﬁrst2  return true; if  ∗ﬁrst2<∗ﬁrst  return false;     [ﬁrst:last <[ﬁrst2:last2      [ﬁrst2:last2 <[ﬁrst:last   } return ﬁrst==last && ﬁrst2!=last2;      [ﬁrst:last <[ﬁrst2:last2  if [ﬁrst:last  is shorter  }  That is, a string compares as a sequence of characters. For example:   950   STL Algorithms   Chapter 32  string n1 {"10000"}; string n2 {"999"};  bool b1 = lexicographical_compare n1.begin  ,n1.end  ,n2.begin  ,n2.end   ;      b1 == true  n1 = "Zebra"; n2 = "Aardvark"; bool b2 = lexicographical_compare n1.begin  ,n1.end  ,n2.begin  ,n2.end   ;      b2 == false  32.7  Min and Max Value comparisons are useful in many contexts:  x=min a,b   x=min a,b,f   x=min {elem}   x=min {elem},f    x=max a,b   x=max a,b,f   x=max {elem}   x=max {elem},f    The min and max Family  §iso.25.4.7  x is the smaller of a and b x is the smaller of a and b, using f for comparison x is the smallest element in {elem} x is the smallest element in {elem}, using f for the element comparison x is the larger of a and b x is the larger of a and b, using f for comparison x is the largest element in {elem} x is the largest element in {elem}, using f for the element comparison x is min a,b  and y is max a,b  x is min a,b,f  and y is max a,b,f  x is min {elem}  and y is max {elem}  x is min {elem},f  and y is max {elem},f  p points to the smallest element of [b:e  or e p points to the smallest element of [b:e  or e, using f for the element comparison p points to the largest element of [b:e  or e p points to the largest element of [b:e  or e, using f for the element comparison x is min_element b,e  and y is max_element b,e  x is min_element b,e,f  and y is max_element b,e,f   pair x,y =minmax a,b   pair x,y =minmax a,b,f   pair x,y =minmax {elem}   pair x,y =minmax {elem},f   p=min_element b,e   p=min_element b,e,f   p=max_element b,e   p=max_element b,e,f   pair x,y =minmax_element b,e   pair x,y =minmax_element b,e,f   If we compare two lvalues, the result is a reference to the result; otherwise, an rvalue is returned. Unfortunately, the versions that take lvalues take const lvalues, so you can never modify the result of one of these functions. For example:  int x = 7; int y = 9;   Section 32.7  Min and Max  951  ++min x,y ;  ++min {x,y} ;      the result of min x,y  is a const int&    error :the result of min {x,y}  is an rvalue  an initializer_list is immutable   The _element functions return iterators and the minmax function returns pairs, so we can write:  string s = "Large_Hadron_Collider"; auto p = minmax_element s.begin  ,s.end  ,  cout << "min==" << ∗ p.ﬁrst  << ' ' << "max==" << ∗ p.second  << '\n'; With the ACSII character set on my machine, this little test produces:  [] char c1,char c2  { return toupper c1 <toupper c2 ; } ;  min==a max==_  32.8  Advice [1]  An STL algorithm operates on one or more sequences; §32.2.

The STL consists of the iterator, container, algorithm, and function object parts of the standard library. The rest of the STL is presented in Chapter 31 and Chapter 32.  Iterators are the glue that ties standard-library algorithms to their data. Conversely, you can say that iterators are the mechanism used to minimize an algorithm’s dependence on the data structures on which it operates:   954   STL Iterators   Chapter 33  sor t    ﬁnd    merge    ...  my_algo    your_fct    Iterators  vector  map  list  ...  my_container  your_container  33.1.1  Iterator Model An iterator is akin to a pointer in that it provides operations for indirect access  e.g., ∗ for derefer- encing   and  for  moving  to  point  to  a  new element   e.g., ++ for  moving  to  the  next  element . A sequence is deﬁned by a pair of iterators deﬁning a half-open range [begin:end :  iterators:  begin  elements:  end  That is, begin points to the ﬁrst element of the sequence, and end points to the one-beyond-the-last element  of  the  sequence. Never read  from  or  write  to ∗end. Note  that  the  empty  sequence  has begin==end; that is, [p:p  is the empty sequence for any iterator p.  To read a sequence, an algorithm usually takes a pair of iterators  b,e  and iterates using ++ until  the end is reached:  while  b!=e  {     use != rather than <     do something ++b;      go to next element  }  The reason to use != rather than < for testing whether we have reached the end is partially because that is the more precise statement of what we are testing for and partially because only random- access iterators support <.  Algorithms that search for something in a sequence usually return the end of the sequence to  indicate ‘‘not found’’; for example:  auto p = ﬁnd v.begin  ,v.end  ,x ;      look for x in v  if  p!=v.end    {     xfound at p  } else {  }     xnot found in [v.begin  :v.end      Section 33.1.1  Iterator Model  955  Algorithms that write to a sequence often are given only an iterator to its ﬁrst element. In that case, it is the programmer’s responsibility not to write beyond the end of that sequence. For example:  template  void forward Iter p, int n  {  while  n>0   ∗p++ = −−n;  void user   {  }  }  vector  v 10 ; forward v.begin  ,v.siz e   ; forward v.begin  ,1000 ;      OK    big trouble  Some standard-library implementations range check – that is, throw an exception for that last call of forward   – but you can’t rely on that for portable code: many implementations don’t check.  For a simple and safe alternative use an insert iterator  §33.2.2 .  33.1.2  Iterator Categories The standard library provides ﬁve kinds of iterators  ﬁve iterator categories :   cid:129   Input iterator: We can iterate forward using ++ and read each element  repeatedly  using ∗. We  can  compare  input  iterators  using == and !=. This  is  the  kind  of  iterator  that istream offers; see §38.5.   cid:129  Output  iterator: We can  iterate  forward  using ++ and  write  an  element  once  only  using ∗.  This is the kind of iterator that ostream offers; see §38.5.   cid:129  Forward iterator: We can iterate forward repeatedly using ++ and read and write  unless the elements  are const  elements  repeatedly  using ∗. If a forward  iterator  points  to  a  class object, we can use −> to refer to a member. We can compare forward iterators using == and !=. This is the kind of iterator forward_list offers  §31.4 .   cid:129  Bidirectional iterator: We can iterate forward  using ++  and backward  using −−  and read and write  unless the elements are const  elements repeatedly using ∗. If a bidirectional iter- ator points to a class object, we can use −> to refer to a member. We can compare bidirec- tional  iterators  using == and !=. This  is  the  kind  of  iterator  that list, map, and set offer  §31.4 .   cid:129  Random-access iterator: We can iterate forward  using ++ or +=  and backward  using − or −=  and read and write  unless the elements are const  elements repeatedly using ∗ or []. If a random-access iterator points to a class object, we can use −> to refer to a member. We can subscript a random-access iterator using [], add an integer using +, and subtract an integer using −. We can  ﬁnd  the  distance  between  two random-access  iterators  to  the  same sequence by subtracting one from the other. We can compare random-access iterators using ==, !=,  , and >=. This is the kind of iterator that vector offers  §31.4 .  Logically, these iterators are organized in a hierarchy  §iso.24.2 :   956   STL Iterators   Chapter 33  Iterator ∗, ++  Input Iterator  ==, !=, single read, −>  Output Iterator  single write  Forward Iterator  repeated read and write  Bidirectional Iterator  −−  Random-access Iterator [], +, +=, −, −=,  , >=  The iterator categories are concepts  §24.3  rather than classes, so this hierarchy is not a class hier- archy implemented  using  derivation.  If you  need  to  do  something  advanced  with  iterator  cate- gories, use iterator_traits  directly or indirectly .  33.1.3  Iterator Traits In  , the standard library provides a set of type functions that allow us to write code spe- cialized for speciﬁc properties of an iterator:  iterator_traits  iterator_traits  iterator  input_iterator_tag output_iterator_tag forward_iterator_tag  bidirectional_iterator_tag  random_access_iterator_tag  Iterator Traits  §iso.24.4.1  Traits type for a non-pointer Iter Traits type for a pointer T∗ Simple class deﬁning the basic iterator member types Category for input iterators Category for output iterators Category for forward iterators; derived from input_iterator_tag; provided for forward_list, unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, and unordered_multimap Category for bidirectional iterators; derived from forward_iterator_tag; provided for list, set, multiset, map, multimap Category for random-access iterators; derived from bidirectional_iterator_tag; provided for vector, deque, array, built-in arrays, and string   Section 33.1.3  Iterator Traits   957  The iterator tags are types used to select among algorithms based on the type of an iterator. For example, a random-access iterator can go directly to an element:  template  void advance_helper Iter p, int n, random_access_iterator_tag  {  p+=n;  On the other hand, a forward iterator must get to the nth element by moving one step at a time  e.g., following links on a list :  template  void advance_helper Iter p, int n, forward_iterator_tag  {  if  0<n   while  n−−  ++p;  else if  n<0   while  n++  −−p;  Given these helpers, advance   can consistently use the optimal algorithm:  template  void advance Iter p, int n  {     use the optimal algorithm  advance_helper p,n,typename iterator_traits ::iterator_category{} ;  Typically, advance   and or advance_helper   will be inlined to ensure that no run-time overhead is introduced by this tag dispatch technique.  Variants of this technique are pervasive in the STL.  The key properties of an iterator are described by the aliases in iterator_traits:  template  struct iterator_traits {  using value_type = typename Iter::value_type; using difference_type = typename Iter::difference_type; using pointer = typename Iter::pointer; using reference = typename Iter::reference;  using iterator_category = typename Iter::iterator_category;      pointer type    reference type     tag   For an iterator that does not have these member types  e.g., an int∗ , we provide a specialization of iterator_traits:  template  struct iterator_traits  {       specialization for pointers  using difference_type = ptrdiff_t; using value_type = T; using pointer = T∗; using reference = T& reference; using iterator_category = random_access_iterator_tag;  }  }  }  };  };   958   STL Iterators   We cannot in general say:  template  typename Iter::value_type read Iter p, int n  {     ... do some checking ... return p[n];     not general  Chapter 33  {  {  }  This is an error waiting to happen. Calling this read   with a pointer argument would be an error. The compiler would catch it, but the error messages might be voluminous and obscure. Instead, we can write:  template  typename iterator_traits ::value_type read Iter p, int n  {     more general     ... do some checking ... return p[n];  The idea is that to ﬁnd a property of an iterator, you look in its iterator_traits  §28.2.4 , rather than at the iterator itself. To avoid directly referring to the iterator_traits, which after all is just an imple- mentation detail, we can deﬁne an alias. For example:  template  using Category  = typename std::iterator_traits ::iterator_category;  template  using Difference_type  = typename std::iterator_traits ::difference_type;  So,  if  we  want  to  know the  type  of  the  difference  between  two iterators   pointing  to  the  same sequence , we have some choices:  tempate  void f Iter p, Iter q  {  Iter::difference_type d1 = distance p,q ;     syntax error:‘‘typename’’missing  typename Iter::difference_type d2 = distance p,q ;    doesn’t wor kforpointers,etc.  typename iterator_traits ::distance_type d3 = distance p,q ; Distance_type  d4 = distance p,q ;     OK, but ugly    OK, much better  auto d5 = distance p,q ;    ...     OK, if you don’t need to mention the type explicitly  I recommend the last two alternatives.  The iterator template simply bundles the key properties of an iterator into a struct for the con-  venience of iterator implementers and provides a few defaults:   Section 33.1.3  Iterator Traits   959  template  struct iterator {  using value_type = T; using difference_type = Dist ; using pointer = Ptr; using reference = Ref; using iterator_category = Cat;      type used bydistance      pointer type    reference type    categor y tag   };  33.1.4  Iterator Operations Depending on its category  §33.1.2 , an iterator provides some or all of these operations:  Iterator Operations  §iso.24.2.2   Pre-increment  advance one element : make p refer to the next element or to the one-beyond-the-last element; the resulting value is the incremented value Post-increment  advance one element : make p refer to the next element or to the one-beyond-the-last element; the resulting value is p’s value before the increment Access  dereference : ∗p refers to the element pointed to by p Pre-decrement  go back one element : make p point to the previous element; the resulting value is the decremented value Post-decrement  go back one element : make p point to the previous element; the resulting value is p’s value before the decrement Access  subscripting : p[n] refers to the element pointed to by p+n; equivalent to ∗ p+n  Access  member access : equivalent to  ∗p .m Equality: Do p and q point to the same element or do both point to the one-beyond-the-last element? Inequality: ! p==q  Does p point to an element before the one q points to? p<q  p==q Does p point to an element after the one q points to? p>q  p==q Advance n: make p point to the nth element after the one to which it points Advance −n: make p point to the nth element before the one to which it points q points to the nth element after the one p points to q points to the nth element before the one p points to  ++p  p++  ∗p −−p  p−−  p[n]  p−>n p==q  p!=q p<q p<=q  p>q p>=q  p+=n p−=n q=p+n  q=p−n   A ++p returns a reference to p, whereas p++ must return a copy of p holding the old value.  Thus, for more complicated iterators, ++p is likely to be more efﬁcient than p++.  The following operations work for every iterator for which they can be implemented, but they  may work more efﬁciently for random-access iterators  see §33.1.2 :   960   STL Iterators   Chapter 33  advance p  x=distance p,q  q=next p,n  q=next p   q=prev p,n  q=prev p    Iterator Operations  §iso.24.4.4  Like p+=n; p must be at least an input iterator Like x=q−p; p must be at least an input iterator Like q=p+n; p must be at least a forward iterator q=next p,1  Like q=p−n; p must be at least a bidirectional iterator q=prev p,1   In each case, if p is not a random-access iterator, the algorithm will take n steps.  33.2  Iterator Adaptors In  , the standard library provides adaptors to generate useful related iterator types from a given iterator type:  reverse_iterator back_inser t_iterator front_inser t_iterator inser t_iterator move_iterator raw_storage_iterator Write to uninitialized storage  Iterator Adaptors Iterate backward  Insert at end Insert at beginning  Insert anywhere  Move rather than copy  §33.2.1 §33.2.2 §33.2.2 §33.2.2 §33.2.3 §34.6.2.  Iterators for iostreams are described in §38.5.  33.2.1  Reverse Iterator Using an iterator we can traverse a sequence [b:e  from b to e. If the sequence allows bidirectional access, we can also traverse the sequence in reverse order, from e to b. An iterator that does that is called  a reverse_iterator. A reverse_iterator iterates  from  the  end  of  the  sequence  deﬁned  by  its underlying iterator to the beginning of that sequence. To  get a half-open sequence, we must con- sider b−1 as one past the end and e−1 as the start of the sequence: [e−1,b−1 .  Thus, the fundamental relation between a reverse iterator and its corresponding iterator is &∗ reverse_iterator p  ==&∗ p−1 . In particular, if v is a vector, v.rbegin   points to its last element, v[v.siz e  −1]. Consider:  begin    end    A  B  C  This sequence can be viewed like this using a reverse_iterator:   Section 33.2.1  Reverse Iterator  961  rbegin    rend    C  B  A  The deﬁnition of reverse_iterator looks something like this:  template  class reverse_iterator  : public iterator ,  Value_type , Difference_type , Pointer , Reference > {  public:  using iterator_type = Iter;  reverse_iterator  : current{} { } explicit reverse_iterator Iter p : current{p} { } template   reverse_iterator const reverse_iterator & p  :current p.base    { }  Iter base   const { return current; }    current iterator value  reference operator∗   const { tmp = current; return ∗−−tmp; } pointer operator−>   const; reference operator[] difference_type n  const;  reverse_iterator& operator++   { −−current; return ∗this; } reverse_iterator operator++ int  { reverse_iterator t = current; −−current; return t; } reverse_iterator& operator−−   { ++current; return ∗this; } reverse_iterator operator−− int  { reverse_iterator t = current; ++current; return t; }     note: not ++     note: not −−  reverse_iterator operator+ difference_type n  const; reverse_iterator& operator+= difference_type n ; reverse_iterator operator− difference_type n  const; reverse_iterator& operator−= difference_type n ;    ...  protected:  private:     ... iterator tmp;  };  Iterator current;     current points to the element after the one *this refers to     fortemporar iesthat need to outliveafunction scope  A reverse_iterator  has the same member types and operations as Iter. In particular, if Iter is a random-access operator, its reverse_iterator  has [], +, and <. For example:   962   STL Iterators   Chapter 33  void f vector & v, list & lst  {  v.rbegin  [3] = 7; lst.rbegin  [3] = '4'; ∗ next lst.rbegin  ,3   = '4';     OK: random-access iterator    error :bidirectional iterator doesn’t support[]    OK!  }  }  }  }  I use next   to move the iterator because  like []  + wouldn’t work for a bidirectional iterator, such as list ::iterator.  Reverse iterators allow us to use algorithms in a way that views a sequence in the reverse order. For example,  to  ﬁnd  the  last  occurrence  of  an  element  in  a  sequence,  we  can  apply ﬁnd   to  its reverse sequence:  auto ri = ﬁnd v.rbegin  ,v.rend  ,val ;      last occurrence  Note that C::reverse_iterator is not the same type as C::iterator. So, if I wanted to write a ﬁnd_last   algorithm using a reverse sequence, I would have to decide which type of iterator to return:  template  auto ﬁnd_last C& c, Val v  −> decltype c.begin     {  auto ri = ﬁnd c.rbegin  ,c.rend  ,v ; if  ri == c.rend    return c.end  ; return prev ri.base   ;     use C’siterator in the interface     use c.end   to indicate "not found"  For a reverse_iterator, ri.base   returns an iterator pointing one beyond the position pointed to by ri. So,  to  get  an  iterator  pointing  to  the  same  element  as  the  reverse  iterator ri, I hav e to  return ri.base  −1. Howev er,  my container may be a list that does not support − for its iterators, so I use prev   instead.  A rev erse iterator is a perfectly ordinary iterator, so I could write the loop explicitly:  template  auto ﬁnd_last C& c, Val v  −> decltype c.begin    {  for  auto p = c.rbegin  ; p!=c.rend  ; ++p      viewsequence in reverse order  if  ∗p==v  return −−p.base  ;  return c.end  ;     use c.end   to indicate "not found"  The equivalent code searching backward using a  forward  iterator is:  template  auto ﬁnd_last C& c, Val v  −> decltype c.begin    {  for  auto p = c.end  ; p!=c.begin  ;       search backward from end  if  ∗−−p==v  return p;  return c.end  ;     use c.end   to indicate "not found"  As for the earlier deﬁnitions of ﬁnd_last  , this version requires at least a bidirectional iterator.   Section 33.2.2  Insert Iterators  963  33.2.2  Insert Iterators Producing  output  through  an  iterator  into  a  container  implies  that  elements  following  the  one pointed to by the iterator can be overwritten.  This implies the possibility of overﬂow and conse- quent memory corruption. For example:  void f vector & vi  {  ﬁll_n vi.begin  ,200,7 ;      assign 7 to vi[0]..[199]  }  }  If vi has fewer than 200 elements, we are in trouble.  In  , the standard library provides a solution in the form of an inserter: when written to, an inserter inserts a new element into a sequence rather than overwriting an existing element. For example:  void g vector & vi  {  ﬁll_n back_inser ter vi ,200,7 ;     add 200 7s to the end of vi  When writing to an element through an insert iterator, the iterator inserts its value rather than over- writing the element pointed to. So, a container grows by one element each time a value is written to it through an insert iterator. Inserters are as simple and efﬁcient as they are useful.  There are three insert iterators:  cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   insert_iterator inserts before the element pointed to using insert  . front_inser t_iterator inserts before the ﬁrst element of a sequence using push_front  . back_inser t_iterator inserts after the last element of the sequence using push_back  .  An inserter is usually constructed by a call to a helper function:  Inserter Construction Functions  §iso.24.5.2   ii=inserter c,p  ii=back_inser ter c  ii=front_inser ter c   ii is an insert_iterator pointing to p in container c ii is a back_inser t_iterator pointing to back   in container c ii is a front_inser t_iterator pointing to front   in container c  The iterator passed to inserter   must be an iterator into the container. For a sequence container, that implies that it must be a bidirectional iterator  so that you can insert before it . For example, you can’t use inserter   to  make an iterator  to  insert  into  a forward_list. For  an  associative  container, where that iterator is only used as a hint for where to insert, a forward iterator  e.g., as provided by an unordered_set  can be acceptable. An inserter is an output iterator:  insert_iterator  Operations  §iso.24.5.2   continues   insert_iterator p {c,q}; insert_iterator p {q}; p=q p=move q   Inserter for container c pointing to ∗q; q must point into c Copy constructor: p is a copy of q Copy assignment: p is a copy of q Move assignment: p points to what q pointed to   964   STL Iterators   Chapter 33  insert_iterator  Operations  continued   §iso.24.5.2   ++p p++ ∗p=x ∗p++=x  Make p point to the next element; the value is p’s new value Make p point to the next element; the value is p’s old value Insert x before p Insert x before p, then increment p  The front_inser t_iterator and back_inser t_iterator differ  in  that  their  constructors  don’t require  an iterator. For example:  vector  v; back_inser t_iterator  p;  You cannot read through an inserter.  33.2.3  Move Iterator A move iterator is an iterator where reading from the pointed-to element moves rather than copies. We usually make a move iterator from another iterator using a helper function:  Move Iterator Construction Function  mp=make_move_iterator p   mp is a move_iterator pointing to the same element as p;  p must be an input iterator  A move iterator has the same operations as the iterator from which it is made. For example, we can do −−p if the move iterator p was made from a bidirectional iterator. A move iterator’s operator∗   simply returns an rvalue reference  §7.7.2  to the element pointed to: std::move q . For example:  vector  read_strings istream& ; auto vs = read_strings cin ;     get some strings  vector  vs2; copy vs,back_inser ter vs2  ;     copystr ingsfrom vs into vs2  vector  vs3; copy vs2,make_move_iterator back_inser ter vs3   ;     move str ingsfrom vs2 into vs3  This assumes that a container version of std::copy   has been deﬁned.  33.3  Range Access Functions In  , the standard library provides a nonmember begin   and end   functions for containers:  begin   and end    §iso.24.6.5   p=begin c   p=end c    p is an iterator for the ﬁrst element of c; c is a built-in array or has c.begin   p is an iterator for the one-past-the-end of c; c is a built-in array or has c.end    These functions are very simple:   Section 33.3  Range Access Functions  965  These functions are used by the range-for-statement  §9.5.1  but can of course also be used directly by users. For example:  template   template   auto begin C& c  −> decltype c.begin   ;  auto begin const C& c  −> decltype c.begin   ;  template   auto end C& c  −> decltype c.end   ;  template   auto end const C& c  −> decltype c.end   ;  template    auto begin T  &array [N]  −> T∗;  template   auto end T  &array [N]  −> T∗;     forbuilt-in arrays  template  void print Cont& c  {  for auto p=begin c ; p!=end c ; ++p   cout << ∗p << '\n';  void f   {  vector  v {1,2,3,4,5}; print v ;  int a[] {1,2,3,4,5}; print a ;  Had I said c.begin   and c.end  , the call print a  would have failed.  A user-deﬁned container with member begin   and end   automatically gets nonmember versions when   is included.  To provide nonmember begin   and end   for a container, My_container, that doesn’t hav e them, I have to write something like:  template  Iterator > begin My_container & c  {  return Iterator >{&c[0]};     iterator to ﬁrst element  template  Iterator > end My_container & c  {  return Iterator >{&c[0]+c.size  };      iterator to last element  }  }  }  }   966   STL Iterators   Chapter 33  Here, I assume that passing the address of the ﬁrst element is a way to create an iterator to the ﬁrst element of My_container and that My_container has a size  .  33.4  Function Objects Many of the  standard  algorithms  take function  objects   or  functions   as  arguments  to  control  the way they work.  Common uses are comparison criteria, predicates  functions returning bool , and arithmetic  operations. In  , the  standard  library  supplies  a  few common  function objects:  Predicates  §iso.20.8.5, §iso.20.8.6, §iso.20.8.7   p=equal_to  x,y   p=not_equal_to  x,y   p=greater  x,y   p=less  x,y   p=greater_equal  x,y   p=less_equal  x,y   p=logical_and  x,y   p=logical_or  x,y   p=logical_not  x   p=bit_and  x,y   p=bit_or  x,y   p=bit_xor  x,y    p x,y  means x==y when x and y are of type T p x,y  means x!=y when x and y are of type T p x,y  means x>y when x and y are of type T p x,y  means x<y when x and y are of type T p x,y  means x>=y when x and y are of type T p x,y  means x<=y when x and y are of type T p x,y  means x&&y when x and y are of type T p x,y  means xy when x and y are of type T p x  means !x when x is of type T p x,y  means x&y when x and y are of type T p x,y  means xy when x and y are of type T p x,y  means xˆy when x and y are of type T  For example:  vector  v;    ... sort v.begin  ,v.end  ,greater {} ;      sor tvinto decreasing order  Such predicates are roughly equivalent to simple lambdas. For example:  vector  v;    ... sort v.begin  ,v.end  ,[] int a, int b  { return a>b; } ;     sor tvinto decreasing order  Note that logical_and and logical_or always evaluate both their arguments  && and  do not .  Arithmetic Operations  §iso.20.8.4   f=plus  x,y   f=minus  x,y   f=multiplies  x,y   f=divides  x,y   f=modulus  x,y   f=negate  x    f x,y  means x+y when x and y are of type T f x,y  means x−y when x and y are of type T f x,y  means x∗y when x and y are of type T f x,y  means x y when x and y are of type T f x,y  means x%y when x and y are of type T f x  means −x when x is of type T   Section 33.5  Function Adaptors  967  33.5  Function Adaptors A function adaptor takes a function as argument and returns a function object that can be used to invoke the original function.  g=bind f,args    g=mem_fn f    g=not1 f   g=not2 f    Adaptors  §iso.20.8.9, §iso.20.8.10, §iso.20.8.8  g args2  is equivalent to f args3  where args3 is obtained by replacing placeholders in args with arguments from args2 for the use of placeholders, such as _1, _2, and _3 g p,args  means p−>f args  if p is a pointer and p.mf args  if p is not; args is a  possibly empty  list of arguments g x  means !f x  g x,y  means !f x,y   The bind   and mem_fn   adaptors do argument binding, also called Currying or partial evaluation. These binders, and their deprecated predecessors  such as bind1st  , mem_fun  , and mem_fun_ref   , were  heavily  used  in  the  past,  but  most  uses  seem  to  be  more  easily  expressed  using  lambdas  §11.4 .  33.5.1 bind   Given a function and a set of arguments, bind   produces a function object that can be called with ‘‘the remaining’’ arguments, if any, of the function. For example:  double cube double ;  auto cube2 = bind cube,2 ;  A call cube2   will invoke cube with the argument 2, that is, cube 2 . We don’t hav e to bind every argument of a function. For example:  using namespace placeholders;  void f int,const string& ; auto g = bind f,2,_1 ;  f 2,"hello" ; g "hello" ;      bind f  ’sﬁrst argument to 2     also calls f 2,"hello" ;  The curious _1 argument to the binder is a placeholder telling bind   where arguments to the result- ing function object should go. In this case, g  ’s  ﬁrst  argument is used as f  ’s second argument.  The placeholders are found in the  sub namespace std::placeholders that is part of  .  The placeholder mechanism is very ﬂexible.  Consider:  f 2,"hello" ; bind f  2,"hello" ;  bind f,_1,_2  2,"hello" ;  bind f,_2,_1  "hello",2 ;      also calls f 2,"hello" ;    also calls f 2,"hello" ;    reverse order of arguments: also calls f 2,"hello" ;  auto g = [] const string& s, int i  { f i,s ; }    reverse order of arguments g "hello",2 ;      also calls f 2,"hello" ;   968   STL Iterators   Chapter 33  To  bind  arguments  for  an  overloaded  function,  we  have  to explicitly  state  which  version  of  the function we want to bind:  int pow int,int ; double pow double ,double ;      pow   is overloaded  auto pow2 = bind pow,_1,2 ;  auto pow2 = bind  double ∗  double ,double  pow,_1,2 ;     OK  but ugly      error :which pow  ?  Note that bind   takes ordinary expressions as arguments.  This implies that references are derefer- enced before bind   gets to see them. For example:  void incr int& i  {  ++i;  void user   {  }  }  }  int i = 1; incr i ;  auto inc = bind incr,_1 ; inc i ;      ibecomes 2     istays 2; inc i  incremented a local copyofi  To deal with that, the standard library provides yet another pair of adaptors:  reference_wrapper   §iso.20.8.3   r=ref t   r=cref t    r is a reference_wrapper for T& t; noexcept r is a reference_wrapper for a const T& t; noexcept  This solves the ‘‘reference problem’’ for bind  :  void user   {  int i = 1; incr i ;  auto inc = bind incr,_1 ; inc ref i  ;      ibecomes 2     ibecomes 3  This ref   is needed to pass references as arguments to threads because thread constructors are vari- adic templates  §42.2.2 .  So far, I either used the result of bind   immediately or assigned it to a variable declared using auto. This saves me the bother of specifying the return type of a call of bind  . That can be useful because the return type of bind   varies with the type of function to be called and the argument val- ues stored. In particular, the returned function object is larger when it has to hold values of bound parameters.  However, we sometimes want to be speciﬁc about the types of the arguments required and the type of result returned. If so, we can specify them for a function  §33.5.3 .   Section 33.5.2  mem_fn    969  33.5.2 mem_fn   The  function  adaptor mem_fn mf  produces  a  function  object  that  can  be  called  as  a  nonmember function.  For example: void user Shape∗ p  {  p−>draw  ; auto draw = mem_fn &Shape::draw ; draw p ;  The major use of mem_fn   is when an algorithm requires an operation to be called as a nonmember function.  For example:  void draw_all vector & v  {  for_each v.begin  ,v.end  ,mem_fn &Shape::draw  ;  Thus, mem_fn   can be seen as a mapping from the object-oriented calling style to the functional one.  Often, lambdas provide a simple and general alternative to binders.  For example: void draw_all vector & v  {  for_each v.begin  ,v.end  ,[] Shape∗ p  { p−>draw  ; } ;  }  }  }  33.5.3 function A bind   can be used directly, and it can be used to initialize an auto variable.  In that, bind   resem- bles a lambda.  If we want to assign the result of bind   to a variable with a speciﬁc type, we can use the stan- dard-library type function. A function is speciﬁed with a speciﬁc return type and a speciﬁc argu- ment type.  function f {}; function f {nullptr};  function f {g};  function   §iso.20.8.11.2   continues  f is an empty function; noexcept f is an empty function; noexcept f is a function holding g; g can be anything that can be invoked with f’s argument types f is an empty function; use allocator a; noexcept f is an empty function; use allocator a; noexcept f is a function holding g; use allocator a; noexcept f2 is a copy of f f becomes empty  function f {allocator_arg_t,a};  function f {allocator_arg_t,a,nullptr_t};  function f {allocator_arg_t,a,g};  f2=f  f=nullptr    970   STL Iterators   Chapter 33  function   continued  §iso.20.8.11.2   f.swap f2   f.assign f2,a   bool b {f};  r=f args   ti=f.target_type     p=f.target     f==nullptr nullptr==f  f!=nullptr  nullptr!=f  swap f,f2    Swap the contents of f and f2; f and f2 must be of the same function type; noexcept f gets a copy of f2 and the allocator a conversion of f to bool; b is true if f is nonempty; explicit; noexcept Invoke the contained function with args; the argument types must match f’s ti is the type_info for f; if f doesn’t contain something callable ti==typid void ; noexcept If f.target_type  ==typeid F , p points to the contained object, otherwise, p==nullptr; noexcept Is f empty? noexcept f==nullptr ! f==nullptr  ! f==nullptr  f.swap f2   int f double ; function  fct {f}; int g int ;     initializetof  For example:  void user   {  fct = [] double d  { return round d ; }; fct = f; fct = g;     assign lambda to fct    assign function to fct    error :incorrect returntype  }  };  The target functions are provided for the rare cases where someone wants to examine a function, rather than simply call it as usually intended.  The standard-library function is a type that can hold any object you can invoke  using the call operator     §2.2.1, §3.4.3, §11.4, §19.2.2 . That is, an object of type function is a function object. For example:  int round double x  { return static_cast  ﬂoor x+0.5  ; }     conventional 4 5 rounding  function  f;     fcan hold anything that can be called with a double and returnanint  enum class Round_style { truncate, round };  struct Round {     function object carrying a state  Round_style s; Round Round_style ss  :s ss  { } int operator   double x  const { return  s==Round_style::round  ?  x+0.5  : x; };   Section 33.5.3  function  971  void t1   {  f = round; cout << f 7.6  << '\n';     call through f to the function round  f = Round Round_style::truncate ; cout << f 7.6  << '\n';     call the function object  Round_style style = Round_style::round; f = [style]  double x { return  style==Round_style::round  ? x+0.5 : x; };  cout << f 7.6  << '\n';     call the lambda  vector  v {7.6}; f = Round Round_style::round ; std::transform v.begin  ,v.end  ,v.begin  ,f ;   cout << v[0] << '\n';  }  We get 8, 8, 7, and 8.     pass to algorithm     transfor medby the lambda  Obviously, functions are useful for callbacks, for passing operations as arguments, etc.  33.6  Advice [1]  An input sequence is deﬁned by a pair of iterators; §33.1.1.

This chapter presents facilities that are more specialized or deal with raw memory  as opposed to typed objects .  34.2  ‘‘Almost Containers’’ The  standard  library  provides  several  containers  that  don’t ﬁt perfectly  into  the  STL  framework  §31.4, §32.2, §33.1 . Examples are built-in arrays, array, and string. I sometimes refer to those as   974  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  ‘‘almost containers’’  §31.4 , but that is not quite fair: they hold elements, so they are containers, but each  has  restrictions  or  added  facilities  that  make them  awkward  in  the  context  of  the  STL. Describing them separately also simpliﬁes the description of the STL.  ‘‘ Almost Containers’’  T[N]  array   bitset  vector  pair  tuple  basic_string  valarray   Built-in array: a ﬁxed-size continuously allocated sequence of N elements of type T; implicitly converts to a T∗ A ﬁxed-size continuously allocated sequence of N elements of type T; like the built-in array, but with most problems solved A ﬁxed-size sequence of N bits A sequence of bits compactly stored in a specialization of vector Tw o elements of types T and U A sequence of an arbitrary number of elements of arbitrary types A sequence of characters of type C; provides string operations An array of numeric values of type T; provides numeric operations  Why does  the  standard  library  provide  so  many containers?  They serve common  but  different  often overlapping  needs. If the standard library didn’t provide them, many people would have to design and implement their own.  For example:   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   pair and tuple are heterogeneous; all other containers are homogeneous  all elements are of the same type . array, vector, and tuple elements are contiguously allocated; forward_list and map are linked structures. bitset and vector  hold bits and access them through proxy objects; all other standard- library containers can hold a variety of types and access elements directly. basic_string requires its elements to be some form of character and to provide string manip- ulation,  such  as  concatenation  and  locale-sensitive  operations   Chapter  39   and valarray requires its elements to be numbers and to provide numerical operations.  All of these containers can be seen as providing specialized services needed by large communities of programmers. No single container could serve all of these needs because some needs are contra- dictory, for  example,  ‘‘ability  to  grow’’ vs.  ‘‘guaranteed  to  be  allocated  in  a  ﬁxed  location,’’  and ‘‘elements do not move when elements are added’’ vs. ‘‘contiguously allocated.’’  Furthermore, a very general container would imply overhead deemed unacceptable for individual containers.  34.2.1 array An array, deﬁned in  , is a ﬁxed-size sequence of elements of a given type where the number of elements is speciﬁed at compile time. Thus, an array can be allocated with its elements on the stack, in an object, or in static storage. The elements are allocated in the scope where the array is deﬁned.  An array is  best  understood  as  a  built-in  array  with  its  size  ﬁrmly  attached,  without implicit, potentially surprising conversions to pointer types, and with a few convenience functions provided.  There is  no  overhead   time  or  space   involved  in  using  an array compared  to  using  a built-in  array. An array does not follow the  ‘‘handle  to  elements’’ model  of  STL  containers. Instead, an array directly contains its elements:   Section 34.2.1  array  975  template   struct array {  *     an array ofNTs §iso.23.3.2   types and operations likevector’s §31.4 , except operations that change the container size,constructors,and assign   functions  void ﬁll const T& v ;   assign N copies of v void swap array&  noexcept noexcept swap declval   , declval      ;  T __elem[N];      implementation detail  No ‘‘management information’’  e.g., a size  is stored in an array. This implies that moving  §17.5  an array is no more efﬁcient than copying it  unless the array’s  elements are resource handles with efﬁcient moves .  An array does not have a constructor or an allocator  because it does not directly allocate anything .  The number of elements and subscript values for array are of an unsigned type  size_t , just like vector’s, but different from the built-in array’s.  So, array  might be accepted by an inatten- tive compiler. Hope for a warning.  An array can be initialized by an initializer list:  array  a1 = { 1, 2, 3 };  The  number  of  elements  in  the  initializer  must  be  equal  to  or  less  than  the  number  of  elements speciﬁed for the array. As usual, if the initializer list provides values for some but not all elements, the remainder is initialized with the appropriate default value.  For example:  void f   {  array  aa = {"Churchill", "Clare"};     The last two elements will be empty strings.  The element count is not optional:  array  ax = { 1, 2, 3 };    error sizenot speciﬁed  The element count must be a constant expression:  int  a0;  void f int n  {  To sav e us from a special case, the number of elements can be zero:  array  aa = {"John's", "Queens' "};        error :sizenot a constant expression  If you need the element count to be variable, use vector. On the other hand, since array’s  element count is known at compile time, array’s size   is a constexpr function.  *   };  }  }   976  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  There is no constructor for array that copies an argument value  as there is for vector; §31.3.2 .  Instead, a ﬁll   operation is provided:  void f   {  array  aa; aa.ﬁll 99 ;     ...     uninitialized, so far    assign eight copies of 99  Because an array doesn’t follow the ‘‘handle to elements’’ model, swap   has to actually swap ele- ments  so  that  swapping  two array s applies swap   to N pairs  of Ts.  The declaration  of array ::swap   basically  says  that  if  a swap   of Ts can  throw,  then  so  can  a swap   of  an array . Obviously, throwing swap  s should be avoided like the plague.  When necessary, an array can be explicitly passed to a C-style function that expects a pointer.  For example:  void f int∗ p, int sz ;    C-style interface  void g   {  array  a;  f a,a.size   ; f &a[0],a.size   ; f a.data  ,a.size   ;     error :no conversion    C-style use    C-style use  auto p = ﬁnd a.begin  ,a.end  ,777 ;    ...     C++ STL-style use  Why would we use an array when vector is so much more ﬂexible?  Because an array is less ﬂexi- ble, it is simpler. Occasionally, there is a signiﬁcant performance advantage to be had by directly accessing elements allocated on the stack rather than allocating elements on the free store, access- ing them indirectly through the vector  a handle , and then deallocating them. On the other hand, the stack is a limited resource  especially on some embedded systems , and stack overﬂow is nasty. Why would we use an array when we could use a built-in array? An array knows its size, so it is easy to use with standard-library algorithms, and it can be copied  using = or initialization . How- ev er, my main reason to prefer array is that it saves me from surprising nasty conversions to point- ers.  Consider:  void h   {  Circle a1[10]; array  a2;    ... Shape∗ p1 = a1; Shape∗ p2 = a2; p1[3].draw  ;      OK: disaster waiting to happen    error :no conversion of array  to Shape*    disaster  }  }  }   Section 34.2.1  array  977  The  ‘‘disaster’’ comment  assumes  that sizeof Shape <sizeof Circle , so that  subscripting  a Circle[] through  a Shape∗ gives a wrong  offset   §27.2.1,  §17.5.1.4 . All  standard  containers  provide  this advantage over built-in arrays.  An array can be seen as a tuple  §34.2.4  where all elements are of the same type. The standard library provides support for that view.  The tuple helper type functions tuple_size and tuple_element can be applied to arrays:  tuple_size >::value  tuple_element >::type      N    T  We can also use a get  function to access the ith element:  template   T& get array & a  noexcept;  template   T&& get array && a  noexcept;  template   const T& get const array & a  noexcept;  For example:  array  a = {1,2,3,5,8,13,25}; auto x1 = get  a ;  auto x2 = a[5]; auto sz = tuple_size ::value;  typename tuple_element ::type x3 = 13;     13    13    7    x3 is an int  These type functions are for people writing code that expects tuples.  Use a constexpr function  §28.2.2  and a type alias  §28.2.1  to improve readability:  auto sz = Tuple_siz e   ;      7  Tuple_element  x3 = 13;     x3 is an int  The tuple syntax is meant for use in generic code.  34.2.2 bitset Aspects of a system, such as the state of an input stream  §38.4.5.1 , are often represented as a set of  ﬂags  indicating  binary  conditions  such  as  good bad,  true false,  and  on off.  C++ supports  the notion of small sets of ﬂags efﬁciently through bitwise operations on integers  §11.1.1 . Class bit- set  generalizes  this  notion  and  offers  greater  convenience  by  providing  operations  on  a sequence of N bits [0:N , where N is known at compile time. For sets of bits that don’t ﬁt into a long long int, using a bitset is much more convenient than using integers directly. For smaller sets, bitset is usually optimized. If you want to name the bits, rather than numbering them, the alternatives are to use a set  §31.4.3 , an enumeration  §8.4 , or a bit-ﬁeld  §8.2.7 .  A bitset  is an array of N bits.  It is presented in  . A bitset differs from a vector   §34.2.3  by being of ﬁxed size, from set  §31.4.3  by having its bits indexed by integers rather than associatively by value, and from both vector  and set by providing operations to manipulate the bits.   978  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  It is not possible to address a single bit directly using a built-in pointer  §7.2 . Consequently, bitset provides  a  reference-to-bit   proxy   type. This  is  actually  a  generally  useful  technique  for addressing objects for which a built-in pointer for some reason is unsuitable:  template  class bitset { public:  };    ...  };  class reference {     reference to a single bit:  friend class bitset; reference   noexcept;  public:      suppor tzero-based subscripting in [0:b.size     ˜reference   noexcept; reference& operator= bool x  noexcept;  reference& operator= const reference&  noexcept;  bool operator˜   const noexcept;  operator bool   const noexcept;  reference& ﬂip   noexcept;      forb[i] = x;    forb[i] = b[j];    return˜b[i]    forx=b[i];    b[i].ﬂip  ;  For historical reasons, bitset differs in style from other standard-library classes. For example, if an index  also known as a bit position  is out of range, an out_of_range exception is thrown.  No itera- tors are provided.  Bit positions are numbered from right to left in the same way bits often are in a word, so the value of b[i] is pow 2,i . Thus, a bitset can be thought of as an N-bit binary number:  position:  bitset  989 :  9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1  34.2.2.1  Constructors  A bitset can be constructed with a speciﬁed number of zeros, from the bits in an unsigned long long int, or from a string:  bitset  Constructors  §iso.20.5.1   continues   bitset bs {}; bitset bs {n}; bitset bs {s,i,n,z,o};  bitset bs {s,i,n,z}; bitset bs {s,i,n}; bitset bs {s,i}; bitset bs {s};  N zero bits Bits from n; n is an unsigned long long n bits [i:i+n  of s; s is a basic_string ; z is the character of type C used for zero; o is the character of type C used for one; explicit bitset bs {s,i,n,z,C{’1’}}; bitset bs {s,i,n,C{’0’},C{’1’}};} bitset bs {s,i,npos,C{’0’},C{’1’}}; bitset bs {s,0,npos,C{’0’},C{’1’}};   Section 34.2.2.1  Constructors   979  bitset  Constructors  continued   §iso.20.5.1   bitset bs {p,n,z,o};  bitset bs {p,n,z}; bitset bs {p,n}; bitset bs {p};  n bits [p:p+n ; p is a C-style string of type C∗; z is the character of type C used for zero; o is the character of type C used for one; explicit bitset bs {p,n,z,C{’0’}}; bitset bs {p,n,C{’1’},C{’0’}}; bitset bs {p,npos,C{’1’},C{’0’}};  The position npos is string ’s ‘‘beyond the end’’ position, meaning ‘‘all characters until the end’’  §36.3 .  When an unsigned long long int argument is supplied, each bit in the integer is used to initialize the corresponding bit in the bitset  if any .  A basic_string  §36.3  argument does the same, except that the character '0' gives the bit value 0, the character '1' gives the bit value 1, and other characters cause an invalid_argument exception to be thrown.  For example:  void f   {  bitset  b1;    all 0  bitset  b2 = 0xaaaa; bitset  b3 = 0xaaaa;     1010101010101010    00000000000000001010101010101010  bitset  b4 {"1010101010"}; bitset  b5 {"10110111011110",4};  bitset  b6 {string{"1010101010"}}; bitset  b7 {string{"10110111011110"},4}; bitset  b8 {string{"10110111011110"},2,8};     1010101010    0111011110     1010101010     0011011101     0111011110  bitset  b9 {string{"n0g00d"}}; bitset  b10 = string{"101001"};     invalid_argument thrown    error :no implicit string to bitset conversion  }  A key idea in the design of bitset is that an optimized implementation can be provided for bitsets that ﬁt in a single word.  The interface reﬂects this assumption.  34.2.2.2 bitset Operations  A bitset provides the operators for accessing individual bits and for manipulating all bits in the set:  bitset  Operations  §iso.20.5   continues  The ith bit of bs The ith bit of bs; throw out_of_range if i is not in [0:bs.size    Bitwise and Bitwise or Bitwise exclusive or  bs[i] bs.test i  bs&=bs2 bs=bs2 bsˆ=bs2   980  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  bitset  Operations  continued   §iso.20.5   bs<<=n bs>>=n bs.set   bs.set i,v   bs.reset   bs.reset i   bs.ﬂip    bs.ﬂip i   bs2=˜bs bs2=bs<<n bs2=bs>>n bs3=bs&bs2 bs3=bsbs2 bs3=bsˆbs2 is>>bs os<<bs  Logical left shift  ﬁll with zeros  Logical right shift  ﬁll with zeros  Set every bit of bs to 1 bs[i]=v Set every bit of bs to 0 b[i]=0; bs[i]=˜bs[i] for every bit in bs bs[i]=˜bs[i] Make complement set: bs2=bs, bs2.ﬂip   Make left-shifted set: bs2=bs, bs2<<=n Make right-shifted set: bs2=bs, bs2>>=n Bitwise and: bs3[i]=bs[i]&bs2[i] for each bit in bs Bitwise or: bs3[i]=bs[i]bs2[i] for each bit in bs Bitwise exclusive or: bs3[i]=bs[i]ˆbs2[i] for each bit in bs Read from is into bs; is is an istream Write bs to os; os is an ostream  The >> and << are  I O  operators  when  their  ﬁrst  operand  is  an iostream; othewise,  they are  shift operators and their second operand must be an integer. For example:  bitset  bs  "110001111"}; cout << bs << '\n'; auto bs2 = bs<<3; cout << bs2 << '\n'; cin >> bs; bs2 = bs>>3; cout << bs2 << '\n';     write"110001111" to cout    bs2 == "001111000";    write"001111000" to cout    read from cin    bs2 == "000110001" if the input were "110001111"    write"000110001" to cout  When bits are shifted, a logical  rather than cyclic  shift is used. That implies that some bits ‘‘fall off the end’’ and that some positions get the default value 0. Note that because size_t is an unsigned type, it is not possible to shift by a negative number. It does, however, imply that b<<−1 shifts by a very  large  positive  value,  thus  leaving  every  bit  of  the bitset  b with  the  value 0. Your  compiler should warn against this.  A bitset also supports common operations such as size  , ==, I O, etc.:  More bitset  Operations  §iso.20.5   C, Tr, and A have defaults for basic_string   n=bs.to_ulong    n=bs.to_ullong    s=bs.to_string  c0,c1   s=bs.to_string  c0   s=bs.to_string      n is the unsigned long corresponding to bs n is the unsigned long long corresponding to bs s[i]= b[i] ?c1:c0; s is a basic_string  s=bs.template to_string  c0,C{’1’}  s=bs.template to_string  C{’0’},C{’1’}    Section 34.2.2.2  bitset Operations   981  More bitset  Operations  continued   §iso.20.5   C, Tr, and A have defaults for basic_string   n=bs.count    n=bs.size   bs==bs2 bs!=bs2  bs.all   bs.any   bs.none   hash >  n is the number of bits with value 1 in bs n is the number of bits in bs Do bs and b2 have the same value? ! bs==bs2  Do all bits in bs have the value 1? Does any bit in bs have the value 1? Does no bit in bs have the value 1? Specialization of hash for bitset   The  operations to_ullong   and to_string   provide  the  inverse  operations  to  the  constructors. To avoid nonobvious conversions, named operations were preferred over conversion operators. If the value of the bitset has so many signiﬁcant bits that it cannot be represented as an unsigned  long, to_ulong   throws overﬂow_error; so does to_ullong   if its bitset argument doesn’t ﬁt.  Fortunately, the template arguments for the basic_string returned by to_string are defaulted.  For  example, we could write out the binary representation of an int:  void binary int i  {  bitset  b = i;     assume 8-bit byte  see also §40.2   cout  ,allocator >   << '\n'; cout     << '\n';    use default traits and allocator cout     << '\n'; cout << b.to_string   << '\n';     use all defaults    use all defaults     general and verbose  This prints the bits represented as 1s and 0s from left to right, with the most signiﬁcant bit leftmost, so that argument 123 would give the output  }  }  00000000000000000000000001111011 00000000000000000000000001111011 00000000000000000000000001111011 00000000000000000000000001111011  void binary2 int i  {  bitset  b = i; cout << b << '\n';  For this example, it is simpler to directly use the bitset output operator:     assume 8-bit byte  see also §40.2   34.2.3 vector  The vector  from   is a specialization of vector  §31.4  providing compact storage of bits  bools :   982  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34     specialization of vector   §31.4   template  class vector  { public:  using const_reference = bool; using value_type = bool;    likevector   friend class vector; reference   noexcept;  public:  class reference {     suppor tzero-based subscripting in [0:v.size     ˜reference  ; operator bool   const noexcept; reference& operator= const bool x  noexcept;  reference& operator= const reference& x  noexcept;  void ﬂip   noexcept;      v[i] = x    v[i] = v[j]    ﬂip the bit: v[i]=˜v[i]  void ﬂip   noexcept;    ﬂip all bits of v  };     ...  };  The similarity to bitset is obvious, but, unlike bitset but like vector , vector  has an allocator and can have its size changed.  As in a vector , elements of a vector  with higher indices have higher addresses:  position: vector :  9876543210 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1  This is exactly the opposite of the layout in a bitset. Also, there is no direct support for converting integers and strings to and from a vector .  Use vector  as you would any other vector , but expect operations on a single bit to be less  efﬁcient  than  the  equivalent  operations  on  a vector . Also,  it  is  impossible  in  C++  to completely faithfully mimic the behavior of a  built-in  reference with a proxy, so don’t try to be subtle about rvalue lvalue distinctions when using a vector .  34.2.4  Tuples The standard library provides two ways of grouping values of arbitrary types into a single object:   cid:129  A pair  §34.2.4.1  holds two values.  cid:129  A tuple  §34.2.4  holds zero or more values.  We  use pair when it is useful to know  statically  that we have exactly two values.  With tuple, we always have to deal with all possible numbers of values.   Section 34.2.4.1  34.2.4.1 pair  In  , the standard library provides class pair for manipulating pairs of values:  template  struct pair {  using ﬁrst_type = T; using second_type = U;     the type of the ﬁrst element    the type of the second element  pair  983  T ﬁrst;  U second;      ﬁrst element    second element     ...  };  pair p {} pair p {x,y} pair p {p2} pair p {piecewise_construct,t,t2}   pair   §iso.20.3.2  Default constructor: pair p {T{},U{}}; constexpr p.ﬁrst is initialized to x and p.second is initialized to y Construct from the pair p2: pair p {p2.ﬁrst,p2.second}; p.ﬁrst is constructed from the elements of tuple t, and p.second is constructed from the elements of tuple t2 Destructor: destroy t.ﬁrst and t.second Copy assignment: p2.ﬁrst=p.ﬁrst and p2.second=p.second Move assignment: p2.ﬁrst=move p.ﬁrst  and p2.second=move p.second  Exchange the values of p and p2  p.˜pair   p2=p p2=move{p}  p.swap p2   void f   {  }  };  An  operation  on pair is noexcept if  the  corresponding  operations  on  its  elements  are. Similarly, copy or move operations exist for a pair if the corresponding operations on its elements do.  The elements ﬁrst and second are members that we can directly read and write. For example:  pair  p {"Cambridge",1209};    print"Cambr idge" cout << p.ﬁrst;  p.second += 800;    update year    ...  The piecewise_construct is the name of an object of type piecewise_construct_t used to distinguish between  constructing  a pair with  members  of tuple types  and  constructing  a pair using tuples as argument lists for its ﬁrst and second. For example:  struct Univ {  Univ const string& n, int r  : name{n}, rank{r} { } string name; int rank; string city = "unknown";   984  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  using Tup = tuple ; Tup t1 {"Columbia",11};  Tup t2 {"Cambridg e",2};     U.S. News2012  pair  p1 {t1,t2}; pair  p2 {piecewise_construct,t1,t2};      pair of tuples    pair of Univs  That is, p1.second is t2, that is, {"Cambridge",2}. To contrast, p2.second is Univ{t2}, that is, {"Cam- bridge",2,"unknown"}.  pair  Helpers  §iso.20.3.3, §iso.20.3.4   p==p2  p<p2  p!=p2  p>p2  p<=p2  p>=p2  swap p,p2   p=make_pair x,y    tuple_size ::value tuple_element ::type get  p   p.ﬁrst==p2.ﬁrst && p.second==p2.second p.ﬁrst<p2.ﬁrst   ! p2.ﬁrst<p.ﬁrst  && p.second<p2.second  ! p==p2  p2<p ! p2<p  ! p<p2  p.swap p2  p is a pair  holding the value x,y; if possible, move rather than copy x and y The size of a pair of type T The type of ﬁrst  if N==0  or second  if N==1  A reference to the Nth element of the pair p; N must be 0 or 1  The make_pair function avoids explicit mention of the element types of a pair. For example:  In  , the standard library provides class tuple and various supporting facilities.  A tuple is a sequence of N elements of arbitrary types:  auto p = make_pair "Harvard",1736 ;  34.2.4.2 tuple  template  class tuple { public:     ...  };  The number of elements is zero or positive.  For details of tuple design, implementation, and use, see §28.5 and §28.6.4.  tuple  Members  §iso.20.4.2   continues   tuple t {}; tuple t {args};  tuple t {t2}; tuple t {p};  Default constructor: the empty tuple; constexpr t has one element for each element of args; explicit Construct from tuple t2 Construct from pair p   Section 34.2.4.2  tuple  985  tuple  Members  continued   §iso.20.4.2   tuple t {allocator_arg_t,a,args}; tuple t {allocator_arg_t,a,t2}; tuple t {allocator_arg_t,a,p}; t.˜tuple   t=t2 t=move t2  t=p t=move p  t.swap t2   Construct from args using the allocator a Construct from tuple t2, using the allocator a Construct from pair p, using the allocator a Destructor: destroy each element Copy assignment of tuples Move assignment of tuples Copy assignment of pair p Move assignment of pair p Exchange the values of tuples t and t2; noexcept  The types of tuple and operands of = and arguments to swap  , etc., are not required to be the same. An operation is valid if  and only if  the implied operations on elements are valid.  For example, we can assign one tuple to another if each element of the assigned tuple can be assigned to the target element.  For example:  tuple ,int> t2 = make_tuple "Hello, tuples!",vector {1,2,3},'x' ;  An operation is noexcept if all the element operations are, and an operation throws only if a mem- ber operation throws.  Similarly, a tuple operation is constexpr if the element operations are.  The number of elements in each tuple of a pair of operands  or arguments  must be the same. Note that the general tuple constructor is explicit. In particular, this does not work:  tuple  rotate tuple  t  {  return {t.get   ,t.g et   ,t.get   };     error :explicit tuple constructor  auto t2 = rotate {3,7,9} ;     error :explicit tuple constructor  If all you need is two elements, you can use pair:  }  }  pair  rotate pair  p  {  return {p.second,p.ﬁrst};  auto p2 = rotate {3,7} ;  For more examples, see §28.6.4.  tuple  Helpers  §iso.20.4.2.4, §iso.20.4.2.9   continues   t=make_tuple args  t=forward_as_tuple args    t=tie args    Make tuple from args t is a tuple of rvalue references to the elements in args so you can forward the elements of arg through t t is a tuple of lvalue references to the elements of args so you can assign to the elements of args through t   986  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  tuple  Helpers  continued   §iso.20.4.2.4, §iso.20.4.2.9   t=tuple_cat args   tuple_size ::value tuple_elements ::type get  t  t==t2  t!=t2  t<t2 t>t2  t<=t2  t>=t2  uses_allocator ::value swap t,t2    Concatenate tuples: args is one or more tuples; t has the members of the tuples in args in order The number of elements of the tuple T The type of the Nth element of the tuple T A reference to the Nth element of the tuple t Are all elements of t and t2 equal? t and t2 must have the same number of elements ! t==t2  Does t lexicographically compare less than t2? t2<t ! t2>t  ! t2<t  Can a tuple  be allocated by an allocator of type A? t.swap t2   For example, tie   can be used to extract elements from a tuple:  auto t = make_tuple 2.71828,299792458,"Hannibal" ; double c; string name; tie c,ignore,name  = t;     c=299792458; name="Hannibal"  The name ignore refers to an object of a type that ignores assignments. Thus, an ignore in a tie   implies that attempts to assign to its tuple position are ignored. An alternative would be:  double c = get  t ;  string name = get  t ;      c=299792458    name="Hannibal"  Obviously, this  would  be  more  interesting  if  the tuple came  from  ‘‘elsewhere’’ so that  we  didn’t trivially know the element values.  For example:  tuple  compute  ;    ... double c; string name; tie c,ignore,name  = t;     results in c and name  34.3  Resource Management Pointers A pointer points to an object  or not . However, a pointer does not indicate who  if anyone  owns the objects. That is, looking just at a pointer, we hav e no idea who is supposed to delete the object pointed to, or how, or if at all.  In  , we ﬁnd ‘‘smart pointers’’ to express ownership:  unique_ptr  §34.3.1  to represent exclusive ownership shared_ptr  §34.3.2  to represent shared ownership   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129  weak_ptr  §34.3.3  to break loops in circular shared data structures  These resource handles are introduced in §5.2.1.   Section 34.3.1  unique_ptr  987  34.3.1 unique_ptr The unique_ptr  deﬁned in    provides a semantics of strict ownership:   cid:129  A unique_ptr owns the object to which it holds a pointer. That is, it is the unique_ptr’s obli-  gation to destroy the object pointed to  if any  by its contained pointer.   cid:129  A unique_ptr cannot be copied  has no copy constructor or copy assignment . However,  it  can be moved.   cid:129  A unique_ptr stores a pointer and deletes the object pointed to  if any  using the associated deleter   if  any   when  it  is  itself  destroyed   such  as  when  a  thread  of  control  leaves the unique_ptr’s scope; §17.2.2 .  The uses of unique_ptr include:   cid:129  Providing exception safety for dynamically allocated memory  §5.2.1, §13.3   cid:129  Passing ownership of dynamically allocated memory to a function  cid:129  Returning dynamically allocated memory from a function  cid:129  Storing pointers in containers  Think of unique_ptr as being represented by a simple pointer  ‘‘the contained pointer’’  or  if it has a deleter  as a pair of pointers:  up1:  unique_ptr   up2:  unique_ptr   object  object  deleter  When a unique_ptr is destroyed, its deleter is called to destroy the owned object. The deleter repre- sents what it means to destroy an object.  For example:  cid:129  A deleter for a local variable should do nothing.  cid:129  A deleter for a memory pool should return the object to the memory pool and destroy it or  not, depending on how that pool is deﬁned.   cid:129  The  default   ‘‘no  deleter’’   version  of unique_ptr uses delete.  It doesn’t even store  the  default deleter. It can be a specialization or rely on the empty-base optimization  §28.5 .  This way unique_ptr supports general resource management  §5.2 .  template > class unique_ptr { public:  using pointer = ptr;    type of the contained pointer;     ptr is D::pointer if that is deﬁned, otherwise T*  using element_type = T; using deleter_type = D;     ...  };  The contained pointer is not directly accessible to users.   988  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  unique_ptr up {} unique_ptr up {p} unique_ptr up {p,del} unique_ptr up {up2} up.˜unique_ptr   up=up2  up=nullptr  bool b {up}; x=∗up  x=up−>m  x=up[n]  x=up.get   del=up.get_deleter   p=up.release    up.reset p  up.reset     up.swap up2  up==up2  up<up2  up!=up2  up>up2  up<=up2  up>=up2  swap up,up2    unique_ptr   §iso.20.7.1.2   cp is the contained pointer  Default constructor: cp=nullptr; constexpr; noexcept cp=p; use the default deleter; explicit; noexcept cp=p; del is the deleter; noexcept Move constructor: cp.p=up2.p; up2.p=nullptr; noexcept Destructor: if cp!=nullptr invoke cp’s deleter Move assigment: up.reset up2.cp ; up2.cp=nullptr; up gets up2’s deleter; up’s old object  if any  is deleted; noexcept up.reset nullptr ; that is, delete up’s old object, if any Conversion to bool: up.cp!=nullptr; explicit x=up.cp; for contained non-arrays only x=up.cp−>m; for contained non-arrays only x=up.cp[n]; for contained arrays only x=up.cp del is up’s deleter p=up.cp; up.cp=nullptr If up.cp!=nullptr call deleter for up.cp; up.cp=p up.cp=pionter{}  probably nullptr ; call the deleter for the old value of up.cp Exchange up and up2’s values; noexcept up.cp==up2.cp up.cp<up2.cp ! up==up2  up2<up ! up2>up  ! up2<up  up.swap up2   Note: unique_ptr does not offer a copy constructor or copy assignment.  Had it done so, the mean- ing  of  ‘‘ownership’’ would  have  been  very  hard  to  deﬁne  and or  use. If  you  feel  the  need  for copies, consider using a shared_ptr  §34.3.2 .  It is possible to have a unique_ptr for a built-in array. For example:  unique_ptr  make_sequence int n  {  unique_ptr p {new int[n]}; for  int i=0; i<n; ++i   p[i]=i;  return p;  }  This is provided as a specialization:   Section 34.3.1  unique_ptr  989  template  class unique_ptr  {     specialization for arrays §iso.20.7.1.3     the default D=default_delete  comes from the general unique_ptr  ... likethe unique_ptr for individual objects,but with [] instead of * and -> ...

What are the best ways to use a unique_ptr? It is called a pointer  _ptr  and I pronounce it ‘‘unique pointer,’’ but clearly it is not just an ordinary pointer  or there would be no point in deﬁning it . Consider a simple technical example:  };  };  }  }  }  unique_ptr  f unique_ptr  p  {  ++∗p; return p;  void f2 const unique_ptr & p  {  ++∗p;  void use   {  unique_ptr  p {new int{7}}; p=f p ;  p=f move p  ;  f2 p ;      error :no copyconstr uctor    transfer ownership there and back    pass a reference  The f2   body is slightly shorter than f   and f2   is simpler to call, but I ﬁnd f   easier to think about. The style illustrated by f   is explicit about ownership  and the use of unique_ptr is typically moti- vated by ownership issues . See also the discussion of the use of non-const references in §7.7.1. On balance, a notation f x  that modiﬁes x is more error-prone than a y=f x  notation that does not.  It is a fair estimate that the call of f2   is one or two machine instructions faster than a call of f    because  of  the  need  to  place  a nullptr in  the  original unique_ptr ,  but  that  is  unlikely  to  be   990  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  signiﬁcant.  On the other hand, access to the contained pointer involves an extra indirection in f2   compared to f  . This, too, is unlikely to be signiﬁcant in most programs, so the choice between the styles of f   and f2   has to be made on reasoning about code quality.  Here is a simple example of a deleter used to provide guaranteed release of data obtained from a  C program fragment using malloc    §43.5 :  extern "C" char∗ get_data const char∗ data ;     get data from C programfragment  using PtoCF = void ∗  void∗ ;  void test   {  unique_ptr  p {get_data "my_data" ,free};    ... use *p ...    implicit free p   }  Currently, make_shared    §34.3.2 .  However, it is easily deﬁned:  there  is  no  standard-library make_unique   similar  to make_pair    §34.2.4.1   and  template  unique_ptr  make_unique Args&&... args   {  return unique_ptr {new T{args...}};  }     default deleter version  34.3.2 shared_ptr A shared_ptr represents shared ownership.  It is used where two pieces of code need access to some data  but  neither  has  exclusive  ownership   in  the  sense  of  being  responsible  for  destroying  the object .  A shared_ptr is a kind of counted pointer where the object pointed to is deleted when the use count goes to zero. Think of a shared pointer as a structure with two pointers: one to the object and one to the use count:  sp1:  sp2:  use count deleter  object  The deleter is what is used to delete the shared object when the use count goes to zero. The default deleter is the usual delete  invoke the destructor, if any, and deallocate free store .  For example, consider a Node in a general graph used by an algorithm that adds and removes both  nodes  and  connections  between  nodes   edges . Obviously, to avoid  resource  leaks,  a Node must be deleted if and only if no other node refers to it. We could try:   Section 34.3.2  shared_ptr  991  Given that, answering questions such as ‘‘How many nodes points to this node?’’ is very hard and requires much added ‘‘housekeeping’’ code.  We could plug in a garbage collector  §34.5 , but that could have neg ative performance implications if the graph was only a small part of a large applica- tion data space. Worse, if the container contained non-memory resources, such as thread handles, ﬁle handles, locks, etc., even a garbage collector would leak resources.  struct Node {  vector  edg es;    ...  };  };  Instead, we can use a shared_ptr:  struct Node {  vector > edges; thread worker;    ...  Here, Node’s destructor  the implicitly generated destructor will do ﬁne  deletes its edges. That is, the destructor for each edges[i] is invoked, and the Node pointed to  if any  is deleted if edges[i] was the last pointer to it.  Don’t use a shared_ptr just to pass a pointer from one owner to another; that’s what unique_ptr is for, and unique_ptr does it better and more cheaply. If you have been using counted pointers as return values from factory functions  §21.2.4  and the like, consider upgrading to unique_ptr rather than shared_ptr.  Do not thoughtlessly replace pointers with shared_ptrs in an attempt to prevent memory leaks;  shared_ptrs are not a panacea nor are they without costs:   cid:129  A circular linked structure of shared_ptrs can cause a resource leak. You need some logical  complication to break the circle, for example, use a weak_ptr  §34.3.3 .   cid:129  Objects with shared ownership tend to stay ‘‘live’’ for longer than scoped objects  thus caus-   cid:129  Shared pointers in a multi-threaded environment can be expensive  because of the need to  ing higher average resource usage .  prevent data races on the use count .   cid:129  A destructor  for  a  shared  object  does  not  execute  at  a  predictable  time,  so  the  algo- rithms logic for the update of any shared object are easier to get wrong than for an object that’s not shared. For example, which locks are set at the time of the destructor’s execution? Which ﬁles are open? In general, which objects are ‘‘live’’  and in appropriate states at the  unpredictable  point of execution? If a single  last  node keeps a large data structure alive, the cascade of destructor calls trig- gered by its deletion can cause a signiﬁcant ‘‘garbage collection delay.’’ That can be detri- mental to real-time response.   cid:129   A shared_ptr represents shared ownership and can be very useful, even essential, but shared owner- ship isn’t my ideal, and it always carries a cost  independently of how you represent the sharing . It is better  simpler  if an object has a deﬁnite owner and a deﬁnite, predictable life span. When there is a choice:   992  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34   cid:129  Prefer unique_ptr to shared_ptr.  cid:129  Prefer ordinary scoped objects to objects on the heap owned by a unique_ptr.  The shared_ptr provides a fairly conventional set of operations:  shared_ptr  Operations  §iso.20.7.2.2   cp is the contained pointer; uc is the use count  shared_ptr sp {} shared_ptr sp {p} shared_ptr sp {p,del} shared_ptr sp {p,del,a} shared_ptr sp {sp2}  sp.˜shared_ptr    sp=sp2 sp=move sp2  bool b {sp}; sp.reset     sp.reset p    sp.reset p,d  sp.reset p,d,a  p=sp.get   x=∗sp  x=sp−>m  n=sp.use_count    sp.unique    x=sp.owner_before pp    sp.swap sp2   Default constructor: cp=nullptr; uc=0; noexcept Constructor: cp=p; uc=1 Constructor: cp=p; uc=1; use deleter del Constructor: cp=p; uc=1; use deleter del and allocator a Move and copy constructors: the move constructor moves and then sets sp2.cp=nullptr; the copy constructor copies and sets ++uc for the now-shared uc Destructor: −−uc; delete the object pointed to by cp if uc became 0, using the deleter  the default deleter is delete  Copy assignment: ++uc for the now-shared uc; noexcept Move assignment: sp2.cp=nullptr for the now-shared uc; noexcept Conversion to bool: sp.uc==nullptr; explicit shared_ptr{}.swap sp ; that is, sp contains pointer{}, and the destruction of the temporary shared_ptr{} decreases the use count for the old object; noexcept shared_ptr{p}.swap sp ; that is, sp.cp=p; uc==1; the destruction of the temporary shared_ptr decreases the use count for the old object Like sp.reset p  but with the deleter d Like sp.reset p  but with the deleter d and the allocator a p=sp.cp; noexcept x=∗sp.cp; noexcept x=sp.cp−>m; noexcept n is the value of the use count  0 if sp.cp==nullptr  sp.uc==1?  does not check if sp.cp==nullptr  x is an ordering function  strict weak order; §31.2.2.1  pp is a shared_ptr or a weak_ptr Exchange sp’s and sp2’s values; noexcept  In addition, the standard library provides a few helper functions:  shared_ptr  Helpers  §iso.20.7.2.2.6, §iso.20.7.2.2.7   continues   sp=make_shared args    sp=allocate_shared a,args    sp is a shared_ptr  for an object of type T constructed from the arguments args; allocated using new sp is a shared_ptr  for an object of type T constructed from the arguments args; allocated using allocator a   Section 34.3.2  shared_ptr  993  shared_ptr  Helpers  continued   §iso.20.7.2.2.6, §iso.20.7.2.2.7   sp==sp2  sp<sp2  sp!=sp2  sp>sp2  sp<=sp2  sp>=sp2  swap sp,sp2   sp2=static_pointer_cast sp    sp2=dynamic_pointer_cast sp    sp2=const_pointer_cast sp    dp=get_deleter  sp   sp.cp==sp2.cp; sp or sp2 may be the nullptr less  sp.cp,sp2.cp ; sp or sp2 may be the nullptr ! sp=sp2  sp2<sp ! sp>sp2  ! sp<sp2  sp.swap sp2  static_cast for shared pointers: sp2=shared_ptr  static_cast  sp.cp  ; noexcept dynamic_cast for shared pointers: sp2=shared_ptr  dynamic_cast  sp.cp  ; noexcept const_cast for shared pointers: sp2=shared_ptr  const_cast  sp.cp  ; noexcept If sp has a deleter of type D, ∗dp is sp’s deleter; otherwise, dp==nullptr; noexcept Write sp to ostream os  os<<sp  For example:  struct S { int i; string s; double d;    ...  };  auto p = make_shared  1,"Ankh Morpork",4.65 ;  Now, p is  a shared_ptr  pointing  to  an  object  of  type S allocated  on  the  free  store,  containing {1,string{"Ankh Morpork"},4.65}.  Note that unlike unique_ptr::get_deleter  , shared_ptr’s deleter is not a member function.  34.3.3 weak_ptr A weak_ptr refers to an object managed by a shared_ptr. To  access the object, a weak_ptr can be converted to a shared_ptr using the member function lock  . A weak_ptr allows access to an object, owned by someone else, that   cid:129  You need access to  only  if it exists  cid:129  May get deleted  by someone else  at any time  cid:129  Must have its destructor called after its last use  usually to delete a non-memory resource   In particular, we use weak pointers to break loops in data structures managed using shared_ptrs.  Think of a weak_ptr as a structure with two pointers: one to the  potentially shared  object and  one to the use count structure of that object’s shared_ptrs:   994  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  wp:  sp1:  sp2:  Object  use count deleter  weak use count  The  ‘‘weak  use  count’’ is needed  to  keep  the  use  count  structure  alive  because  there  may  be weak_ptrs after the last shared_ptr for an object  and the object  is destroyed.  template  class weak_ptr { public:  using element_type = T;    ...  };  A weak_ptr has to be converted to a shared_ptr to access ‘‘its’’ object, so it provides relatively few operations:  weak_ptr   §iso.20.7.2.3   cp is the contained pointer; wuc is the weak use count  weak_ptr wp {}; weak_ptr wp {pp};  wp.˜weak_ptr   wp=pp  wp.swap wp2  wp.reset    n=wp.use_count    wp.expired   sp=wp.lock   x=wp.owner_before pp    swap wp,wp2    Default constructor: cp=nullptr; constexpr; noexcept Copy constructor: cp=pp.cp; ++wuc; pp is a weak_ptr or a shared_ptr; noexcept Destructor: no effect on ∗cp; −−wuc Copy: decrease wuc and set wp to pp: weak_ptr pp .swap wp ; pp is a weak_ptr or a shared_ptr; noexcept Exchange wp’s and wp2’s values; noexcept Decrease wuc and set wp to nullptr: weak_ptr{}.swap wp ; noexcept n is the number of shared_ptrs to ∗cp; noexcept Are there any shared_ptrs to ∗cp? noexcept Make a new shared_ptr for ∗cp; noexcept x is an ordering function  strict weak order; §31.2.2.1 ; pp is a shared_ptr or a weak_ptr wp.swap wp2 ; noexcept  Consider an implementation of the old ‘‘asteroid game.’’  All asteroids are owned by ‘‘the game,’’ but each asteroid must keep track of neighboring asteroids and handle collisions. A collision typi- cally leads to the destruction of one or more asteroids. Each asteroid must keep a list of other aster- oids  in  its  neighborhood.  Note  that  being  on  such  a  neighbor  list  should  not  keep  an  asteroid ‘‘alive’’   so  a shared_ptr would  be  inappropriate . On  the  other  hand,  an  asteroid  must  not  be   Section 34.3.3  weak_ptr  995  destroyed while another asteroid is looking at it  e.g., to calculate the effect of a collision . And obviously, an asteroid destructor must be called to release resources  such as a connection to the graphics system . What we need is a list of asteroids that might still be intact and a way of ‘‘grab- bing onto one’’ for a while. A weak_ptr does just that:  void owner   {     ... vector > va 100 ; for  int i=0; i<va.siz e  ; ++i  {     ... calculate neighbors for newasteroid ... va[i].reset new Asteroid weak_ptr  va[neighbor]  ; launch i ;  }    ...  }  Obviously, I radically simpliﬁed ‘‘the owner’’ and gav e each new Asteroid just one neighbor. The key is that we give the Asteroid a weak_ptr to that neighbor. The owner keeps a shared_ptr to repre- sent the ownership that’s shared whenever an Asteroid is looking  but not otherwise . The collision calculation for an Asteroid will look something like this:  void collision weak_ptr  p  {  if  auto q = p.lock    {     p.lockretur nsashared_ptr to p’sobject     ... that Asteroid still existed: calculate ...     Oops: that Asteroid has already been destroyed  } else {  p.reset  ;  }  }  Note that even if a user decides to shut down the game and deletes all Asteroids  by destroying the shared_ptrs representing ownership , every Asteroid that is in the middle of calculating a collision still ﬁnishes correctly: after the p.lock  , it holds a shared_ptr that will not become invalid.  34.4  Allocators The STL containers  §31.4  and string  Chapter 36  are resource handles that acquire and release memory to hold their elements. To do so, they use allocators. The basic purpose of an allocator is to provide a source of memory for a given type and a place to return that memory to once it is no longer needed. Thus, the basic allocator functions are:  p=a.allocate n ;  a.deallocate p,n ;      acquire space for n objects of type T    release space for n objects of type T pointed to byp  For example:   996  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34     use new[] and delete[] to allocate and deallocate bytes  { return reinterpret_cast  new char[n∗sizeof T ] ; }  void deallocate T∗ p, size_t n   { delete[] reinterpret_cast  p ; }  Simple_alloc happens to be the simplest standards-conforming allocator. Note the casts to and from char∗: allocate   does not invoke constructors and deallocate   does not invoke destructors; they deal in memory, not typed objects.  I can build my own allocator to allocate from an arbitrary area of memory:  template  struct Simple_alloc {  using value_type = T;  Simple_alloc   {}  T∗ allocate size_t n      ...  };  class Arena { void∗ p; int s;  public:  Arena void∗ pp, int ss ;    allocate from p[0..ss-1]  };  };  template  struct My_alloc {  Arena& a; My_alloc Arena& aa  : a aa  { } My_alloc   {}    usual allocator stuff     use an Arena to allocate and deallocate bytes  Once Arenas are made, objects can be constructed in the memory allocated:  constexpr int sz {100000}; Arena my_arena1{new char[sz],sz}; Arena my_arena2{new char[10∗sz],10∗sz};  vector  v0;   allocate using default allocator  vector > v1 {My_alloc {my_arena1}};      constructin my_arena1  vector > v2 {My_alloc {my_arena2}};      constructin my_arena2  vector > v3;     constructon free store  Typically, the verbosity would be alleviated by the use of aliases. For example:   Section 34.4  Allocators   997  template   template   using Arena_vec = std::vector >;  using Simple_vec = std::vector >;  My_alloc  Alloc2 {my_arena2};      named allocator object  Arena_vec > vcd {{{1,2}, {3,4}}, Alloc2}; Simple_vec  vs {"Sam Vimes", "Fred Colon", "Nobby Nobbs"};      explicit allocator    default allocator  An  allocator  imposes  space  overhead  in  a  container  only  if  its  objects  actually  have  state   like My_alloc .  This is usually achieved by relying on the empty-base optimization  §28.5 .  34.4.1  The Default Allocator A default allocator that allocates using new and deallocates using delete is used  by default  by all standard-library containers.  template  class allocator { public:  using size_type = size_t; using difference_type = ptrdiff_t; using pointer = T∗; using const_pointer = const T∗; using reference = T&; using const_reference = const T&; using value_type = T;  template   struct rebind { using other = allocator ; };  allocator   noexcept; allocator const allocator&  noexcept; template   allocator const allocator &  noexcept;  ˜allocator  ;  pointer address reference x  const noexcept; const_pointer address const_reference x  const noexcept;  pointer allocate size_type n, allocator ::const_pointer hint = 0 ; void deallocate pointer p, size_type n ;     allocate n bytes    deallocate n bytes  size_type max_siz e   const noexcept;  template  void construct U∗ p, Args&&... args ;      new p  U{args}   998  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  template  void destroy U∗ p ;      p->˜U    The curious rebind template is an archaic alias. It should have been:  template  using other = allocator ;  However, allocator was deﬁned before such aliases were supported by C++. It is provided to allow an allocator to allocate objects of arbitrary type. Consider:  using Link_alloc = typename A::template rebind ::other;  If A is an allocator, then rebind ::other is an alias for allocator . For example:  template > class list { private:  class Link {  * ...*  };  Link_alloc a; A alloc;     ...     link allocator    list allocator  using Link_alloc = typename A:: template rebind ::other;     allocator   A more restricted specialization of allocator  is provided:  template  class allocator  { public:  typedef void∗ pointer; typedef const void∗ const_pointer; typedef void value_type; template  struct rebind { typedef allocator  other; };  };  };  };  This allows us to avoid special cases: We can mention allocator  as long as we don’t derefer- ence its pointers.  34.4.2  Allocator Traits The  allocators  are  ‘‘wired  together’’ using allocator_traits. A property  of  an  allocator, say, its pointer type, is found in its trait: allocator_traits ::pointer. As usual, the traits technique is used so that I can build an allocator for a type that does not have member types matching the require- ments of an allocator, such as int, and a type designed without any thought of allocators.  Basically, allocator_traits provide  defaults  for  the  usual  set  of  type  aliases  and  allocator  func- is  missing  and select_on_con-  tions.  Compared to  the  default allocator  §34.4.1 , address   tainer_copy_construction   is added:   Section 34.4.2  Allocator Traits   999  template  struct allocator_traits {     §iso.20.6.8  using allocator_type = A; using value_type = A::value_type; using pointer = value_type;  using const_pointer = Pointer_traits ::rebind ;  using void_pointer = Pointer_traits ::rebind ;  using const_void_pointer = Pointer_traits ::rebind ;  using difference_type = Pointer_traits ::difference_type;  using size_type = Make_unsigned ;  using propagate_on_container_copy_assignment = false_type; using propagate_on_container_move_assignment = false_type; using propagate_on_container_swap = false_type;     trick    trick    trick    trick    trick    trick    trick    trick    trick  template  using rebind_alloc = A ;  template  using rebind_traits = Allocator_traits >;     trick  static pointer allocate A& a, size_type n  { return a.allocate n ; } static pointer allocate A& a, size_type n, const_void_pointer hint      trick    trick  { return a.allocate n,hint ; }  static void deallocate A& a, pointer p, size_type n  { a.deallocate p, n ; }     trick  template   static void construct A& a, T∗ p, Args&&... args   { ::new  static_cast  p   T std::forward  args ... ; }  template   static void destroy A& a, T∗ p  { p−>T  ; }     trick     trick     trick  static size_type max_size const A& a   { return numeric_limits ::max   }  static A select_on_container_copy_construction const A& rhs  { return a; }    trick  };  The ‘‘trick’’ is to use the equivalent member of the allocator A if it exists; otherwise, the default speciﬁed here. For allocate n,hint , A::allocate n  will be called if A has no allocate   taking a hint. The Args are any type arguments needed by A.  I am no fan  of  trickery  in  the  deﬁnition  of  the  standard  library, but  liberal  use  of enable_if     §28.4  allows this to be implemented in C++.  To make the declarations readable, I assume a few type aliases.  34.4.3  Pointer Traits An allocator uses pointer_traits to determine properties of pointers and proxy types for pointers:  template  struct pointer_traits {     §iso.20.6.3  using pointer = P; using element_type = T; using difference_type = ptrdiff_t;      trick    trick   1000  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  template  using rebind = T∗;  static pointer pointer_to a ;     trick     trick  template  struct pointer_traits  {  using pointer = T∗; using element_type = T; using difference_type = ptrdiff_t; template  using rebind = U∗;  };  };  static pointer pointer_to x  noexcept { return addressof x ; }  The ‘‘trick’’ is the same as used by allocator_traits  §34.4.2 : to use the equivalent member of the pointer P if it exists; otherwise, the default speciﬁed here. To  use the T, the template argument P must be the ﬁrst argument of a Ptr  template.  This speciﬁcation does violence to the C++ language.  34.4.4  Scoped Allocators A rather sneaky problem can occur when using containers and user-deﬁned allocators: Should an element be in the same allocation area as its container? For example, if you use Your_allocator for Your_string to  allocate  its  elements  and  I  use My_allocator to  allocate  elements  of My_vector then which allocator should be used for string elements in My_vector >?  Gorm  Harald  Sven     §iso.20.12.1  The solution is the ability to tell a container which allocator to pass to elements. The key to that is the class scoped_allocator, which provides the mechanism to keep track of an outer allocator  to be used for elements  and an inner allocator  to be passed to elements for their use :  template  class scoped_allocator_adaptor : public OuterA { private:  using Tr = allocator_traits ;  public:  using outer_allocator_type = OuterA; using inner_allocator_type = see below;   Section 34.4.4  Scoped Allocators  1001  using value_type = typename Tr::value_type; using size_type = typename Tr::siz e_type; using difference_type = typename Tr::difference_type; using pointer = typename Tr::pointer; using const_pointer = typename Tr::const_pointer; using void_pointer = typename Tr::void_pointer; using const_void_pointer = typename Tr::const_void_pointer; using propagate_on_container_copy_assignment =  * see §iso.20.12.2* ; using propagate_on_container_move_assignment =  * see §iso.20.12.2* ; using propagate_on_container_swap =  * see §iso.20.12.2* ;     ...  };  We hav e four alternatives for allocation of vectors of strings:     vector and string use their own  the default  allocator: using svec0 = vector ; svec0 v0;     vector  only  uses My_alloc and string uses its own allocator  the default : using Svec1 = vector >; Svec1 v1 {My_alloc {my_arena1}};     vector and string use My_alloc  as above : using Xstring = basic_string , My_alloc >; using Svec2 = vector >>; Svec2 v2 {scoped_allocator_adaptor >{my_arena1}};     vector uses its own alloctor  the default  and string uses My_alloc: using Xstring2 = basic_string , My_alloc >; using Svec3 = vector ,My_alloc >>; Svec3 v3 {scoped_allocator_adaptor ,My_alloc >{my_arena1}};  Obviously, the ﬁrst variant, Svec0, will be by far the most common, but for systems with serious memory-related performance constraints, the other versions  especially Svec2  can be important. A few more aliases would make that code a bit more readable, but it is good that this is not the kind of code you have to write every day.  The deﬁnition of scoped_allocator_adaptor is somewhat involved, but basically it is an allocator much like the default allocator  §34.4.1  that also keeps track of its ‘‘inner’’ allocator to be passed along for use by contained containers, such as string:  scoped_allocator_adaptor   Abbreviated, §iso.20.12.1   continues   rebind ::other x=a.inner_allocator    x=a.outer_allocator    p=a.allocate n   Alias for a version of this allocator allocating objects of type T x is the inner allocator; noexcept x is the outer allocator; noexcept Acquire space for n objects of value_type   1002  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  scoped_allocator_adaptor   continued   Abbreviated, §iso.20.12.1   p=a.allocate n,hint   a.deallocate p,n  n=a.max_size   t=a.construct args  a.destroy p   Acquire space for n objects of value_type hint is an implementation-dependent help for the allocator; often, hint is a pointer to an object to which we would like ∗p to be near Free the space for n objects of value_type pointed to by p n is the largest possible number of elements allocated Construct a value_type from args: t=new p  value_type{args} Destroy ∗p: p−>˜value_type    34.5  The Garbage Collection Interface Garbage  collection   automatic  recycling  of  unreferenced  regions  of  memory   is  sometimes  pre- sented as a panacea. It is not. In particular, resources that are not pure memory can be leaked by a garbage collector. Examples are ﬁle handles, thread handles, and locks. I see garbage collection as a convenient last resort after the usual techniques for preventing leaks have been exhausted:  [1]  Use resource  handles  with  the  proper  semantics  for  an  application  whenever possible. The standard library provides string, vector, unordered_map, thread, lock_guard, and more. Move semantics allow such objects to be efﬁciently returned from a function.  [2]  Use unique_ptrs to hold on to objects that do not implicitly manage their own resources  such as pointers , need to be protected from premature deletion  because they don’t hav e proper  destructors ,  or  need  to  be  allocated  in  ways  that  require  special  attention  deleters .  [3]  Use shared_ptrs to hold objects that require shared ownership.  If consistently used, this sequence of techniques ensures the absence of leaks  i.e., no garbage col- lection is needed because no garbage is generated . However, in a very large number of real-world programs these techniques  all based on RAII; §13.3  are not consistently used and cannot be easily applied because they inv olve huge amounts of code structured in different ways.  These ‘‘different ways’’ often  involve complicated  pointer  uses,  naked news and deletes,  explicit  type  conversions that  obscure  resource  ownership,  and  similar  error-prone  low-level techniques.  In such  cases,  a garbage collector is an appropriate last resort. It can reclaim recycle memory, even if it cannot han- dle non-memory resources. Don’t even think of using general ‘‘ﬁnalizers’’ called at collection time to try to deal with non-memory resources. A garbage collector can sometimes extend the running time for leaking systems  even systems that leak non-memory resources  signiﬁcantly. For exam- ple, a garbage collector might extend the time between resource exhaustion from hours to days for a system that is taken down every night for maintenance. Also, a garbage collector can be instru- mented to ﬁnd the sources of leaks.  It is worth remembering that a garbage-collected system can have its own variants of leaks. For example, if we put a pointer to an object into a hash table and forget its key, the object is de facto leaked.  Similarly, a resource  referred  to  by  an  inﬁnite  thread  can  live  forever,  even if the  thread wasn’t meant  to  be  inﬁnite   e.g.,  it  could  be  waiting  for  input  that  never arrives .  Sometimes, resources ‘‘living’’ for an excessive time can be as bad for a system as a permanent leak.   Section 34.5  The Garbage Collection Interface  1003  From this basic philosophy it follows that garbage collection is optional in C++. A garbage col- lector will not be invoked unless explicitly installed and activated.  A garbage collector is not even a required  part  of  a  standard  C++  implementation,  but  good  free  and  commercial  collectors  are available.  C++ provides a deﬁnition of what a garbage collector can do if one is used and an ABI  Application Binary Interface  to help control its actions.  The  rules  for  pointers  and  lifetimes  are  expressed  in  terms  of safely-derived  pointers  §iso.3.7.4.3 .  A safely-derived pointer is  roughly  ‘‘a pointer to something allocated by new or to a subobject thereof.’’  Here are some examples of pointers that are not safely derived, also known as disguised pointers. Make a pointer point ‘‘elsewhere’’ for a while:     can webesure that the int is still there?     not evenpor table     can webesure that the int is still there?  Write a pointer to a ﬁle and read it back later:  int∗ p = new int[100]; p+=10;    ... collector mayrun here ... p −= 10; ∗p = 10;   Hide the pointer in an int:  int∗ p = new int; int x = reinterpret_cast  p ; p = nullptr;    ... collector mayrun here ... p = reinterpret_cast  x ; ∗p = 10;   int∗ p = new int; cout << p; p = nullptr;    ... collector mayrun here ... cin >> p; ∗p = 10;   using Link = pair ;  long xor Link∗ pre, Link∗ suc  {     can webesure that the int is still there?  Use the ‘‘xor trick’’ to compress doubly-linked lists:  static_assert sizeof Link∗ <=sizeof long ,"a long is smaller than a pointer" ; return long{pre}ˆlong{suc};  }  }  void insert_between Value val, Link∗ pre, Link∗ suc  {  Link∗ p = new Link{val,xor pre ,suc }; pre−>second = xor xor pre−>second,suc ,p ; suc−>second = xor p,xor suc−>second,pre  ;   1004  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  Using that trick, no undisguised pointers to links are stored.  Don’t use such tricks in a program you want to be considered well behaved and comprehensible to ordinary mortals – even if you don’t plan to use a garbage collector. There are many more and ev en nastier tricks, such as scattering the bits of a pointer around in different words.  There are legitimate reasons to disguise pointers  e.g., the xor trick in exceptionally memory-  constrained applications , but not as many as some programmers think.  A disguised pointer can still be found by a careful garbage collector if its bitpattern is stored in memory with a wrong type  e.g., long or char[4]  and is still properly aligned. Such pointers are called traceable.  The standard library allows a programmer to specify where there are no pointers to be found  e.g.,  in  an  image   and  what  memory  should  not  be  reclaimed  even if the  collector  can’t ﬁnd  a pointer into it  §iso.20.6.4 :  void declare_reachable void∗ p ;  template   T∗ undeclare_reachable T∗ p ;      the object pointed to bypmust not be collected     undo a declare_reachable    void declare_no_pointers char∗ p, size_t n ; void undeclare_no_pointers char∗ p, size_t n ;     p[0:n  holds no pointers    undo a declare_no_pointers    C++ garbage collectors have  traditionally been conservative collectors; that is, they do not move objects around in memory and have to assume that every word in memory might contain a pointer. Conservative garbage collection is more efﬁcient than it is reputed to be, especially when a program doesn’t generate much garbage, but declare_no_pointers   can make it very efﬁcient by safely elimi- nating large parts of memory from consideration. For example, we might use declare_no_pointers   to tell the collector where our photographic images are in an application, so as to allow the collec- tor to ignore potentially gigabytes of non-pointer data.  A programmer can inquire which rules for pointer safety and reclamation are in force:  enum class pointer_safety {relaxed, preferred, strict };  pointer_safety get_pointer_safety  ;  The  standard  says   §iso.3.7.4.3 :  ‘‘a  pointer  value  that  is  not  a  safely-derived pointer  value  is  an invalid pointer value unless the referenced complete object is of dynamic storage duration and has previously been declared reachable ... the effect of using an invalid pointer value  including passing it to a deallocation function  is undeﬁned.’’  The enumerators mean:  cid:129   relaxed: Safely-derived and not safely-derived pointers are treated equivalently  as in C and C++98 . Collect every object that does not have a safely derived or traceable pointer to it. preferred: Like relaxed, but a garbage collector may be running as a leak detector and or a detector of dereferences of ‘‘bad pointers.’’ strict: Safely-derived and  not  safely-derived pointers  may  be  treated  differently;  that  is,  a garbage collector may be running and will ignore pointers that’s not safely derived.   cid:129    cid:129   There is no standard way of saying which alternative you prefer. Consider that a quality-of-imple- mentation issue or a programming environment issue.   Section 34.6  Uninitialized Memory  1005  34.6  Uninitialized Memory Most of the time, it is best to avoid uninitialized memory. Doing so simpliﬁes programming and eliminates many kinds of errors. However,  in relatively rare cases, such as when writing memory allocators, implementing containers, and dealing directly with hardware, direct use of uninitialized memory, also known as raw memory, is essential.  In addition to the standard allocator, the   header provides the ﬁll∗ family of functions for dealing with uninitialized memory  §32.5.6 . They share the dangerous and occasionally essen- tial property of using a type name T to refer to space sufﬁcient to hold an object of type T rather than to a properly constructed object of type T. These functions are intended primarily for imple- menters  of  containers  and  algorithms. For example, reserve   and resize   are  most  easily  imple- mented using these functions  §13.6 .  34.6.1  Temporary Buffers Algorithms often require temporary space to perform acceptably. Often, such temporary space is best  allocated  in  one  operation  but  not  initialized  until  a  particular  location  is  actually  needed. Consequently, the library provides a pair of functions for allocating and deallocating uninitialized space:  template   pair  get_temporar y_buffer ptrdiff_t ;     allocate,don’t initialize  template   void return_temporary_buffer T∗ ;      deallocate,don’t destroy  A get_temporar y_buffer  n  operation tries to allocate space for n or more objects of type X. If it succeeds  in  allocating  some  memory, it returns  a  pointer  to  the  ﬁrst  uninitialized  space  and  the number of objects of type X that will ﬁt into that space; otherwise, the second value of the pair is zero.  The idea is that a system may keep space ready for fast allocation so that requesting space for n objects of a given size may yield space for more than n. It may also yield less, however, so one way of using get_temporar y_buffer   is to optimistically ask for a lot and then use what happens to be available.  A buffer obtained by get_temporar y_buffer   must be freed for other use by a call of return_tem- porary_buffer  . Just as get_temporar y_buffer   allocates without constructing, return_temporary_buf- fer   frees  without  destroying.  Because get_temporar y_buffer   is  low-level and  likely  to  be  opti- mized  for  managing  temporary  buffers,  it  should  not  be  used  as  an  alternative  to new or alloca- tor::allocate   for obtaining longer-term storage.  34.6.2 raw_storage_iterator The standard algorithms that write into a sequence assume that the elements of that sequence have been  previously  initialized. That  is,  the  algorithms  use  assignment  rather  than  copy construction for writing. Consequently, we cannot use uninitialized memory as the immediate target of an algo- rithm.  This can  be  unfortunate  because  assignment  can  be  signiﬁcantly  more  expensive  than initialization, and to initialize immediately before overwriting is a waste.  The solution is to use a raw_storage_iterator from   that initializes instead of assigns:   1006  Memory and Resources   Chapter 34  template  class raw_storage_iterator : public iterator  {  Out p;  public:  explicit raw_storage_iterator Out pp  : p{pp} { } raw_storage_iterator& operator∗   { return ∗this; }  raw_storage_iterator& operator= const T& val  {     place val in *p  §11.2.4   new &∗p  T{val};  return ∗this;  raw_storage_iterator& operator++   {++p; return ∗this; } raw_storage_iterator operator++ int  {     pre-increment    post-increment  }  }  auto t = ∗this; ++p; return t;  void test1   {  };  }  A raw_storage_iterator should never be used to write to initialized data. This tends to limit its use to the depth of implementations of containers and algorithms. Consider generating a set of permuta- tions  §32.5.5  of strings for use in testing:  auto pp = get_temporar y_buffer  1000 ;  if  pp.second<1000  {     ... handle allocation failure ...     get uninitialized space  } auto p = raw_storage_iterator  pp.ﬁrst ;     the iterator generate_n p,a.siz e  ,  [&]{ next_permutation seed,seed+siz eof seed −1 ; return seed; } ;     ... return_temporary_buffer p ;  This is a somewhat contrived example because I see nothing wrong in allocating default initialized storage for the strings and then assigning the test strings. Also, it fails to use RAII  §5.2, §13.3 .  Note that there are no == or != operators for raw_storage_iterator, so don’t try to use it to write to a [b:e  range.  For  example iota b,e,0   §40.6   will  not  work  if b and e are raw_storage_iterators. Don’t mess with uninitialized memory unless you absolutely have to.

All chrono facilities are in the std::chrono  sub namespace, so we have to either explicitly qualify with chrono:: or add a using-directive:  using namespace std::chrono;  We  often  want  to  time  things  or  to  do  things  that  depend  on  timing. For example,  the  standard- library mutexes and locks provide the option for a thread to wait for a period of time  a duration  or to wait until a given point in time  a time_point .   1010  Utilities  Chapter 35  If  you  want  to  know the  current time_point, you  can  call now   for  one  of  three  clocks: sys-  tem_clock, steady_clock, high_resolution_clock. For example:  steady_clock::time_point t = steady_clock::now  ;    ... do something ... steady_clock::duration d = steady_clock::now  −t;      something took d time units  A clock returns a time_point, and a duration is the difference between two time_points from the same clock.  As usual, if you are not interested in details, auto is your friend:  auto t = steady_clock::now  ;    ... do something ... auto d = steady_clock::now  −t;  cout   d .count   << "ms";     something took d time units     printas milliseconds  The time facilities here are intended to efﬁciently support uses deep in the system; they do not pro- vide  convenience  facilities  to  help  you  maintain  your  social  calendar. In fact,  the  time  facilities originated with the stringent needs of high-energy physics.  It turns out that ‘‘time’’ is far more complicated to deal with than we usually think. For exam- ple, we have leap seconds, clocks that are not accurate and must be adjusted  possibly causing time as reported by a clock to go backward , clocks of differing precision, etc. Furthermore, language facilities for dealing with short time spans  e.g., nanoseconds  must not themselves take signiﬁcant time.  Consequently, the chrono facilities are not simple, but many uses of those facilities can be very simple.  The C-style time utilities can be found in §43.6.  35.2.1 duration In  , the standard library provides type duration to represent the time between two points in time  time_points §35.2.2 :  template > class duration { public:  using rep = Rep; using period = Period;    ...  };  duration   §iso.20.11.5   duration d {}; duration d {r};  duration d {d2};  d=d2  r=d.count     Default constructor: d becomes {Rep{},Period{}}; constexpr Constructor from r; r must be convertible to Rep without narrowing; constexpr; explicit Copy constructor: d gets the same value as d2; d2 must be convertible to Rep without narrowing; constexpr d gets the same value as d2; d2 must be representable as a Rep r is the number of clock ticks in d; constexpr  We can deﬁne a duration with a speciﬁc period value.  For example:   Section 35.2.1  duration  1011  duration  d1 {7}; duration  d2 {3.33}; duration > d3 {};     7milliseconds    3.33 picoseconds    0seconds  A duration’s period holds the number of clock ticks of the period.  cout << d1.count   << '\n'; cout << d2.count   << '\n'; cout << d3.count   << '\n';     7    3.33    0  Naturally, the value of count   depends on the period:  d2=d1; cout << d1.count   << '\n'; cout << d2.count   << '\n'; if  d1!=d2  cerr<<"insane!";     7    7e+009  Here, d1 and d2 are equal but report very different count   values.  Care is taken to avoid truncation or loss of precision during initialization  even if the {} notation  is not used . For example:  duration  d {3}; duration  d {3.5};     OK    error :3.5 to int is narrowing  duration  ms {3}; duration  us {ms}; duration  ms2 {us};     OK    error :we could lose manymicroseconds  The standard library provides meaningful arithmetic operations on durations:  duration   continued   §iso.20.11.5   r is a Rep; arithmetic is done in the common_type of the representations  ++d  d++  −−d  d−−  +d  −d  d+=d2  d−=d2  d%=d2  d%=r  d∗=r  d =r   ++d.r duration{d.r++} −−d.r duration{d.r−−} d duration{−d.r} d.r+=d2.r d.r−=d2.r d.r%=d2.r.count   d.r+=r d.r+=r d.r+=r  The period is a unit system, so there is no = or += taking a plain value.  Allowing that would be like allowing the addition of 5 of an unknown SI unit to a length in meters. Consider:   1012  Utilities  Chapter 35  duration  d1 {7}; d1 += 5;     error     7milliseconds  duration > d2 {7}; d2 = 5; d2 += 5;     error    error     7seconds  What would 5 mean here? 5 seconds? 5 milliseconds?  Something else?  If you know what you mean, be explicit about it. For example:  d1 += duration {5};    OK: milliseconds d3 += decltype d2 {5};      OK: seconds  Arithmetic involving durations with different representations is allowed as long as the combination makes sense  §35.2.4 :  duration   continued   §iso.20.11.5   r is a Rep; arithmetic is done in the common_type of the representations  d3=d+d2 d3=d−d2 d3=d%d2 d2=d%r  d2=d∗x d2=r∗d d2=d x   constexpr constexpr constexpr d2=d%r.count  ; constexpr x is a duration or a Rep; constexpr constexpr x is a duration or a Rep; constexpr  Comparisons  between  and  explicit  conversion  between durations with  compatible  representations are supported:  duration   continued   §iso.20.11.5   d=zero    d=min    d=max    d==d2 d!=d2  d<d2 d<=d2  d>d2 d>=d2  d2=duration_cast  d   The 0 for Rep: d=duration{duration_values ::z ero  }; constexpr The smallest Rep value  less than or equal to zero   : d=duration{duration_values ::min  }; constexpr The largest Rep value  larger than or equal to zero   : d=duration{duration_values ::max  }; constexpr Comparison is done in the common_type of d and d2; constexpr ! d==d2  Comparison is done in the common_type of d and d2; constexpr ! d>d2  Comparison is done in the common_type of d and d2; constexpr ! d<d2  Convert duration d to duration type D; no implicit conversions are used for the representation or period; constexpr  The standard library provides some convenience aliases using the SI units from    §35.3 :   Section 35.2.1  duration  1013  Here, siN means ‘‘an implementation-deﬁned signed integer type of at least N bits.’’  The duration_cast is used to get a duration with a known unit of measurement. For example:  using nanoseconds = duration ; using microseconds = duration ; using milliseconds = duration ; using seconds = duration ; using minutes = duration >; using hours = duration >;  auto t1 = system_clock::now  ; f x ;     do something auto t2 = system_clock::now  ;  auto dms = duration_cast  t2−t1 ; cout << "f x  took " << dms.count   << " milliseconds\n";  auto ds = duration_cast  t2−t1 ; cout << "f x  took " << ds.count   << " seconds\n";  The reason we need a cast in this example is that we are throwing away information: on the system I used, the system_clock counts in nanoseconds.  Alternatively, we can simply  try to  construct a suitable duration:  auto t1 = system_clock::now  ; f x ;     do something auto t2 = system_clock::now  ;  cout << "f x  took " << milliseconds t2−t1 .count   << " milliseconds\n"; cout << "f x  took " << microseconds t2−t1 .count   << " microseconds\n";     error :tr uncation  The precision of a clock is implementation-dependent.  35.2.2 time_point In  , the  standard  library  provides  type time_point to  represent  a  point  in  time  of  a  given epoch as measured by a given clock:  template  class time_point { public:  using clock = Clock; using duration = Duration; using rep = typename duration::rep; using period = typename duration::period;    ...  };  An epoch is a range of time determined by a clock, measured in terms of a duration, starting at the duration::zero  :   1014  Utilities  Chapter 35  time_point   §iso.20.11.6   time_point tp {}; time_point tp {d}; time_point tp {tp2};  d=tp.time_since_epoch    tp=tp2   Default constructor: start of epoch: duration::zero   Constructor: time point d of epoch: time_point{}+d; explicit Constructor: tp refers to the same point in time as tp2; tp2’s duration type must be implicitly convertible to tp’s d is tp’s stored duration tp refers to the same point in time as tp2; tp2’s duration type must be implicitly convertible to tp’s  For example:  void test   {  time_point  tp1 milliseconds 100  ; time_point  tp2 microseconds 100∗1000  ;  tp1=tp2;  tp2=tp1;      error :would truncate    OK  if  tp1!=tp2  cerr << "Insane!";  }  As for durations, meaningful arithmetic and comparisons are supported for time_points:  time_point   continued   §iso.20.11.6   tp+=d tp−=d tp2=tp+d  tp2=d+tp  tp2=tp−d  d=tp−tp2  tp2=tp.min    tp2=tp.max    tp==tp2  tp!=tp2  tp<tp2  tp<=tp2  tp>tp2  tp>=tp2  tp2=time_point_cast  tp   Move tp forward: tp.d+=d Move tp backward: tp.d−=d tp2=time_point {tp.time_since_epoc  +d} tp2=time_point {d+tp.time_since_epoc  } tp2=time_point {tp.time_since_epoc  −d} d=duration{tp.time_since_epoc  −tp2.time_since_epoc  } tp2=time_point duration::min   ; static; constexpr tp2=time_point duration::max   ; static; constexpr tp.time_since_epoch  ==tp2.time_since_epoch   ! tp==tp2  tp.time_since_epoch  <tp2.time_since_epoch   ! tp2<tp  tp2<tp ! tp<tp2  Convert the time_point tp to time_point : time_point  duration_cast  t.time_since_epoch      For example:   Section 35.2.2  void test2   {  time_point  1015  auto tp = steady_clock::now  ; auto d1 = time_point_cast  tp .time_since_epoch  .count   24;     days since startofepoch  using days = duration >;  auto d2 = time_point_cast  tp .time_since_epoch  .count  ;      aday’s duration    days since startofepoch  if  d1!=d2  cout << "Impossible!\n";  The time_point operations that do not access a clock can be constexpr, but are not currently guaran- teed to be so.  35.2.3  Clocks The time_point and duration values are ultimately obtained from hardware clocks. In  , the standard  library  provides  basic  interfaces  for  clocks. Class system_clock represents  ‘‘wall  clock time’’ as obtained from a system’s real-time clock:  class system_clock { public:  using rep =  * implementation-deﬁned signed type* ; using period =  * implementation-deﬁned ratio * ; using duration = chrono::duration ; using time_point = chrono::time_point ;    ...  All data and function members are static. We don’t explicitly deal with clock objects. Instead, we use clock types:  Clock Members  §iso.20.11.7   is_steady  tp=now    t=to_time_t tp   tp=from_time_t t    Is this clock type steady? That is, is c.now  <=c.now   for all consecutive calls of now   and is the time between clock ticks constant? static tp is system_clock’s time_point for the time of call; noexcept t is the time_t  §43.6  for the time_point tp; noexcept tp is the time_point for the time_t t; noexcept  For example:  void test3   {  auto t1 = system_clock::now  ; f x ;     do something auto t2 = system_clock::now  ; cout   t2−t1 .count   << " ms";  }  };  }   1016  Utilities  Chapter 35  A system provides three named clocks:  system_clock  steady_clock  high_resolution_clock  Clock Types  §iso.20.11.7   The system’s real-time clock; the system’s clock may be reset  jump forward or backward  to match external clocks A clock where time moves steadily forward; that is, time does not go backward and the time between clock ticks is constant A clock with the shortest time increment on a system  These three clocks need not be different; a standard-library clock name may be an alias.  We can determine the basic properties of the clocks like this:  cout << "min " << system_clock::duration::min  .count    << ", max " << system_clock::duration::max  .count    ::value ? "FP" : "integral"  << '\n';  cout <<  system_clock::is_steady?"steady\n": "not steady\n" ;  When I ran it on one of my systems, this produced:  min −9223372036854775808, max 9223372036854775807, integral not steady  Different systems and different clocks can give different results.  35.2.4  Time Traits Implementations of the chrono facilities depend on a few standard facilities, collectively known as time traits.  The conversion rules for duration and time_point depend on whether their representation is ﬂoat-  ing-point  so that rounding is acceptable  or integral:  template  struct treat_as_ﬂoating_point : is_ﬂoating  { };  A few standard values are provided:  duration_values   §iso.20.11.4.2  r=Rep 0 ; static; constexpr r=numeric_limits ::lowest  ; static; constexpr r=numeric_limits ::max  ; static; constexpr  r=zero    r=min    r=max     The common type of two durations is determined by computing their greatest common denominator  GCD :  template  struct common_type , duration > {  using type = duration ::type, GCD > ;  };   Section 35.2.4  Time Traits   1017  This makes type an alias for the duration with the largest possible tick period so that both duration arguments  will  convert  to  it  without  requiring  a  division  operation. This  implies  that com- mon_type ::type can hold any value from duration  and duration  without truncation error. Howev er, ﬂoating-point durations may have round-off errors.  template  struct common_type , time_point > {  using type = time_point ::type>;  In  words,  to  have  a common_type, two time_points must  have  a  common  clock  type. Their com- mon_type is a time_point with the common_type of their durations.  35.3  Compile-Time Rational Arithmetic In  , we ﬁnd  class ratio, which  provides  compile-time  rational  arithmetic.

Similarly, to help express unit values, the standard library provides common SI magnitude names:     conditionally supported     conditionally supported  using yocto  using zepto  using atto using femto  using pico using nano using micro using milli using centi using deci using deca using hecto using kilo using mega using giga using tera using peta using exa  using zetta  using yotta   = ratio ;  = ratio ;  = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ; = ratio ;  = ratio ;   For an example of use, see §35.2.1.     conditionally supported     conditionally supported  35.4  Type Functions In  , the  standard  library  provides  type  functions   §28.2   to  determine  properties  of types  type traits; §35.4.1  and to generate new types from existing ones  type generators; §35.4.2 . These  type  functions  are  primarily  used  at  compile  time  to  support  simple,  and  not  so  simple, metaprogramming.  35.4.1  Type Traits In  , the standard library provides a large set of type functions that allow a programmer to determine properties of a type or a pair of types. Their names are mostly self-explanatory. The primary type predicates test fundamental properties of a type:  Primary Type Predicates  §iso.20.9.4.1   is_void  is_integral  is_ﬂoating_point  is_array  is_pointer   Is X void? Is X an integral type? Is X a ﬂoating-point type? Is X a built-in array? Is X a pointer  not including pointers to members ?   Section 35.4.1  Type Traits   1019  Primary Type Predicates  continued   §iso.20.9.4.1   is_lvalue_reference  is_rvalue_reference  is_member_object_pointer  is_member_function_pointer  is_enum  is_union  is_class  is_function   Is X an lvalue reference? Is X an rvalue reference? Is X a pointer to a non-static data member? Is X a pointer to a non-static member function? Is X an enum  either plain of class enum ? Is X a union? Is X a class  including structs, but not enums ? Is X a function?  A type trait returns a value that is used as a Boolean. To  access that value, use the sufﬁx ::value. For example:  template  void f T& a  {  static_assert std::is_ﬂoating_point ::value ,"FP type expected" ;    ...  If you tire of the ::value notation, deﬁne a constexpr function  §28.2.2 :  template  constexpr bool Is_ﬂoating_point    {  return std::is_ﬂoating_point ::value;  template  void f T& a  {  static_assert Is_ﬂoating_point   ,"FP type expected" ;    ...  }  }  }  Ideally, use a library that provides such functions for all standard library type traits.  Some type functions inquire about a combination of fundamental properties:  Composite Type Predicates  §iso.20.9.4.2   is_reference  is_arithmetic  is_fundamental  is_object  is_scalar  is_compound  is_member_pointer   Is x a reference  lvalue or rvalue reference ? Is x an arithmetic type  integral or ﬂoating-point; §6.2.1 ? Is x a fundamental type  §6.2.1 ? Is x an object type  not a function ? Is x a scalar type  not a class or a function ? Is x a compound type  !is_fundamental  ? Is x a pointer to a non-static data or function member?  These composite  type  predicates simply  offer  notational  convenience.  For  example, ence  is true if X is either an lvalue reference or an rvalue reference.  is_refer-   Like the primary type predicates, type property predicates provide tests for fundamental aspects  Chapter 35  1020  Utilities  of a type:  Type property predicates  §iso.20.9.4.3   is_const  is_volatile  is_trivial  is_trivially_copyable   is_standard_layout  is_pod  is_literal_type  is_empty  is_polymorphic  is_abstract  is_signed  is_unsigned  is_constructible  is_default_constructible  is_copy_constructible  is_move_constructible  is_assignable  is_copy_assignable  is_move_assignable  is_destructible   Is X a const? Is X a volatile  §41.4 ? Is X a trivial type  §8.2.6 ? Can X be copied, moved, and destroyed as a simple collection of bits  §8.2.6 ? Is X a standard-layout type  §8.2.6 ? Is X a POD  §8.2.6 ? Does X have a constexpr constructor  §10.4.3 ? Does X have a member that requires space in an object? Does X have a virtual function? Does X have a pure virtual function? Is X an arithmetic type and signed? Is X an arithmetic type and unsigned? Can an X be constructed from args? Can an X be constructed from {}? Can an X be constructed from an X&? Can an X be constructed from an X&&? Can a Y be assigned to an X? Can a X& be assigned to an X? Can a X&& be assigned to an X? Can an X be destroyed  i.e., ˜X   has not been deleted ?  For example:  template  class Cont {  T∗ elem;     store elements in an array pointed to byelem int sz;    ... Cont const Cont& a      copyconstr uctor     sz elements  :sz a.sz , elem new T[a.elem]   {  static_assert Is_copy_constructable   ,"Cont::Cont  : no copy" ; if  Is_trivially_copyable      memcpy elem,a.elem,sz∗sizeof T  ;     memcopyoptimization  uninitialized_copy a.begin  ,a.end  ,elem ;      use copyconstr uctors  else  }    ...  }  This optimization may be unnecessary, though, because uninitialized_copy   is likely to already have been optimized in this way.   Section 35.4.1  Type Traits   1021  For a class to be empty, it can have no virtual functions, no virtual bases, and no base classes for  which !is_empty ::value.  The  type  property  predicates  don’t do access  checking  depending  on  where  they are  used. Instead, they consistently give the result you would expect for a use outside members and friends. For example:  class X { public:  private:  void inside  ;  X& operator= const X& ; ˜X  ;  void X::inside   {  void outside   {  cout  ::value << '\n'; cout  ::value << '\n';  cout  ::value << '\n'; cout  ::value << '\n';  Both inside   and outside   will write 00 to report that an X is neither destructible nor copy assigna- ble.  Also, if you want to eliminate an operation, use =delete  §17.6.4  rather than relying as private.

The type relations are predicated on two types:  is_same  is_base_of  is_conver tible   Type Relations  §iso.20.9.6  Is X the same type as Y? Is X a base of Y? Can an X be implicitly converted to a Y?  For example:  template  void draw T t  {  static_assert Is_same     Is_base_of >  , "" ; t−>draw  ;  }  }   Section 35.4.2  Type Generators  1023  35.4.2  Type Generators In  , the standard library provides type functions for producing a type given other types as arguments.  remove_const  remove_volatile  remove_cv  add_const  add_volatile  struct add_cv   const and volatile Modiﬁcation  §iso.20.9.7.1  Like X, but with any top-level const removed Like X, but with any top-level volatile removed Like X, but with any top-level const or volatile removed If X is a reference, function, or const, then X; otherwise const X If X is a reference, function, or volatile, then X; otherwise volatile X Add const and volatile: add_const ::type>::type  A type transformer returns a type. To access that type, use the sufﬁx ::type. For example:  template  class My_map { {  pair ::type ,V> default_node;    ...  };  };  If you tire of the ::type deﬁne a type alias  §28.2.1 :  template  using Add_const = typename add_const ::type;  template  class My_map { {  pair ,V> default_node;    ...  Ideally, use a support library that provides such aliases systematically for the standard-library type transformers.

The  type  functions  for  adding  and  removing  references  are  important  for  when  writing  tem-  plates that should work with an argument that may be reference or not. For example:   1024  Utilities  Chapter 35     copyofv    maybe copyofv;maybe a reference to x    increment local var iable  template  void f T v  {  Remove_reference  x = v; T y = v; ++x;  ++y;    ...  }  }  void user   {  int val = 7; f val ;  f 7 ;   Here, x really is a copy of v, but if T is a reference type, y is a reference to v:     call f   : the ++y in f   will increment val    call f   : the ++y in f will increment a local copy  In both calls, ++x will increment a local copy.  make_signed   make_unsigned   Sign Modiﬁcation  §iso.20.9.7.3  Remove any  explicit or implied  unsigned modiﬁer and add signed; X must be an integral type  except bool or an enumeration  Remove any  explicit or implied  signed modiﬁer and add unsigned; X must be an integral type  except bool or an enumeration   For built-in arrays, we sometimes want to get the element type or to remove a dimension:  Array Modiﬁcation  §iso.20.9.7.4   remove_extent  remove_all_extents   If X is an array type, the element type; otherwise X If X is an array type, the base type  after removing all array modiﬁers ; otherwise X  For example:  int a[10][20]; Remove_extent  a10; Remove_all_extents  i;     an array[10]    an int  We can make a pointer type pointing to an arbitrary type, or ﬁnd the pointed-to type:  Pointer Modiﬁcation  §iso.20.9.7.5   remove_pointer  add_pointer    If X is a pointer type, the pointed-to type; otherwise X remove_reference ::type∗  For example:   Section 35.4.2  Type Generators  1025  template  void f T x  {  Add_pointer  p = new Remove_reference {}; T∗ p = new T{};     ...     would not wor kif T is a reference  }  };  When dealing with memory at the lowest levels of a system, we must sometimes consider align- ment  §6.2.9 :  Alignments  §iso.20.9.7.6   aligned_storage   aligned_storage    aligned_union   A POD type with size of at least n and whose alignment is a divisor of a aligned_storage  where def is the largest alignment required for any object type, T, with sizeof T <=n A POD type with size of at least n that can hold a union with members of type X  The standard mentions this as a possible implementation of aligned_storage:  template  struct aligned_storage {  using type = struct { alignas A  unsigned char data[N]; };     Nchars aligned to A  §6.2.9   The  ﬁnal  type  functions  for  type  selection,  computing  common  types,  etc.  are  arguably  the  most useful:  Other Transformations  §iso.20.9.7.6   enable_if    enable_if   conditional   common_type   underlying_type   result_of   X if b==true; otherwise there is no member ::type, leading to substitution failure  §23.5.3.2  for most uses enable_if  T if b==true; otherwise F The common type of all types of a parameter pack X; two types are common if they can be used as true and false types of a ?:-expression X’s underlying type  §8.4 ; X must be an enumeration The type of the result of F X ; FX must be a type F X  where F is invoked with an argument list X  For examples of enable_if and conditional, see §28.3.1.1 and §28.4.  It is often useful to ﬁnd a type that can be used for operations on more than one type, such as the  result  of  an  addition  of  two values  of  related  but  different  types. The  type  function com- mon_type ﬁnds such common types. A type is the common type of itself  obviously :   1026  Utilities  Chapter 35  template  struct common_type;  template  struct common_type  {  using type = T;  The common type of two types is what the rules for ?:  §11.1.3  give us:  template  struct common_type  {  using type = decltype true ? declval    : declval    ;  The declval    type function returns the type of an unevaluated variable of type T.  The common type for N types is found by applying the rules for N==1 and N==2 recursively:  template  struct common_type  {  using type = typename common_type ::type , V...>::type;  For example:  template  using Common_type = typename common_type ::type;  Common_type  x1; Common_type  x2; Common_type  x3; Common_type  x4;  Common_type  x5;      x1 is a double    error :no common type    x3 is a long long    x4 is a Shape*    x5 is a void*  Result_of is used to extract the type of the result of a callable type:  int ff int  { return 2; }     function  typedef  bool  ∗PF  int ;   struct Fct {  double operator   string ; string operator   int,int ;     pointer to function     function object  auto fx = [] char ch  { return tolower ch ; };     lambda  Result_of  r1 = 7; Result_of  r2 = true; Result_of  r3 = 9.9; Result_of  r4 = "Hero";  Result_of  r5 = 'a';     r1 is a int    r2 is a bool    r3 is a double    r4 is a string    r5 is a char  };  };  };  };   Section 35.4.2  Type Generators  1027  Note that Result_of can distinguish between the two versions of Fct::operator    .  Curiously enough, the same does not apply to nonmember functions. For example:  int f  ; string f int ; Result_of  r1 = 7;     function     error :no overload resolution for pointer to function  Unfortunately, we don’t do overload  resolution  for  pointers  to  functions,  but  why did  I  use Result_of in such a roundabout way, instead of:  Result_of  r1 = 7;  Result_of  r1 = 7; Result_of  r2 = 7;  Result_of  r3 = 7;     error :no argument speciﬁcation,    and ff is a function rather than a type    error :the argument to Result_of must be a type    error :decltype f  is a function type    rather than a pointer to function type    OK: r3 is an int  Naturally, Result_of is usually found in templates where we can’t easily look up the answer in the program text.  For example:  template  auto temp F f, A a  −> Result_of  {     ...  void f4   {  temp ff,1 ; temp fx,'a' ; temp Fct  ,"Ulysses" ;  }  }  }  Note that the function ff is converted to a pointer function in the call, so the reliance on pointers to functions in Result_of isn’t as odd as it may seem at ﬁrst.  declval    §iso.20.2.4   declval     Returns an rvalue for T: typename add_r value_reference ::type; never use a return value of declval  The declval   type function is unusual in the standard library because it is actually a function  with- out  users  needing  to  wrap  it . It  returns  a  value  that  must  never be used.  The intent  is  to  use declval  as a type where the type of a variable of type X is needed. For example:  template  void array  swap array& y  noexcept noexcept swap declval   , declval       {  for  int i=0; i<a.size  ; ++i  swap  ∗this [i],a[i] ;  See also the deﬁnition of common_type.   1028  Utilities  Chapter 35  35.5  Minor Utilities These utilities are minor in size, but not in importance. They don’t ﬁt into a larger grouping.  35.5.1 move   and forward   In  , we ﬁnd some of the most useful small functions:  Other Transformations  §iso.20.9.7.6   x2=forward x   x2=move x   x2=move_if_noexcept x   x2 is an rvalue; x may not be an lvalue; noexcept x2 is an rvalue; noexcept If x can be moved, x2=move x ; otherwise x2=x; noexcept  A move   is simply a cast to an rvalue:  template  Remove_reference && move T&& t  noexcept {  return static_cast &&> t ;  In my opinion, move   should have been called rvalue  , because it doesn’t actually move anything. Instead, it produces an rvalue for its argument, so that the object referred to can be moved from.  A move   is used to tell the compiler that an object will not be used anymore in a context, so that its value can be moved and an empty object left behind. The simplest example is the implementa- tion of swap    §35.5.2 .  }  }  }  A forward   produces an rvalue from an rvalue only:  template  T&& forward Remove_reference & t  noexcept {  return static_cast  t ;  template  T&& forward Remove_reference && t  noexcept; {  static_assert !Is_lvalue_reference ,"forward of lvalue" ; return static_cast  t ;  This  pair  of forward   functions  are  meant  always  to  be  available  together, and  selection  between them should be done by overload resolution. In that case, any lvalue goes to the ﬁrst version and ev ery rvalue to the second. For example:  int i = 7; forward i ;  forward 7 ;      call ﬁrst version    call second version  The assert is there for programmer who are too clever for their own good and calls the second ver- sion with an explicit template argument and an lvalue.   Section 35.5.1  move   and forward    1029  The archetypical use of forward   is for ‘‘perfect forwarding’’ of an argument from one function to another  §23.5.2.1, §28.6.3 . The standard-library make_shared  x   §34.3.2  is a good exam- ple.  Use move   when the intent is to ‘‘steal the representation’’ of an object with a move operation, and use forward   for forwarding.  Thus, forward x  is safe, whereas move x  marks x for destruction so that move x  should be used with care. The only safe use of an x after a move x  is destruction or as  a  target  for  an  assignment. Obviously  a  particular  type  could  provide  further  guarantees,  and ideally the class’s inv ariant is left intact. However, don’t rely on that unless you really know.  35.5.2 swap   In  , the standard library provides a general swap   and a specialization for built-in arrays:  swap x,y   swap a1n,a2n    Other Transformations  §iso.20.2.2  Exchange the values of x and y; x and y are passed as non-const references; noexcept if x’s and y’s copy operations are noexcept a1n and a2n are passed as references to arrays: T & [N]; noexcept if ∗a1n and ∗a2n’s copy operations are noexcept  The relatively obvious implementation swap   is:  template  void swap T& a, T& b  noexcept Is_nothrow_move_constructible     && Is_nothrow_move_assignable      {  }  T tmp {move a }; a = move b ; b = move tmp ;  This implies that swap   cannot be used to exchange rvalues:  vector  v1 {1,2,3,4}; swap v,vecor {} ;  v.clear  ;      error :second argument is an rvalue    clearer  less obscure   35.5.3  Relational Operators In  , we ﬁnd relational operators for arbitrary types in a sub-namespace rel_ops:  Relational Operators in std::rel_ops  §iso.20.2.1   x!=y  x>y  x<=y  x>=y   ! x==y  y<x ! y<x  ! x<y   This requires that the programmer has made sure that x==y and x<y work.   Chapter 35  1030  Utilities  For example:  struct Val {  double d; bool operator== Val v  const { return v.d==d; }  void my_algo vector & vv  {  using namespace std::rel_ops;  for  int i=0; i<ww.siz e  ; ++i   if  0>ww[i]  ww[i]=abs ww[i] ;    OK: > from rel_ops  It can be hard to use rel_ops without polluting a namespace. In particular:  namespace Mine {  struct Val {  };  double d; bool operator== Val v  const { return v.d==d; }  using namespace std::rel_ops;  };  }  }  This could expose the perfectly general templates from rel_ops to be found by argument-dependent lookup  §14.2.4  and applied to types for which they may be inappropriate. A safer approach is to place using-directives in local scopes.  35.5.4  Comparing and Hashing type_info In  , the  standard  library  provides  support  for  comparing  and  hashing type_indexs.  A type_index is created from a type_info  §22.5 , speciﬁcally to allow such comparison and hashing.  type_index Operations  §iso.20.13   tip is a pointer to the type_info represented by a type_index  type_index ti {tinf};  ti==ti2  ti!=ti2  ti<ti2  ti<=ti2  ti>ti2  ti>=ti2  n=ti.hash_code    p=name    hash   ti represents the type_info tinf; noexcept ti and ti2 represent the same type_info: ∗ti.tip==∗ti2.tip ; noexcept ! ti==ti2 ; noexcept ti.tip−>before ti2.tip ; noexcept !ti2.tip−>before ti.tip ; noexcept ti2.tip−>before ti.tip ; noexcept !ti.tip−>before ti2.tip ; noexcept n=ti.tip−>hash_code   p = ti.tip−>name   A specialization of hash  §31.4.3.4   For example:   Section 35.5.4  Comparing and Hashing type_info  1031  unordered_map  types;    ... types[type_index{something}] = &typeid something ;  35.6  Advice [1]  Use   facilities, such as steady_clock, duration, and time_point for timing; §35.2.

Handling of different character sets, encodings, and conventions  locales  is discussed in Chapter 39.  A simpliﬁed string implementation is presented in §19.3.  36.2  Character Classiﬁcation The standard library provides classiﬁcation functions to help users to manipulate strings  and other character  sequences   and  traits  specifying  properties  of  a  character  type  to  help  implementers  of operations on strings.   1034   Strings  Chapter 36  36.2.1  Classiﬁcation Functions In  , the standard library provides functions to classify the characters from the basic execu- tion character set:  Character Classiﬁcation  isspace c   isalpha c  isdigit c  isxdigit c  isupper c  islower c  isalnum c   iscntrl c  ispunct c  isprint c  isgraph c    Is c whitespace  space ' ', horizontal tab '\t', newline '\n', vertical tab '\v', form feed '\f', carriage return '\r' ? Is c a letter  'a'..'z', 'A'..'Z' ? note: not underscore '_' Is c a decimal digit  '0'..'9' ? Is c hexadecimal digit  decimal digit or 'a'..'f' or 'A'..'F' ? Is c an uppercase letter? Is c a lowercase letter? isalpha c  or isdigit c  Is c a control character  ASCII 0..31 and 127 ? Is c not a letter, digit, whitespace, or invisible control character? Is c printable  ASCII ' '..'˜' ? isalpha c  or isdigit c  or ispunct c ? note: not space  In addition, the standard library provides two useful functions for removing case differences:  Upper- and Lowercase  toupper c   tolower c    c or c’s uppercase equivalent c or c’s lowercase equivalent  The equivalent functions for wide characters are provided in  .  The character classiﬁcation functions are sensitive to the "C" locale  §39.5.1, §39.5.2 . Equiv-  alent functions for other locales are provided in    §39.5.1 .  One reason that these character classiﬁcation functions are useful is that character classiﬁcation  can be trickier than it might appear. For example, a novice might write:  if  'a'<ch && ch<'z'      acharacter  This is more verbose  and most likely slower  than:  if  islower ch        alow ercase character  Also, there is no guarantee that the characters are contiguous in a code space. Furthermore, the use of standard character classiﬁcations are far easier to convert to another locale:  if  islower,danish       alow ercase character in Danish     assuming ‘‘danish’’isthe name for a Danish locale   Note that Danish has three more lowercase characters than English, so that the initial explicit test using 'a' and 'z' would be ﬂat wrong.   Section 36.2.2  Character Traits   1035  36.2.2  Character Traits As shown in §23.2, a string template can, in principle, use any type with proper copy operations as its character type. However, efﬁciency can be improved and implementations can be simpliﬁed for types that don’t hav e user-deﬁned copy operations.  Consequently, the standard string requires that a type used as its character type be a POD  §8.2.6 . This also helps to make I O of strings simple and efﬁcient.  The properties of a character type are deﬁned by its char_traits. A char_traits is a specialization  of the template:  template  struct char_traits { };  All char_traits are  deﬁned  in std, and  the  standard  ones  are  presented  in  . The  general char_traits itself  has  no  properties;  only char_traits specializations  for  a  particular  character  type have. Consider char_traits :  template  struct char_traits  {  using char_type = char; using int_type = int; using off_type = streamoff; using pos_type = streampos; using state_type = mbstate_t;    ...  };     char_traits operations should not throwexceptions     type of integer value of character    offset in stream    position in stream    multibyte stream state  §39.4.6   The standard provides four specializations of char_traits  §iso.21.2.3 :  template  struct char_traits ; template  struct char_traits ; template  struct char_traits ; template  struct char_traits ;  The members of the standard char_traits are all static functions:  char_traits  static Members  §iso.21.2   c=to_char_type i   i=to_int_type c   eq_int_type c,c2   eq c,c2  lt c,c2  i=compare p,p2,n  assign c,c2   p2=assign p,n,c  p3=move p,p2,n  p3=copy p,p2,n   int_type to char_type conversion char_type to int_type conversion to_int_type c ==to_int_type c2  Is c treated as equal to c2? Is c treated as less than c2? Lexicographical compare of [p:p+n  and [p2:p2+n  c=c2 for char_type Assign n copies of c to [p:p+n ; p2=p Copy [p:p+n  to [p2:p2+n ; [p:p+n  and [p2:p2+n  may overlap; p3=p Copy [p:p+n  to [p2:p2+n ; [p:p+n  and [p2:p2+n  may not overlap; p3=p   1036   Strings  Chapter 36  char_traits  static Members  §iso.21.2   n=length p    p2=ﬁnd p,n,c   i=eof    i=not_eof i    n is the number of characters in [p:q  where ∗q is the ﬁrst element so that eq q,charT{}  p points to the ﬁrst occurrence of c in [p:p+n  or nullptr i is the int_type value representing end-of-ﬁle i if !eq_int_type i,eof   ; otherwise i can be any value not equal to eof    Comparing with eq   is often not simply an ==. For example, a case-insensitive char_traits would deﬁne its eq   so that eq 'b','B'  would return true.  Because copy   does not protect against overlapping ranges, it may be faster than move  . The compare   function uses lt   and eq   to compare characters. It returns an int, where 0 repre- sents  an  exact  match,  a  negative  number  means  that  its  ﬁrst  argument  comes  lexicographically before the second, and a positive number means that its ﬁrst argument comes after its second.  The I O-related functions are used by the implementation of low-level I O  §38.6 .  36.3  Strings In  , the standard library provides a general string template basic_string:  template<typename C,  typename Tr = char_traits , typename A = allocator >  class basic_string { public:  using traits_type = Tr; using value_type = typename Tr::char_type; using allocator_type = A; using size_type = typename allocator_traits ::size_type; using difference_type = typename allocator_traits ::difference_type; using reference = value_type&; using const_reference = const value_type&; using pointer = typename allocator_traits ::pointer; using const_pointer = typename allocator_traits ::const_pointer; using iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using const_iterator =  * implementation-deﬁned* ; using reverse_iterator = std::reverse_iterator ; using const_reverse_iterator = std::reverse_iterator ;  static const size_type npos = −1;     integer representing end-of-string     ...  };  The elements  characters  are stored contiguously, so that low-level input operations can safely use a basic_string’s sequence of characters as a source or target.  The basic_string offers  the  strong  guarantee   §13.2 :  if  a basic_string operation  throws,  the  string is left unchanged.   Section 36.3  Strings   1037  Specializations are offered for a few standard character types:  using string = basic_string ; using u16string = basic_string ; using u32string = basic_string ; using wstring = basic_string ;  All these strings provide a host of operations.  Like containers   Chapter  31 , basic_string is  not  meant  to  be  used  as  a  base  class  and  offers  move semantics so that it can be efﬁciently returned by value.  36.3.1 string vs. C-Style Strings I assume some familiarity with string from the many examples in this book, so I start with a few examples contrasting string use with the use of C-style strings  §43.4  which are popular with pro- grammers primarily familiar with C and C-style C++.  Consider making up an email address by concatenating a user identiﬁer and a domain name:  string address const string& identiﬁer, const string& domain  {  return identiﬁer + '@' + domain;  This is trivial.  Now consider a plausible C-style version.  A C-style string is a pointer to an array of zero-terminated characters. The user controls allocation and is responsible for deallocation:     remember space for 0 and '@'  }  }  }  }  void test   {  string t = address "bs","somewhere" ; cout << t << '\n';  char∗ address const char∗ identiﬁer, const char∗ domain  {  int iden_len = strlen identiﬁer ; int dom_len = strlen domain ; char∗ addr =  char∗ malloc iden_len+dom_len+2 ;  strcpy identiﬁer,addr ; addr[iden_len] = '@'; strcpy domain,addr+iden_len+1 ; return addr;  void test2   {  char∗ t = address "bs","somewhere" ; printf "%s\n",t ; free t ;   1038   Strings  Chapter 36  Did I get that right? I hope so. At least it gav e the output I expected.  Like most experienced C programmers, I got the C version correct  I hope  the ﬁrst time, but there are a lot of details to get right.  However,  experience   i.e.,  error  logs   shows  that  this  is  not  always  the  case. Often,  such simple  programming  tasks  are  given to relative  novices  who  still  don’t know all  the  techniques needed to get it right. The implementation of the C-style address   contains a lot of tricky pointer manipulation, and its use requires the caller to remember to free the returned memory. Which code would you prefer to maintain?  Sometimes, it is claimed that C-style strings are more efﬁcient than strings.  However, for most uses, the string does fewer allocations and deallocations than a C-style equivalent  because of the small-string optimization and move semantics; §19.3.3, §19.3.1 . Also, strlen   is a log N  opera- tion, whereas string::size   is a simple read. In the example, this implies that the C-style code tra- verses each input string twice, whereas the string version does only one traversal per input. Efﬁ- ciency concerns at this level are often misguided, but the string version has a fundamental edge.  The fundamental difference between C-style strings and string is that string is a proper type with conventional semantics, whereas the C-style string is a set of conventions supported by a few useful functions.  Consider assignment and comparison:  void test3   {  string s1 = "Ring"; if  s1!="Ring"  insanity  ; if  s1<"Opera" cout << "check"; string s2 = address s1,"Valkyrie" ;  char s3[] = "Ring"; if  strcmp s3,"Ring" !=0  insanity  ; if  strcmp s3,"Opera" <0  cout << "check"; char∗ s4 = address s3,"Valkyrie" ; free s4 ;  Finally, consider sorting:  void test4   {  }  }  vector  vs = {"Grieg", "Williams", "Bach", "Handel" }; sort vs.begin  ,vs.end   ;     assuming that I haven’t deﬁned sort vs   const char∗ as[] = {"Grieg", "Williams", "Bach", "Handel" }; qsort as,sizeof ∗as ,sizeof as  sizeof ∗as , int ∗  const void∗,const void∗  strcmp ;  The C-style string sort function qsort   is presented in §43.7. Again, sort   is as fast as  and typi- cally much faster than  qsort  , so there is no performance reason to choose the lower-level, more verbose, and less maintainable programming style.   Section 36.3.2  Constructors   1039  36.3.2  Constructors A basic_string offers a bewildering variety of constructors:  basic_string  Constructors  §iso.21.4.2   x can be a basic_string, a C-style string, or an initializer_list   basic_string s {a}; basic_string s {}; basic_string s {x,a}; basic_string s {x}; basic_string s {s2,pos,n,a}; basic_string s {s2,pos,n}; basic_string s {s2,pos}; basic_string s {p,n,a}; basic_string s {p,n}; basic_string s {n,c,a}; basic_string s {n,c}; basic_string s {b,e,a};  basic_string s {b,e}; s.˜basic_string   s=x s2=move s   s is an empty string with allocator a; explicit Default constructor: basic_string s {A{}}; s gets the characters from x; use allocator a Move and copy constructor: basic_string s {x,A{}}; s gets the characters s2[pos:pos+n ; use allocator a basic_string s {s2,pos,n,A{};} basic_string s {s2,pos,string::npos,A{}}; Initialize s from [p:p+n ; p is a C-style string; use allocator a basic_string s {p,n,A{}}; s holds n copies of the character c; use allocator a basic_string s {n,c,A{};} s gets the characters from [b:e ; use allocator a basic_string s {b,e,A{}}; Destructor: free all resources Copy: s gets the characters from x Move: s2 gets the characters from s; noexcept  The most common variants are also the simplest:  string s0; string s1 {"As simple as that!"}; string s2 {s1};     the empty string    constructfrom C-style string    copyconstr uctor  Almost always, the destructor is implicitly invoked.  There is no string constructor that takes only a number of elements:  string s3 {7}; string s4 {'a'}; string s5 {7,'a'}; string s6 {0};     error :no string int     error :no string char     OK: 7 'a's    danger :passing nullptr  const char∗ p = 0;     set p to ‘‘no string’’  The declaration of s6 shows a mistake sometimes made by programmers used to C-style strings:  Unfortunately, the  compiler  cannot  catch  the  deﬁnition  of s6 or  the  even nastier  case  of  a const char∗ holding the nullptr:  string s6 {0}; string s7 {p}; string s8 {"OK"};     danger :passing nullptr    mayormay not be OK depending on the value of p    OK: pass pointer to C-style string  Don’t try to initialize a string with a nullptr. At best, you get a nasty run-time error. At worst, you get mysterious undeﬁned behavior.   1040   Strings  Chapter 36  If you try to construct a string with more characters than your implementation can handle, the  constructor throws std::length_error. For example:  string s9 {string::npos,'x'};     throwlength_error  The value string::npos represents a position beyond a string’s length and is generally used to mean ‘‘the end of the string.’’ For example:  string ss {"Fleetwood Mac"}; string ss2 {ss,0,9}; string ss3 {ss,10,string::npos};     "Fleetwood"    "Mac"  Note that the substring notation is  position,length  rather than [start,end .  There are no literals of type string. A user-deﬁned literal could be used for that  §19.2.6 , for  example, "The Beatles"s and "Elgar"s. Note the s sufﬁx.  36.3.3  Fundamental Operations A basic_string offers comparisons, control of size and capacity, and access operations.  basic_string  Comparisons  §iso.21.4.8   s or s2 but not both can be a C-style string  s==s2 s!=s2  s<s2 s<=s2 s>s2 s>=s2  Is s equal to s2? compares character values using traits_type ! s==s2  Is s lexicographically before s2? Is s lexicographically before or equal to s2? Is s lexicographically after s2? Is s lexicographically after or equal to s2?  For more comparison operations, see §36.3.8.  The size and capacity mechanisms for basic_string are the same as those for vector  §31.3.3 :  basic_string  Size and Capacity  §iso.21.4.4   n=s.size   n=s.length    n=s.max_size   s.resize n,c  s.resize n  s.reserve n  s.reserve   n=s.capacity    s.shrink_to_ﬁt   s.clear   s.empty   a=s.get_allocator    n is the number of characters in s n=s.size   n is the largest possible value of s.size   Make s.size  ==n; added elements get the value c s.resiz e n,C{}  Ensure that s can hold n characters without further allocation No effect: s.reserve 0  s can hold n characters without further allocation Make s.capacity==s.size   Make s empty Is s empty? a is s’s allocator  A resize   or reserve   that would cause size   to exceed max_size   will throw std::length_error.   Fundamental Operations  1041  Section 36.3.3  An example:  void ﬁll istream& in, string& s, int max      use s as target for low-levelinput  simpliﬁed   {  }  s.reserve max ; in.read &s[0],max ; const int n = in.gcount  ; s.resize n ; s.shrink_to_ﬁt  ;      makesure there is enough allocated space     number of characters read     discard excess capacity  Here, I ‘‘forgot’’ to make use of the number of characters read. That’s sloppy.  basic_string  Access  §iso.21.4.5   s[i]  s.at i   s.front    s.back    s.push_back c  s.pop_back   s+=x  s=s1+s2 n2=s.copy s2,n,pos    n2=s.copy s2,n   p=s.c_str     p=s.data    s.swap s2  swap s,s2    Subscripting: s[i] is a reference to the ith element of s; no range check Subscripting: s.at i  is a reference to the ith element of s; throw range_error if s.size  <=i s[0] s[s.size  −1] Append the character c Remove the last character from s: s.erase s.size  −1  Append x at the end of s; x can be a character, a string, a C-style string, or an initializer_list  Concatenation: optimized version of s=s1; s+=s2; s gets the characters from s2[pos:n2  where n2 is min n,s.size  −pos ; throw out_of_range if s.size  <pos s gets all the characters from s2; n=s.copy s2,n,0  p is a C-style string version  zero-terminated  of the characters in s; a const C∗ p=s.c_str   Exchange the values of s and s2; noexcept s.swap s2   An  out-of-range  access  using at   throws std::out_of_range. A +=  , push_back  , or + that  would cause size   to exceed max_size   will throw std::length_error.  There is no implicit conversion of a string to a char∗. That was tried in many places and found to be error-prone.  Instead, the standard library provides the explicit conversion function c_str   to const char∗.  A string can contain a zero value character  e.g., '\0' .  Using a function, such as strcmp  , that assumes C-style string conventions on the result of s.c_str   or s.data   on a string containing a zero character may cause surprise.   1042   Strings  Chapter 36  36.3.4  String I O A basic_string can be written using  >  §38.4.1 :  basic_string  I O Operations  §iso.21.4.8.9   in>>s out<<s getline in,s,d   getline in,s    Read a whitespace-separated word into s from in Write s to out Read characters from in into s until the character d is encountered; d is removed from in but not appended to s getline in,s,'\n'  where '\n' is widened to match the string’s character type  An input operation that would cause size   to exceed max_size   will throw std::length_error.  A getline   removes its terminator character  by default '\n'  from the input stream but does not  enter it into the string. This simpliﬁes handling of lines. For example:  The string I O  operations  all  return  a  reference  to  their  input  stream,  so  that  operations  can  be chained.  For example:  vector  lines; for  string s; getline cin,s ;   lines.push_back s ;  string ﬁrst_name; string second_name; cin >> ﬁrst_name >> second_name;  The string target of an input operation is set to empty before reading and expands to hold the char- acters read. A read operation can also be terminated by reaching end-of-ﬁle  §38.3 .  36.3.5  Numeric Conversions In  , the standard library provides a set of functions for extracting numeric values from their character  representation  in  a string or wstring  note:  not  a basic_string  .  The desired numeric types are encoded in the function names:  Numeric Conversions  §iso.21.5   continues   s can be a string or a wstring  x=stoi s,p,b   x=stoi s,p   x=stoi s   x=stol s,p,b  x=stoul s,p,b  x=stoll s,p,b  x=stoull s,p,b   String to int; x is an integer; read starting with s[0] if p!=nullptr, ∗p is set to the number of characters used for x; b is the base of the number  between 2 and 36, inclusive  x=stoi s,p,10 ; decimal numbers x=stoi s,nullptr,10 ; decimal numbers; don’t report the character count String to long String to unsigned long String to long long String to unsigned long long   Section 36.3.5  Numeric Conversions   1043  Numeric Conversions  continued   §iso.21.5   s can be a string or a wstring  x=stof s,p  x=stod s,p  x=stold s,p  s=to_string x   ws=to_wstring x    String to ﬂoat String to double String to long double s is a string representation of x; x must be an integer or ﬂoating-point value s is a wstring representation of x; x must be an integer or ﬂoating-point value  Each of these sto∗  String to  functions has three variants, like stoi. For example:  string s = "123.45"; auto x1 = stoi s ; auto x2 = stod s ;     x1 = 123    x2 = 123.45  The  second  argument  of  a sto∗ function  is  a  pointer  used  to  indicate  how far  into  the  string  the search for a numeric value progressed. For example:  string ss = "123.4567801234"; size_t dist = 0; auto x = stoi ss,&dist ; ++dist;  auto y = stoll &ss[dist] ;     put number of characters read here    x=123  an int     ignore the dot    x=4567801234  a long long   This  is  not  my  favorite  interface  for  parsing  several  numbers  from  a  string. string_stream  §38.2.2 .  I prefer  to  use  a  Initial whitespace is skipped. For example:  string s = " auto x1 = stoi s ;  123.45";     x1 = 123  The base argument can be in the range [2:36] with the 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz used as ‘‘digits’’ with their value determined by their position in this sequence. Any further base value will be an error or an extension.  For example:  string s4 = "149F"; auto x5 = stoi s4 ; auto x6 = stoi s4,nullptr,10 ;  auto x7 = stoi s4,nullptr,8 ;  auto x8 = stoi s4,nullptr,16 ;      x5 = 149    x6 = 149    x7 = 014    x8 = 0x149F  string s5 = "1100101010100101"; auto x9 = stoi s5,nullptr,2 ;      binar y    x9 = 0xcaa5  If a conversion function doesn’t ﬁnd characters in its string argument that it can convert to a num- ber, it throws invalid_argument. If it ﬁnds  a  number  that  it  cannot  represent  in  its  target  type,  it throws out_of_range; in addition,  the  conversions  to  ﬂoating-point  types  set errno to ERANGE  §40.3 .  For example:  stoi "Hello, World!" ;  stoi "12345678901234567890" ;  stof "123456789e1000" ;      throws std::invalid_argument    throws std::out_of_range; errno=ERANGE    throws std::out_of_range; errno=ERANGE   1044   Strings  Chapter 36  The sto∗ functions encode their target type in their names. This makes them unsuitable for generic code where the target can be a template parameter. In such cases, consider to   §25.2.5.1 .  36.3.6  STL-like Operations The basic_string provides the usual set of iterators:  basic_string  String Iterators  §iso.21.4.3   All operations are noexcept p is an iterator to the ﬁrst character of s p is an iterator to one beyond the end of s p is a const_iterator to the ﬁrst character p is a const_iterator to one beyond the end of s p is the beginning of the reverse sequence for s p is the end of the reverse sequence for s p is a const_iterator to the beginning of the reverse sequence for s p is a const_iterator to the end of the reverse sequence for s  p=s.begin    p=s.end    p=s.cbegin    p=s.cend    p=s.rbegin    p=s.rend    p=s.crbegin    p=s.crend     Because string has the required member types and the functions for obtaining iterators, strings can be used together with the standard algorithms  Chapter 32 . For example:  void f string& s  {  }  auto p = ﬁnd_if s.begin  ,s.end  ,islower ;    ...  The most common operations on strings are supplied directly by string. Hopefully, these versions will be optimized for strings beyond what would be easy to do for general algorithms.  The standard algorithms  Chapter 32  are not as useful for strings as one might think. General algorithms tend to assume that the elements of a container are meaningful in isolation. This is typi- cally not the case for a string.  A basic_string offers complex assignment  s:  basic_string  Assignment  §iso.21.4.6.3   All operations return the string to which they are applied  s=x; x can be a string, a C-style string, or an initializer_list   s.assign x   s.assign move s2   Move: s2 is a string; noexcept s.assign s2,pos,n   s.assign p,n   s.assign n,c   s.assign b,e    s gets the characters s2[pos:pos+n  s gets the characters [p:p+n ; p is a C-style string s gets n copies of the character c s gets the characters from [b:e   We can insert  , append  , and erase   in a basic_string:   Section 36.3.6  STL-like Operations   1045  basic_string  Insertion and Deletion  §iso.21.4.6.2, §iso.21.4.6.4, §iso.21.4.6.5   All operations return the string to which they are applied  s.append x   s.append b,e  s.append s2,pos,n  s.append p,n  s.append n,c  s.insert pos,x   s.insert p,c  s.insert p,n,c  insert p,b,e  s.erase pos   s.erase pos,n   Append x at the end of s; x can be a character, a string, a C-style string, or an initializer_list  Append [b:e  at the end of s Append s2[pos:pos+n  to the end of s Append the characters [p:p+n  to the end of s; p is a C-style string Append n copies of character c to the end of s Insert x before s[pos]; x can be a character, a string, a C-style string, or an initializer_list  Insert c before iterator p Insert n copies of c before iterator p Insert [b:e  before iterator p Remove trailing characters from s, starting with s[pos]; s.size   becomes pos Remove n characters from s, starting with s[pos]; s.size   becomes max pos,s.size  −n   void add_middle string& s, const string& middle   {     add middle name  auto p = s.ﬁnd ' ' ; s.insert p,' '+middle ;  For example:  void test   {  }  }  string dmr = "Dennis Ritchie"; add_middle dmr,"MacAlistair" ; cout << dmr << '\n';  As for vectors, append  ing  adding characters at the end  is typically more efﬁcient than insert  ing elsewhere.

For example:  string s = "but I have heard it works even if you don't believe in it"; s.replace 0,4,"" ;  s.replace s.ﬁnd "even" ,4,"only" ; s.replace s.ﬁnd " don't" ,6,"" ; assert s=="I have heard it works only if you believe in it" ;     erase byreplacing with ""     erase initial "but "  Code relying on ‘‘magic’’ constants like the number of characters to be replaced is error-prone.  A replace   returns a reference to the object for which it was called.

An smatch type is a container of regex results.  Here, matches[0] is the whole pattern and matches[1] is the optional four-digit subpattern. I used a raw string  §7.3.2.1  which is particularly suitable for regular expressions because they tend to contain a lot of backslashes. Had I used a conventional string, the pattern deﬁnition would have been:  regex pat {"\\w{2}\\s∗\\d{5} −\\d{4} ?"};      U.S. postal code pattern  The regular expression syntax and semantics are designed so that regular expressions can be com- piled into state machines for efﬁcient execution [Cox,2007]. The regex type performs this compila- tion at run time.  37.1.1  Regular Expression Notation The regex library  can  recognize  several  variants  of  the  notation  for  regular  expressions   §37.2 . Here,  I  ﬁrst  present  the  default  notation  used,  a  variant  of  the  ECMA  standard  used  for ECMAScript  more commonly known as JavaScript .  The syntax of regular expressions is based on characters with special meaning:  Regular Expression Special Characters  . [ ] { }      Any single character  a ‘‘wildcard’’  Begin character class End character class Begin count End count Begin grouping End grouping  \ ∗ + ?  ˆ $  Next character has a special meaning Zero or more One or more Optional  zero or one  Alternative  or  Start of line; negation End of line   Section 37.1.1  Regular Expression Notation  1053  For example, we can specify a line starting with zero or more As followed by one or more Bs fol- lowed by an optional C like this:  A part of a pattern is considered a subpattern  which can be extracted separately from an smatch  if it is enclosed in parentheses.  A pattern can be optional or repeated  the default is exactly once  by adding a sufﬁx:  Repetition  { n } { n, }   {n,m} ∗ + ?  Exactly n times n or more times At least n and at most m times Zero or more, that is, {0,} One or more, that is, {1,} Optional  zero or one , that is {0,1}  ˆA∗B+C?$  Examples that match:  AAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBC BC B  Examples that do not match:  AAAAA   AAAABC   AABBCC      no B    initial space    too manyCs  For example:  A{3}B{2,4}C∗  Examples that match:  AAABBC AAABBB  Example that do not match:  AABBC  AAABC  AAABBBBBCCC      too few As    too few Bs    too manyBs  A sufﬁx ? after any of the repetition notations makes the pattern matcher ‘‘lazy’’ or ‘‘non-greedy.’’ That is, when looking for a pattern, it will look for the shortest match rather than the longest. By default, the pattern matcher always looks for the longest match  similar to C++’s Max Munch rule; §10.3 .  Consider:  ababab  The pattern  ab ∗ matches all of ababab. Howev er,  ab ∗? matches only the ﬁrst ab.   1054  Regular Expressions   Chapter 37  The most common character classiﬁcations have names:  Character Classes  alnum alpha blank cntrl d digit graph lower print punct s space upper w xdigit  Any alphanumeric character Any alphabetic character Any whitespace character that is not a line separator Any control character Any decimal digit Any decimal digit Any graphical character Any lowercase character Any printable character Any punctuation character Any whitespace character Any whitespace character Any uppercase character Any word character  alphanumeric characters plus the underscore  Any hexadecimal digit character  Several character classes are supported by shorthand notation:  Character Class Abbreviations  A decimal digit \d A space  space, tab, etc.  \s A letter  a-z  or digit  0-9  or underscore  _  \w Not \d  \D Not \s  \S \W Not \w   [[:digit:]] [[:space:]] [_[:alnum:]] [ˆ[:digit:]] [ˆ[:space:]] [ˆ_[:alnum:]]  Nonstandard  but Common  Character Class Abbreviations  \l \u \L \U  A lowercase character An uppercase character Not \l  Not \u   [[:lower:]] [[:upper:]] [ˆ[:lower:]] [ˆ[:upper:]]  In addition, languages supporting regular expressions often provide:  For full portability, use the character class names rather than these abbreviations.  As an example, consider writing a pattern that describes C++ identiﬁers: an underscore or a let- ter followed by a possibly empty sequence of letters, digits, or underscores. To  illustrate the sub- tleties involved, I include a few false attempts:  [:alpha:][:alnum:]∗ [[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]∗  [[:alpha:]]_ [[:alnum:]]∗     wrong: characters from the set ":alph" followedby...    wrong: doesn’t accept underscore  '_' is not alpha     wrong: underscore is not partofalnum either   Section 37.1.1  Regular Expression Notation  1055   [[:alpha:]]_  [[:alnum:]]_ ∗ [[:alpha:]_][[:alnum:]_]∗ [_[:alpha:]][_[:alnum:]]∗ [_[:alpha:]]\w∗     OK, but clumsy    OK: include the underscore in the character classes    also OK    \w is equivalent to [_[:alnum:]]  Finally, here is a function that uses the simplest version of regex_match    §37.3.1  to test whether a string is an identiﬁer:  bool is_identiﬁer const string& s  {  regex pat {"[_[:alpha:]]\\w∗"}; return regex_match s,pat ;  Note the doubling of the backslash to include a backslash in an ordinary string literal. As usual, backslashes can also denote special characters:  Special Characters  §iso.2.14.3, §6.2.3.2   Newline \n Tab \t One backslash \\ \xhh  Unicode characters expressed using two hexadecimal digits \uhhhh  Unicode characters expressed using four hexadecimal digits  To  add to the opportunities for confusion, two further logically different uses of the backslash are provided:  Special Characters  §iso.28.5.2, §37.2.2   \b \B \i  The ﬁrst or last character of a word  a ‘‘boundary character’’  Not a \b The ith sub_match in this pattern  Using raw string literals alleviates many problems with special characters. For example:  }  }  bool is_identiﬁer const string& s  {  regex pat {R" [_[:alpha:]]\w∗ "}; return regex_match s,pat ;  Here are some examples of patterns:  Ax∗ Ax+  \d−?\d  \w{2}−\d{4,5}   \d∗: ? \d+    bsBS   [aeiouy]  [ˆaeiouy]  [aˆeiouy]   Not A Not 1--2     A, Ax, Axxxx    Ax, Axxx    1-2, 12    Ab-1234, XX-54321, 22-5432    12:3, 1:23, 123, :123 Not 123:    bs,BS    a, o,u     x, k    a, ˆ, o,u   Not bS AnEnglish vow el, not x Not an English vow el, not e AnEnglish vow elorˆ  Digits are in \w   1056  Regular Expressions   Chapter 37  A group  a subpattern  potentially to be represented by a sub_match is delimited by parentheses. If you need parentheses that should not deﬁne a subpattern, use  ? rather than plain  . For example:   \s:, ∗ \d∗      spaces,colons,and or commas followedbyanumber  Assuming that we were not interested in the characters before the number  presumably separators , we could write:  ?\s:, ∗ \d∗      spaces,colons,and or commas followedbyanumber  This would save the regular expression engine from having to store the ﬁrst characters: the  ? vari- ant has only one subpattern.  Regular Expression Grouping Examples  \d∗\s\w+  \d∗ \s \w+   \d∗  \s \w+  +  \s∗\w∗ +    .∗?    No groups  subpatterns  Tw o groups Tw o groups  groups do not nest  One group, but one or more subpatterns; only the last subpattern is saved as a sub_match Three groups; the \1 means ‘‘same as group 1’’  That  last  pattern  is  useful  for  parsing  XML. It  ﬁnds  tag end-of-tag  markers.  Note that  I  used  a non-greedy match  a lazy match , .∗?, for the subpattern between the tag and the end tag. Had I used plain .∗, this input would have caused a problem:  Always look for the  bright  side of  life .  A greedy match for the ﬁrst subpattern would match the ﬁrst  . A greedy match on the second subpattern would match the ﬁrst   with the last  . Both would be correct behavior, but unlikely what the programmer wanted.  It is possible to vary details of the regular expression notation using options  §37.2 . For exam- ple, if regex_constants::grep is used, a?x:y is a sequence of ﬁve ordinary characters because ? does not mean ‘‘optional’’ in grep.  For a more exhaustive presentation of regular expressions, see [Friedl,1997].  37.2 regex A regular expression is a matching engine  usually a state machine  constructed from a sequence of characters, such as a string:  template > class basic_regex { public:  using value_type = C; using traits_type = traits; using string_type = typename traits::string_type; using ﬂag_type = regex_constants::syntax_option_type; using locale_type = typename traits::locale_type;   regex  1057  Section 37.2  };  ˜basic_regex  ;    not virtual; basic_regexisnot meant to be used as a base class    ...  The regex_traits are presented in §37.5.  Like string, regex is an alias for the version that uses chars:  using regex = basic_reg ex ;  The  meaning  of  regular  expression  patterns  is  controlled  by syntax_option_type constants  deﬁned identically in regex_constants and regex:  basic_regex  Member Constants  syntax_option_type, §iso.28.5.1   icase nosubs optimize collate ECMAScript  basic  extended  awk grep egrep  No case is used when matching No subexpression matches are stored in the match results Prefer fast matching to fast regular expression object construction Character ranges of the form [a−b] are locale sensitive The regular expression grammar is the one used by ECMAScript in ECMA-262  with minor modiﬁcations; §iso.28.13  The regular expression grammar is the one used by basic regular expressions in POSIX The regular expression grammar is the one used by extended regular expressions in POSIX The regular expression grammar is the one used by POSIX awk The regular expression grammar is the one used by POSIX grep The regular expression grammar is the one used by POSIX grep -E  Use the default unless you have a good reason not to. Good reasons include a large body of exist- ing regular expressions in a non-default notation.  A regex object can be constructed from a string or similar sequence of characters:  basic_regex  Constructors  §iso.28.8.2   basic_regex r {};  basic_regex r {x,ﬂags};   basic_regex r {x};  basic_regex r {p,n,ﬂags};  basic_regex r {p,n};  basic_regex r {b,e ,ﬂags}  basic_regex r {b,e};   Default constructor: an empty pattern; ﬂags set to regex_constants::ECMAScript x can be a basic_regex, a string, a C-style string, or an initializer_list  with the notation deﬁned by ﬂags; explicit basic_regex{x,reg ex_constants::ECMAScript}; explicit Construct r from the characters in [p:p+n  with the notation deﬁned by ﬂags basic_regex{p,n,reg ex_constants::ECMAScript} Construct r from the characters in [b:e  with the notation deﬁned by ﬂags basic_regex{b,e ,regex_constants::ECMAScript}  The main use of regex is through the search, match, and replace functions  §37.3 , but there are also a few operations on regex itself:   1058  Regular Expressions   Chapter 37  r=x  r=move r2  r=r.assign r2  r=r.assign x,ﬂags   r=r.assign x   r=r.assign p,n,ﬂags  r=r.assign b,e ,ﬂags  r=r.assign b,e   n=r.mark_count    x=r.ﬂags    loc2=r.imbue loc   loc=r.g etloc   r.swap r2   basic_regex  Operations  §iso.28.8  Copy assignment: x can be a basic_regex, a C-style string, a basic_string, or an initializer_list  Move assignment Copy or move Copy or move; set r’s ﬂags to ﬂags x can be a basic_string, a C-style string, or an initializer_list  r=r.assign x,reg ex_constants::ECMAScript  Set r’s pattern to [p:p+n  and r’s ﬂags to ﬂags Set r’s pattern to [b:e  and r’s ﬂags to ﬂags r=r.assign b,e ,regex_constants::ECMAScript  n is the number of marked subexpressions in r x is r’s ﬂags r gets the locale loc; loc2 is r’s previous locale loc is r’s locale Exchange values of r and r2  You can  determine  the locale or  a regex by  a  call  of getloc   and  learn  what  ﬂags  are  used  from ﬂags  , but unfortunately there is no  standard  way of reading out its pattern. If you need to output a pattern, keep a copy of the string used to initialize. For example:  regex pat1 {R" \w+\d∗ "};      no way ofoutputting the patterninpat1  string s {R" \w+\d∗ "}; regex pat2 {s}; cout << s << '\n';     the patterninpat2  37.2.1  Match Results Results from a regular expression match are gathered in a match_results object which contains one or more sub_match objects:  template  class sub_match : public pair  { public:  using value_type = typename iterator_traits ::value_type; using difference_type = typename iterator_traits ::difference_type; using iterator = Bi; using string_type = basic_string ;  bool matched;    trueif *this contains a match    ...  };  Bi must be a bidirectional iterator  §33.1.2 .

If the table format is as expected, the program writes ‘‘all is well’’ to cout; if not, it writes error messages to cerr. A ta- ble is a series of rows, each with four tab-separated ﬁelds, except for the ﬁrst  title row  which may have only three ﬁelds. For example:  The numbers are supposed to add up horizontally and vertically.  The program reads the title line and then does the sums for each line until it reaches the ﬁnal  Class  1a  1b  Total   Boys  12  16 28  Girls 15  14  29   Total 27 30 57  line labeled ‘‘Total’’:  int main   {  ifstream in "table .txt" ; if  !in  cerr << "no ﬁle\n";     input ﬁle  string line; int lineno = 0;     input buffer  regex header {R" ˆ[\w ]+ \t[\w ]+ ∗$ "};  regex row {R" ˆ [\w ]+  \t\d+  \t\d+  \t\d+ $ "};     tab-separated words     label followedbythree tab-separated numbers  if  getline in,line   {    checkand discard the header line  smatch matches; if  !regex_match line ,matches,header    cerr << "no header\n";  }  int boys = 0; int girls = 0;     running totals   1064  Regular Expressions   Chapter 37  while  getline in,line   {  ++lineno; smatch matches;      submatches go here  if  !regex_match line ,matches,row    cerr << "bad line: " << lineno << '\n';  int curr_boy = stoi matches[2] ;  int curr_girl = stoi matches[3] ; int curr_total = stoi matches[4] ; if  curr_boy+curr_girl != curr_total  cerr << "bad row sum \n";     forstoi   see §36.3.5  if  matches[1]=="Total"  {     last line  if  curr_boy != boys  cerr << "boys do not add up\n"; if  curr_girl != girls  cerr << "girls do not add up\n"; cout << "all is well\n"; return 0;  } boys += curr_boy; girls += curr_girl;  }  }  cerr << "didn't ﬁnd total line\n"  return 1;  37.3.2 regex_search   To look for a pattern in a part of a sequence, such as a ﬁle, use regex_search  :  Regular Expression Searching  §iso.28.11.3   Matching is controlled by match_ﬂag_type options  §37.3   regex_search b,e ,m,pat,ﬂags   regex_search b,e ,m,pat  regex_search b,e ,pat,ﬂags   regex_search b,e ,pat  regex_search x,m,pat,ﬂags   regex_search x,m,pat   regex_search x,pat,ﬂags   regex_search x,pat    Does the input [b:e  contain a match for the regex pattern pat? place the result in match_results m; use options ﬂags reg ex_search b,e ,m,regex_constants::match_default  Does the input [b:e  contain a match for the the regex pattern pat? use options ﬂags reg ex_search b,e ,pat,regex_constants::match_default  Does the input x contain a match for the regex pattern pat? x can be a basic_string or a C-style string; place the result in match_results m; use options ﬂags regex_search x,m,pat,reg ex_constants::match_default  Does the input x contain a match for the regex pattern pat? x can be a basic_string or a C-style string; use options ﬂags regex_search x,pat,reg ex_constants::match_default   For example, I could look for some of the more popular misspellings of my name like this:   Section 37.3.2  regex_search    1065  regex pat {"[Ss]tro?u?v?p?stra?o?u?p?b?"};  smatch m; for  string s; cin>>s;    if  regex_search s,m,pat    if  m[0]!="stroustrup" && m[0]!="Stroustrup"    cout << "Found: " << m[0] << '\n';  Given suitable input, this will output misspellings of Stroustrup, such as:  Found: strupstrup Found: Strovstrup Found: stroustrub Found: Stroustrop  Note  that regex_search   will  ﬁnd  its  pattern  even if it is ‘‘hidden’’ among  other  characters. For example, it will ﬁnd strustrub in abstrustrubal. If you want to match a pattern against every charac- ter in an input string, use regex_match  §37.3.1 .  37.3.3 regex_replace   To make simple substitutions of a pattern in a part of a sequence, such as a ﬁle, use regex_replace  :  Regular Expression Replacement  §iso.28.11.4   Matching is controlled by match_ﬂag_type options  §37.3   out=regex_replace out,b,e ,pat,fmt,ﬂags   Copy [b:e  to out, searching for the regex pattern pat; when a match for pat is found, copy it to out using the format fmt controlled by ﬂags; fmt can be a basic_string or a C-style string out=reg ex_replace out,b,e ,pat,fmt,  regex_constants::match_defaults   Copy x to s, searching for the regex pattern pat; when a match for pat is found copy it to s using the format fmt controlled by ﬂags; x can be a basic_string or a C-style string; fmt can be a basic_string or a C-style string s=regex_replace x,pat,fmt,  regex_constants::match_defaults   out=regex_replace out,b,e ,pat,fmt   s=regex_replace x,pat,fmt,ﬂags   s=regex_replace x,pat,fmt    Copying a format is done using the regex’s format    §37.2.2  with the $ preﬁx notation, for exam- ple, $& for  the  match  and $2 for  the  second  submatch. Here  is  a  little  test  program  that  takes  a string of word and number pairs and outputs them as {word,number}, one per line:   1066  Regular Expressions   Chapter 37  string input {"x 1 y2 22 zaq 34567"}; regex pat {" \w+ \s \d+ "}; string format {"{$1,$2}\n"};     word space number  cout << regex_replace input,pat,format ;  Note  the  annoying  ‘‘spurious’’ spaces  at  the  beginning  of  the  lines. By  default, regex_match   copies  unmatched  characters  to  its  output,  so  the  two spaces  that  were  not  matched  by pat are printed.  To eliminate those spaces, we can use the format_no_copy option  §37.2.2 :  cout << regex_replace input,pat,format,reg ex_constants::format_no_copy ;  Submatches do not have to be output in order:  string input {"x 1 y 2 z 3"}; regex pat {" \w \s \d+ "};    word space number string format {"$2: $1\n"};  cout << regex_replace input,pat,format,reg ex_constants::format_no_copy ;  void test1   {  }  The output is:  {x,1} {y2,22} {zaq,34567}  Now we get:  {x,1} {y2,22} {zaq,34567}  void test2   {  }  Now we get:  1: x 22: y2 34567: zeq  37.4  Regular Expression Iterators The regex_search   function  allows  us  to  ﬁnd  a  single  occurrence  of  a  pattern  in  a  data  stream. What if we wanted to ﬁnd and do something to all such occurrences? If the data is organized as a sequence of easily recognized lines or records, we can iterate over those and use regex_match   for each.  If what we want to do with each occurrence of a pattern is a simple substitution, we can use   Section 37.4  Regular Expression Iterators  1067  regex_replace  . If we want to iterate over a sequence of characters doing something for each occur- rence of a pattern, we use a regex_iterator.  37.4.1 regex_iterator A regex_iterator is a bidirectional iterator that searches a sequence for the next match of a pattern when incremented:  template<class Bi,  class regex_iterator { public:  class C = typename iterator_traits ::value_type , class Tr = typename regex_traits ::type>  using regex_type = basic_regex ; using value_type = match_results ; using difference_type = ptrdiff_t; using pointer = const value_type∗; using reference = const value_type&; using iterator_category = forward_iterator_tag;    ...  }  The regex_traits are described in §37.5. The usual set of aliases is provided: using cregex_iterator = regex_iterator ; using wcregex_iterator = regex_iterator ; using sregex_iterator = regex_iterator ; using wsregex_iterator = regex_iterator ;  A regex_iterator provides a minimal set of iterator operations:  regex_iterator   §iso.28.12.1   regex_iterator p {}; regex_iterator p {b,e,pat,ﬂags ; regex_iterator p {b,e,pat ;  regex_iterator p {q}; p=q p==q p!=q  c=∗p x=p−>m  ++p q=p++   p is end-of-sequence Iterate over [b:e , looking for matches of pat using options ﬂags p is initialized with {b,e,pat,regex_constants::match_default} Copy constructor  no move constructor  Copy assignment  no move assignment  Does p point to the same sub_match as q? ! p==q  c is the current sub_match x= ∗p .m Make p point to the next occurrence of p’s pattern q=p, then ++p  A regex_iterator is a bidirectional iterator, so we cannot directly iterate over an istream.  As an example, we can output all whitespace-separated words in a string:   1068  Regular Expressions   Chapter 37  string input = "aa as; asd ++eˆasdf asdfg"; regex pat {R" \s+ \w+  "}; for  sreg ex_iterator p input.begin  ,input.end  ,pat ; p!=sregex_iterator{}; ++p   cout <<  ∗p [1] << '\n';  Note that we are missing the ﬁrst word, aa, because it has no preceding whitespace. If we simplify the pattern to R"  \ew+  ", we get  void test   {  This outputs:  }  as asd asdfg  aa as asd e asdf asdfg  You cannot write through a regex_iterator and regex_iterator{} is the only possible end-of-sequence.  37.4.2 regex_token_iterator A regex_token_iterator is  an  adaptor  for regex_iterator that  iterates  over sub_matches  of  the match_results found:  template<class Bi,  class C = typename iterator_traits ::value_type , class Tr = typename regex_traits ::type>  class regex_token_iterator { public:  using regex_type = basic_regex ; using value_type = sub_match ; using difference_type = ptrdiff_t; using pointer = const value_type∗; using reference = const value_type&; using iterator_category = forward_iterator_tag;    ...  The regex_traits are described in §37.5. The usual set of aliases is provided: using cregex_token_iterator = regex_token_iterator ; using wcregex_token_iterator = regex_token_iterator ; using sregex_token_iterator = regex_token_iterator ; using wsregex_token_iterator = regex_token_iterator ;  A regex_token_iterator provides a minimal set of iterator operations:   Section 37.4.2  regex_token_iterator  1069  regex_token_iterator  §iso.28.12.2   regex_token_iterator p {}; regex_token_iterator p {b,e,pat,x,ﬂags};   p is the end-of-sequence x lists the indices of the sub_matches to be included in the iteration or 0, meaning ‘‘the whole match,’’ or −1, meaning ‘‘represent each character sequence not matched as a sub_match’’; x can be an int, an initializer_list , a const vector &, or a const int  &sub_match [N] p is initialized with {b,e,pat,x,regex_constants::match_default} p is initialized with {b,e,pat,0,regex_constants::match_default} Copy constructor  no move constructor  Destructor: release all resources Copy assignment  no move assignment  Does p point to the same sub_match as q? ! p==q  c is the current sub_match x= ∗p .m Make p point to the next occurrence of p’s pattern q=p, then ++p  regex_token_iterator p {b,e,pat,x};   regex_token_iterator p {b,e,pat};   regex_token_iterator p {q}; p.˜regex_token_iterator   p=q p==q p!=q  c=∗p x=p−>m  ++p  q=p++   void test1   {  }  aa bb cc dd ee ff  This gives the output:  The x argument lists the sub_matches to be included in the iteration. For example  iterating over matches 1 and 3 :  string input {"aa::bb cc::dd ee::ff"}; regex pat {R"  \w+  [[:punct:]]+  \w+ \s∗ "}; sregex_token_iterator end {}; for  sreg ex_token_iterator p{input.begin  ,input.end  ,pat,{1,3}}; p!=end; ++p   cout << ∗p << '\n';  The −1 option  basically  inverts  the  strategy  for  reporting  matches  by  representing  each  character sequence that does not match as a sub_match. This is often referred to as token splitting  that is,   1070  Regular Expressions   Chapter 37  splitting a character stream into tokens  because when your pattern matches the token separators, option −1 leaves you with the tokens.  For example:  void test2   {  The output is:  string s {"1,2 , 3 ,4,5, 6 7"}; regex pat {R" \s∗,\s∗ "};  copy sreg ex_token_iterator{s.begin  ,s.end  ,pat,−1 },     input    use comma as token  separator  sregex_token_iterator{}, ostream_iterator {cout,"\n"} ;  This could equivalently be written using an explicit loop:  void test3   {  sregex_token_iterator end{}; for  sreg ex_token_iterator p {s.begin  ,s.end  ,pat,−1}; p!=end; ++p   cout << ∗p << '\n';  }  37.5 regex_traits A regex_traits  represents  the  correspondence  between  a  character  type,  a  string  type,  and  a locale as needed for a regex implementer:  template  struct regex_traits { public:  using char_type = C; using string_type = basic_string ; using locale_type = locale; using char_class_type =  * implementation-deﬁned bitmask type* ;    ...

The deﬁnitions for I O stream facilities are found in  ,  , etc.; see §30.2.  An ostream converts typed objects to a stream of characters  bytes :  Typed values:  'c'  123   123,45   Byte sequences:  ostream  ‘‘Somewhere’’  stream buffer   1074   I O Streams   Chapter 38  An istream converts a stream of characters  bytes  to typed objects:  Typed values:  'c'  123   123,45   Byte sequences:  istream  ‘‘Somewhere’’  stream buffer  An iostream is a stream that can act as both an istream and an ostream. The buffers in the diagrams are stream buffers  streambufs; §38.6 . You need them to deﬁne a mapping from an iostream to a new kind  of  device,  ﬁle,  or  memory. The  operations  on istreams and ostreams are  described  in §38.4.1 and §38.4.2.  Knowledge  of  the  techniques  used  to  implement  the  stream  library  is  not  needed  to  use  the library. So I present only the general ideas needed to understand and use iostreams.  If you need to implement the standard streams, provide a new kind of stream, or provide a new locale, you need a copy of the standard, a good systems manual, and examples of working code in addition to what is presented here.  The key components of the stream I O system can be represented graphically like this:  ios_base:  locale independent format state  basic_streambuf :  buffering  locale dependent format state  basic_ios :  stream state  real destination source  character buffer  basic_iostream :  formatting   >, etc.   setup cleanup  locale:  format information  The solid arrows represent ‘‘derived from.’’  The dotted arrows represent ‘‘pointer to.’’  The classes marked with   are templates parameterized by a character type and containing a locale.  The I O stream operations:  cid:129  Are type-safe and type sensitive  cid:129  Are extensible  when someone designs a new type, matching I O stream operators can be  added without modifying existing code    Section 38.1  Introduction   1075   cid:129  Are locale sensitive  Chapter 39   cid:129  Are efﬁcient  though their potential is not always fully realized   cid:129  Are interoperable with C-style stdio  §43.3   cid:129   Include formatted, unformatted, and character-level operations  The basic_iostream is deﬁned based on basic_istream  §38.6.2  and basic_ostream  §38.6.1 :  template > class basic_iostream :  public basic_istream , public basic_ostream  {  public:  using char_type = C; using int_type = typename Tr::int_type; using pos_type = typename Tr::pos_type; using off_type = typename Tr::off_type; using traits_type = Tr;  explicit basic_iostream basic_streambuf ∗ sb ; virtual ˜basic_iostream  ;  protected:  basic_iostream const basic_iostream& rhs  = delete; basic_iostream basic_iostream&& rhs ;  basic_iostream& operator= const basic_iostream& rhs  = delete; basic_iostream& operator= basic_iostream&& rhs ; void swap basic_iostream& rhs ;  };  The  template  parameters  specify  the  character  type  and  the  traits  used  to  manipulate  characters  §36.2.2 , respectively.  Note  that  no  copy operations  are  provided:  sharing  or  cloning  the  fairly  complex state  of  a stream would be difﬁcult to implement and expensive to use.  The move operations are intended for use by derived classes and are therefore protected. Moving an iostream without moving the state of its deﬁning derived class  e.g., an fstream  would lead to errors.  There are three standard streams:  Standard I O Streams  cout cin cerr clog wcin  wcout  wcerr  wclog   The standard character output  often by default a screen  The standard character input  often by default a keyboard  The standard character error output  unbuffered  The standard character error output  buffered  wistream version of cin wostream version of cout wostream version of cerr wostream version of clog  Forward declarations for stream types and stream objects are provided in  .   1076   I O Streams   Chapter 38  38.2  The I O Stream Hierarchy An istream can be connected to an input device  e.g., a keyboard , a ﬁle, or a string. Similarly, an ostream can be connected to an output device  e.g., a text window or an HTML engine , a ﬁle, or a string. The I O stream facilities are organized in a class hierarchy:  ios_base  basic_ios   basic_istream   basic_ostream   basic_istringstream   basic_iostream   basic_ostringstream   basic_ifstream   basic_ofstream   basic_fstream   basic_stringstream   The classes sufﬁxed by   are templates parameterized on the character type. A dotted line indi- cates a virtual base class  §21.3.5 .  The key class is basic_ios in which most of the implementation and many of the operations are deﬁned.  However,  most casual  and not-so-casual  users never see it: it is mostly an implementa- tion detail of the streams. It is described in §38.4.4. Most of its facilities are described in the con- text of their function  e.g., formatting; §38.4.5 .  38.2.1  File Streams In  , the standard library provides streams to and from a ﬁle:   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   ifstreams for reading from a ﬁle ofstreams for writing to a ﬁle fstreams for reading from and writing to a ﬁle  The ﬁle streams follow a common pattern, so I describe only fstream:  template > class basic_fstream : public basic_iostream  { public:  using char_type = C; using int_type = typename Tr::int_type; using pos_type = typename Tr::pos_type;  using off_type = typename Tr::off_type;  using traits_type = Tr;    ...  };     forpositions in ﬁle     foroffsets in ﬁle   Section 38.2.1  File Streams   1077  The set of fstream operations is fairly simple:  fstream fs {}; fstream fs {s,m};  basic_fstream   §iso.27.9  fs is a ﬁle stream not attached to a ﬁle fs is a ﬁle stream opened for a ﬁle called s with mode m; s can be a string or a C-style string  fstream fs {fs2}; Move constructor: fs2 is moved to fs; fs2 becomes unattached Move assignment: fs2 is moved to fs; fs2 becomes unattached fs=move fs2  Exchange the states of fs and fs2 fs.swap fs2  p is a pointer to fs’s ﬁle stream buffer  basic_ﬁlebuf   p=fs.rdbuf    Is fs open? fs.is_open   Open a ﬁle called s with mode m and have fs refer to it; fs.open s,m  sets fs’s failbit if it couldn’t open the ﬁle; s can be a string or a C-style string Close the ﬁle associated with fs  if any   fs.close    In addition, the string streams override the basic_ios protected virtual functions underﬂow  , pback- fail  , overﬂow  , setbuf  , seekoff  , and seekpos    §38.6 .  A ﬁle stream does not have copy operations.  If you want two names to refer to the same ﬁle  stream, use a reference or a pointer, or carefully manipulate ﬁle streambufs  §38.6 .  If an fstream fails to open, the stream is in the bad   state  §38.3 . There are six ﬁle stream aliases deﬁned in  :  using ifstream = basic_ifstream ; using wifstream = basic_ifstream ; using ofstream = basic_ofstream ; using wofstream = basic_ofstream ; using fstream = basic_fstream ; using wfstream = basic_fstream ;  You can open a ﬁle in one of several modes, as speciﬁed in ios_base  §38.4.4 :  ios_base::app ios_base::ate ios_base::binary ios_base::in ios_base::out ios_base::trunc  Stream Modes  §iso.27.5.3.1.4  Append  i.e., add to the end of the ﬁle  ‘‘At end’’  open and seek to the end  Binary mode; beware of system-speciﬁc behavior For reading For writing Truncate the ﬁle to 0 length  In each case, the exact effect of opening a ﬁle may depend on the operating system, and if an oper- ating system cannot honor a request to open a ﬁle in a certain way, the result will be a stream that is in the bad   state  §38.3 . For example:  ofstream ofs "target" ;  if  !ofs   error "couldn't open 'target' for writing" ;     ‘‘o’’for ‘‘output’’implying ios::out   1078   I O Streams   Chapter 38  fstream ifs; ifs.open "source",ios_base::in ; if  !ifs      ‘‘i’’for ‘‘input’’implying ios::in  error "couldn't open 'source' for reading" ;  For positioning in a ﬁle, see §38.6.1.  38.2.2  String Streams In  , the standard library provides streams to and from a string:   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   istringstreams for reading from a string ostringstreams for writing to a string stringstreams for reading from and writing to a string  The string streams follow a common pattern, so I describe only stringstream:  template , typename A = allocator > class basic_stringstream  : public basic_iostream  {  public:  using char_type = C; using int_type = typename Tr::int_type; using pos_type = typename Tr::pos_type;  using off_type = typename Tr::off_type;     foroffsets in string using traits_type = Tr; using allocator_type = A;     forpositions in string     ...  The stringstream operations are:  stringstream ss {m}; stringstream ss {}; stringstream ss {s,m};  basic_stringstream   §iso.27.8  ss is an empty string stream with mode m Default constructor: stringstream ss {ios_base::outios_base::in}; ss is a string stream with its buffer initialized from the string s with mode m stringstream ss {s,ios_base::outios_base::in};  stringstream ss {s}; stringstream ss {ss2}; Move constructor: ss2 is moved to ss; ss2 becomes empty Move assignment: ss2 is moved to ss; ss2 becomes empty ss=move ss2  p points to ss’s string stream buffer  a basic_stringbuf   p=ss.rdbuf    s is a string copy of the characters in ss: s=ss.rdbuf  −>str   s=ss.str    ss’s buffer is initialized from the string s: ss.rdbuf  −>str s ; ss.str s   if ss’s mode is ios::ate  ‘‘at end’’  values written to ss are added after the characters from s; otherwise values written overwrites the characters from s Exchange the states of ss and ss2  ss.swap ss2   The  open  modes  are  described  in  §38.4.4. For an istringstream, the  default  mode  is ios_base::in. For an ostringstream, the default mode is ios_base::out.   Section 38.2.2  String Streams   1079  In  addition,  the  string  streams  override  the basic_ios protected  virtual  functions underﬂow  ,  pbackfail  , overﬂow  , setbuf  , seekoff  , and seekpos    §38.6 .  A string  stream  does  not  have  copy operations.  If you  want  two names  to  refer  to  the  same  string stream, use a reference or a pointer.  There are six string stream aliases deﬁned in  :  using istringstream = basic_istringstream ; using wistringstream = basic_istringstream ; using ostringstream = basic_ostringstream ; using wostringstream = basic_ostringstream ; using stringstream = basic_stringstream ; using wstringstream = basic_stringstream ;  For example:  void test   {  ostringstream oss {"Label: ",ios::ate}; cout << oss.str   << '\n'; oss<<"val"; cout << oss.str   << '\n';     writes"Label: "     writeat end     writes"Label: val"  "val" appended after "Label: "   ostringstream oss2 {"Label: "}; cout << oss2.str   << '\n';    writes"Label: " oss2<<"val"; cout << oss2.str   << '\n';    writes"valel: "  val overwr ites"Label: "      writeat beginning  I tend to use str   only to read a result from an istringstream.  It is not possible to directly output a string stream; str   must be used:  void test2   {  istringstream iss; iss.str "Foobar" ;      Fill iss  cout << iss << '\n'; cout << iss.str   << '\n';     writes1    OK: writes "Foobar"  The reason for the probably surprising 1 is that an iostream converts to its state for testing:  if  iss  {     the last operation of iss succeeded; iss’sstate is good   or eof       ...  } else {     handle problem  }  }  }   1080   I O Streams   Chapter 38  38.3  Error Handling An iostream can be in one of four states, deﬁned in basic_ios from    §38.4.4 :  Stream States  §iso.27.5.5.4   good   eof   fail   bad    The previous iostream operations succeeded We hit end-of-input  ‘‘end-of-ﬁle’’  Something unexpected happened  e.g., we looked for a digit and found 'x'  Something unexpected and serious happened  e.g., disk read error   Any operation attempted on a stream that is not in the good   state has no effect; it is a no-op. An iostream can be used as a condition. In that case, the condition is true  succeeds  if the state of the iostream is good  . That is the basis for the idiom for reading a stream of values:  for  X x; cin>>x;  {     read into an input buffer of type X     ... do something with x ...  }    we get here when >> couldn’t read another X from cin  After a read failure, we might be able to clear the stream and proceed:  } else if  cin.fail   {     possibly a for mattingerror     we might be able to use a string to recover  int i; if  cin>>i  {     ... use i ...  cin.clear  ; string s; if  cin>>s  {     ... use s ...  }  }  Alternatively, errors can be handled using exceptions:  Exception Control: basic_ios   §38.4.4, §iso.27.5.5   st=ios.exceptions    ios.exceptions st   st is the iostate of ios Set ios’s iostate to st  For example,  we  can  make cin throw a basic_ios::failure when  its  state  is  set  to bad    e.g.,  by  a cin.setstate ios_base::badbit  :  cin.exceptions cin.exceptions  ios_base::badbit ;  For example:     RAII class for iostream exceptions  struct Io_guard {   iostream& s; auto old_e = s.exceptions  ; Io_guard iostream& ss, ios_base::iostate e  :s{ss} { s.exceptions s.exceptions  e ; } ˜Io_guard   { s.exceptions old_e ; }  };   Section 38.3  Error Handling  1081  void use istream& is  {  Io_guard guard is.ios_base::badbit ;    ... use is ...  } catch  ios_base::badbit  {     ... bail out! ...  }  I tend  to  use  exceptions  to  handle iostream errors  that  I  don’t expect  to  be  able  to  recover from. That usually means all bad   exceptions.  38.4  I O Operations The complexity of the I O operations reﬂects tradition, the need for I O performance, and the vari- ety of human expectations.  The description here is based on the conventional English small charac- ter set  ASCII . The ways in which different character sets and different natural languages are han- dled are described in Chapter 39.  38.4.1  Input Operations Input operations are provided by istream  §38.6.2 , found in   except for the ones reading into a string; those are found in  . The basic_istream is primarily intended as a base class for more speciﬁc input classes, such as istream and istringstream:  template > class basic_istream : virtual public basic_ios  { public:  using char_type = C; using int_type = typename Tr::int_type; using pos_type = typename Tr::pos_type; using off_type = typename Tr::off_type; using traits_type = Tr;  explicit basic_istream basic_streambuf ∗ sb ; virtual ˜basic_istream  ;     release all resources  class sentry;    ...  protected:     move but no copy: basic_istream const basic_istream& rhs  = delete; basic_istream basic_istream&& rhs ; basic_istream& operator= const basic_istream& rhs  = delete; basic_istream& operator= basic_istream&& rhs ;    ...  };   1082   I O Streams   Chapter 38  To  users of an istream, the sentry class is an implementation detail. It provides common code for standard-library and user-deﬁned input operations. Code that needs to be executed ﬁrst  the ‘‘preﬁx code’’  – such as ﬂushing a tied stream – is provided as the sentry’s constructor. For example:  template > basic_ostream & basic_ostream ::operator<< int i  {     checkwhether all is well for output to start  sentry s {∗this}; if  !s  {  setstate failbit ; return ∗this;  }     ... output the int ... return ∗this;  }  38.4.1.1  Formatted Input  A sentry is used by implementers of input operations rather than by their users.  Formatted input is primarily supplied by the >>  ‘‘input,’’ ‘‘get,’’ or ‘‘extraction’’  operator:  Formatted Input  §iso.27.7.2.2, §iso.21.4.8.9   in>>x  getline in,s   Read from in into x according to x’s type; x can be an arithmetic type, a pointer, a basic_string, a valarray, a basic_streambuf, or any type for which the user has supplied a suitable operator>>   Read a line from in into the string s  Built-in  types  are  ‘‘known’’ to istream  and ostream ,  so  if x is  a  built-in  type, cin>>x means cin.operator>> x . If x is  a  user-deﬁned  type, cin>>x, means operator>> cin,x   §18.2.5 .  That is, iostream input is type sensitive, inherently type-safe, and extensible.  A designer of a new type can provide I O operations without direct access to the implementation of iostream.  If a pointer to a function is the target of >>, that function will be invoked with the istream as its argument.  For example, cin>>pf yields pf cin . This is the basis for the input manipulators, such as skipws  §38.4.5.2 .  Output stream manipulators are more common than input stream manipulators, so the technique is explained further in §38.4.3.  Unless otherwise stated, an istream operation returns a reference to its istream, so that we can  ‘‘chain’’ operations.  For example:  template  void read_pair T1& x, T2& y  {  cin >> c1 >> x >> c2 >> y >> c3; if  c1!='{'  c2!=','  c3!='}'  {  }  }  cin.setstate ios_base::badbit ;  throw runtime_error "bad read of pair" ;     unrecoverableinput for materror    set badbit   Section 38.4.1.1  Formatted Input  1083  By default >> skips whitespace. For example:  for  int i; cin>>i && 0<i;   cout << i << '\n';  This will take a sequence of whitespace-separated positive integers and print them one to a line.  Skipping of whitespace can be suppressed using noskipws  §38.4.5.2 . The input operations are not virtual. That is, a user cannot do an in>>base where base is a class hierarchy and automatically have the >> resolved to an operation on the appropriate derived class. However, a simple technique can deliver that behavior; see §38.4.2.1. Furthermore, it is possible to extend such a scheme to be able to read objects of essentially arbitrary types from an input stream; see §22.2.4.  38.4.1.2  Unformatted Input  Unformatted  input  can  be  used  for  ﬁner  control  of  reading  and  potentially  for  improved perfor- mance.  One use of unformatted input is the implementation of formatted input:  x=in.get    in.get c  in.get p,n,t  in.get p,n  in.getline p,n,t   in.getline p,n  in.read p,n  x=in.gcount     in.putback c  in.unget    in.ignore n,d   in.ignore n   in.ignore    in.swap in2   Unformatted Input  §iso.27.7.2.3, §iso.27.7.2.3  Read one character from in and return its integer value; return EOF for end-of-ﬁle Read a character from in into c Read at most n characters from in into [p:... ; consider t a terminator in.g et p,n,'\n'  Read at most n characters from in into [p:... ; consider t a terminator; remove terminator from in in.g etline p,n,'\n'  read at most n characters from in into  [p:...  x is the number of characters read by the most recent unformatted input operation on in Put c back into in’s stream buffer Back up in’s stream buffer by one, so that the next character read is the same as the previous character Extract characters from in and discard them until either n characters have been discarded or d is found  and discarded  in.ignore n,traits::eof    in.ignore 1,traits::eof    Exchange the values of in and in2  If you have a choice, use formatted input  §38.4.1.1  instead these low-level input functions.  The simple get c  is useful when you need to compose your values out of characters. The other get   function and getline   read sequences of characters into a ﬁxed-size area [p:... .  They read until they reach the maximum number of characters or ﬁnd their terminator character  by default '\n' . They place a 0 at the end of the characters  if any  written to; getline   removes its terminator from the input, if found, whereas get   does not. For example:   1084   I O Streams   Chapter 38  void f   {     low-level, old-style line read  char word[MAX_WORD][MAX_LINE];  int i = 0; while cin.getline word[i++],MAX_LINE,'\n'  && i<MAX_WORD      MAX_WORD arraysofMAX_LINE char each   * do nothing*  ;     ...  }  For these functions, it is not immediately obvious what terminated the read:   cid:129  We found the terminator.  cid:129  We read the maximum number of characters.  cid:129  We hit end-of-ﬁle.  cid:129  There was a non-format input error.  The last two alternatives are handled by looking at the ﬁle state  §38.3 . Typically, the appropriate actions are quite different for these cases.  A read p,n  does not write a 0 to the array after the characters read. Obviously, the formatted  input operators are simpler to use and less error-prone than the unformatted ones.  The following functions depend on the detailed interaction between the stream buffer  §38.6   and the real data source and should be used only if necessary and then very carefully:  x=in.peek     n=in.readsome p,n   x=in.sync   pos=in.tellg    in.seekg pos  in.seekg off,dir   Unformatted Input  §iso.27.7.2.3  x is the current input character; x is not extracted from in’s stream buffer and will be the next character read If rdbuf  −>in_avail  ==−1, call setstate eofbit ; otherwise read at min n,most rdbuf  −>in_avail    characters into [p:... ; n is the number of characters read Synchronize buffers: in.rdbuf  −>pubsync   pos is the position of in’s get pointer Place in’s get pointer at position pos Place in’s get pointer at the offset off in the direction dir  38.4.2  Output Operations Output operations are provided by ostream  §38.6.1 , found in   except for the ones writ- ing out a string; those are found in  :  template > class basic_ostream : virtual public basic_ios  { public:  using char_type = C; using int_type = typename Tr::int_type; using pos_type = typename Tr::pos_type; using off_type = typename Tr::off_type; using traits_type = Tr;   Section 38.4.2  Output Operations  1085  explicit basic_ostream basic_streambuf ∗ sb ; virtual ˜basic_ostream  ;    release all resources  class sentry;     ...     see §38.4.1  protected:     move but no copy: basic_ostream const basic_ostream& rhs  = delete; basic_ostream basic_ostream&& rhs ; basic_ostream& operator= basic_ostream& rhs  = delete; basic_ostream& operator= const basic_ostream&& rhs ;    ...  An ostream offers formatted output, unformatted output  output of characters , and simple opera- tions on its streambuf  §38.6 :  Output Operations  §iso.27.7.3.6, §iso.27.7.3.7, §iso.21.4.8.9   out<<x  out.put c  out.write p,n  out.ﬂush   pos=out.tellp    out.seekp pos  out.seekp off,dir   Write x to out according to x’s type; x can be an arithmetic type, a pointer, a basic_string, a bitset, a complex, a valarray, or any type for which a user has deﬁned a suitable operator<<   Write the character c to out Write the characters [p:p+n  to out Empty the character buffer to the destination pos is the position of out’s put pointer Place out’s put pointer at position pos Place out’s put pointer at the offset off in the direction dir  Unless  otherwise  stated,  an ostream operation  returns  a  reference  to  its ostream, so that  we  can ‘‘chain’’ operations.  For example:  cout << "The value of x is " << x << '\n';  Note that char values are output as characters rather than small integers.  For example:  void print_val char ch  {  cout << "the value of '" << ch << "' is " << int{ch} << '\n';  };  }  }  void test   {  print_val 'a' ; print_val 'A' ;  This prints:  the value of 'a' is 97 the value of 'A' is 65   1086   I O Streams   Chapter 38  Versions of operator << for user-deﬁned types are usually trivial to write:  template  struct Named_val { string name; T value;  ostream& operator<< ostream& os, const Named_val& nv  {  return os << '{' << nv.name << ':' << nv.value << '}';  This will work for every Named_val  where X has a << deﬁned.  For full generality, << must be deﬁned for basic_string .  38.4.2.1  Virtual Output Functions  The ostream members  are  not virtual. The  output  operations  that  a  programmer  can  add  are  not members, so they cannot be virtual either. One reason for this is to achieve close to optimal perfor- mance for simple operations such as putting a character into a buffer. This is a place where run- time efﬁciency is often crucial so that inlining is a must. Virtual functions are used to achieve ﬂexi- bility for the operations dealing with buffer overﬂow and underﬂow only  §38.6 .  However,  a  programmer  sometimes  wants  to  output  an  object  for  which  only  a  base  class  is known.  Since the exact type isn’t known, correct output cannot be achieved simply by deﬁning a << for each new type.  Instead, a virtual output function can be provided in an abstract base:  class My_base { public:     ... virtual ostream& put ostream& s  const = 0;     write*this to s  ostream& operator<< ostream& s, const My_base& r  {  return r.put s ;    use the right put    That is, put   is a virtual function that ensures that the right output operation is used in <<.  Given that, we can write:  class Sometype : public My_base { public:     ... ostream& put ostream& s  const override;      the real output function  void f const My_base& r, Sometype& s     use << which calls the right put   {  cout << r << s;  };  }  };  }  };  }   Section 38.4.2.1  Virtual Output Functions  1087  This integrates the virtual put   into the framework provided by ostream and <<. The technique is generally useful to provide operations that act like virtual functions, but with the run-time selection based on their second argument.  This is similar to the technique that under the name double dis- patch is often used to select an operation based on two dynamic types  §22.3.1 . A similar tech- nique can be used to make input operations virtual  §22.2.4 .  38.4.3  Manipulators If a pointer to function is given as the second argument to <<, the function pointed to is called. For example, cout<<pf means pf cout . Such a function is called a manipulator. Manipulators that take arguments can be useful. For example:  cout << setprecision 4  << angle;  This prints the value of the ﬂoating-point variable angle with four digits.  To  do this, setprecision returns an object that is initialized by 4 and calls cout.precision 4  when invoked.  Such a manipulator is a function object that is invoked by << rather than by   . The exact type of that function object is implementation-deﬁned, but it might be deﬁned like this:  struct smanip {  ios_base&  ∗f  ios_base&,int ;  int i; smanip ios_base& ∗ff  ios_base&,int , int ii  :f{ff}, i{ii} { }     function to be called    value to be used  };  }  }  template  basic_ostream & operator & os, const smanip& m  {  m.f os,m.i ;  return os;     call m’sfwith m’sstored value  We can now deﬁne setprecision   like this:  inline smanip setprecision int n  {  auto h = [] ios_base& s, int x  −> ios_base& { s.precision x ; return s; }; return smanip h,n ;     makethe function object  The  explicit  speciﬁcation  of  the  return  type  for  the  lambda  is  needed  to  return  a  reference. An ios_base cannot be copied by a user.  We can now write:  cout << setprecision 4  << angle;  A programmer can deﬁne new manipulators in the style of smanip as needed. Doing this does not require modiﬁcation of the deﬁnitions of standard-library templates and classes.  The standard-library manipulators are described in §38.4.5.2.   1088   I O Streams   Chapter 38  38.4.4  Stream State In  , the  standard  library  deﬁnes  the  base  class ios_base deﬁning  most  of  the  interface  to  a stream class:  template > class basic_ios : public ios_base { public:  using char_type = C; using int_type = typename Tr::int_type; using pos_type = typename Tr::pos_type; using off_type = Tr::off_type; using traits_type = Tr;    ...  };  };  The basic_ios class manages the state of a stream:   cid:129  The mapping between a stream and its buffers  §38.6   cid:129  The formatting options  §38.4.5.1   cid:129  The use of locales  Chapter 39   cid:129  Error handling  §38.3   cid:129  Connections to other streams and stdio  §38.4.4   It might be the most complicated class in the standard library.  The ios_base holds information that does not depend on template arguments:  class ios_base { public:  using fmtﬂags =  * implementation-deﬁned type* ; using iostate =  * implementation-deﬁned type* ; using openmode =  * implementation-deﬁned type* ; using seekdir =  * implementation-deﬁned type* ;  class failure; class Init;     exception class    initializestandard iostreams  The implementation-deﬁned types are all bitmask types; that is, they support bitwise logical opera- tions, such as & and . Examples are int  §11.1.2  and bitset  §34.2.2 .  The ios_base controls an iostream’s connection  or lack thereof  to stdio  §43.3 :  Fundamental ios_base Operations  §iso.27.5.3.4   ios_base b {}; ios.˜ios_base   b2=sync_with_stdio b   b=sync_with_stdio     Default constructor; protected Destructor; virtual If b==true synchronize ios with stdio; otherwise shared buffers might be corrupted; b is the previous synchronization state; static b=sync_with_stdio true   A call  of sync_with_stdio true  before  the  ﬁrst iostream operation  in  the  execution  of  a  program   Section 38.4.4  Stream State  1089  guarantees  that  the iostream and  stdio   §43.3   I O  operations  share  buffers.  A call  of sync_with_stdio false  before the ﬁrst stream I O operation prevents buffer sharing and can improve I O performance signiﬁcantly on some implementations.  Note that ios_base has no copy or move operations.  ios_base Stream State iostate Member Constants  §iso.27.5.3.1.3   badbit failbit eofbit goodbit  Something unexpected and serious happened  e.g., a disk read error  Something unexpected happened  e.g., we looked for a digit and found 'x'  We hit end-of-input  e.g., end-of-ﬁle  All is well  Functions for reading these bits  good  , fail  , etc.  in a stream are provided by basic_ios.  ios_base Mode openmode Member Constants  §iso.27.5.3.1.4   app ate binary in out trunc  Append  insert output at end-of-stream  At end  position to end-of-stream  Don’t apply formatting to characters Input stream Output stream Truncate stream before use  set the stream’s size to zero   The exact meaning of ios_base::binary is implementation-dependent. However, the usual meaning is that a character gets mapped to a byte.

This ios is implicitly converted to a bool representing the state of cin. Thus, we could equivalently have written:  The tie   is used to ensure that output from a tied stream appears before an input from the stream to which it is tied. For example, cout is tied to cin:  for  X x; cin>>x;  {     ...  for  X x; ! cin>>x .fail  ;  {     ...  }  }  cout << "Please enter a number: "; int num; cin >> num;  This code does not explicitly call cout.ﬂush  , so had cout not been tied to cin, the user would see the request for input.  ios_base Operations  §iso.27.5.3.5, §iso.27.5.3.6   i=xalloc    r=iob.iword i   r=iob.pword i   iob.register_callback fn,i   i is the index of a new  iword,pword  pair; static r is a reference to the ith long r is a reference to the ith void∗ Register callback fn to iword i   Sometimes, people want to add to the state of a stream. For example, one might want a stream to ‘‘know’’ whether a complex should be output in polar or Cartesian coordinates. Class ios_base pro- vides a function xalloc   to allocate space for such simple state information. The value returned by xalloc   identiﬁes a pair of locations that can be accessed by iword   and pword  .  Sometimes, an implementer or a user needs to be notiﬁed about a change in a stream’s state. The register_callback   function ‘‘registers’’ a function to be called when its ‘‘event’’ occurs.  Thus, a call of imbue  , copyfmt  , or ˜ios_base   will call a function ‘‘registered’’ for an imbue_event, copy- fmt_event, or erase_event, respectively. When the state changes, registered functions are called with the argument i supplied by their register_callback  .  The event and event_callback types are deﬁned in ios_base:   1092   I O Streams   Chapter 38  enum event {  erase_event, imbue_event, copyfmt_event  }; using event_callback = void  ∗  event, ios_base&, int index ;  38.4.5  Formatting The format of stream I O is controlled by a combination of object type, stream state  §38.4.4 , for- mat state  §38.4.5.1 , locale information  Chapter 39 , and explicit operations  e.g., manipulators; §38.4.5.2 .  38.4.5.1  Formatting State  In  , the standard library deﬁnes a set of formatting constants of an implementation-deﬁned bit- mask type fmtﬂags as members of class ios_base:  ios_base Formatting fmtﬂags Constants  §iso.27.5.3.1.2   boolalpha dec hex oct ﬁxed scientiﬁc internal left right showbase  showpoint showpos skipws unitbuf uppercase adjustﬁeld baseﬁeld ﬂoatﬁeld  Use symbolic representation of true and false Integer base is 10 Integer base is 16 Integer base is 8 Floating-point format dddd.dd Scientiﬁc format d.ddddEdd Pad between a preﬁx  such as +  and the number Pad after the value Pad before the value On output, preﬁx octal numbers by 0 and hexadecimal numbers by 0x Always show the decimal point  e.g., 123.  Show + for positive numbers  e.g., +123  Skip whitespace on input Flush after each output operation Use uppercase in numeric output, e.g., 1.2E10 and 0X1A2 Set a value’s placement in its ﬁeld: left, right, or internal Set the integer’s base: dec, oct, or hex Set the ﬂoating-point format: scientiﬁc or ﬁxed  Curiously, there are no defaultﬂoat or hexﬂoat ﬂags.  To get the equivalent, use manipulators default- ﬂoat and hexﬂoat  §38.4.5.2 , or manipulate the ios_base directly:  ios.unsetf ios_base::ﬂoatﬁeld ;  ios.setf ios_base::ﬁxed  ios_base::scientiﬁc, ios_base::ﬂoatﬁeld ;     use the default ﬂoating-point for mat     use hexadecimal ﬂoats  An iostream’s format state can be read and written  set  by operations provided in its ios_base:   Section 38.4.5.1  Formatting State  1093  ios_base Formatting fmtﬂags Operations  §iso.27.5.3.2   f=ios.ﬂags    f2=ios.ﬂags f  f2=ios.setf f  f2=ios.setf f,m   ios.unsetf f  n=ios.precision    n2=ios.precision n  n=ios.width    n2=ios.width n   f is ios’s formatting ﬂags Set ios’s formatting ﬂags to f; f2 is the old value of the ﬂags Set ios’s formatting ﬂags to f; f2 is the old value of the ﬂags f2=ios.setf f&m  Clear the ﬂags f in ios n is ios’s precision Set ios’s precision to n; n2 is the old precision n is ios’s width Set ios’s width to n; n2 is the old width  Precision is an integer that determines the number of digits used to display a ﬂoating-point number:  cid:129  The general format   defaultﬂoat  lets  the  implementation  choose  a  format  that  presents  a value in the style that best preserves the value in the space available.  The precision speciﬁes the maximum number of digits.   cid:129  The scientiﬁc format  scientiﬁc  presents a value with one digit before a decimal point and an exponent.  The precision speciﬁes the maximum number of digits after the decimal point.  cid:129  The ﬁxed format  ﬁxed  presents a value as an integer part followed by a decimal point and a fractional  part. The  precision  speciﬁes  the  maximum  number  of  digits  after  the  decimal point.  For example, see §38.4.5.2.  Floating-point values are rounded rather than just truncated, and precision   doesn’t affect integer output.  For example:  cout.precision 8 ; cout << 1234.56789 << ' ' << 1234.56789 << ' ' << 123456 << '\n';  cout.precision 4 ; cout << 1234.56789 << ' ' << 1234.56789 << ' ' << 123456 << '\n';  This produces:  1234.5679 1234.5679 123456 1235 1235 123456  The width   function speciﬁes the minimum number of characters to be used for the next standard- library << output operation of a numeric value, bool, C-style string, character, pointer, string, and bitset  §34.2.2 .  For example:     print12 preceded bytwo spaces  The ‘‘padding’’ or ‘‘ﬁller’’ character can be speciﬁed by the ﬁll   function.  For example:  cout.width 4 ; cout << 12;  cout.width 4 ; cout.ﬁll '' ; cout << "ab";     printab  The default ﬁll character is the space character, and the default ﬁeld size is 0, meaning ‘‘as many characters as needed.’’  The ﬁeld size can be reset to its default value like this:   1094   I O Streams   Chapter 38  cout.width 0 ;      ‘‘as manycharacters as needed’’  A call width n  sets the minimum number of characters to n. If more characters are provided, they will all be printed. For example:  cout.width 4 ; cout << "abcdef";     printabcdef  It does not truncate the output to abcd. It is usually better to get the right output looking ugly than to get the wrong output looking just ﬁne.  A width n  call affects only the immediately following << output operation. For example:  cout.width 4 ; cout.ﬁll '' ; cout << 12 << ':' << 13;     print12:13  This produces 12:13, rather than 12:13.  If the explicit control of formatting options through many separate operations becomes tedious,  we can combine them using a user-deﬁned manipulator  §38.4.5.3 .  An ios_base also allows the programmer to set an iostream’s locale  Chapter 39 :  ios_base locale Operations  §iso.27.5.3.3   loc2=ios.imbue loc  loc=ios.getloc    Set ios’s locale to loc; loc2 is the old value of the locale loc is ios’s locale  38.4.5.2  Standard Manipulators  The  standard  library  provides  manipulators  corresponding  to  the  various  format  states  and  state changes.

For example:  cout << 1234 << ',' << hex << 1234 << ',' << oct << 1234 << '\n';     print1234,4d2,2322  We can explicitly set the output format for ﬂoating-point numbers:  constexpr double d = 123.456;  cout << d << "; "  << scientiﬁc << d << "; " << hexﬂoat << d << "; " << ﬁxed << d << "; " << defaultﬂoat << d << '\n';  This produces:  123.456; 1.234560e+002; 0x1.edd2f2p+6; 123.456000; 123.456  The ﬂoating-point format is ‘‘sticky’’; that is, it persists for subsequent ﬂoating-point operations.

Here, I present an additional style that I have found useful for formatting ﬂoating-point numbers.  Formatting is controlled by a confusing multitude of separate functions  §38.4.5.1 . For exam- ple, a precision   persists for all output operations, but a width   applies to the next numeric output operation only. What I want is something that makes it simple to output a ﬂoating-point number in a predeﬁned format without affecting future output operations on the stream. The basic idea is to deﬁne a class that represents formats, another that represents a format plus a value to be formatted, and then an operator << that outputs the value to an ostream according to the format. For example:  Form gen4 {4};     general for mat,precision 4  void f double d  {  Form sci8; sci8.scientiﬁc  .precision 8 ;  cout << d << ' ' << gen4 d  << ' ' << sci8 d  << ' ' << d << '\n';     scientiﬁc for mat,precision 8  Form sci {10,ios_base::scientiﬁc};    scientiﬁc for mat,precision 10 cout << d << ' ' << gen4 d  << ' ' << sci d  << ' ' << d << '\n';  Note how the use of a Form doesn’t affect the state of the stream, so that the last output of d has the same default format as the ﬁrst.  }  A call f 1234.56789  writes:  1234.57 1235 1.23456789e+003 1234.57 1234.57 1235 1.2345678900e+003 1234.57  Here is a simpliﬁed implementation:  class Form;     our for mattingtype     Form plus value  struct Bound_form { const Form& f; double val;  };  class Form {  friend ostream& operator<< ostream&, const Bound_form& ;  int prc;  int wdt; int fmt;    ...     precision    width 0 means ‘‘as wide as necessary’’    general, scientiﬁc,orﬁxed §38.4.5.1    1098   I O Streams   Chapter 38  public:  }  explicit Form int p =6, ios_base::fmtﬂags f =0, int w =0  : prc{p}, fmt{f}, wdt{w} {}  Bound_form Form::operator   double d  const {  return Bound_form{∗this,d};     makeaBound_for mfor*this and d  Form& scientiﬁc   { fmt = ios_base::scientiﬁc; return ∗this; } Form& ﬁxed   { fmt = ios_base::ﬁxed; return ∗this; } Form& general   { fmt = 0; return ∗this; }  Form& uppercase  ; Form& lowercase  ; Form& precision int p  { prc = p; return ∗this; }  Form& width int w  { wdt = w; return ∗this; } Form& ﬁll char ;     applies to all types  Form& plus bool b = true ; Form& trailing_zeros bool b = true ;    ...     explicit plus    printtrailing zeros  };  }  The idea is that a Form holds all the information needed to format one data item. The default is chosen to be reasonable for many uses, and the various member functions can be used to reset indi- vidual aspects of formatting. The    operator is used to bind a value with the format to be used to output it. A Bound_form  that is, a Form plus a value  can then be output to a given stream by a suitable << function:  ostream& operator<< ostream& os, const Bound_form& bf  {     §38.2.2  ostringstream s; s.precision bf.f.prc ; s.setf bf.f.fmt,ios_base::ﬂoatﬁeld ; s << bf.val;  return os << s.str  ;     compose string in s    output s to os  Writing a less simplistic implementation of << is left as an exercise.  Note  that  these  declarations  make the  combination  of << and    into  a  ternary  operator; cout<<sci4{d} collects the ostream, the format, and the value into a single function before doing any real computation.  38.5  Stream Iterators In  , the standard library provides iterators to allow input and output streams to be viewed as sequences [input-begin:end-of-input  and [output-begin:end-of-output :   Section 38.5  Stream Iterators  1099  };  };  1; 2; 3;  template<typename T,  typename C = char, typename Tr = char_traits , typename Distance = ptrdiff_t>  class istream_iterator  :public iterator  { using char_type = C; using traits_type = Tr; using istream_type = basic_istream ;    ...  template > class ostream_iterator: public iterator  {  using char_type = C; using traits_type = Tr; using ostream_type = basic_ostream ;    ...  For example:  copy istream_iterator {cin}, istream_iterator {},  ostream_iterator {cout,";\n"} ;  When an ostream_iterator is constructed with a second  string  argument, that string is output as a terminator after every element value. So, if you enter 1 2 3 to that call of copy  , the output is:  The operators provided for a stream_iterator are the same as for other iterator adaptors  §33.2.2 :  Stream Iterator Operations  §iso.24.6   istream_iterator p {st}; istream_iterator p {p2}; ostream_iterator p {st}; ostream_iterator p {p2}; ostream_iterator p {st,s};  p=p2  p2=++p  p2=p++  ∗p=x ∗p++=x  Iterator for input stream st Copy constructor: p is a copy of the istream_iterator p2 Iterator for output stream st Copy constructor: p is a copy of the ostream_iterator p2 Iterator for output stream st; use the C-style string s as the separator between output elements p is a copy of p2 p and p2 point to the next element p2=p,++p Insert x before p Insert x before p, then increment p  Except  for  the  constructors,  these  operations  are  typically  used  by  general  algorithms,  such  as copy  , rather than directly.   1100   I O Streams   Chapter 38  38.6  Buffering Conceptually, an output  stream  puts  characters  into  a  buffer. Sometime  later, the  characters  are then written to  ‘‘ﬂushed to’’  wherever they are supposed to go. Such a buffer is called a stream- buf. Its  deﬁnition  is  found  in  . Different  types  of streambufs implement  different buffering strategies.  Typically, the streambuf stores characters in an array until an overﬂow forces it to  write  the  characters  to  their  real  destination. Thus,  an ostream can  be  represented  graphically like this:  ostream:  locale:  streambuf:  tellp   begin current  end  real destination  character buffer  The set of template arguments for an ostream and its streambuf must be the same, and they deter- mine the type of character used in the character buffer.  An istream is similar, except that the characters ﬂow the other way. Unbuffered I O is simply I O where the streambuf immediately transfers each character, rather  than holding on to characters until enough have been gathered for efﬁcient transfer.  The key class in the buffering mechanisms is basic_streambuf:  template > class basic_streambuf { public:  using char_type = C; using int_type = typename Tr::int_type;   using pos_type = typename Tr::pos_type;  using off_type = typename Tr::off_type;  using traits_type = Tr;    ... vir tual ˜basic_streambuf  ;  };     the type of a character    the integer type to which    acharacter can be converted    type of position in buffer    type of offset from position in buffer  As usual, a couple of aliases are provided for the  supposedly  most common cases:  using streambuf = basic_streambuf ; using wstreambuf = basic_streambuf ;  The basic_streambuf has a host of operations. Many of the public operations simply call a protected virtual function that ensures that a function from a derived class implemented the operation appro- priately for the particular kind of buffer:   Section 38.6  Buffering   1101  public basic_streambuf  Operations  §iso.27.6.3  Destructor: release all resources; virtual loc is sb’s locale sb.imbue loc ; loc2 is a pointer to the previous locale psb=sb.setbuf s,n  pos=sb.seekoff n,w,m  pos=sb.seekoff n,w  pos=sb.seekpos n,m  pos=sb.seekpos n,ios_base::inios_base::out  sb.sync    sb.˜basic_streambuf   loc=sb.g etloc   loc2=sb.pubimbue loc   psb=sb.pubsetbuf s,n   pos=sb.pubseekoff n,w,m   pos=sb.pubseekoff n,w   pos=sb.pubseekpos n,m   pos=sb.pubseekpos n   sb.pubsync     All constructors are protected because basic_streambuf is designed as a base class.  protected basic_streambuf  Operations  §iso.27.6.3   basic_streambuf sb {}; basic_streambuf sb {sb2}; sb=sb2   sb.swap sb2  sb.imbue loc   psb=sb.setbuf s,n   pos=sb.seekoff n,w,m   pos=sb.seekoff n,w   pos=sb.seekpos n,m   n=sb.sync    Construct sb with no character buffer and the global locale sb is a copy of sb2  they share a character buffer  sb is a copy of sb2  they share a character buffer ; sb’s old resources are released Exchange the states of sb and sb2 loc becomes sb’s locale; virtual Set sb’s buffer; psb=&sb; s is a const char∗ and n is a streamsiz e; virtual Seek with an offset n, a direction w, and a mode m; pos is the resulting position or pos_type off_type −1  , indicating an error; virtual pos=sb.seekoff n,way,ios_base::inios_base::out  Seek to position n and a mode m; pos is the resulting position or pos_type off_type −1  , indicating an error; virtual Synchronize the character buffers with the real destination or source; virtual  The exact meaning of the virtual functions are determined by derived classes.  A streambuf has a put area into which << and other output operations write  §38.4.2 , and a get area from which >> and other input operations read  §38.4.1 .

It returns an estimate of how many characters can be read ‘‘soon,’’  say, by emptying the operating system’s buffers rather than waiting for a disk read. A call to showmanyc   returns −1 if it cannot promise that any character can be read without encountering end-of-ﬁle. This is  necessarily  rather low-level and highly imple- mentation-dependent.  Don’t use showmanyc   without a careful reading of your system documenta- tion and conducting a few experiments.  38.6.1  Output Streams and Buffers An ostream provides  operations  for  converting  values  of  various  types  into  character  sequences according  to  conventions   §38.4.2   and  explicit  formatting  directives  §38.4.5 .  In addition,  an ostream provides operations that deal directly with its streambuf:  template > class basic_ostream : virtual public basic_ios  { public:     ... explicit basic_ostream basic_streambuf ∗ b ;  pos_type tellp  ; basic_ostream& seekp pos_type ; basic_ostream& seekp off_type, ios_base::seekdir ;      get current position    set current position    set current position  basic_ostream& ﬂush  ;     empty buffer  to real destination   basic_ostream& operator ∗ b ;      writefrom b  };  The basic_ostream functions override their equivalents in the basic_ostream’s basic_ios base.  An ostream is  constructed  with  a streambuf argument,  which  determines  how the  characters written are handled and where they eventually go. For example, an ostringstream  §38.2.2  or an ofstream  §38.2.1  is created by initializing an ostream with a suitable streambuf  §38.6 .   1104   I O Streams   Chapter 38  The seekp   functions are used to position an ostream for writing. The p sufﬁx indicates that it is the position used for putting characters into the stream. These functions have no effect unless the stream is attached to something for which positioning is meaningful, such as a ﬁle. The pos_type represents a character position in a ﬁle, and the off_type represents an offset from a point indicated by an ios_base::seekdir.  Stream positions start at 0, so we can think of a ﬁle as an array of n characters.  For example:  int f ofstream& fout     fout refers to some ﬁle {  fout << "0123456789"; fout.seekp 8 ;  fout << ''; fout.seekp −4,ios_base::cur ;  fout << '∗';      8from beginning    add '' and move position  +1     4backward    add '*' and move position  +1   If the ﬁle was initially empty, we get:  }  01234∗679  There is no similar way to do random access on elements of a plain istream or ostream. Attempting to  seek  beyond  the  beginning  or  the  end  of  a  ﬁle  typically  puts  the  stream  into  the bad   state  §38.4.4 .  However,  some  operating  systems  have  operating  modes  where  the  behavior  differs  e.g., positioning might resize a ﬁle .  The ﬂush   operation allows the user to empty the buffer without waiting for an overﬂow. It is possible to use << to write a streambuf directly into an ostream. This is primarily handy for  implementers of I O mechanisms.  38.6.2  Input Streams and Buffers An istream provides operations for reading characters and converting them into values of various types  §38.4.1 . In addition, an istream provides operations that deal directly with its streambuf:  template > class basic_istream : virtual public basic_ios  { public:     ... explicit basic_istream basic_streambuf ∗ b ; pos_type tellg  ; basic_istream& seekg pos_type ; basic_istream& seekg off_type, ios_base::seekdir ;      get current position    set current position    set current position  basic_istream& putback C c ; basic_istream& unget  ;  int_type peek  ;     put c backinto the buffer    put backmost recent char read    look at next character to be read  int sync  ;     clear buffer  ﬂush   basic_istream& operator>> basic_streambuf ∗ b ;  basic_istream& get basic_streambuf & b, C t = Tr::newline   ;     read into b   Section 38.6.2  Input Streams and Buffers  1105  streamsize readsome C∗ p, streamsize n ;      read at most n char  };  The basic_istream functions override their equivalents in the basic_istream’s basic_ios base.  The positioning functions work like their ostream counterparts  §38.6.1 . The g sufﬁx indicates that it is the position used for getting characters from the stream. The p and g sufﬁxes are needed because we can create an iostream derived from both istream and ostream, and such a stream needs to keep track of both a get position and a put position.  The putback   function allows a program to put a character ‘‘back’’ into an istream to be the next character  read. The unget   function  puts  the  most  recently  read  character  back. Unfortunately, backing  up  an  input  stream  is  not  always  possible. For example,  trying  to  back  up  past  the  ﬁrst character read will set ios_base::failbit. What is guaranteed is that you can back up one character after a successful read. The peek   function reads the next character and also leaves that character in  the streambuf so  that  it  can  be  read  again.  Thus, c=peek   is  logically  equivalent  to  c=get  ,unget  ,c . Setting failbit might trigger an exception  §38.3 .  Flushing an istream is done using sync  . This cannot always be done right. For some kinds of streams, we would have to reread characters from the real source – and that is not always possible or  desirable   e.g.,  for  a  stream  attached  to  a  network .  Consequently, sync   returns 0 if  it  suc- ceeded.  If it failed, it sets ios_base::badbit  §38.4.4  and returns −1. Setting badbit might trigger an exception  §38.3 . A sync   on a buffer attached to an ostream ﬂushes the buffer to output.  The >> and get   operations that directly reads from a streambuf are primarily useful for imple-  menters of I O facilities.  The readsome   function is a low-level operation that allows a user to peek at a stream to see if there are any characters available to read. This can be most useful when it is undesirable to wait for input, say, from a keyboard.  See also in_avail    §38.6 .  38.6.3  Buffer Iterators In  , the standard library provides istreambuf_iterator and ostreambuf_iterator to allow a user  mostly an implementer of a new kind of iostream  to iterate over the contents of a stream buffer. In particular, these iterators are widely used by locale facets  Chapter 39 .  38.6.3.1 istreambuf_iterator  An istreambuf_iterator reads a stream of characters from an istream_buffer:  template >  class istreambuf_iterator     §iso.24.6.3  :public iterator  {  public:  };  using char_type = C; using traits_type = Tr; using int_type = typename Tr::int_type; using streambuf_type = basic_streambuf ; using istream_type = basic_istream ;    ...   1106   I O Streams   Chapter 38  The reference member of the iterator base is not used and is consequently left unspeciﬁed.  If you use an istreambuf_iterator as an input iterator, its effect is like that of other input iterators:  a stream of characters can be read from input using c=∗p++:  istreambuf_iterator   §iso.24.6.3   istreambuf_iterator p {}; istreambuf_iterator p {p2}; istreambuf_iterator p {is}; istreambuf_iterator p {psb}; istreambuf_iterator p {nullptr};  istreambuf_iterator p {prox};  p.˜istreambuf_iterator   c=∗p p−>m p=++p prox=p++ p.equal p2  p==p2  p!=p2   p is an end-of-stream iterator; noexcept; constexpr Copy constructor; noexcept p is an iterator for is.rdbuf  ; noexcept p is an iterator to the istreambuf ∗psb; noexcept p is an end-of-stream iterator p points to the istreambuf designated by prox; noexcept Destructor c is the character returned by the streambuf’s sgetc   The member m of ∗p, if that is a class object The streambuf’s sbumpc   Let prox designate the same position as p; then ++p Are both p and p2, or neither, at end-of-stream p.equal p2  !p.equal p2   Note that any attempt to be clever when comparing istreambuf_iterators will fail: you cannot rely on two iterators referring to the same character while input is going on.  38.6.3.2 ostreambuf_iterator  An ostreambuf_iterator writes a stream of characters to an ostream_buffer:  template >  class ostreambuf_iterator     §iso.24.6.4  :public iterator  {  public:  };  using char_type = C; using traits_type = Tr; using streambuf_type = basic_streambuf ; using ostream_type = basic_ostream ;    ...  By most measures, ostreambuf_iterator’s operations are odd, but the net effect is that if you use it as an output iterator, its effect is like that of other output iterators: a stream of characters can be writ- ten to output using ∗p++=c:  ostreambuf_iterator   §iso.24.6.4   continues   ostreambuf_iterator p {os}; ostreambuf_iterator p {psb};  p is an iterator for os.rdbuf  ; noexcept p is an iterator for the istreambuf ∗psb; noexcept   Section 38.6.3.2  ostreambuf_iterator  1107  ostreambuf_iterator   continued   §iso.24.6.4   p=c ∗p ++p p++ p.failed    If !p.failed   call the streambuf’s sputc c  Do nothing Do nothing Do nothing Has a sputc   on p’s streambuf reached eof? noexcept  38.7  Advice [1]  Deﬁne  > for user-deﬁned types with values that have meaningful textual representa-  tions; §38.1, §38.4.1, §38.4.2.

The notion of a locale is extensible so that a programmer can add new facets to a locale representing  locale-speciﬁc  entities  not  directly  supported  by  the  standard  library, such  as  postal codes  zip codes  and phone numbers. The primary use of locales in the standard library is to con- trol the appearance of information written to an ostream and the format of data read by an istream.  This chapter describes how to use a locale, how a locale is constructed out of facets, and how a  locale affects an I O stream.  The notion of a locale is not primarily a C++ notion. Most operating systems and application environments have a notion of locale. Such a notion is – in principle – shared among all programs   1110  Locales  Chapter 39  on  a  system,  independently  of  which  programming  language  they are  written  in. Thus,  the  C++ standard-library notion of a locale can be seen as a standard and portable way for C++ programs to access  information  that  has  very  different  representations  on  different  systems. Among  other things, a C++ locale is an interface to system information that is represented in incompatible ways on different systems.  Consider writing a program that needs to be used in several countries. Writing a program in a style that allows that is often called internationalization  emphasizing the use of a program in many countries  or localization  emphasizing the adaptation of a program to local conditions . Many of the entities that a program manipulates will conventionally be displayed differently in those coun- tries.  We can handle this by writing our I O routines to take this into account. For example:  void print_date const Date& d  {     printin the appropriate for mat  switch where_am_I  { case DK:     e.g., 7. marts 1999     user-deﬁned style indicator  cout << d.day   << ". " << dk_month[d.month  ] << " " << d.year  ; break;  case ISO:     e.g., 1999-3-7  cout << d.year   << " − " << d.month   << "   " << d.day  ; break;  case US:     e.g., 3 7 1999  cout << d.month   << " " << d.day   << " " << d.year  ; break;     ... }  }  }  This style of code does the job. Howev er, such code is ugly and hard to maintain. In particular, we have to use this style consistently to ensure that all output is properly adjusted to local conventions. If we want to add a new way of writing a date, we must modify the application code. Worse yet, writing dates is only one of many examples of cultural differences.  Consequently, the standard library provides an extensible way of handling cultural conventions. The iostream library relies on this framework to handle both built-in and user-deﬁned types  §38.1 . For example, consider a simple loop copying  Date,double  pairs that might represent a series of measurements or a set of transactions:  void cpy istream& is, ostream& os    copy Date,double  stream {  Date d; double volume;  while  is >> d >> volume   os << d << ' '<< volume << '\n';  Naturally, a real program would do something with the records and ideally also be a bit more care- ful about error handling.  How would we make this program read a ﬁle that conformed to French conventions  where a comma is the character used to represent the decimal point in a ﬂoating-point number; for example,   Section 39.1  Handling Cultural Differences   1111  12,5 means  twelve and  a  half   and  write  it  according  to  American  conventions?  We can  deﬁne locales and I O operations so that cpy   can be used to convert between conventions:  void f istream& ﬁn, ostream& fout, istream& ﬁn2, ostream& fout2  {  ﬁn.imbue locale{"en_US.UTF−8"} ;  fout.imbue locale{"fr_FR.UTF−8"} ;  cpy ﬁn,fout ;     ...     AmericanEnglish    French    read American English, write French  ﬁn2.imbue locale{"fr_FR.UTF−8"} ;  fout2.imbue locale{"en_US.UTF−8"} ;  cpy ﬁn2,fout2 ;     ...     French    AmericanEnglish    read French, write American English  }  Given these streams:  Apr 12, 1999 Apr 13, 1999 Apr 14, 1999 ... 3 juillet 1950 3 juillet 1951 3 juillet 1952 ...  1000.3 345.45 9688.321  10,3 134,45 67,9  this program would produce:  12 avril 1999 1000,3 13 avril 1999 345,45 14 avril 1999 9688,321 ... July 3, 1950 10.3 July 3, 1951 134.45 July 3, 1952 67.9 ...  Much of the rest of this chapter is devoted to describing the mechanisms that make this possible and explaining how to use them. However,  most programmers will have little reason to deal with the  details  of locales and  will  never explicitly  manipulate  a locale. At most,  they will  simply retrieve a standard locale and imbue a stream with it  §38.4.5.1 .  The  concept  of  localization   internationalization   is  simple. However,  practical  constraints  make the design and implementation of locale quite intricate:  [1]  A locale encapsulates cultural conventions, such as the appearance of a date. Such con- ventions vary in many subtle and unsystematic ways.  These conventions have nothing to do with programming languages, so a programming language cannot standardize them.  [2]  The concept of a locale must be extensible, because it is not possible to enumerate every  cultural convention that is important to every C++ user.   1112  Locales  Chapter 39  [3]  A locale is used in operations  e.g., I O and sorting  from which people demand run-time  efﬁciency.  [4]  A locale must be invisible to the majority of programmers who want to beneﬁt from facil- ities ‘‘doing the right thing’’ without having to know exactly what ‘‘the right thing’’ is or how it is achieved.  [5]  A locale must be available to designers of facilities that deal with culture-sensitive infor-  mation beyond the scope of the standard.  The mechanisms provided to compose those locales and to make them trivial to use constitute a lit- tle programming language of their own.  A locale is  composed  of facets that  control  individual  aspects,  such  as  the  character  used  for punctuation in the output of a ﬂoating-point value  decimal_point  ; §39.4.2  and the format used to read  a  monetary  value   moneypunct; §39.4.3 .  A facet is  an  object  of  a  class  derived from  class locale::facet  §39.3 .  We can think of a locale as a container of facets  §39.2, §39.3.1 .  39.2  Class locale The locale class and its associated facilities are presented in  .  locale loc {}; locale loc {loc2};  locale loc {s};  locale loc {loc2,s,cat};  locale loc {loc2,pf};  locale loc {loc2,loc3,cat};  loc.˜locale   loc2=loc loc3=loc.combine  loc2    s=loc.name    loc==loc2 loc!=loc2  loc   s,s2  loc2=global loc  loc=classic     locale Members  §iso.22.3.1   loc is a copy of the current global locale; noexcept Copy constructor: loc holds a copy of loc2; loc.name  ==loc2.name  ; noexcept Initialize loc to the locale with the name s; s can be a string or a C-style string; loc.name  ==s; explicit loc is a copy of loc2 except for the facet with category cat, which is copied from locale{s}; s can be a string or a C-style string; if loc2 has a name, loc has a name loc is a copy of loc2 except for the facet ∗pf provided pf!=nullptr; loc does not have a name loc is a copy of loc2 except for the facet with category cat, which is copied from loc3; loc has a name if loc2 and loc3 both have names Destructor; not virtual; noexcept Assignment: loc2 is a copy of loc; noexcept loc3 is a copy of loc except for facet F, which is copied from loc2; loc3 does not have a name s is the name of loc’s locale or "∗" Is loc the same locale as loc2? ! loc==loc2  Compare basic_string s s and s2, using loc’s collate  facet Set the global locale to loc; loc2 is the previous global locale loc is the classic ‘‘C’’ locale   Section 39.2  Class locale  1113  If a locale of a given name or a facet referred to doesn’t exist, the locale operation naming it throws a runtime_error.  Naming of locales is a bit curious. When you make a new locale from another plus a facet and the resulting locale has a name, that name is implementation-deﬁned. Often, such an implementa- tion-deﬁned  name  includes  the  name  of  the locale that  supplied  most  of  the facets.  For  a locale without a name, name   returns "∗".  A locale can be thought of as an interface to a map , that is, something that allows us to use a locale::id to ﬁnd a corresponding object of a class derived from locale::facet. A real imple- mentation of locale is an efﬁcient variant of this idea. The layout will be something like this:  locale:  collate :  compare    hash    ...  numpunct :  decimal_point    truename    ...  Here, collate  and numpunct  are standard-library facets  §39.4 . All facets are derived from locale::facet.  A locale is  meant  to  be  copied  freely  and  cheaply. Consequently, a locale is  almost  certainly implemented  as  a  handle  to  the  specialized map  that  constitutes  the  main  part  of  its implementation.  The facets must be quickly accessible in a locale. Consequently, the specialized map  will  be  optimized  to  provide  array-like fast  access. The facets of a locale are accessed by using the use_facet  loc  notation; see §39.3.1.  The standard library provides a rich set of facets.  To help the programmer manipulate facets in  logical groups, the standard facets are grouped into categories, such as numeric and collate  §39.4 :  facet Categories  §iso.22.3.1   E.g., collate; §39.4.1 E.g., ctype; §39.4.5 E.g., num_put, num_g et, numpunct; §39.4.2 money_put, money_g et, moneypunct; §39.4.3 E.g., time_put, time_get; §39.4.4 messages; §39.4.7 collate  ctype  monetary  numeric  time  messages  collate ctype numeric monetary time messages all  none  There are no facilities for a programmer to specify a name string for a newly created locale. Name strings  are  either  deﬁned  in  the  program’s execution  environment  or  created  as  combinations  of such names by locale constructors.   1114  Locales  Chapter 39  A programmer can replace facets from existing categories  §39.4, §39.4.2.1 . However, there is no way for a programmer to deﬁne a new category. The notion of ‘‘category’’ applies to standard- library facets only, and it is not extensible.  Thus, a facet need not belong to any category, and many user-deﬁned facets do not.  If a locale  x does not have a name string, it is undeﬁned whether locale::global x  affects the C global locale. This implies that a C++ program cannot reliably and portably set the C locale to a locale that wasn’t retrieved from the execution environment.  There is no standard way for a C pro- gram to set the C++ global locale  except by calling a C++ function to do so . In a mixed C and C++ program, having the C global locale differ from global   is error prone.  By far the dominant use of locales is implicitly, in stream I O. Each istream and ostream has its own locale. The locale of  a  stream  is  by  default  the  global locale  §39.2.1   at  the  time  of  the stream’s creation.  The locale of a stream can be set by the imbue   operation, and we can extract a copy of a stream’s locale using getloc    §38.4.5.1 .  Setting the global locale does not affect existing I O streams; those still use the locales that they  were imbued with before the global locale was reset.  39.2.1  Named locales A locale is constructed from another locale and from facets.  The simplest way of making a locale is to copy an existing one. For example:  locale loc1; locale loc2 {""};     copyofthe current global locale    copyof‘‘the user’spreferred locale’’  locale loc3 {"C"}; locale loc4 {locale::classic  };      copyofthe ‘‘C’’locale    copyofthe ‘‘C’’locale  locale loc5 {"POSIX"}; locale loc6 {"Danish_Denmark.1252"}; locale loc7 {"en_US.UTF−8"};     copyofthe locale named "POSIX"    copyofthe locale named "Danish_Denmark.1252"    copyofthe locale named "en_US.UTF-8"  The meaning of locale{"C"} is deﬁned by the standard to be the ‘‘classic’’ C locale; this is the locale that has been used throughout this book. Other locale names are implementation-deﬁned.  The locale{""} is deemed to be ‘‘the user’s preferred locale.’’  This locale is set by extralinguistic  means in a program’s execution environment.  So to see your current ‘‘preferred locale,’’ write:  locale loc "" ; cout << loc.name   << '\n';  On my Windows laptop, I got:  English_United States.1252  On my Linux box, I got:  en_US.UTF−8  The  names  of  locales  are  not  standardized  for  C++. Instead,  a  variety  of  organizations,  such  as POSIX and Microsoft, maintain their own  differing  standards across different programming lan- guages.  For example:   Section 39.2.1  Named locales  1115  GNU Locale Name Examples  Based on POSIX   ja_JP da_DK en_DK de_CH de_DE en_GB en_US fr_CA de_DE de_DE@euro de_DE.utf8 de_DE.utf8@euro  Japanese for Japan Danish for Denmark English for Denmark German for Switzerland German for Germany English for Great Britain English for the U.S.A. French for Canada German for Germany German for Germany with the euro symbol € German for Germany using UTF-8 German for Germany using UTF-8 with the euro symbol €  POSIX recommends a format of a lowercase language name, optionally followed by an uppercase country name, optionally followed by an encoding speciﬁer, for example, sv_FI@euro  Swedish for Finland including the euro symbol .  Microsoft Locale Name Examples  Arabic_Qatar.1256 Basque.Spain.1252 Chinese_Singapore.936 English_United Kingdom.1252 English_United States.1252 French_Canada.1252 Greek_Greece.1253 Hebrew_Israel.1255 Hindi_India.1252 Russian_Russia.1251  Microsoft uses a language name followed by a country name optionally followed by a code page number. A code page is a named  or numbered  character encoding.  Most operating systems have ways of setting a default locale for a program. Typically, that is done through environment variables with names such as LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, and LANG. Often, a locale suitable to the person using a system is chosen when that person ﬁrst encounters a system. For example, I would expect a person who conﬁgures a Linux system to use Argentine Spanish as its default setting will ﬁnd locale{""} to mean locale{"es_AR"}. Howev er, these names are not stan- dardized across platforms. So, to use named locales on a giv en system, a programmer must refer to system documentation and experiment.  It is generally a good idea to avoid embedding locale name strings in the program text.  Men- tioning a ﬁle name or a system constant in the program text limits the portability of a program and often forces a programmer who wants to adapt a program to a new environment to ﬁnd and change such values.  Mentioning a locale name string has similar unpleasant consequences. Instead, locales can  be  picked  up  from  the  program’s execution  environment   for  example,  using locale ""  or   1116  Locales  Chapter 39  reading a ﬁle . Alternatively, a program can request a user to specify alternative locales by entering a string.  For example:  void user_set_locale const string& question  {     e.g., "If you want to use a different locale,please enter its name"  cout << question; string s; cin >> s; locale::global locale{s} ;    set global locale as speciﬁed byuser  It is usually better to let a non-expert user pick from a list of alternatives.  A function implementing this would need to know where and how a system keeps its locales.  For example, many Linux sys- tems keep their locales in the directory  usr share locale.  If the string argument doesn’t refer to a deﬁned locale, the constructor throws the runtime_error  exception  §30.4.1.1 . For example:  void set_loc locale& loc, const char∗ name  try {  loc = locale{name};  } catch  runtime_error&  {  cerr << "locale    ...  If a locale has a name string, name   will return it. If not, name   will return string "∗" . A name string  is  primarily  a  way  to  refer  to  a locale stored  in  the  execution  environment.  Secondarily, a name string can be used as a debugging aid. For example:  void print_locale_names const locale& my_loc  {  cout << "name of current global locale: " << locale  .name   << "\n"; cout << "name of classic C locale: " << locale::classic  .name   << "\n"; cout << "name of ‘‘user's preferred locale'': " << locale "" .name   << "\n"; cout << "name of my locale: " << my_loc.name   << "\n";  39.2.1.1  Constructing New locales  A new locale is made by taking an existing locale and adding or replacing facets.  Typically, a new locale is a minor variation on an existing one. For example:  void f const locale& loc, const My_money_io∗ mio   {     My_money_io deﬁned in §39.4.3.1  locale loc1 locale{"POSIX"},loc,locale::monetary ;    use monetaryfacets from loc locale loc2 = locale locale::classic  , mio ;    ...     classic plus mio  }  }  }  }   Section 39.2.1.1  Constructing New locales  1117  Here, loc1 is a copy of the POSIX locale modiﬁed to use loc’s monetary facets  §39.4.3 .  Similarly, loc2 is a copy of the C locale modiﬁed to use a My_money_io  §39.4.3.1 .  The resulting locales can be represented like this:  classic  :  loc2:  collate :  compare    hash    ...  numpunct :  decimal_point   curr_symbol    My_money_io:  decimal_point   curr_symbol    ...  ...  If  a Facet∗ argument   here, My_money_io  is nullptr, the  resulting locale is  simply  a  copy of the locale argument.  In a construction locale{loc,f}, the f argument must identify a speciﬁc facet type.  A plain facet∗  is not sufﬁcient.  For example:  void g const locale::facet∗ mio1, const money_put ∗ mio2  {  locale loc3 = locale locale::classic  , mio1 ; locale loc4 = locale locale::classic  , mio2 ;    ...  }     error :type of facet not known    OK: type of facet known  moneyput    The locale uses the type of the Facet∗ argument to determine the type of the facet at compile time. Speciﬁcally, the  implementation  of locale uses  a facet’s  identifying  type, facet::id  §39.3 ,  to  ﬁnd that facet in the locale  §39.3.1 .  The constructor  template  locale const locale& x, Facet∗ f ;  is the only mechanism offered within the language for the programmer to supply a facet to be used through a locale. Other locales are supplied by implementers as named locales  §39.2.1 . Named locales  can  be  retrieved from  the  program’s execution  environment.  A programmer  who  under- stands the implementation-speciﬁc mechanism used for that might be able to add new locales.  The set of constructors for locale is designed so that the type of every facet is known either from type deduction  of the Facet template parameter  or because it came from another locale  that knew its type . Specifying a category argument speciﬁes the type of facets indirectly, because the locale knows the type of the facets in the categories.  This implies that the locale class can  and does  keep track of the types of facets so that it can manipulate them with minimal overhead.   1118  Locales  Chapter 39  The locale::id member type is used by locale to identify facet types  §39.3 . There is no way of modifying a locale. Instead, the locale operations provide ways of making new locales from  existing  ones. The  fact  that  a locale is  immutable  after  it  has  been  created  is essential for run-time efﬁciency.  This allows someone using a locale to call virtual functions of a facet and to cache the values returned. For example, an istream can know what character is used to represent the decimal point and how true is represented without calling decimal_point   each time it reads a number and truename   each time it reads to a bool  §39.4.2 .  Only a call of imbue   for the stream  §38.4.5.1  can cause such calls to return a different value.  39.2.2  Comparing strings Comparing two strings according to a locale is possibly the most common use of a locale outside I O.  Consequently, this  operation  is  provided  directly  by locale so  that  users  don’t hav e to  build their own comparison function from the collate facet  §39.4.1 . This string comparison function is deﬁned as locale’s operator    . For example:  void user const string s1, const string s2, const locale& my_locale  {  if  my_locale s,s2   {     is s<s2 according to my_locale?     ...  }  }  }  Having the comparison function as the    operator makes it directly useful as a predicate  §4.5.4 . For example:  void f vector & v, const locale& my_locale  {  sort v.begin  ,v.end   ;     ... sort v.begin  ,v.end  ,my_locale ;     ...     sor tusing < to compare elements     sor taccording to the rules of my_locale  By default, the standard-library sort   uses < for the numerical value of the implementation charac- ter set to determine collation order  §32.6, §31.2.2.1 .  39.3  Class facet A locale is  a  collection  of facets.  A facet represents  one  speciﬁc  cultural  aspect,  such  as  how a number is represented on output  num_put , how a date is read from input  time_get , and how char- acters are stored in a ﬁle  codecvt .  The standard-library facets are listed in §39.4.  A user  can  deﬁne  new facets,  such  as  a facet determining  how the  names  of  the  seasons  are  printed  §39.3.2 .  A facet is represented in a program as an object of a class derived from std::locale::facet. Like  all other locale facilities, facet is found in  :   Section 39.3  Class facet  1119  class locale::facet { protected:  explicit facet size_t refs = 0 ; virtual ˜facet  ; facet const facet&  = delete; void operator= const facet&  = delete;  };  };  The facet class is designed to be a base class and has no public functions. Its constructor is pro- tected to prevent the creation of ‘‘plain facet’’  objects, and its destructor is virtual to ensure proper destruction of derived-class objects.  A facet is intended to be managed through pointers stored in locales.  A 0 argument to the facet constructor means that locale should delete the facet when the last reference to it goes away.  Con- versely, a nonzero constructor argument ensures that locale never deletes the facet. A nonzero argu- ment is meant for the rare case in which the lifetime of a facet is controlled directly by the program- mer rather than indirectly through a locale.  Each kind of facet interface must have a separate id:  class locale::id { public:  id  ; void operator= const id&  = delete; id const id&  = delete;  The intended use of id is for the user to deﬁne a static member of type id of each class supplying a new facet interface   for  example,  see  §39.4.1 . The locale mechanisms  use ids to identify facets  §39.2, §39.3.1 . In the obvious implementation of a locale, an id is used as an index into a vector of pointers to facets, thereby implementing an efﬁcient map .  Data used to deﬁne a  derived  facet is deﬁned in the derived class.  This implies that the pro- grammer deﬁning a facet has full control over the data and that arbitrary amounts of data can be used to implement the concept represented by a facet.  A facet is intended to be immutable, so all member functions of a user-deﬁned facet should be  deﬁned const.  39.3.1  Accessing facets in a locale The facets of a locale are accessed using two template functions:  Non-member locale functions  §iso.22.3.2   f=use_facet  loc   has_facet  loc   f is a reference to the facet F in loc; throw bad_cast if loc doesn’t hav e F Does loc have facet F? noexcept  Think of these functions as doing a lookup in their locale argument for their template parameter F. Alternatively, think of use_facet as a kind of explicit type conversion  cast  of a locale to a speciﬁc facet. This is feasible because a locale can have only one facet of a given type.  For example:   1120  Locales  Chapter 39  void f const locale& my_locale  {  char c = use_facet > my_locale .decimal_point      use standard facet    ...  if  has_facet  my_locale   {  const Encrypt& f = use_facet  my_locale ;  const Crypto c = f.g et_crypto  ;    ...     does my_locale contain an Encrypt facet?    retrieve Encr yptfacet    use Encrypt facet  }    ...  }  The standard facets are guaranteed to be available for all locales  §39.4 , so we don’t need to use has_facet for standard facets.  One way of looking at the facet::id mechanism is as an optimized implementation of a form of compile-time  polymorphism. A dynamic_cast can  be  used  to  get  very  similar  results  to  what use_facet produces.  However,  the specialized use_facet can be implemented more efﬁciently than the general dynamic_cast.  An id identiﬁes an interface and a behavior rather than a class. That is, if two facet classes have exactly the same interface and implement the same semantics  as far as a locale is concerned , they should be identiﬁed by the same id. For example, collate  and collate_byname  are inter- changeable in a locale, so both are identiﬁed by collate ::id  §39.4.1 .  If we deﬁne a facet with a new interface – such as Encrypt in f   – we must deﬁne a correspond-  ing id to identify it  see §39.3.2 and §39.4.1 .  39.3.2  A Simple User-Deﬁned facet The standard library provides standard facets for the most critical areas of cultural differences, such as character sets and I O of numbers. To  examine the facet mechanism in isolation from the com- plexities of widely used types and the efﬁciency concerns that accompany them, let me ﬁrst present a facet for a trivial user-deﬁned type:  enum Season { spring, summer, fall, winter };    very simple user-deﬁned type  The style of I O outlined here can be used with little variation for most simple user-deﬁned types.  class Season_io : public locale::facet { public:  Season_io int i = 0  : locale::facet{i} { } ˜Season_io   { }     to makeitpossible to destroySeason_io objects  §39.3   virtual const string& to_str Season x  const = 0; virtual bool from_str const string& s, Season& x  const = 0;    place Season for s in x     stringrepresentation of x  static locale::id id;     facet identiﬁer object  §39.2, §39.3, §39.3.1   };  locale::id Season_io::id;    deﬁne the identiﬁer object   Section 39.3.2  A Simple User-Deﬁned facet  1121  For simplicity, this facet is limited to strings of chars.  The Season_io class provides a general and abstract interface for all Season_io facets.  To deﬁne the I O representation of a Season for a particular locale, we derive a class from Season_io, deﬁning to_str   and from_str   appropriately.  Output of a Season is easy. If the stream has a Season_io facet, we can use that to convert the  value into a string. If not, we can output the int value of the Season:  ostream& operator<< ostream& os, Season x  {  locale loc {os.getloc  };      extract the stream’slocale  §38.4.4   if  has_facet  loc    return os   loc .to_str x ;    stringrepresentation  return os   x ;     integer representation  For maximum efﬁciency and ﬂexibility, standard facets tend to operate directly on stream buffers  §39.4.2.2, §39.4.2.3 . However, for a simple user-deﬁned type, such as Season, there is no need to drop to the streambuf level of abstraction.  As is typical, input is a bit more complicated than output:  const Season_io& f {use_facet  loc };    get hold of the locale’sSeason_io facet     extract the stream’slocale  §38.4.4      read alphabetic representation     read numer icrepresentation  }  }  {  istream& operator>> istream& is, Season& x  {  const locale& loc {is.getloc  };   if  has_facet  loc   {  string buf; if  ! is>>buf && f.from_str buf,x     is.setstate ios_base::failbit ;  return is;  }  int i; is >> i; x = static_cast  i ; return is;  Here is a trivial test program:  int main       atrivial test  Season x;  The error handling is simple and follows the error-handling style for built-in types. That is, if the input string didn’t represent a Season in the chosen locale, the stream is put into the fail state.  If exceptions are enabled, this implies that an ios_base::failure exception is thrown  §38.3 .   1122  Locales  Chapter 39     use the default locale  no Season_io facet  implies integer I O: cin >> x; cout << x << endl;  locale loc locale  ,new US_season_io{} ; cout.imbue loc ;  cin.imbue loc ;      use locale with Season_io facet    use locale with Season_io facet  To  get this, we must derive a class US_season_io from Season_io, and deﬁne an appropriate string representation of the seasons:  cin >> x; cout << x << endl;  }  Given the input  this program responds:  2 summer  2 summer  class US_season_io : public Season_io {  static const string seasons[];  public:  const string& to_str Season  const; bool from_str const string&, Season&  const;     note: no US_season_io::id  const string US_season_io::seasons[] = {  "spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"  const string& US_season_io::to_str Season x  const {  if  x<spring  winter<x  {  static const string ss = "no−such−season"; return ss;  } return seasons[x];  };  };  }  Then, we override the Season_io functions that convert between the string representation and the enumerators:   Section 39.3.2  A Simple User-Deﬁned facet  1123  bool US_season_io::from_str const string& s, Season& x  const {  const string∗ p =ﬁnd begin seasons ,end seasons ,s ; if  p==end   return false;  x = Season p−begin seasons  ; return true;  }  Note that because US_season_io is simply an implementation of the Season_io interface, I did not deﬁne an id for US_season_io. In fact, if we want US_season_io to be used as a Season_io, we must not give US_season_io its own id. Operations on locales, such as has_facet  §39.3.1 , rely on facets implementing the same concepts being identiﬁed by the same id  §39.3 .  The only interesting implementation question is what to do if asked to output an invalid Season. Naturally, that shouldn’t happen.  However, it is not uncommon to ﬁnd an invalid value for a simple user-deﬁned  type,  so  it  is  realistic  to  take that  possibility  into  account. I could  have  thrown  an exception, but when dealing with simple output intended for humans to read, it is often helpful to produce an ‘‘out-of-range’’ representation for an out-of-range value.  Note that for input, the error- handling policy is left to the >> operator, whereas for output, the facet function to_str   implements an  error-handling  policy.  This  was  done  to  illustrate  the  design  alternatives.  In a ‘‘production design,’’ the facet functions would either implement error handling for both input and output or just report errors for >> and << to handle.  This Season_io design relies on derived classes to supply the locale-speciﬁc strings. An alterna- tive design would have Season_io itself retrieve those strings from a locale-speciﬁc repository  see §39.4.7 .  The possibility of having a single Season_io class to which the season strings are passed as constructor arguments is left as an exercise.  39.3.3  Uses of locales and facets The primary use of locales within the standard library is in I O streams. However, the locale mecha- nism  is  a  general  and  extensible  mechanism  for  representing  culture-sensitive  information.  The messages facet  §39.4.7  is an example of a facet that has nothing to do with I O streams. Exten- sions to the iostream library and even I O facilities that are not based on streams might take advan- tage of locales.  Also, a user may use locales as a convenient way of organizing arbitrary culture- sensitive information.  Because of the generality of the locale facet mechanism, the possibilities for user-deﬁned facets are unlimited. Plausible candidates for representation as facets are dates, time zones, phone num- bers, social security numbers  personal identiﬁcation numbers , product codes, temperatures, gen- eral  unit,value  pairs, postal codes  zip codes , clothing sizes, and ISBN numbers.  As with every other powerful mechanism, facets should be used with care. That something can be represented as a facet doesn’t mean that it is best represented that way. The key issues to con- sider when selecting a representation for cultural dependencies are – as ever – how the various deci- sions affect the difﬁculty of writing code, the ease of reading the resulting code, the maintainability of the resulting program, and the efﬁciency in time and space of the resulting I O operations.   1124  Locales  Chapter 39  39.4  Standard facets In  , the standard library provides these facets:  Standard facets  §iso.22.3.1.1.1   collate numeric  String comparison Numeric formatting  monetary Money formatting  time  Date and time formatting  ctype  Character classiﬁcation  messages Message retrieval  collate  numpunct  num_g et  num_put  moneypunct  moneypunct  money_g et  money_put  time_put  time_put_byname  time_get  ctype  codecvt  codecvt_byname  messages   §39.4.1 §39.4.2  §39.4.3  §39.4.4  §39.4.5  §39.4.7  The details are explained in the referenced subsections.  When instantiating a facet from this table, C must be a character type  §36.1 . These facets are guaranteed  to  be  deﬁned  for char or wchar_t. In addition, ctype  is  guaranteed  to  support char16_t and char32_t. A user who needs standard I O to deal with another character type X must rely  on  implementation-speciﬁc facet specializations  or  provide  suitable  versions  of facets for X. For example, codecvt   §39.4.6  might be needed to control conversions between X and char.  International can be true or false; true means that a three-character  plus zero terminator  ‘‘inter-  national’’ representation of a currency symbol is used  §39.4.3.1 , such as USD and BRL.  A shift-state parameter, SS, is used to represent the shift states of a multibyte character repre- sentation  §39.4.6 . In  , mbstate_t is deﬁned to represent any of the conversion states that can occur in an implementation-deﬁned set of supported multibyte character encoding rules. The equivalent to mbstate_t for an arbitrary character type X is char_traits ::state_type  §36.2.2 .  In and Out are input iterators and output iterators, respectively  §33.1.2, §33.1.4 . Providing the _put and _get facets  with  these  template  arguments  allows  a  programmer  to  provide facets that access nonstandard buffers  §39.4.2.2 . Buffers associated with iostreams are stream buffers, so the iterators provided for those are ostreambuf_iterators  §38.6.3, §39.4.2.2 . Consequently, the func- tion failed   is available for error handling  §38.6.3 .  Each  standard facet has  a _byname version.  An F_byname facet  is  derived from  the  facet F. F_byname provides the identical interface to F, except that it adds a constructor taking a string argu- ment naming a locale  e.g., see §39.4.1 . The F_byname name  provides the appropriate semantics for F deﬁned in locale name . For example:   Section 39.4  Standard facets  1125  sort v.begin  ,v.end  ,collate_byname{"da_DK"} ;      sor tusing character comparison from "da_DK"  The  idea  is  to  pick  a  version  of  a  standard facet from  a  named locale  §39.2.1   in  the  program’s execution  environment.  This implies  that _byname constructors  are  very  slow compared  to  con- structors that do not need to consult the environment.  It is almost always faster to construct a locale and then to access its facets than it is to use _byname  facets in many places in a program. Thus, reading a facet from the environment once and then using the copy in main memory repeatedly is usually a good idea. For example:  locale dk {"da_DK"};     read the Danish locale  including all of its facets  once     then use the dk locale and its facets as needed  void f vector & v, const locale& loc  {  const collate & col {use_facet > dk }; const ctype & ctyp {use_facet > dk };  locale dk1 {loc,&col}; locale dk2 {dk1,&ctyp};     use Danish string comparison     use Danish character classiﬁcation and string comparison  sort v.begin  ,v.end  ,dk2 ;    ...  }  This dk2 locale will use Danish-style strings but will retain the default conventions for numbers.  The  notion  of  categories  gives a simpler  way  of  manipulating  standard facets in locales.  For example, given the dk locale, we can construct a locale that reads and compares strings according to the rules of Danish  which has three more vowels than English  but that retains the syntax of num- bers used in C++:  locale dk_us locale::classic  ,dk,collatectype ;      Danish letters,Amer icannumbers  The presentations of individual standard facets contain more examples of facet use.  In particular, the discussion of collate  §39.4.1  brings out many of the common structural aspects of facets.  Standard facets often depend on each other. For example, num_put depends on numpunct. Only if you have a detailed knowledge of individual facets can you successfully mix and match facets or add  new versions  of  the  standard facets.  In other  words,  beyond  the  simple  operations   such  as imbue   for iostreams and using collate for sort   , the locale mechanisms are not meant to be directly used by novices.  For an extensive discussion of locales, see [Langer,2000].  The  design  of  an  individual  facet  is  often  messy. The  reason  is  partially  that  facets  have  to reﬂect messy cultural conventions outside the control of the library designer, and partially that the C++  standard  library-facilities  have  to remain  largely  compatible  with  what  is  offered  by  the  C standard library and various platform-speciﬁc standards.  On the other hand, the framework provided by locales and facets is general and ﬂexible.  A facet can be designed to hold any data, and the facet’s operations can provide any desired operation based on that data. If the behavior of a new facet isn’t overconstrained by convention, its design can be simple and clean  §39.3.2 .   1126  Locales  Chapter 39  39.4.1 string Comparison The standard collate facet provides ways of comparing arrays of characters:  template  class collate : public locale::facet { public:  using char_type = C; using string_type = basic_string ;  explicit collate size_t = 0 ;  int compare const C∗ b, const C∗ e, const C∗ b2, const C∗ e2  const  { return do_compare b,e,b2,e2 ; }  long hash const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const  { return do_hash b,e ; }  string_type transform const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const  { return do_transform b,e ; }  static locale::id id;     facet identiﬁer object  §39.2, §39.3, §39.3.1   protected:  ˜collate  ;    note: protected destructor  virtual int do_compare const C∗ b, const C∗ e, const C∗ b2, const C∗ e2  const; virtual string_type do_transform const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const; virtual long do_hash const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const;  };  This deﬁnes two interfaces:   cid:129  The public interface for users of the facet.  cid:129  The protected interface for implementers of derived facets.  The constructor argument speciﬁes whether a locale or a user is responsible for deleting the facet. The default  0  means ‘‘let the locale manage’’  §39.3 .  All standard-library facets share a common structure, so the salient facts about a facet can be  summarized by the key functions:  collate  facet  §iso.22.4.4.1   int compare const C∗ b, const C∗ e, const C∗ b2, const C∗ e2  const; long hash const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const; string_type transform const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const;  To  deﬁne  a facet use collate as  the  pattern. To  derive  from  a  standard  pattern,  simply  deﬁne  the do_∗ versions of the key functions providing the facet’s functionality. The full declarations of func- tions are listed  rather than use patterns  to give sufﬁcient information to write an overriding do_∗ function.  For an example, see §39.4.1.1.  The hash   function calculates a hash value for its imput string. Obviously, this can be useful  for building hash tables.   Section 39.4.1  string Comparison   1127  The transform   function produces a string that, when compared to another transform  ed string,  gives the same result as comparing the strings. That is:  cf.compare cf.transform s ,cf.transform s2   == cf.compare s,s2   The purpose of transform   is to allow optimization of code in which a string is compared to many others.  This is useful when implementing a search among a set of strings.  The compare   function  does  the  basic  string  comparison  according  to  the  rules  deﬁned  for  a  particular collate. It returns:  if the ﬁrst string is lexicographically greater than the second if the strings are identical  1 0 −1 if the second string is greater than the ﬁrst  For example:  void f const string& s1, const string& s2, const collate & cmp  {     because compare   operates on char[]s  const char∗ cs1 {s1.data  }; const char∗ cs2 {s2.data  };  switch  cmp.compare cs1,cs1+s1.siz e  ,cs2,cs2+s2.size    { case 0:     identical strings according to cmp     ... break;  case −1:    ... break;  case 1:     ... break;  }  }     s1 < s2     s1 > s2  The collate member  functions  compare  [b:e  ranges  of C rather  than basic_strings or zero-termi- nated C-style strings. In particular, a C with the numeric value 0 is treated as an ordinary character rather than as a terminator.  The standard-library string is not locale sensitive. That is, it compares strings according to the rules of the implementation’s character set  §6.2.3 . Furthermore, the standard string does not pro- vide a direct way of specifying comparison criteria  Chapter 36 . To do a locale-sensitive compari- son, we can use a collate’s compare  . For example:  void f const string& s1, const string& s2, const string& name  {  bool b {s1==s2};     compare using implementation’scharacter set values  const char∗ s1b {s1.data  }; const char∗ s1e {s1.data  +s1.size  }  const char∗ s2b {s2.data  }; const char∗ s2e {s2.data  +s2.size  }     get startofdata    get end of data   1128  Locales  Chapter 39  using Col = collate ;  const Col& global {use_facet  locale{} }; int i0 {global.compare s1b,s1e,s2b,s2e };     from the current global locale  const Col& my_coll {use_facet  locale{""} }; int i1 {my_coll.compare s1b,s1e ,s2b,s2e };     from mypreferred locale  const Col& n_coll {use_facet  locale{name} }; int i2 {n_coll.compare s1b,s1e,s2b,s2e };     from a named locale  }  }  Notationally, it can be more convenient to use collate’s compare   indirectly through a locale’s opera- tor    §39.2.2 .  For example:  void f const string& s1, const string& s2, const string& name  {  int i0 = locale{} s1,s2 ; int i1 = locale{""} s1,s2 ; int i2 = locale{name} s1,s2 ;    ...     compare using the current global locale    compare using mypreferred locale    compare using the named locale  It is not difﬁcult to imagine cases in which i0, i1, and i2 differ. Consider this sequence of words from a German dictionary:  Dialekt, Di¨at, dich, dichten, Dichtung  According to convention, nouns  only  are capitalized, but the ordering is not case sensitive.  A case-sensitive German sort would place all words starting with D before d:  Dialekt, Di¨at, Dichtung, dich, dichten  The ¨a  umlaut a  is treated as ‘‘a kind of a,’’ so it comes before c. Howev er, in most common char- acter sets, the numeric value of ¨a is larger than the numeric value of c. Consequently, int ’c’ <int ’ ¨a’ , and the simple default sort based on numeric values gives:  Dialekt, Dichtung, Di¨at, dich, dichten  Writing  a  compare  function  that  orders  this  sequence  correctly  according  to  the  dictionary  is  an interesting exercise.  39.4.1.1  Named collate  A collate_byname is a version of collate for a locale named by a constructor string argument:  template  class collate_byname : public collate  { public:  typedef basic_string  string_type;     note: no id and no newfunctions  explicit collate_byname const char∗, siz e_t r = 0 ;     constructfrom named locale explicit collate_byname const string&, size_t r = 0 ;   Section 39.4.1.1  Named collate  1129  protected:  ˜collate_byname  ;     note: protected destructor  int do_compare const C∗ b, const C∗ e, const C∗ b2, const C∗ e2  const override; string_type do_transform const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const override; long do_hash const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const override;  };  Thus,  a collate_byname can  be  used  to  pick  out  a collate from  a locale named  in  the  program’s execution  environment   §39.4 . One  obvious  way  of  storing facets in an execution  environment would be as data in a ﬁle. A less ﬂexible alternative would be to represent a facet as program text and data in a _byname facet.  39.4.2  Numeric Formatting Numeric  output  is  done  by  a num_put facet  writing  into  a  stream  buffer   §38.6 . Conversely, numeric  input  is  done  by  a num_g et facet  reading  from  a  stream  buffer. The  format  used  by num_put and num_g et is deﬁned by a ‘‘numerical punctuation’’ facet called numpunct.  39.4.2.1  Numeric Punctuation  The numpunct facet deﬁnes the I O format of built-in types, such as bool, int, and double:  numpunct  facet  §iso.22.4.6.3.1   C decimal_point   const; C thousands_sep   const; string grouping   const; string_type truename   const; string_type falsename   const;  E.g., ’.’ E.g., ’,’ E.g., "" meaning ‘‘no grouping’’ E.g., "true" E.g., "false"  The characters of the string returned by grouping   are read as a sequence of small integer values. Each number speciﬁes a number of digits for a group. Character 0 speciﬁes the rightmost group  the  least  signiﬁcant  digits ,  character 1 the  group  to  the  left  of  that,  etc. Thus, "\004\002\003" describes a number such as 123−45−6789  provided you use '−' as the separation character . If nec- essary, the  last  number  in  a  grouping  pattern  is  used  repeatedly, so "\003" is  equivalent  to "\003\003\003". The most common use of grouping is to make large numbers more readable. The grouping   and thousands_sep   functions deﬁne a format for both input and output of integers and the integer part of ﬂoating-point values.  We can deﬁne a new punctuation style by deriving from numpunct. For example, I could deﬁne facet My_punct to write integer values using spaces to group the digits in sets of three and ﬂoating- point values, using a European-style comma as the ‘‘decimal point’’:  class My_punct : public numpunct  { public:  explicit My_punct size_t r = 0  :numpunct  r  { }  protected:  char do_decimal_point   const override  { return ','; }     comma   1130  Locales  Chapter 39  char do_thousands_sep   const override { return '_'; } string do_grouping   const override { return "\003"; }     underscore    3-digit groups  };  void f   {  }  This produces:  cout << "style A: " << 12345678  << " ∗∗∗ " << 1234567.8 << " ∗∗∗ " <<ﬁxed << 1234567.8 << '\n';  cout << defaultﬂoat; locale loc locale  ,new My_punct ; cout.imbue loc ; cout << "style B: " << 12345678  << " ∗∗∗ " << 1234567.8 << " ∗∗∗ " <<ﬁxed << 1234567.8 << '\n';     reset ﬂoating for mat  style A: 12345678 ∗∗∗ 1.23457e+06 ∗∗∗ 1234567.800000 style B: 12_345_678 ∗∗∗ 1_234_567,800000 ∗∗∗ 1_234_567,800000  Note that imbue   stores a copy of its argument in its stream. Consequently, a stream can rely on an imbued locale ev en after the original copy of that locale has been destroyed.  If an iostream has its boolalpha ﬂag set  §38.4.5.1 , the strings returned by truename   and falsename   are used to repre- sent true and false, respectively; otherwise, 1 and 0 are used.  A _byname version  §39.4, §39.4.1  of numpunct is provided:  template  class numpunct_byname : public numpunct  {     ...  };  39.4.2.2  Numeric Output  When writing to a stream buffer  §38.6 , an ostream relies on the num_put facet:  num_put > facet  §iso.22.4.2.2   Put value v to buffer position b in stream s  Out put Out b, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, bool v  const; Out put Out b, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, long v  const; Out put Out b, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, long long v  const; Out put Out b, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, unsigned long v  const; Out put Out b, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, unsigned long long v  const; Out put Out b, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, double v  const; Out put Out b, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, long double v  const; Out put Out b, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, const void∗ v  const;  The value of put   is that iterator positioned one past the last character position written.   };  }  }  Section 39.4.2.2  Numeric Output  1131  The default specialization of num_put  the one where the iterator used to access characters is of type ostreambuf_iterator   is part  of  the  standard locales  §39.4 .  To write  elsewhere  using  a num_put, we must deﬁne an appropriate specialization. For example, here is a very simple num_put for writing into a string:  template  class String_numput : public num_put ::iterator> { public:  String_numput   :num_put ::iterator>{1} { }  I don’t mean for String_numput to go into a locale, so I used the constructor argument to retain ordi- nary lifetime rules. The intended use is something like this:  void f int i, string& s, int pos     format i into s starting at pos {  String_numput  f; f.put s.begin  +pos,cout,' ',i ;     format i into s; use cout’sfor mattingrules  The ios_base argument   here, cout  provides  information  about  formatting  state  and locale. For example:  void test iostream& io  {  locale loc = io.getloc  ;  wchar_t wc = use_facet > loc .widen c ;  string s = use_facet > loc .decimal_point  ;  string false_name = use_facet > loc .falsename  ;      char to C conversion    default: ’.’    default: "false"  A standard facet, such as num_put , is typically used implicitly through a standard I O stream function.  Consequently, most  programmers  need  not  know about  it. However,  the  use  of  such facets by standard-library  functions  is  interesting  because  they show how  I O  streams  work  and how facets can  be  used. As  ever,  the  standard  library  provides  examples  of  interesting  program- ming techniques.  Using num_put, the implementer of ostream might write:  template  basic_ostream & basic_ostream ::operator<< double d  {  sentry guard ∗this ;  if  !guard  return ∗this;     see §38.4.1  try {  }  if  use_facet > g etloc   .put ∗this,∗this,this−>ﬁll  ,d .failed     setstate badbit ;   1132  Locales  Chapter 39  handle_ioexception ∗this ;  catch  ...  {  } return ∗this;  A lot  is  going  on  here. The  sentry  ensures  that  all  preﬁx  and  sufﬁx  operations  are  performed  §38.4.1 .  We get  the ostream’s locale by  calling  its  member  function getloc    §38.4.5.1 .  We extract num_put from that locale using use_facet  §39.3.1 .  That done, we call the appropriate put   function to do the real work.  An ostreambuf_iterator can be constructed from an ostream  §38.6.3 , and an ostream can be implicitly converted to its base class ios_base  §38.4.4 , so the ﬁrst two argu- ments to put   are easily supplied.  A call  of put   returns  its  output  iterator  argument.  This output  iterator  is  obtained  from  a basic_ostream, so it is an ostreambuf_iterator. Consequently, failed    §38.6.3  is available to test for failure and to allow us to set the stream state appropriately.  I did not use has_facet, because the standard facets  §39.4  are guaranteed to be present in every  locale. If that guarantee is violated, bad_cast is thrown  §39.3.1 .  The put   function calls the virtual do_put  . Consequently, user-deﬁned code may be executed, and operator<<   must be prepared to handle an exception thrown by the overriding do_put  . Also, num_put may  not  exist  for  some  character  types,  so use_facet   might  throw bad_cast  §39.3.1 . The behavior of a << for a built-in type, such as double, is deﬁned by the C++ standard. Conse- quently, the question is not what handle_ioexception   should do but rather how it should do what the standard prescribes. If badbit is set in this ostream’s  exception state  §38.3 , the exception is simply re-thrown.  Otherwise, an exception is handled by setting the stream state and continuing. In either case, badbit must be set in the stream state  §38.4.5.1 :  template  void handle_ioexception basic_ostream & s    called from catch-clause {  if  s.exceptions  &ios_base::badbit  {  s.setstate ios_base::badbit ;      might throwbasic_ios::failure  try {  } catch ...  {     ... do nothing ...  } throw;     re-throw  } s.setstate ios_base::badbit ;  }  }  The try-block is needed because setstate   might throw basic_ios::failure  §38.3, §38.4.5.1 . How- ev er, if badbit is set in the exception state, operator<<   must re-throw the exception that caused han- dle_ioexception   to be called  rather than simply throwing basic_ios::failure .  The << for a built-in type, such as double, must be implemented by writing directly to a stream buffer. When writing a << for a user-deﬁned type, we can often avoid the resulting complexity by expressing the output of the user-deﬁned type in terms of output of existing types  §39.3.2 .   Section 39.4.2.3  Numeric Input  1133  39.4.2.3  Numeric Input  When reading from a stream buffer  §38.6 , an istream relies on the num_g et facet:  num_g et > facet  §iso.22.4.2.1   Read [b:e  into v, using formatting rules from s, reporting errors by setting r  In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, bool& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, long& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, long long& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, unsigned short& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, unsigned int& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, unsigned long& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, unsigned long long& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, ﬂoat& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, double& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, long double& v  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, void∗& v  const;  Basically, num_g et is  organized  like num_put  §39.4.2.2 .  Since it  reads  rather  than  writes, get   needs a pair of input iterators, and the argument designating the target of the read is a reference.  The iostate variable r is set to reﬂect the state of the stream. If a value of the desired type could not be read, failbit is set in r; if the end-of-input was reached, eofbit is set in r. An input operator will use r to determine how to set the state of its stream. If no error was encountered, the value read is assigned through v; otherwise, v is left unchanged.  A sentry is used to ensure that the stream’s preﬁx and sufﬁx operations are performed  §38.4.1 . In particular, the sentry is used to ensure that we try to read only if the stream is in a good state to start with. For example, an implementer of istream might write:  template  basic_istream & basic_istream ::operator>> double& d  {  sentry guard ∗this ;  if  !guard  return ∗this;     see §38.4.1  iostate state = 0; istreambuf_iterator  eos; try {     good  double dd; use_facet > g etloc   .get ∗this,eos,∗this,state,dd ; if  state==0  state==eofbit  d = dd;  setstate state ;     set value only if get   succeeded  handle_ioexception ∗this ;      see §39.4.2.2  } catch  ...  {  } return ∗this;  }   1134  Locales  Chapter 39  I took care not to modify the target of the >> unless the read operation succeeded. Unfortunately, that cannot be guaranteed for all input operations.  Exceptions enabled for the istream will be thrown by setstate   in case of error  §38.3 . By deﬁning a numpunct, such as My_punct from §39.4.2.1, we can read using nonstandard punc-  tuation.  For example:  void f   {  cout << "style A: " int i1; double d1; cin >> i1 >> d1;     read using standard ‘‘12345678’’for mat  locale loc locale::classic  ,new My_punct ; cin.imbue loc ; cout << "style B: " int i2; double d2; cin >> i1 >> d2;  }     read using the ‘‘12_345_678’’for mat  If we want to read really unusual numeric formats, we have to override do_get  . For example, we might deﬁne a num_g et that reads Roman numerals, such as XXI and MM.  39.4.3  Money Formatting The formatting of monetary amounts is technically similar to the formatting of ‘‘plain’’ numbers  §39.4.2 .  However, the presentation of monetary amounts is even more sensitive to cultural differ- ences.  For example, a negative amount  a loss, a debit , such as −1.25, should in some contexts be presented as a  positive  number in parentheses:  1.25 . Similarly, color is in some contexts used to ease the recognition of negative amounts.  There is no standard ‘‘money type.’’  Instead, the money facets are meant to be used explicitly  for numeric values that the programmer knows to represent monetary amounts. For example:  struct Money {    using Value = long long; Value amount;     simple type to hold a monetaryamount    forcurrencies that have suffered inﬂation  };     ...  }  void f long int i  {  cout << "value= " << i << " amount= " << Money{i} << '\n';  The task of the monetary facets is to make it reasonably easy to write an output operator for Money so that the amount is printed according to local convention  see §39.4.3.2 . The output would vary depending on cout’s locale. Possible outputs are:   Section 39.4.3  Money Formatting   1135  value= 1234567 amount= $12345.67 value= 1234567 amount= 12345,67 DKK value= 1234567 amount= CAD 12345,67 value= −1234567 amount= $−12345.67 value= −1234567 amount= −€12345.67 value= −1234567 amount=  CHF12345,67   For money,  accuracy to the smallest currency unit is usually considered essential. Consequently, I adopted the common convention of having the integer value represent the number of cents  pence, øre, ﬁls, cents, etc.  rather than the number of dollars  pounds, kroner, dinar, euro, etc. . This con- vention is supported by moneypunct’s frac_digits   function  §39.4.3.1 . Similarly, the appearance of the ‘‘decimal point’’ is deﬁned by decimal_point  .  The  facets money_g et and money_put provide  functions  that  perform  I O  based  on  the  format  deﬁned by the money_base facet.  A simple Money type can be used to control I O formats or to hold monetary values.  In the for- mer case, we cast values of  other  types used to hold monetary amounts to Money before writing, and we read into Money variables before converting them to other types. It is less error-prone to consistently hold monetary amounts in a Money type; that way, we cannot forget to cast a value to Money before writing it, and we don’t get input errors by trying to read monetary values in locale- insensitive ways.  However, it may be infeasible to introduce a Money type into a system that wasn’t designed for that. In such cases, applying Money conversions  casts  to read and write operations is necessary.  39.4.3.1  Money Punctuation  The facet controlling  the  presentation  of  monetary  amounts, moneypunct, naturally  resembles  the facet for controlling plain numbers, numpunct  §39.4.2.1 :  class money_base { public:  enum part {    };  };  struct pattern {  char ﬁeld[4];  none, space , symbol, sign, value     par tsof value layout     layout speciﬁcation  template  class moneypunct : public locale::facet, public money_base { public:  using char_type = C; using string_type = basic_string ;    ...  };  };   1136  Locales  Chapter 39  The moneypunct member functions deﬁne the layout of money input and output:  moneypunct > facet  §iso.22.4.6.3   C decimal_point   const; C thousands_sep   const; string grouping   const; string_type curr_symbol   const; string_type positive_sign   const; string_type negative_sign   const; int frac_digits   const; pattern pos_format   const; pattern neg_format   const; static const bool intl = International;  E.g., ’.’ E.g., ’,’ E.g., "" meaning ‘‘no grouping’’ E.g., "$" E.g., "" E.g., "−" Number of digits after ".", e.g., 2 symbol, space, sign, none, or value symbol, space, sign, none, or value Use three-letter international abbreviations  The facilities offered by moneypunct are intended primarily for use by implementers of money_put and money_g et facets  §39.4.3.2, §39.4.3.3 .  A _byname version  §39.4, §39.4.1  of moneypunct is provided:  template  class moneypunct_byname : public moneypunct  {  The decimal_point  , thousands_sep  , and grouping   members behave as in numpunct.  The curr_symbol  , positive_sign  , and negative_sign   members return the string to be used to represent  the  currency symbol   for  example, $, ¥, INR, DKK ,  the  plus  sign,  and  the  minus  sign, respectively. If the International template argument is true, the intl member will also be true, and ‘‘international’’ representations of the currency symbols will be used. Such an ‘‘international’’ rep- resentation is a four-character C-style string. For example:     ...  };  "USD" "DKK" "EUR"  The last  invisible  character is a terminating zero. The three-letter currency identiﬁer is deﬁned by the ISO-4217 standard. When International is false, a ‘‘local’’ currency symbol, such as $, £, and ¥, can be used.  A pattern returned by pos_format   or neg_format   is four parts deﬁning the sequence in which the  numeric  value,  the  currency symbol,  the  sign  symbol,  and  whitespace  occur. Most  common formats are trivially represented using this simple notion of a pattern. For example:     {sign, symbol, space,value } where positive_sign   returns "+" +$ 123.45    {symbol, sign, value,none } where positive_sign   returns "+" $+123.45     {symbol, sign, value,none } where positive_sign   returns "" $123.45  $123.45−     {symbol, value,sign, none } −123.45 DKK    {sign, value,space,symbol }  $123.45    123.45DKK       {sign, symbol, value,none } where negative_sign   returns "  "    {sign, value,symbol, none } where negative_sign   returns "  "   Section 39.4.3.1  Money Punctuation  1137  Representing  a  negative  number  using  parentheses  is  achieved by having negative_sign   return  a string containing the two characters   . The ﬁrst character of a sign string is placed where sign is found in the pattern, and the rest of the sign string is placed after all other parts of the pattern. The most  common  use  of  this  facility  is  to  represent  the  ﬁnancial  community’s convention  of  using parentheses for negative amounts, but other uses are possible. For example:  −$123.45  ∗$123.45 silly     {sign, symbol, value,none } where negative_sign   returns "−"    {sign, symbol, value,none } where negative_sign   returns "* silly"  Each of the values sign, value, and symbol must appear exactly once in a pattern. The remaining value can be either space or none. Where space appears, at least one and possibly more whitespace characters may appear in the representation. Where none appears, except at the end of a pattern, zero or more whitespace characters may appear in the representation.  Note that these strict rules ban some apparently reasonable patterns:  pattern pat = { sign, value , none , none };     error :no symbol  The frac_digits   function indicates where the decimal_point   is placed. Often, monetary amounts are represented in the smallest currency unit  §39.4.3 . This unit is typically one-hundredth of the major unit  for example, a ¢ is one-hundredth of a $ , so frac_digits   is often 2.  Here is a simple format deﬁned as a facet:  class  My_money_io : public moneypunct  { public:  explicit My_money_io siz e_t r = 0  :moneypunct  r  { }  char_type do_decimal_point   const { return '.'; } char_type do_thousands_sep   const { return ','; } string do_grouping   const { return "\003\003\003"; }  string_type do_curr_symbol   const { return "USD "; } string_type do_positive_sign   const { return ""; } string_type do_negative_sign   const { return "  "; }  int do_frac_digits   const { return 2; }     twodigits after decimal point  pattern do_pos_format   const { return pat; } pattern do_neg_format   const { return pat; }  private:  };  static const pattern pat;  const pattern My_money_io::pat { sign, symbol, value , none };  39.4.3.2  Money Output  The money_put facet  writes  monetary  amounts  according  to  the  format  speciﬁed  by moneypunct. Speciﬁcally, money_put provides put   functions that place a suitably formatted character represen- tation into the stream buffer of a stream:   1138  Locales  Chapter 39  money_put > facet  §iso.22.4.6.2   Put value v into buffer position b  Out put Out b, bool intl, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, long double v  const; Out put Out b, bool intl, ios_base& s, C ﬁll, const string_type& v  const;  The intl argument indicates whether a standard four-character ‘‘international’’ currency symbol or a ‘‘local’’ symbol is used  §39.4.3.1 .  Given money_put, we can deﬁne an output operator for Money  §39.4.3 :  ostream& operator<< ostream& s, Money m  {  ostream::sentry guard s ;  if  !guard  return s;     see §38.4.1  const money_put & f = use_facet > s.g etloc   ; if  m==static_cast  m   {    mcan be represented as a long long  if  f.put s,true ,s,s.ﬁll  ,m .failed    s.setstate ios_base::badbit ;  ostringstream v; v << m; if  f.put s,true ,s,s.ﬁll  ,v.str   .failed        convert tostr ingrepresentation  s.setstate ios_base::badbit ;  handle_ioexception s ;      see §39.4.2.2  try {  } else {  }  } catch  ...  {  } return s;  }  If a long long doesn’t hav e sufﬁcient precision to represent the monetary value exactly, I convert the value to its string representation and output that using the put   that takes a string.  39.4.3.3  Money Input  The money_g et facet  reads  monetary  amounts  according  to  the  format  speciﬁed  by moneypunct. Speciﬁcally, money_g et provides get   functions that extract a suitably formatted character represen- tation from the stream buffer of a stream:  money_g et > facet  §iso.22.4.6.1   Read [b:e  into v, using formatting rules from s, reporting errors by setting r  In get In b, In e, bool intl, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, long double& v  const; In get In b, In e, bool intl, ios_base& s, ios_base::iostate& r, string_type& v  const;  A well-deﬁned pair of money_g et and money_put facets will provide output in a form that can be read back in without errors or loss of information. For example:   Section 39.4.3.3  Money Input  1139  }  }  The output of this simple program should be acceptable as its input. Furthermore, the output pro- duced by a second run given the output from a ﬁrst run should be identical to its input.  int main   {  Money m; while  cin>>m   cout << m << "\n";  A plausible input operator for Money would be:  istream& operator>> istream& s, Money& m  {  istream::sentry guard s ;  if  guard  try {     see _io.sentr y_  ios_base::iostate state = 0; istreambuf_iterator  eos; string str;     good  use_facet > s.g etloc   .get s,eos,true,state,str ;  if  state==0  state==ios_base::eofbit  {    set value only if get   succeeded  long long i = stoll str ; if  errno==ERANGE  {  state = ios_base::failbit;     §36.3.5  m = i;     set value only if conversion to long long succeeded  } else {  } s.setstate state ;  }  } catch  ...  {  } return s;  handle_ioexception s ;      see §39.4.2.2  I use the get   that reads into a string because reading into a double and then converting to a long long could lead to loss of precision.  The  largest  value  that  can  be  exactly  represented  by  a long  double may  be  smaller  than  the  largest value that can be represented by a long long.  39.4.4  Date and Time Formatting Date and time formats are controlled by time_get  and time_put . The representation of dates and times used is tm  §43.6 .   1140  Locales  39.4.4.1 time_put  Chapter 39  A time_put facet takes a point in time presented as a tm and produces a sequence of characters rep- resenting it using strftime    §43.6  or an equivalent.  time_put > facet  §iso.22.4.5.1   Out put Out s, ios_base& f, C ﬁll, const tm∗ pt, const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const; Out put Out s, ios_base& f, C ﬁll, const tm∗ pt, char format, char mod = 0  const; Out do_put Out s, ios_base& ib, const tm∗ pt, char format, char mod  const;  A call s=put s,ib,ﬁll,pt,b,e  copies [b:e  onto the output stream s. For each strftime   format character x, with optional modiﬁer mod, it calls do_put s,ib,pt,x,mod . The possible modiﬁer values are 0  the default meaning ‘‘none’’ , E, or O. An overriding p=do_put s,ib,pt,x,mod  is supposed to format the appropriate parts of ∗pt into s and return a value pointing to the position in s after the last character written.  A _byname version  §39.4, §39.4.1  of messages is provided:  The basic idea is that a get_time can read what is produced by a put_time using the same strftime   format  §43.6 :  template > class time_put_byname : public time_put  {     ...  };  39.4.4.2 time_get  class time_base { public:  enum dateorder {  no_order,    meaning mdy dmy,  mdy,  ymd,  ydm      meaning "%d%m%y"    meaning "%m%d%y"    meaning "%y%m%d"    meaning "%y%d%m"  };  };  template > class time_get : public locale::facet, public time_base { public:  using char_type = C; using iter_type = In;    ...  }  In addition to reading according to a format, there are operations for examining the dateorder and for reading speciﬁc parts of date and time representations, such as weekday and monthname:   Section 39.4.4.2  time_get  1141  time_get  facet  §iso.22.4.5.1   Read from [b:e  into ∗pt  dateorder do_date_order   const; In get_time In b, In e, ios_base& ib, ios_base::iostate& err, tm∗ pt  const; In get_date In b, In e, ios_base& ib, ios_base::iostate& err, tm∗ pt  const; In get_weekday In b, In e, ios_base& ib, ios_base::iostate& err, tm∗ pt  const; In get_monthname In b, In e, ios_base& ib, ios_base::iostate& err, tm∗ pt  const; In get_year In b, In e, ios_base& ib, ios_base::iostate& err, tm∗ pt  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& ib, ios_base::iostate& err, tm∗ pt, char format, char mod  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& ib, ios_base::iostate& err, tm∗ pt, char format  const; In get In b, In e, ios_base& ib, ios_base::iostate& err, tm∗ pt, C∗ fmtb, C∗ fmte  const;  A get_∗   function reads from [b:e  into ∗pt, getting its locale from b and setting err in case of error. It returns an iterator pointing to the ﬁrst unread character in [b:e .  A call p=get b,e,ib,err,pt,format,mod  reads as indicated by the format character format and modi-  ﬁer character mod, as speciﬁed by strftime  . If mod is not speciﬁed, mod==0 is used.  A call  of get b,e ,ib,err,pt,fmtb,fmtb  uses  a strftime   format  presented  as  a  string  [fmtb:fmte . This overload, together with the one with the defaulted modiﬁer, does not have do_get   interfaces. Instead, they are implemented by calls to the do_get   for the ﬁrst get  .  The obvious use of the time and date facets is to provide locale-sensitive I O for a Date class.  Consider a variant of the Date from §16.3:  Date::to_string   produces a locale  -speciﬁc string using a stringstream  §38.2.2 :  class Date { public:  explicit Date int d ={}, Month m ={}, int year ={} ;    ... string to_string const locale& = locale    const;  };  }  }  istream& operator>> istream& is, Date& d ; ostream& operator<< ostream& os, Date d ;  string Date::to_string const locale& loc  const {  ostringstream os; os.imbue loc ; return os << ∗this;  Given to_string  , the output operator is trivial:  ostream& operator<< ostream& os, Date d  {  return os<<to_string d,os.getloc   ;  The input operator needs to be careful about state:   1142  Locales  Chapter 39  istream& operator>> istream& is, Date& d  {  if  istream::sentry guard{is}  {  ios_base::iostate err = goodbit; struct tm t; use_facet > is.g etloc   .get_date is,0,is,err,&t ;  if  !err  {  Month m = static_cast  t.tm_mon+1 ; d = Date t.tm_day,m,t.tm_year+1900 ;     read into t  } is.setstate err ;  } return is;  }  };  The +1900 is needed because year 1900 is year zero for tm  §43.6 . A _byname version  §39.4, §39.4.1  of messages is provided:  template > class time_get_byname : public time_get  {     ...  39.4.5  Character Classiﬁcation When reading characters from input, it is often necessary to classify them to make sense of what is being read. For example, to read a number, an input routine needs to know which letters are digits. Similarly, §10.2.2 showed a use of standard character classiﬁcation functions for parsing input.  Naturally, classiﬁcation of characters depends on the alphabet used. Consequently, a facet ctype  is provided to represent character classiﬁcation in a locale.  The character classes are described by an enumeration called mask:  class ctype_base { public:  enum mask {     the actual values are implementation-deﬁned    whitespace  in "C" locale: ’ ’, ’\n’, ’\t’, ...  space = 1,    printingcharacters print = 1<<1,    control characters cntrl = 1<<2,    uppercase characters upper = 1<<3,    lowercase characters lower = 1<<4,    alphabetic characters alpha = 1<<5,    decimal digits digit = 1<<6,    punctuation characters punct = 1<<7,    hexadecimal digits xdigit = 1<<8, blank = 1 << 9;    space and horizontal tab alnum=alphadigit,     alphanumer iccharacters graph=alnumpunct  };  };   Section 39.4.5  Character Classiﬁcation  1143  template  class ctype : public locale::facet, public ctype_base { public:  using char_type = C;    ...  };  This mask doesn’t depend on a particular character type. Consequently, this enumeration is placed in a  non-template  base class.  Clearly, mask reﬂects the traditional C and C++ classiﬁcation  §36.2.1 . However, for different character  sets,  different  character  values  fall  into  different  classes. For example,  for  the  ASCII character  set,  the  integer  value 125 represents  the  character }, which  is  a  punctuation  character  punct .  However, in the Danish national character set, 125 represents the vowel å, which in a Dan- ish locale must be classiﬁed as an alpha.  The classiﬁcation is called a ‘‘mask’’ because the traditional efﬁcient implementation of charac- ter classiﬁcation for small character sets is a table in which each entry holds bits representing the classiﬁcation.  For example:  table['P'] == upperalpha table['a'] == loweralphaxdigit table['1'] == digitxdigit table[' '] == spaceblank  Given that implementation, table[c]&m is nonzero if the character c is an m and 0 otherwise.  The ctype facet is deﬁned like this:  ctype  facet  §iso.22.4.1.1   bool is mask m, C c  const; const C∗ is const C∗ b, const C∗ e, mask∗ v  const; const C∗ scan_is mask m, const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const; const C∗ scan_not mask m, const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const; C toupper C c  const; const C∗ toupper C∗ b, const C∗ e  const; C tolower C c  const; const C∗ tolower C∗ b, const C∗ e  const; C widen C c  const; const char∗ widen const char∗ b, const char∗ e, C∗ b2  const; char narrow C c, char def  const; const C∗ narrow const C∗ b, const C∗ e, char def, char∗ b2  const;  A call is m,c  tests whether the character c belongs to the classiﬁcation m. For example:  int count_spaces const string& s, const locale& loc  {  const ctype & ct = use_facet > loc ; int i = 0;   1144  Locales  Chapter 39  for auto p = s.begin  ; p!=s.end  ; ++p   if  ct.is ctype_base::space,∗p        whitespace as deﬁned byct  ++i;  return i;  Note that it is also possible to use is   to check whether a character belongs to one of a number of classiﬁcations.  For example:  ct.is ctype_base::spacectype_base::punct,c ;      is c whitespace or punctuation in ct?  A call is b,e,v  determines  the  classiﬁcation  of  each  character  in  [b:e  and  places  it  in  the  corre- sponding position in the array v.  A call scan_is m,b,e  returns a pointer to the ﬁrst character in [b:e  that is an m. If no character is  classiﬁed  as  an m, e is  returned. As  ever for  standard facets,  the  public  member  function  is implemented by a call to its do_ virtual function. A simple implementation might be:  template  const C∗ ctype ::do_scan_is mask m, const C∗ b, const C∗ e  const {  while  b!=e && !is m,∗b    ++b; return b;  A call scan_not m,b,e  returns a pointer to the ﬁrst character in [b:e  that is not an m. If all charac- ters are classiﬁed as m, e is returned.  A call toupper c  returns the uppercase version of c if such a version exists in the character set  A call toupper b,e  converts each character in the range [b:e  to uppercase and returns e. A sim-  used and c itself otherwise.  ple implementation might be:  template  const C∗ ctype ::to_upper C∗ b, const C∗ e  {  for  ; b!=e; ++b   ∗b = toupper ∗b ;  return e;  }  }  }  The tolower   functions are similar to toupper   except that they convert to lowercase.  A call widen c  transforms the character c into its corresponding C value.  If C’s  character set provides several characters corresponding to c, the standard speciﬁes that ‘‘the simplest reasonable transformation’’ be used.  For example:  wcout  > wcout.g etloc   .widen 'e' ;  will output a reasonable equivalent to the character e in wcout’s locale.  Translation between unrelated character representations, such as ASCII and EBCDIC, can also  be done by using widen  . For example, assume that an ebcdic locale exists:   Section 39.4.5  Character Classiﬁcation  1145  char EBCDIC_e = use_facet > ebcdic .widen 'e' ;  A call widen b,e,v  takes each character in the range [b:e  and places a widened version in the corre- sponding position in the array v.  A call narrow ch,def  produces a char value corresponding to the character ch from the C type. Again,  ‘‘the  simplest  reasonable  transformation’’ is to be used.  If no  such  corresponding char exists, def is returned.  A call narrow b,e ,def,v  takes each character in the range [b:e  and places a narrowed version in  the corresponding position in the array v.  The general idea is that narrow   converts from a larger character set to a smaller one and that widen   performs the inverse operation. For a character c from the smaller character set, we expect:  c == narrow widen c ,0       not guaranteed  This is true provided that the character represented by c has only one representation in ‘‘the smaller character set.’’  Howev er,  that is not guaranteed. If the characters represented by a char are not a subset of those represented by the larger character set  C , we should expect anomalies and poten- tial problems with code treating characters generically.  Similarly, for a character ch from the larger character set, we might expect:  widen narrow ch,def   == ch  widen narrow ch,def   == widen def      not guaranteed  However,  even though this is often the case, it cannot be guaranteed for a character that is repre- sented by several values in the larger character set but only once in the smaller character set. For example, a digit, such as 7, often has several separate representations in a large character set. The reason for that is typically that a large character set has several conventional character sets as sub- sets and that the characters from the smaller sets are replicated for ease of conversion. For every character in the basic source character set  §6.1.2 , it is guaranteed that  widen narrow ch_lit,0   == ch_lit  For example:  widen narrow 'x',0   == 'x'  The narrow   and widen   functions respect character classiﬁcations wherever possible.  For exam- ple, if is alpha,c , then is alpha,narrow c,'a'   and is alpha,widen c   wherever alpha is a valid mask for the locale used.  A major reason for using a ctype facet in general and for using narrow   and widen   functions in particular is to be able to write code that does I O and string manipulation for any character set, that is, to make such code generic with respect to character sets. This implies that iostream implementa- tions depend critically on these facilities.  By relying on   and  , a user can avoid most direct uses of the ctype facet.  A _byname version  §39.4, §39.4.1  of ctype is provided:  template  class ctype_byname : public ctype  {     ...  };   1146  Locales  Chapter 39  39.4.6  Character Code Conversion Sometimes, the representation of characters stored in a ﬁle differs from the desired representation of  those  same  characters  in  main  memory. For  example,  Japanese  characters  are  often  stored  in ﬁles  in  which  indicators   ‘‘shifts’’   indicate  to  which  of  the  four  common  character  sets   kanji, katakana,  hiragana,  and  romaji   a  given sequence  of  characters  belongs. This  is  a  bit  unwieldy because the meaning of each byte depends on its ‘‘shift state,’’ but it can save memory because only a kanji requires more than 1 byte for its representation. In main memory, these characters are easier to  manipulate  when  represented  in  a  multibyte  character  set  where  every  character  has  the  same size.  Such characters   for  example,  Unicode  characters   are  typically  placed  in  wide  characters  wchar_t; §6.2.3 .  Consequently, the codecvt facet provides a mechanism for converting characters from one representation to another as they are read or written. For example:  disk representation:  JIS  main memory representation:  Unicode  I O conversions controlled by codecvt  This  code  conversion  mechanism  is  general  enough  to  provide  arbitrary  conversions  of  character representations.  It allows us to write a program to use a suitable internal character representation  stored in char, wchar_t, or whatever  and to then accept a variety of input character stream repre- sentations by adjusting the locale used by iostreams.  The alternative would be to modify the pro- gram itself or to convert input and output ﬁles from to a variety of formats.  The codecvt facet  provides  conversion  between  different  character  sets  when  a  character  is  moved between a stream buffer and external storage:  class codecvt_base { public:  enum result {     result indicators  ok, partial, error, noconv  };  };  template  class codecvt : public locale::facet, public codecvt_base { public:  using intern_type = In; using extern_type = Ex; using state_type = SS;    ...  };   Section 39.4.6  Character Code Conversion   1147  codecvt  facet  §iso.22.5   using CI = const In; using CE = const Ex;  result in SS& st, CE∗ b, CE∗ e, CE∗& next, In∗ b2, In∗ e2, In∗& next2  const; result out SS& st, CI∗ b, CI∗ e, CI∗& next, Ex∗ b2, Ex∗ e2, Ex∗& next2  const; result unshift SS& st, Ex∗ b, Ex∗ e, Ex∗& next  const; int encoding   const noexcept; bool always_noconv   const noexcept; int length SS& st, CE∗ b, CE∗ e, siz e_t max  const; int max_length   const noexcept;  A codecvt facet is used by basic_ﬁlebuf  §38.2.1  to read or write characters. A basic_ﬁlebuf obtains this facet from the stream’s locale  §38.1 .  The State template  argument  is  the  type  used  to  hold  the  shift  state  of  the  stream  being  con- verted. State can also be used to identify different conversions by specifying a specialization. The latter is useful because characters of a variety of character encodings  character sets  can be stored in objects of the same type. For example:  class JISstate {  * ..*  };  p = new codecvt ;  q = new codecvt ;      standard char to wide char    JIS to wide char  Without the different State arguments, there would be no way for the facet to know which encoding to  assume  for  the  stream  of chars.  The mbstate_t type  from   or   identiﬁes  the system’s standard conversion between char and wchar_t.  A new codecvt can also be created as a derived class and identiﬁed by name. For example:  class JIScvt : public codecvt  {     ...  };  A call in st,b,e,next,b2,e2,next2  reads each character in the range [b:e  and tries to convert it. If a character  is  converted, in   writes  its  converted  form  to  the  corresponding  position  in  the  [b2:e2  range; if not, in   stops at that point. Upon return, in   stores the position one beyond the last char- acter read in next  the next character to be read  and the position one beyond the last character writ- ten in next2  the next character to be written . The result value returned by in   indicates how much work was done:  codecvt_base result  §iso.22.4.1.4  All characters in [b:e  range were converted Not all characters in [b:e  were converted A character couldn’t be converted No conversion was needed  ok partial error noconv  Note that a partial conversion is not necessarily an error. Possibly more characters have to be read before a multibyte character is complete and can be written, or maybe the output buffer has to be emptied to make room for more characters.   1148  Locales  Chapter 39  The state_type argument st indicates the state of the input character sequence at the start of the call of in  . This is signiﬁcant when the external character representation uses shift states. Note that st is a  non-const  reference argument: at the end of the call, st holds the shift state of the input sequence.  This allows  a  programmer  to  deal  with partial conversions  and  to  convert  a  long sequence using several calls to in  .  A call out st,b,e,next,b2,e2,next2  converts [b:e  from the internal to the external representation  in the same way the in   converts from the external to the internal representation.  A character stream must start and end in a ‘‘neutral’’  unshifted  state. Typically, that state is  state_type{}.  A call unshift ss,b,e,next  looks at st and places characters in [b:e  as needed to bring a sequence of characters back to that unshifted state. The result of unshift   and the use of next are done just like out  .  A call length st,b,e,max  returns the number of characters that in   could convert from [b:e . Return values from encoding   mean: −1 The  encoding  of  the  external  character  set  uses  state   for  example,  uses  shift  and  unshift  character sequences .  0 The encoding uses varying number of bytes to represent individual characters  for example, a character representation might use a bit in a byte to indicate whether 1 or 2 bytes are used to represent that character .  n Every character of the external character representation is n bytes.  A call always_noconv   returns true if no conversion is required between the internal and the exter- nal character sets and false otherwise.  Clearly, always_noconv  ==true opens the possibility for the implementation to provide the maximally efﬁcient implementation that simply doesn’t inv oke the conversion functions.  A call cvt.max_length   returns the maximum value that cvt.length ss,p,q,n  can return for a valid  set of arguments.  The simplest code conversion that I can think of is one that converts input to uppercase. Thus,  this is about as simple as a codecvt can be and still perform a service:  class Cvt_to_upper : public codecvt  {    convert touppercase public:  explicit Cvt_to_upper size_t r = 0  : codecvt r  { }  protected:     read exter nalrepresentation, write internal representation: result do_in State& s,  const char∗ from, const char∗ from_end, const char∗& from_next, char∗ to, char∗ to_end, char∗& to_next    const override;     read internal representation, write exter nalrepresentation: result do_out State& s,  const char∗ from, const char∗ from_end, const char∗& from_next, char∗ to, char∗ to_end, char∗& to_next    const override;   Section 39.4.6  Character Code Conversion   1149  result do_unshift State&, E∗ to, E∗ to_end, E∗& to_next  const override { return ok; }  int do_encoding   const noexcept override { return 1; } bool do_always_noconv   const noexcept override { return false; }  int do_length const State&, const E∗ from, const E∗ from_end, size_t max  const override; int do_max_length   const noexcept override;      maximum possible length    codecvt ::result Cvt_to_upper::do_out State& s,  const char∗ from, const char∗ from_end, const char∗& from_next, char∗ to, char∗ to_end, char∗& to_next  const  return codecvt ::do_out s,from,from_end,from_next,to,to_end,to_next ;  codecvt ::result Cvt_to_upper::do_in State& s,  const char∗ from, const char∗ from_end, const char∗& from_next, char∗ to, char∗ to_end, char∗& to_next  const     ...  int main      trivialtest {  locale ulocale locale  , new Cvt_to_upper ;  cin.imbue ulocale ;  for  char ch; cin>>ch;    cout << ch;  A _byname version  §39.4, §39.4.1  of codecvt is provided:  template  class codecvt_byname : public codecvt  {     ...  };  };  {  }  {  }  }  39.4.7  Messages Naturally, most end users prefer to use their native language to interact with a program. However, we  cannot  provide  a  standard  mechanism  for  expressing locale-speciﬁc  general  interactions. Instead, the library provides a simple mechanism for keeping a locale-speciﬁc set of strings from which  a  programmer  can  compose  simple  messages. In  essence, messages implements  a  trivial read-only database:   1150  Locales  Chapter 39  class messages_base { public:  using catalog =  * implementation-deﬁned integer type* ;     catalog identiﬁer type  template  class messages : public locale::facet, public messages_base { public:  using char_type = C; using string_type = basic_string ;    ...

A catalog is a set of strings organized in an implementation-speciﬁc way and accessed through the messages::g et   func- tion.  A negative value is returned if no catalog named s can be opened. A catalog must be opened before the ﬁrst use of get  .  A call close cat  closes the catalog identiﬁed by cat and frees all resources associated with that  catalog.  A call get cat,set,id,"foo"  looks for a message identiﬁed by  set,id  in the catalog cat. If a string  is found, get   returns that string; otherwise, get   returns the default string  here, string "foo"  .  Here is an example of a messages facet for an implementation in which a message catalog is a  vector of sets of ‘‘messages’’ and a ‘‘message’’ is a string:  struct Set {  vector  msgs;  struct Cat {  vector  sets;  };  };  };  };  class My_messages : public messages  {  vector & catalogs;  public:  explicit My_messages siz e_t = 0  :catalogs{∗new vector } { }  catalog do_open const string& s, const locale& loc  const; string do_get catalog cat, int s, int m, const string&  const;     open catalog s    get message  s,m  in cat   Section 39.4.7  Messages   1151  void do_close catalog cat  const {  if  catalogs.size  <=cat   catalogs.erase catalogs.begin  +cat ;  ˜My_messages   { delete &catalogs; }  }  };  All messages’ member functions are const, so the catalog data structure  the vector   is stored outside the facet.  A message is selected by specifying a catalog, a set within that catalog, and a message string within that set. A string is supplied as an argument, to be used as a default result in case no mes- sage is found in the catalog:  string My_messages::do_g et catalog cat, int set, int id, const string& def  const {  if  catalogs.size  <=cat   return def;  Cat& c = catalogs[cat]; if  c.sets.size  <=set   return def;  Set& s = c.sets[set]; if  s.msgs.size  <=msg   return def;  return s.msgs[id];  Opening a catalog involves reading a textual representation from disk into a Cat structure.  Here, I chose a representation that is trivial to read. A set is delimited by  >>, and each message is a line of text:  messages ::catalog My_messages::do_open const string& n, const locale& loc  const {  }  }  string nn = n + locale  .name  ; ifstream f nn.c_str   ; if  !f  return −1;  catalogs.push_back Cat{} ;  Cat& c = catalogs.back  ;     makein-core catalog  for string s; f>>s && s=="<<<";   {     read Set  c.sets.push_back Set{} ; Set& ss = c.sets.back  ; while  getline f,s  && s != ">>>"   ss.msgs.push_back s ;  } return catalogs.size  −1;     read message  Here is a trivial use:   Chapter 39  1152  Locales  int main       atrivial test  }  }  {  }  if  !has_facet  locale     {  cerr << "no messages facet found in" << locale  .name   << '\n'; exit 1 ;  const messages & m = use_facet  locale   ; extern string message_director y;     where I keep mymessages  auto cat = m.open message_director y,locale   ; if  cat<0  {  cerr << "no catalog found\n"; exit 1 ;  cout << m.get cat,0,0,"Missed again!"  << endl; cout << m.get cat,1,2,"Missed again!"  << endl; cout << m.get cat,1,3,"Missed again!"  << endl; cout << m.get cat,3,0,"Missed again!"  << endl;  If the catalog is:  <<< hello goodbye >>> <<< yes no maybe >>>  this program prints  hello maybe Missed again! Missed again!  39.4.7.1  Using Messages from Other facets  In addition to being a repository for locale-dependent strings used to communicate with users, mes- sages can be used to hold strings for other facets.  For example, the Season_io facet  §39.3.2  could have been written like this:   Section 39.4.7.1  Using Messages from Other facets  1153  ˜Season_io   { }     to makeitpossible to destroySeason_io objects  §39.3   const string& to_str Season x  const;     stringrepresentation of x  bool from_str const string& s, Season& x  const;     place Season corresponding to s in x  static locale::id id;     facet identiﬁer object  §39.2, §39.3, §39.3.1   class Season_io : public locale::facet {  const messages & m; messages_base::catalog cat;     message directory    message catalog  public:  class Missing_messages { };  Season_io size_t i = 0   : locale::facet i , m use_facet  locale    , cat m.open message_director y,locale      {  }  if  cat<0   throw Missing_messages  ;  };  }  }  locale::id Season_io::id;    deﬁne the identiﬁer object  string Season_io::to_str Season x  const {  return m−>get cat,0,x,"no−such−season" ;  bool Season_io::from_str const string& s, Season& x  const {  for  int i = Season::spring; i<=Season::winter; i++  if  m−>get cat,0,i,"no−such−season"  == s  {  x = Season i ; return true;  }  return false;  This messages-based solution differs from the original solution  §39.3.2  in that the implementer of a set of Season strings for a new locale needs to be able to add them to a messages directory. This is easy for someone adding a new locale to an execution environment.  However,  since messages provides only a read-only interface, adding a new set of season names may be beyond the scope of an application programmer.  A _byname version  §39.4, §39.4.1  of messages is provided:   1154  Locales  Chapter 39  template  class messages_byname : public messages  {     ...  };  39.5  Convenience Interfaces Beyond simply imbuing an iostream, the locale facilities can be complicated to use. Consequently, convenience interfaces are provided to simplify notation and minimize mistakes.  39.5.1  Character Classiﬁcation The most common use of the ctype facet is to inquire whether a character belongs to a given classi- ﬁcation.  Consequently, a set of functions is provided for that:  locale-Sensitive Character Classiﬁcation  §iso.22.3.3.1   isspace c,loc  isblank c,loc  isprint c,loc  iscntrl c,loc  isupper c,loc  islower c,loc  isalpha c,loc  isdigit c,loc  ispunct c,loc  isxdigit c,loc  isalnum c,loc   isgraph c,loc    Is c a space in loc? Is c a blank in loc? Is c printable? Is c a control character? Is c an uppercase letter? Is c a lowercase letter? Is c a letter? Is c a decimal digit? Is c not a letter, digit, whitespace, or invisible control character? Is c a hexadecimal digit? isalpha c  or isdigit c  isalpha c  or isdigit c  or ispunct c   note: not space   These functions are trivially implemented using use_facet. For example:  template  inline bool isspace C c, const locale& loc  {  return use_facet > loc .is space,c ;  }  }  The one-argument versions of these functions  §36.2.1  use the current C global locale. Except for the rare cases in which the C global locale and the C++ global locale differ  §39.2.1 , we can think of a one-argument version as the two-argument version applied to locale  . For example:  inline int isspace int i  {  return isspace i,locale   ;     almost   Section 39.5.2  Character Conversions   1155  39.5.2  Character Conversions Case conversions can be locale sensitive:  Character Conversion  §iso.22.3.3.2.1   c2= toupper c,loc  c2= tolower c,loc    use_facet > loc .toupper c  use_facet > loc .tolower c   39.5.3  String Conversions Character code conversions can be locale sensitive. Class template wstring_conver t performs con- versions between a wide string and a byte string. It lets you specify a code conversion facet  such as codecvt  to perform the conversions, without affecting any streams or locales.  For example, you might  use  a  code  conversion facet called codecvt_utf8 directly  to  output  a  UTF-8  multibyte sequence to cout without altering cout’s locale:  wstring_conver t > myconv; string s = myconv.to_bytes L"Hello\n" ; cout << s;  The deﬁnition of wstring_conver t is fairly conventional:  template<class Codecvt,  class Wc = wchar_t, class Wa = std::allocator ,  class Ba = std::allocator       wide-character allocator    byte allocator  >  class wstring_conver t { public:  using byte_string = basic_string , Ba>; using wide_string = basic_string , Wa>; using state_type = typename Codecvt::state_type; using int_type = typename wide_string::traits_type::int_type;    ...  };  The wstring_conver t constructors allow us to specify a character conversion facet, an initial conver- sion state, and values to be used in case of errors:  wstring_conver t   §iso.22.3.3.2.2   wstring_conver t cvt {}; wstring_conver t cvt {pcvt,state} wstring_conver t cvt {pcvt}; wstring_conver t cvt {b_err,w_err};  wstring_conver t cvt {b_err}; cvt.˜wstring_conver t  ;  wstring_conver t cvt {new Codecvt}; cvt uses the conversion facet ∗pcvt and conversion state state wstring_conver t cvt {pcvt,state_type{}}; wstring_conver t cvt{}; use b_error and w_err wstring_conver t cvt{}; use b_error Destructor   1156  Locales  Chapter 39  ws=cvt.from_bytes c   ws=cvt.from_bytes s    ws=cvt.from_bytes b,e   s=cvt.to_bytes wc   s=cvt.to_bytes ws    wstring_conver t   §iso.22.3.3.2.2  ws contains the char c converted to Wcs ws contains the chars of s converted to Wcs; s is a C-style string or a string ws contains the chars of [b:e  converted to Wcs s contains wc converted to chars s contains the Wcs of wsconverted to a chars; ws is a C-style string or a basic_string  s contains the Wcs of [b:e  converted to chars n is the number of input elements converted by cvt st is the cvt’s state  s=cvt.to_bytes b,e   n=cvt.conver ted   st=cvt.state     If a conversion to a wide_string fails, functions on a cvt constructed with a non-default w_err string return that string  as an error message ; otherwise, they throw range_error.  If  a  conversion  to  a byte_string fails,  functions  on  a cvt constructed  with  a  non-default b_err  string return that string  as an error message ; otherwise, they throw range_error.  An example:  void test   {  wstring_conver t > conver ter;  39.5.4  Buffer Conversions We can use a code conversion facet  §39.4.6  to write directly into or to read directly from a stream buffer  §38.6 :  string s8 = u8"This is a UTF−8 string"; wstring s16 = conver ter.from_bytes s8 ; string s88 = conver ter.to_bytes s16 ;  if  s8!=s88   cerr <"Insane!\n";  }  template<class Codecvt,  class C = wchar_t, class Tr = std::char_traits   >  class wbuffer_conver t  : public std::basic_streambuf  {  public:  };  using state_type = typename Codecvt::state_type;    ...

However, numeric computa- tion typically occurs in the context of other work – such as database access, networking, instrument control,  graphics,  simulation,  and  ﬁnancial  analysis  –  so  C++  becomes  an  attractive  vehicle  for computations  that  are  part  of  a  larger  system. Furthermore,  numeric  methods  have  come  a  long way from being simple loops over vectors of ﬂoating-point numbers. Where more complex data   1160  Numerics  Chapter 40  structures are needed as part of a computation, C++’s strengths become relevant.  The net effect is that  C++  is  widely  used  for  scientiﬁc,  engineering,  ﬁnancial,  and  other  computation  involving sophisticated numerics. Consequently, facilities and techniques supporting such computation have emerged.  This chapter describes the parts of the standard library that support numerics. I make no attempt to teach numeric methods. Numeric computation is a fascinating topic in its own right. To understand it, you need a good course in numerical methods or at least a good textbook – not just a language manual and tutorial.  In addition to the standard-library facilities described here, Chapter 29 is an extended example  of numerical programming: an N-dimensional matrix.  40.2  Numerical Limits To  do anything interesting with numbers, we typically need to know something about the general properties of built-in numeric types. To  allow the programmer to best take advantage of hardware, these  properties  are  implementation-deﬁned  rather  than  ﬁxed  by  the  rules  of  the  language  itself  §6.2.8 .  For  example,  what  is  the  largest int? What  is  the  smallest  positive ﬂoat? Is a double rounded or truncated when assigned to a ﬂoat? How many bits are there in a char?  Answers  to  such  questions  are  provided  by  the  specializations  of  the numeric_limits template  presented in  . For example:  void f double d, int i  {  char classiﬁcation[numeric_limits ::max  ];  if  numeric_limits ::digits==numeric_limits ::digits   {     chars are unsigned  if  i ::min    numeric_limits ::max  <i  {     icannot be stored in a shortwithout loss of digits  if  0 ::epsilon    d = 0;  if  numeric_limits ::is_specializ ed  {     limits infor mationis available for type Quad  Each  specialization  provides  the  relevant  information  for  its  argument  type. Thus,  the  general numeric_limits template is simply a notational handle for a set of constants and constexpr functions:  template  class numeric_limits { public:  static const bool is_specialized = false;    is infor mationavailable for numer ic_limits ?    ... uninteresting defaults ...  }  }  }  }  };   Section 40.2  Numerical Limits  1161  The real information is in the specializations. Each implementation of the standard library provides a specialization of numeric_limits for each fundamental numeric type  the character types, the inte- ger types, the ﬂoating-point types, and bool  but not for any other plausible candidates such as void, enumerations, or library types  such as complex  .  For an integral  type  such  as char, only  a  few pieces  of  information  are  of  interest. Here  is  numeric_limits  for an implementation in which a char has 8 bits and is signed:  template  class numeric_limits  { public:  static const bool is_specialized = true;     yes, wehaveinfor mation  static const int digits = 7;     number of bits  ‘‘binar ydigits’’  excluding sign  static const bool is_signed = true; static const bool is_integer = true;     this implementation has char signed    char is an integraltype  static constexpr char min   noexcept { return −128; } static constexpr char max   noexcept { return 127; }     smallest value    largest value     lots of declarations not relevant to a char  };  The functions are constexpr, so that they can be used where a constant expression is required and without run-time overhead.  Most members of numeric_limits are intended to describe ﬂoating-point numbers. For example,  this describes one possible implementation of ﬂoat:  template  class numeric_limits  { public:  static const bool is_specialized = true;  static const int radix = 2; static const int digits = 24; static const int digits10 = 9;     base of exponent  in this case,binar y     number of radix digits in mantissa    number of base 10 digits in mantissa  static const bool is_signed = true; static const bool is_integer = false; static const bool is_exact = false;  static constexpr ﬂoat min   noexcept { return 1.17549435E−38F; }    smallest positive static constexpr ﬂoat max   noexcept { return 3.40282347E+38F; }    largest positive static constexpr ﬂoat lowest   noexcept { return −3.40282347E+38F; }     smallest value  static constexpr ﬂoat epsilon   noexcept { return 1.19209290E−07F; } static constexpr ﬂoat round_error   noexcept { return 0.5F; }     maximum rounding error  static constexpr ﬂoat inﬁnity   noexcept { return  * some value* ; }   1162  Numerics  Chapter 40  static constexpr ﬂoat quiet_NaN   noexcept { return  * some value* ; } static constexpr ﬂoat signaling_NaN   noexcept { return  * some value* ; } static constexpr ﬂoat denorm_min   noexcept { return min  ; }  static const int min_exponent = −125; static const int min_exponent10 = −37; static const int max_exponent = +128; static const int max_exponent10 = +38;  static const bool has_inﬁnity = true; static const bool has_quiet_NaN = true; static const bool has_signaling_NaN = true; static const ﬂoat_denorm_style has_denorm = denorm_absent; static const bool has_denorm_loss = false;  static const bool is_iec559 = true; static const bool is_bounded = true; static const bool is_modulo = false; static const bool traps = true; static const bool tinyness_before = true;     confor msto IEC-559  static const ﬂoat_round_style round_style = round_to_nearest;  };  Note that min   is the smallest positive normalized number and that epsilon is the smallest positive ﬂoating-point number such that 1+epsilon−1 is larger than 0.  When deﬁning a scalar type along the lines of the built-in ones, it is a good idea also to provide a suitable specialization of numeric_limits. For example, if I write a quadruple-precision type Quad, a user  could  reasonably  expect  me  to  provide numeric_limits . Conversely, if I use  a  non- numeric type, Dumb_ptr, I would expect for numeric_limits > to be the primary tem- plate that has is_specialized set to false, indicating that no information is available.  We  can  imagine  specializations  of numeric_limits describing  properties  of  user-deﬁned  types that have little to do with ﬂoating-point numbers. In such cases, it is usually better to use the gen- eral technique for describing properties of a type than to specialize numeric_limits with properties not considered in the standard.  40.2.1  Limit Macros From C, C++ inherited macros that describe properties of integers.  They are found in  :  Integer Limit Macros  _iso.diff.library_, abbreviated   CHAR_BIT CHAR_MIN CHAR_MAX INT_MIN LONG_MAX  Number of bits in a char  usually 8  Smallest char value  possibly negative  Largest char value  usually 127 if char is signed and 255 if char is unsigned  Smallest int value Largest long value  Analogously named macros for signed chars, long long, etc., are also provided.   Section 40.2.1  Limit Macros   1163  Similarly,   and   deﬁne macros describing properties of ﬂoating-point numbers:  Floating-Point Limit Macros  _iso.diff.library_, abbreviated   FLT_MIN FLT_MAX FLT_DIG FLT_MAX_10_EXP DBL_MIN DBL_MAX DBL_EPSILON  Smallest positive ﬂoat value  e.g., 1.175494351e−38F  Largest ﬂoat value  e.g., 3.402823466e+38F  Number of decimal digits of precision of a ﬂoat  e.g., 6  Largest decimal exponent of a ﬂoat  e.g., 38  Smallest double value Largest double value  e.g., 1.7976931348623158e+308  Smallest double such that 1.0+DBL_EPSILON!=1.0  Analogously named macros for long double are also provided.  40.3  Standard Mathematical Functions In   we ﬁnd what are commonly called the standard mathematical functions:  Standard Mathematical Functions  Absolute value Smallest integer >= x Largest integer <= x Square root; x must be non-negative Cosine Sine Tangent Arccosine; the result is non-negative Arcsine; the result nearest to 0 is returned Arctangent Hyperbolic sine Hyperbolic cosine Hyperbolic tangent Base e exponential Natural logarithm, base e; x must be positive Base 10 logarithm  abs x  ceil x  ﬂoor x  sqrt x  cos x  sin x  tan x  acos x  asin x  atan x  sinh x  cosh x  tanh x  exp x  log x  log10 x   There are versions taking ﬂoat, double, long double, and complex  §40.4  arguments.  For each func- tion, the return type is the same as the argument type.  Errors are reported by setting errno from   to EDOM for a domain error and to ERANGE  for a range error. For example:  void f   {  errno = 0;    clear old error state sqrt −1 ; if  errno==EDOM  cerr << "sqrt   not deﬁned for negative argument";   1164  Numerics  Chapter 40  pow numeric_limits ::max  ,2 ; if  errno == ERANGE  cerr << "result of pow   too large to represent as a double";  }  For historical reasons, a few mathematical functions are found in   rather than in  :  More Mathematical Functions  §iso.26.8   n2=abs n  n2=labs n  n2=llabs n  p=div n,d   p=ldiv n,d  p=lldiv n,d   Absolute value; n is int, long, or long long; n2 has the same type as n ‘‘Long absolute value’’; n and n2 are long ‘‘Long long absolute value’’; n and n2 are long long p=div n,d  Divide n by d; p is {quotient,remainder}; n and d are long Divide n by d; p is {quotient,remainder}; n and d are long long  The l∗   versions are there because C does not support overloading.  The results of the ldiv   func- tions are structs div_t, ldiv_t, and lldiv_t, respectively. These structs hav e members quot  for quo- tient  and rem  for remainder  of implementation-deﬁned types.  There  is  a  separate  ISO  standard  for special  mathematical  functions [C++Math,2010].

A complex  where Scalar is some other type supporting the usual arith- metic operations usually works but is not guaranteed to be portable.  template  class complex {     acomplexisapair of scalar values,basically a coordinate pair Scalar re, im;  public:  complex const Scalar & r = Scalar{}, const Scalar & i = Scalar{}  :re r , im i  { }  Scalar real   const { return re; } void real Scalar r  { re=r; }     real part   Section 40.4  complex Numbers   1165  Scalar imag   const { return im; } void imag Scalar i  { im = i; }     imaginar ypar t  template   complex const complex & ;  complex & operator= const T& ; complex& operator= const complex& ; template   complex & operator= const complex & ;  complex & operator+= const T& ; template   complex & operator+= const complex & ;     similar for operators -=, *=,  =  };  The standard-library complex does not protect against narrowing:  complex  z1 = 1.33333333333333333;    narrows complex  z2 = 1.33333333333333333;   narrows z1=z2;     narrows  To protect against accidental narrowing, use {} initialization:  complex  z3 {1.33333333333333333};     error :narrowing conversion  In addition to the members of complex,   offers a host of useful operations:  complex Operators  Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Equality Inequality The square of abs z  Conjugate: {z.re,−z.im}  z1+z2 z1−z2 z1∗z2 z1 z2 z1==z2 z1!=z2 norm z  conj z  polar x,y  Make a complex giv en polar coordinates  rho,theta  real z  imag z  abs z  arg z  out<<z in>>z  Real part Imaginary part Distance from  0,0 : sqrt z.re∗z.re+z.im∗z.im ; also known as rho Angle from positive real axis: atan2 z.im z.re ; also known as theta Complex output Complex input  The  standard  mathematical  functions   §40.3   are  also  available  for  complex numbers.

For more details, see §18.3.   1166  Numerics  Chapter 40  40.5  A Numerical Array: valarray Much numeric work relies on relatively simple single-dimensional vectors of ﬂoating-point values. In particular, such vectors are well supported by high-performance machine architectures, libraries relying on such vectors are in wide use, and very aggressive optimization of code using such vec- tors  is  considered  essential  in  many ﬁelds.  The valarray from   is  a  single-dimensional numerical array. It provides the usual numeric vector arithmetic operations for an array type plus support for slices and strides:  valarray  slice slice_array  gslice gslice_array  mask_array  indirect_array   Numerical Array Classes  §iso.26.6.1  A numerical array of type T A BLAS-like slice  start, length, and stride ; §40.5.4 A subarray identiﬁed by a slice; §40.5.5 A slice generalized to describe a matrix A submatrix identiﬁed by a generalized slice; §40.5.6 A subset of an array identiﬁed by a mask; §40.5.2 A subset of an array identiﬁed by a list of indices; §40.5.2  The fundamental idea of valarray was to provide Fortran-like facilities for dense multidimensional arrays with Fortran-like opportunities for optimization. This can only be achieved with the active support of compiler and optimization suppliers and the addition of more library support on top of the very basic facilities provided by valarray. So far, that has not happened for all implementations.  40.5.1  Constructors and Assignments The valarray constructors allow us to initialize valarrays from the auxiliary numeric array types and from single values:  valarray va {};  valarray va {n};  valarray va {t,n};  valarray va {p,n};  valarray va {v2}; valarray va {a};  valarray va {args};  va.˜valarray    For example:  valarray  Constructors  §iso.26.6.2.2  valarray with no elements valarray of n elements with value T{}; explicit valarray of n elements with value t valarray of n elements with values copied from [p:p+n  Move and copy constructor Construct va with elements from a; a can be a slice_array, gslice_array, mask_array, or indirect_array; the number of elements is the number of elements in a Construct from the initializer_list {args}; the number of elements is the number of elements in {args} Destructor  valarray  v0; valarray  v1 1000 ;     placeholder,wecan assign to v0 later    1000 elements with value ﬂoat  ==0.0F   Section 40.5.1  Constructors and Assignments  1167  valarray  v2 −1,2000 ; valarray  v3 100,9.8064 ;     2000 elements with value −1    bad mistake: ﬂoating-point valarray size  valarray  v4 = v3;     v4 has v3.size   elements  valarray  v5 {−1,2000};     twoelements  In  the  two-argument  constructors,  the  value  comes  before  the  number  of  elements. This  differs from the convention for standard containers  §31.3.2 .  The number of elements of an argument valarray to a copy constructor determines the size of the  resulting valarray.  Most programs need data from tables or input. In addition to initializer lists, this is supported  by a constructor that copies elements from a built-in array. For example:  void f const int∗ p, int n  {  const double vd[] = {0,1,2,3,4}; const int vi[] = {0,1,2,3,4};  valarray  v1{vd,4}; valarray  v2{vi,4}; valarray  v3{vd,8}; valarray  v4{p,n};     4elements: 0,1,2,3    type error:viisnot pointer to double    undeﬁned: too few elements in initializer    phad better point to at least n ints  }  The valarray and its auxiliary facilities were designed for high-speed computing. This is reﬂected in a few constraints on users and by a few liberties granted to implementers. Basically, an imple- menter of valarray is allowed to use just about every optimization technique you can think of. The valarray operations  are  assumed  to  be  free  of  side  effects   except  on  their  explicit  arguments,  of course , valarrays are assumed to be alias free, and the introduction of auxiliary types and the elimi- nation of temporaries is allowed as long as the basic semantics are maintained. There is no range checking.  The elements of a valarray must have the default copy semantics  §8.2.6 .  Assignment can be with another valarray, a scalar, or a subset of a valarray:  valarray  Assignments  §iso.26.6.2.3  Copy assignment: va2.siz e   becomes va.siz e    va2=va va2=move va  Move assignment: va becomes empty va=t va={args}  Scalar assignment: each element of va is a copy of t Assignment from the initializer_list {args}; the number of elements of va becomes {args}.siz e   Assignment from a; a.size   must equal va.siz e  ; a can be a slice_array, gslice_array, mask_array, or indirect_array v[i]@=va2[i] for each element of va; @ can be  , %, +, −, ˆ, &, ,  > v[i]@=t for each element of va; @ can be  , %, +, −, ˆ, &, ,  >  va=a  va@=va2  va@=t   A valarray can be assigned to another of the same size. As one would expect, v1=v2 copies every element of v2 into its corresponding position in v1. If valarrays hav e different sizes, the result of assignment is undeﬁned.   1168  Numerics  Chapter 40  In addition to this conventional assignment, it is possible to assign a scalar to a valarray. For example, v=7 assigns 7 to every element of the valarray v. This may be surprising to some program- mers and is best understood as an occasionally useful degenerate case of the operator assignment operations.  For example:  valarray  v {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}; v ∗= 2; v = 7;     v=={2,4,6,10,12,14,16}    v=={7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7}  40.5.2  Subscripting Subscripting can be used to select an element of a valarray or a subset of its elements:  valarray  Subscripting  §iso.26.6.2.4, §iso.26.6.2.5   t=va[i] a2=va[x]  Subscripting: t is a reference to the ith element of va; no range checking Subset: x is a slice, a gslice, valarray , or a valarray   Each operator[] returns a subset of the elements from a valarray. The return type  the type of the object representing the subset  depends on the argument type.  For const arguments,  the  result  contains  copies  of  elements. For non-const arguments,  the result holds references to elements. Since C++ doesn’t directly support arrays of references  e.g., we  can’t say valarray  ,  the  implementation  will  somehow simulate  this. This  can  be  done efﬁciently. An exhaustive list, with examples  based on §iso.26.6.2.5 , is in order. In each case, the subscript describes the elements to be returned, and v1 must be a vallaray with an appropriate length and element type:   cid:129  A slice of a const valarray:  valarray  operator[] slice  const;   copyofelements    ... const valarray  v0 {"abcdefghijklmnop",16}; valarray  v1 {v0[slice 2,5,3 ]};    {"cﬁlo",5}   cid:129  A slice of a non-const valarray:  slice_array  operator[] slice ;    ... valarray  v0 {"abcdefghijklmnop",16}; valarray  v1 {"ABCDE",5}; v0[slice 2,5,3 ] = v1;     v0=={"abAdeBghCjkDmnEp",16}     references to elements   cid:129  A gslice of a const valarray:  valarray  operator[] const gslice&  const;    copies of elements    ... const valarray  v0 {"abcdefghijklmnop",16}; const valarray  len {2,3}; const valarray  str {7,2}; valarray  v1 {v0[gslice 3,len,str ]};     v1=={"dfhkmo",6}   Section 40.5.2  Subscripting   1169   cid:129  A gslice of a non-const valarray:  gslice_array  operator[] const gslice& ;    ... valarray  v0 {"abcdefghijklmnop",16}; valarray  v1 {"ABCDE",5}; const valarray  len {2,3}; const valarray  str {7,2}; v0[gslice 3,len,str ] = v1;   cid:129  A valarray   a mask  of a const valarray:     v0=={"abcAeBgCijDlEnFp",16}     references to elements  valarray  operator[] const valarray &  const;    ... const valarray  v0 {"abcdefghijklmnop",16}; const bool vb[] {false, false , true , true , false , true}; valarray  v1 {v0[valarray  vb, 6 ]};     copies of elements     v1=={"cdf",3}   cid:129  A valarray   a mask  of a non-const valarray:  mask_array  operator[] const valarray & ;     ... valarray  v0 {"abcdefghijklmnop", 16}; valarray  v1 {"ABC",3}; const bool vb[] {false, false , true , true , false , true}; v0[valarray  vb,6 ] = v1;     v0=={"abABeCghijklmnop",16}     references to elements   cid:129  A valarray   a set of indices  of a const valarray:  valarray  operator[] const valarray &  const;     references to elements    ... const valarray  v0 {"abcdefghijklmnop",16}; const size_t vi[] {7, 5, 2, 3, 8}; valarray  v1 {v0[valarray  vi,5 ]};     v1=={"hfcdi",5}   cid:129  A valarray   a set of indices  of a non-const valarray:  indirect_array  operator[] const valarray & ;    references to elements    ... valarray  v0 {"abcdefghijklmnop",16}; valarray  v1 {"ABCDE",5}; const size_t vi[] {7, 5, 2, 3, 8}; v0[valarray  vi,5 ] {v1};      v0=={"abCDeBgAEjklmnop",16}  Note that subscripting with a mask  a valarray   yields a mask_array, and subscripting with a set of indices  a valarray   yields an indirect_array.  40.5.3  Operations The  purpose  of valarray is  to  support  computation,  so  a  host  of  basic  numerical  operations  are directly supported:   1170  Numerics  Chapter 40  valarray  Member Operations  §iso.26.6.2.8   va.swap va2  n=va.siz e   t=va.sum    t=va.min    t=va.max    va2=va.shift n  va2=va.cshift n  va2=va.apply f  va.resiz e n,t  va.resiz e n   Exchange elements of va and va2; noexcept; n is the number of elements of va t is the sum of elements of va computed using += t is the smallest element of va found using < t is the largest element of va found using < Linear right shift of elements Circular right shift of elements Apply f: the value of each element va2[i] is va[f i ] Make va a valarray with n elements with the value t va.resiz e n,T{}   There  is  no  range  checking:  the  effect  of  using  a  function  that  tries  to  access  an  element  of  an empty valarray is undeﬁned.  Note that resize   does not retain any old values.  valarray  Operations  §iso.26.6.2.6, §iso.26.6.2.7   v or v2, but not both, can be a scalar; for arithmetic operations, the result is a valarray   swap va,va2   va3=va@va2  vb=v@v2  v2=@ v   v3=atan2 v,v2  v3=pow v,v2  p=begin v   p=end v    va.swap va2  Perform @ on elements of va and va2, yielding va3; @ can be +, −, ∗,  , %, &, , ˆ,  >, &&,  Perform @ on elements of v and v2 ,yielding a valarray ; @ can be ==, !=,  , >= Perform @   on elements of v, yielding v2; @ can be abs, acos, asin, atan, cos, cosh, exp, log, log10 Perform atan2   on elements of v and v2 Perform pow   on v and v2 p is a random-access iterator to the ﬁrst element of v p is a random-access iterator to the one-beyond-the-last element of v  The  binary  operations  are  deﬁned  for valarrays and  for  combinations  of  a valarray and  its  scalar type.  A scalar type is treated as a valarray of the right size with every element having the scalar’s value.  For example:  void f valarray & v, valarray & v2, double d  {  valarray  v3 = v∗v2;  valarray  v4 = v∗d;  valarray  v5 = d∗v2;  valarray  v6 = cos v ;    v6[i] = cos v[i]  for all i     v3[i] = v[i]*v2[i] for all i     v5[i] = d*v2[i] for all i     v4[i] = v[i]*d for all i  }  These vector operations all apply their operations to each element of their operand s  in the way indicated by the ∗ and cos   examples.  Naturally, an operation can be used only if the correspond- ing operation is deﬁned for the scalar type. Otherwise, the compiler will issue an error when trying to specialize the operator or function.   Section 40.5.3  Operations   1171  Where the result is a valarray, its length is the same as its valarray operand.  If the lengths of the  two arrays are not the same, the result of a binary operator on two valarrays is undeﬁned.  These valarray operations return new valarrays rather than modifying their operands. This can  be expensive, but it doesn’t hav e to be when aggressive optimization techniques are applied.  For example, if v is a valarray, it can be scaled like this: v∗=0.2, and this: v =1.3. That is, apply- ing a scalar to a vector means applying the scalar to each element of the vector. As usual, ∗= is more concise than a combination of ∗ and =  §18.3.1  and easier to optimize.  Note that the non-assignment operations construct a new valarray. For example:  double incr double d  { return d+1; }  void f valarray & v  {  valarray  v2 = v.apply incr ;     ...     produce incremented valarray  This  does  not  change  the  value  of v. Unfortunately, apply   does  not  accept  a  function  object  §3.4.3, §11.4  as an argument.  The logical and cyclic shift functions, shift   and cshift  , return a new valarray with the elements suitably shifted and leave the original one unchanged. For example, the cyclic shift v2=v.cshift n  produces a valarray so that v2[i]==v[ i+n %v.siz e  ]. The logical shift v3=v.shift n  produces a valarray so that v3[i] is v[i+n] if i+n is a valid index for v. Otherwise, the result is the default element value. This implies that both shift   and cshift   shift left when given a positive argument and right when given a neg ative argument.  For example:  void f   {  int alpha[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ,6, 7, 8 }; valarray  v alpha,8 ; valarray  v2 = v.shift 2 ;  valarray  v3 = v<<2; valarray  v4 = v.shift −2 ;  valarray  v5 = v>>2; valarray  v6 = v.cshift 2 ;  valarray  v7 = v.cshift −2 ;      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 0    4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32    0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6    0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2    7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  For valarrays, >> and << are bit shift operators, rather than element shift operators or I O operators. Consequently,  >= can be used to shift bits within elements of an integral type. For exam- ple:  void f valarray  vi, valarray  vd  {  vi <<= 2; vd <<= 2;     vi[i]<<=2 for all elements of vi    error :shift is not deﬁned for ﬂoating-point values  All  of  the  operators  and  mathematical  functions  on valarrays can  also  be  applied  to slice_arrays  §40.5.2 ,  and  §40.5.5 ,   §40.5.6 , mask_arrays  indirect_arrays  gslice_arrays   §40.5.2 ,  }  }  }   1172  Numerics  Chapter 40  combinations of these types. However, an implementation is allowed to convert an operand that is not a valarray to a valarray before performing a required operation.  40.5.4  Slices A slice is an abstraction that allows us to manipulate a one-dimensional array  e.g., a built-in array, a vector, or a valarray  efﬁciently as a matrix of arbitrary dimension. It is the key notion of Fortran vectors and of the BLAS  Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms  library, which is the basis for much numeric computation. Basically, a slice is every nth element of some part of an array:  class std::slice {  public:     star tingindex, a length, and a stride  slice  ;  slice size_t star t, siz e_t siz e, siz e_t stride ;     slice{0,0,0}  size_t star t   const;  size_t siz e   const;  size_t stride   const;     indexofﬁrst element    number of elements    element n is at start  +n*str ide    A stride is the distance  in number of elements  between two elements of the slice. Thus, a slice describes  a  mapping  of  non-negative  integers  into  indices. The  number  of  elements   the size    doesn’t affect the mapping  addressing  but allows us to ﬁnd the end of a sequence. This mapping can be used to simulate two-dimensional arrays within a one-dimensional array  such as valarray  in an efﬁcient, general, and reasonably convenient way. Consider a 3-by-4 matrix  three rows, each with four elements :  };  };  valarray  v {  {00,01,02,03},  {10,11,12,13},  {20,21,22,23}      row0    row1    row2  or graphically:  00 01 02 03 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23  Following the usual C C++ conventions, the valarray is laid out in memory with row elements ﬁrst  row-major order  and contiguous:  for  int x : v  cout << x << ' ' ;  This produces:  0 1 2 3 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23   Section 40.5.4  or graphically:  Slices   1173  column 0:  row 0:  4  0 00 01 02 03 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23 0  1 2 3  8  Row x is described by slice x∗4,4,1 . That is, the ﬁrst element of row x is the x∗4th element of the vector, the next element of the row is the  x∗4+1 th, etc., and there are 4 elements in each row.  For example, slice{0,4,1} describes the ﬁrst row of v  row 0 : 00, 01, 02, 03, and slice{1,4,1} describes the second row  row 1 .  Column y is described by slice y,3,4 . That is, the ﬁrst element of column y is the yth element of the vector, the next element of the column is the  y+4 th, etc., and there are 3 elements in each col- umn.  For  example, slice{0,3,4} describes  the  ﬁrst  column   column 0 : 00, 10, 20, and slice{1,3,4} describes the second column  column 1 .  In  addition  to  its  use  for  simulating  two-dimensional  arrays,  a slice can  describe  many other sequences.  It is a fairly general way of specifying very simple sequences. This notion is explored further in §40.5.6.  One  way  of  thinking  of  a  slice  is  as  an  odd  kind  of  iterator:  a slice allows  us  to  describe  a  sequence of indices for a valarray. We could build an STL-style iterator based on that:  template  class Slice_iter {  valarray ∗ v; slice s; size_t curr;      indexofcurrent element  T& ref size_t i  const { return  ∗v [s.start  +i∗s.stride  ]; }  public:  Slice_iter valarray ∗ vv, slice ss, size_t pos =0   :v{vv}, s{ss}, curr{0} { }  Slice_iter end   const { return {this,s,s.size  }; }  Slice_iter& operator++   { ++curr; return ∗this; } Slice_iter operator++ int  { Slice_iter t = ∗this; ++curr; return t; }  T& operator[] size_t i  { return ref i ; } T& operator   size_t i  { return ref i ; } T& operator∗   { return ref curr ; }     C-style subscript    Fortran-style subscript    current element  bool operator== const Slice_iter& q  const {  return curr==q.curr && s.stride  ==q.s.stride   && s.start  ==q.s.star t  ;  }   1174  Numerics  Chapter 40  bool operator!= const Slice_iter& q   const {  return ! ∗this==q ;  bool operator< const Slice_iter& q  const {  return curr<q.curr && s.stride  ==q.s.stride   && s.start  ==q.s.star t  ;  }  }  };  Since a slice has a size, we could even provide range checking. Here, I have  taken advantage of slice::size   to provide an end   operation to provide an iterator for the one-past-the-end element of the slice.  Since a slice can describe either a row or a column, the Slice_iter allows us to traverse a valarray  by row or by column.  40.5.5 slice_array From a valarray and a slice, we can build something that looks and feels like a valarray but is really simply a way of referring to the subset of the array described by the slice.  slice_array   §iso.26.6.5   slice_array sa {sa2}; sa=sa2  sa=va sa=v sa@=va  Copy constructor: sa refers to the same elements as sa2 does Assign the element referred to by sa[i] to each corresponding element referred to by sa2[i] Assign va[i] to each corresponsing element referred to by sa[i] Assign v to each element referred to by sa sa[i]@=va[i] for each element of sa; @ can be  , %, +, −, ˆ, &, ,  >  A user  cannot  directly  create  a slice_array. Instead,  the  user  subscripts  a valarray to  create  a slice_array for a given slice.  Once the slice_array is initialized, all references to it indirectly go to the valarray for which it is created. For example, we can create something that represents every sec- ond element of an array like this:  void f valarray & d  {  slice_array & v_even = d[slice 0,d.size   2+d.siz e  %2,2 ]; slice_array & v_odd = d[slice 1,d.siz e   2,2 ];  v_even ∗= v_odd;  v_odd = 0;     multiply element pairs and store results in evenelements    assign 0 to every odd element of d  }  A slice_array can be copied. For example:   Section 40.5.5  slice_array  1175  slice_array  row valarray & d, int i  {  slice_array  v = d[slice 0,2,d.size   2 ];    ... return d[slice i%2,i,d.size   2 ];  40.5.6  Generalized Slices A slice  §29.2.2,  §40.5.4   can  describe  a  row or a column  of  an n-dimensional  array. Howev er, sometimes  we  need  to  extract  a  subarray  that  is  not  a  row or a column.  For  example,  we  might want to extract the 3-by-2 matrix from the top-left corner of a 4-by-3 matrix:  00 01 02 10 11 12 20 21 22 30 31 32  Unfortunately, these elements are not allocated in a way that can be described by a single slice:  subarray:  1  0 00 01 02 10 11 12 20 21 22 30 31 32  4 5  2 3  A gslice is a ‘‘generalized slice’’ that contains  almost  the information from n slices:  class std::gslice {  public:     instead of 1 stride and one sizelikeslice,gslice holds n strides and n sizes  gslice  ; gslice size_t sz, const valarray & lengths, const valarray & strides ;  size_t star t   const;  valarray  siz e   const;  valarray  stride   const;     indexofﬁrst element    number of elements in dimension    strideforindex[0], index[1], ...  The extra values allow a gslice to specify a mapping between n integers and an index to be used to address elements of an array. For example, we can describe the layout of the 3-by-2 matrix by a pair of  length,stride  pairs:  size_t gslice_index const gslice& s, size_t i, size_t j  {  return s.start  +i∗s.stride  [0]+j∗s.stride  [1];     max  i,j  to their corresponding index  }  };  }   1176  Numerics  Chapter 40  valarray  lengths {2,3};   2elements in the ﬁrst dimension  valarray  strides {3,1};    3isthe stride for the ﬁrst index     1isthe stride for the second index     3elements in the second dimension  void f   {  gslice s 0,lengths,strides ;  for  int i=0; i<3; ++i      foreach row  for  int j=0; j<2; ++j     foreach element in row  cout  " << gslice_index s,i,j  << "; ";     printmapping  }  }  This prints:   0,0 −>0;  0,1 −>1;  1,0 −>3;  1,1 −>4;  2,0 −>6;  2,1 −>7  In this way, a gslice with two  length,stride  pairs describes a subarray of a two-dimensional array, a gslice with  three   length,stride   pairs  describes  a  subarray  of  a  three-dimensional  array, etc. Using a gslice as the index of a valarray yields a gslice_array consisting of the elements described by the gslice. For example:  void f valarray & v  {  gslice m 0,lengths,strides ; v[m] = 0;     assign 0 to v[0],v[1],v[3],v[4],v[6],v[7]  The gslice_array offers the same set of members as slice_array  §40.5.5 .  A gslice_array is the result of using a gslice as the subscript of a valarray  §40.5.2 .  40.6  Generalized Numerical Algorithms In  , the standard library provides a few generalized numeric algorithms in the style of the non-numeric algorithms from    Chapter 32 .

These algorithms generalize common operations such as computing a sum by letting them apply to all  kinds  of  sequences  and  by  making  the  operation  applied  to  elements  of  those  sequences  a parameter. For each algorithm, the general version is supplemented by a version applying the most common operator for that algorithm.  40.6.1 accumulate   The simple version of accumulate   adds elements of a sequence using their + operator:  template  T accumulate In ﬁrst, In last, T init  {  for  ; ﬁrst!=last; ++ﬁrst   init = init + ∗ﬁrst;      forall elements in [ﬁrst:last     plus  return init;  It can be used like this:  void f vector & price, list & incr  {  int i = accumulate price .begin  ,price.end  ,0 ; double d = 0; d = accumulate incr.begin  ,incr.end  ,d ;      accumulate in int     accumulate in double  int prod = accumulate price .begin,price.end  ,1,[] int a, int b  { return a∗b; } ;    ...  The type of the initial value passed determines the return type.  We  can  provide  an  initial  value  and  an  operation  for  ‘‘combining  elements’’ as arguments  to  accumulate  , so accumulate   is not all about addition.  Extracting a value from a data structure is common operation for accumulate  . For example:  struct Record {     ... int unit_price; int number_of_units;  }  }  };   1178  Numerics  Chapter 40  long price long val, const Record& r  {  return val + r.unit_price ∗ r.number_of_units;  void f const vector & v  {  cout << "Total value: " << accumulate v.begin  ,v.end  ,0,price  << '\n';  Operations similar to accumulate are called reduce, reduction, and fold in some communities.  40.6.2 inner_product   Accumulating from a sequence is very common, and accumulating from a pair of sequences is not uncommon:  template  T inner_product In ﬁrst, In last, In2 ﬁrst2, T init  {  while  ﬁrst != last   init = init + ∗ﬁrst++ ∗ ∗ﬁrst2++;  return init;  template  T inner_product In ﬁrst, In last, In2 ﬁrst2, T init, BinOp op, BinOp2 op2  {  while  ﬁrst != last   init = op init,op2 ∗ﬁrst++,∗ﬁrst2++  ;  return init;  As usual, only the beginning of the second input sequence is passed as an argument.  The second input sequence is assumed to be at least as long as the ﬁrst.  The key operation in multiplying a Matrix by a valarray is an inner_product: valarray  operator∗ const Matrix& m, valarray & v  {  valarray  res m.dim2   ;  for  siz e_t i = 0; i<m.dim2  ; i++  {  auto& ri = m.row i ; res[i] = inner_product ri,ri.end  ,&v[0],double 0  ;  } return res;  }  }  }  }  }   Section 40.6.2  inner_product    1179  valarray  operator∗ valarray & v, const Matrix& m  {  valarray  res m.dim1   ;  for  siz e_t i = 0; i<m.dim1  ; i++  {  auto& ci = m.column i ; res[i] = inner_product ci,ci.end  ,&v[0],double 0  ;  } return res;  Some forms of inner_product are referred to as ‘‘dot product.’’  40.6.3 partial_sum   and adjacent_difference   The partial_sum   and adjacent_difference   algorithms are inverses of each other and deal with the notion of incremental change.  Given a sequence a, b, c, d, etc., adjacent_difference   produces a, b−a, c−b, d−c, etc. Consider a vector of temperature readings. We  could transform it into a vector of temperature  adjacent_difference temps.begin  ,temps.end  ,temps.begin   ;  For example, 17, 19, 20, 20, 17 turns into 17, 2, 1, 0, −3.  Conversely, partial_sum   allows us to compute the end result of a set of incremental changes:  template  Out partial_sum In ﬁrst, In last, Out res, BinOp op  {  }  }  }  }  changes like this:  vector  temps;  void f   {  if  ﬁrst==last  return res; ∗res = ∗ﬁrst; T val =∗ﬁrst; while  ++ﬁrst != last  {  val = op val,∗ﬁrst ; ∗++res = val;  } return ++res;  template  Out partial_sum In ﬁrst, In last, Out res  {  return partial_sum ﬁrst,last,res,plus ;      use std::plus  §33.4    1180  Numerics  Chapter 40  Given a sequence a, b, c, d, etc., partial_sum   produces a, a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c+d, etc.  For example:  void f   {  }  partial_sum temps.begin  ,temps.end  ,temps.begin   ;  Note the way partial_sum   increments res before assigning a new value through it. This allows res to be the same sequence as the input; adjacent_difference   behaves similarly. Thus,  partial_sum v.begin  ,v.end  ,v.begin   ;  turns the sequence a, b, c, d into a, a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c+d, and  adjacent_difference v.begin  ,v.end  ,v.begin   ;  reproduces the original value.  Thus, partial_sum   turns 17, 2, 1, 0, −3 back into 17, 19, 20, 20, 17.  For people who think of temperature differences as a boring detail of meteorology or science lab  experiments,  I  note  that  analyzing  changes  in  stock  prices  or  sea  levels  involves  exactly  the same two operations.  These operations are useful for analyzing any series of changes.  40.6.4 iota   A call iota b,e,n  assigns n+i to the ith element of [b:e .  For example:  vector  v 5 ; iota v.begin  ,v.end  ,50 ; vector  v2 {50,51,52,53,54}  if  v!=v2   error "complain to your library vendor" ;  The name iota is the Latin spelling of the Greek letter ι, which was used for that function in APL. Do not confuse iota   with the non-standard, but not uncommon, itoa    int-to-alpha; §12.2.4 .  40.7  Random Numbers Random numbers are essential to many applications, such as simulations, games, sampling-based algorithms, cryptography,  and testing. For example, we might want to choose the TCP IP address for a router simulation, decide whether a monster should attack or scratch its head, or generate a set of values for testing a square root function. In  , the standard library deﬁnes facilities for generating   pseudo- random  numbers. These  random  numbers  are  sequences  of  values  produced according to mathematical formulas, rather than unguessable  ‘‘truly random’’  numbers that could be obtained from a physical process, such as radioactive decay or solar radiation. If the implemen- tation has such a truly random device, it will be represented as a random_device  §40.7.1 .  Four kinds of entities are provided:  cid:129  A uniform random number generator is a function object returning unsigned integer values such that each value in the range of possible results has  ideally  equal probability of being returned.   Section 40.7  Random Numbers  1181   cid:129  A random  number  engine  an  engine   is  a  uniform  random  number  generator  that  can  be  created with a default state E{} or with a state determined by a seed E{s}.   cid:129  A random number engine adaptor  an adaptor  is a random number engine that takes values produced by some other random number engine and applies an algorithm to those values in order to deliver a sequence of values with different randomness properties.   cid:129  A random number distribution  a distribution  is a function object returning values that are distributed  according  to  an  associated  mathematical  probability  density  function p z  or according to an associated discrete probability function P zi .  For details see §iso.26.5.1.  In simpler terms, the users’ terms, a random number generator is an engine plus a distribution. The engine produces a uniformly distributed sequence of values, and the distribution bends those into the desired shape  distribution .  That is, if you take lots of numbers from a random number generator  and  draw them,  you  should  get  a  reasonably  smooth  graph  of  their  distribution.  For example,  binding  a normal_distribution to  the default_random_engine gives me a random  number generator that produces a normal distribution:  auto gen = bind normal_distribution {15,4.0},default_random_engine{} ;  for  int i=0; i<500; ++i  cout << gen  ;  The standard-library function bind   makes a function object that will invoke its ﬁrst argument given its second argument  §33.5.1 .  Using ASCII graphics  §5.6.3 , I got:  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27  ∗∗ ∗ ∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗ ∗ ∗   1182  Numerics  Chapter 40  Most of the time, most programmers just need a simple uniform distribution of integers or ﬂoating- point numbers in a given range.  For example:  void test   {  Rand_int ri {10,20}; Rand_double rd {0,0.5};     unifor mdistr ibution of doubles in [0:0.5      unifor mdistr ibution of ints in [10:20   for  int i=0; i<100; ++i  cout << ri   << ' '; for  int i=0; i<100; ++i  cout << rd   << ' ';  }  };  Unfortunately, Ran_int and Rand_double are not standard classes, but they are easy to build:  class Rand_int {  Rand_int int lo, int hi  : p{lo,hi} { } int operator     const { return r  ; }  private:     store the parameters  uniform_int_distribution ::param_type p; auto r = bind uniform_int_distribution {p},default_random_engine{} ;  I store the parameters using the distribution’s standard param_type alias  §40.7.3  so that I can use auto to avoid having to name the result of the bind  .  Just for variation, I use a different technique for Rand_double:  Rand_double double low, double high   :r bind uniform_real_distribution  low,high ,default_random_engine     { }  class Rand_double { public:  double operator     { return r  ; }  private:  };  function  r;  One important use of random numbers is for sampling algorithms. In such algorithms we need to choose a sample of some size from a much larger population. Here is algorithm R  the simplest algorithm  from a famous old paper [Vitter,1985]:  template  Out random_sample Iter ﬁrst, Iter last, Out result, Size n, Gen&& gen  {  using Dist = uniform_int_distribution ; using Param = typename Dist::param_type;     Fill the reservoir and advance ﬁrst: copy ﬁrst,n,result ; advance ﬁrst,n ;   Section 40.7  Random Numbers  1183     Sample the remaining values in [ﬁrst+n:last  byselecting a random    number r in the range [0:k], and, if r<n, replace it.    kincreases with each iteration, making the probability smaller.    Forrandom access iterators,k=i-ﬁrst  assuming weincrement i and not ﬁrst .

A seed sequence, g, is an object  that  provides  a  function g.generate b,e  that  when  called  ﬁlls  [b:e  with newly generated seeds  §iso.26.5.1.2 .   1184  Numerics  Chapter 40  Standard Random Number Engines  §iso.26.5.3   default_random_engine  linear_congruential_engine  mersenne_twister_engine  subtract_with_carry_engine   An alias for an engine with wide applicability and low cost xi+1 =  axi + c  mod  m §iso.26.5.3.2 xi+1 =  axi  mod  b where b = mr − ms + 1 and a = b −  b − 1   m  The UI parameter for a standard random number engine must be an unsigned integer type. For lin- ear_congruential_engine , numeric_lim- its ::max  +1 is used. For example, this writes out the index of the ﬁrst repetition of a number:  the  modulus m is  the  value  0,  if  map  m; linear_congruential_engine  linc_eng; for  int i=0; i<1000000; ++i   if  1<++m[linc_eng  ]  cout << i << '\n';  I was  lucky;  the  parameters  were  not  too  bad  and  I  got  no  duplicate  values.  Try <unsigned int,16,5,0> instead  and  see  the  difference.  Use the default_random_engine unless  you  have  a  real need and know what you are doing.  A random number engine adaptor takes a random number engine as an argument and produces  a new random number engine with different randomness properties.

The entropy   is deﬁned as  S P0, . . . , Pn−1  = − i=n−1  Σ Pi log Pi i=0  for a device with n states whose respective probabilities are P0, . . . , Pn−1. The entropy is an esti- mate of the randomness, the degree of unpredictability, of the generated numbers. In contrast to thermodynamics, high entropy is good for random numbers because that means that it is hard to guess subsequent numbers. The formula reﬂects the result of repeatedly throwing a perfect n-sided dice.  The random_device is  intended  to  be  useful  for  cryptograpic  applications,  but  it  would  be against  all  rules  of  that  kind  of  application  to  trust  an  implementation  of random_device without ﬁrst studying it closely.  40.7.3  Distributions A random number distribution is a function object that, when called with a random number genera- tor argument, produces a sequence of values of its result_type:  Random Number Distribution D  §iso.26.5.1.6   continues   D::result_type D::param_type D d {}; D d {p};  The type of an element of D The type of the set of arguments needed to construct a D Default constructor Construct from param_type p   1186  Numerics  Chapter 40  Random Number Distribution D  continued   §iso.26.5.1.6   d.reset   p=d.param    d.param p  x=d g   x=d g,p   x=d.min    x=d.max    d==d2 d!=d2  os<<d is>>d  Reset to default state p is d’s parameters of param_type Reset to the state determined by param_type p x is a value produced by d given the generator g x is a value produced by d given the generator g and the parameters p x is the smallest value that d can return x is the largest value that d can return Will d and d2 produce identical sequences of elements? ! d==d2  Write d’s state to os so that it can be read back by >> Read a state previously written by << from is into d  In the following tables, a template argument R means a real is required in the mathematical formula and double is the default.  An I means that an integer is required and int is the default.

For example:  uniform_int_distribution  uid1 {1,100}; uniform_int_distribution  uid2 {100,1};     OK    error :a>b  The default ﬁeld speciﬁes default arguments.  For example:  uniform_real_distribution  urd1 {}; uniform_real_distribution  urd2 {10,20}; uniform_real_distribution  urd3 {};     use a==0.0 and b==1.0    use a==10.0 and b==20.0    use double and a==0.0 and b==1.0  The result ﬁeld speciﬁes the range of the results.

A call srand s  starts a new sequence of random numbers from the seed, s, giv en as argument. For debugging,  it  is  often  important  that  a  sequence  of  random  numbers  from  a  given seed  be repeatable.  However, we often want to start each real run with a new seed.  In fact, to make games unpredictable, it is often useful to pick a seed from the environment of a program. For such pro- grams, some bits from a real-time clock often make a good seed.   1190  Numerics  Chapter 40  40.8  Advice [1]  Numerical problems  are  often  subtle.

The  C++  standard  support  for  concurrency is introduced  in  a  tutorial  manner  in  §5.3. This  chapter and the next provide a more detailed and systematic view.  We call an activity potentially executed concurrently with other activities a task. A thread is the system-level representation  of  a  computer’s facilities  for  executing  a  task. A standard-library thread  §42.2  can execute a task. A thread may share an address space with other threads. That is, all  threads  in  a  single  address  space  can  access  the  same  memory  locations. One  of  the  central challenges of the programmer of a concurrent system is to make sure that threads access memory in a sensible manner.  The standard library’s support for concurrency includes:   1192  Concurrency   Chapter 41   cid:129  A memory model: a set of guarantees for concurrent access to memory  §41.2  that basically  ensures that simple and ordinary access works as one would naively expect   cid:129  Support  for programming  without  locks: ﬁne-grained  low-level mechanisms  for  avoiding  data races  §41.3    cid:129  A thread library: a set of components supporting traditional threads-and-locks-style system-  level concurrent programming, such as thread, condition_variable , and mutex  §42.2    cid:129  A task support library: a few facilities supporting task-level concurrent programming: future,  promise, packaged_task, and async    §42.4   These topics are ordered from the most fundamental and low-level to the highest-level.  The mem- ory model is common to all programming. For programmer productivity and error minimization, work at the highest feasible level.  For example, prefer a future over a mutex for exchanging infor- mation and a mutex over an atomic for anything but simple counters and the like.  Leave the com- plexities to standard-library implementers whenever feasible.  In the context of the C++ standard library, a lock is a mutex  a mutual exclusion variable  and any abstraction built upon a mutex to provide mutually exclusive access to a resource or to synchro- nize the progress of several concurrent tasks.  The topic of processes, that is, threads of execution in their own address spaces and communi- cating though inter-process communication mechanisms [Tanenbaum,2007], is not addressed in this book.  I suspect  that  after  reading  about  the  problems  with  and  techniques  for  managing  shared data, you may become sympathetic to my view that explicitly shared data is best avoided.  Natu- rally, communication implies some form of sharing, but that sharing most often need not be directly managed by the application programmer.  Please also note that as long as you don’t pass pointers to your local data to other threads, your  local data is free of the problems mentioned here. This is yet another reason to avoid global data.  This  chapter  is  not  a  comprehensive  guide  to  concurrent  programming  or  even a complete  explanation of the C++ standard-library facilities for concurrent programming. It provides:   cid:129  A basic description of the problems facing a programmer who has to deal with concurrency  at the system level   cid:129  A fairly detailed overview of the concurrency facilities provided by the standard  cid:129  An introduction to the basic uses of the standard-library concurrency features at the threads-  and-locks level and above  It does not:   cid:129  Go into details of the relaxed memory models or lock-free programming  cid:129  Teach advanced concurrent programming and design techniques  Concurrent  and  parallel  programming  have  been  popular  topics  of  research  and  widely  used  for more than 40 years, so there is an extensive specialized literature  for example, for C++-based con- currency see  [Wilson,1996] .  In particular, just  about  any presentation  of  POSIX  threads  can  be used  as  a  source  of  examples  that  can  be  easily  improved by using  the  standard-library  facilities described here.  In contrast to the C-style POSIX facilities and to many older C++ thread-support libraries, the standard-library  thread  support  is  type-safe. There  is  no  longer  any reason  to  mess  around  with macros or void∗∗s to pass information among threads. Similarly, we can deﬁne tasks as function objects  e.g., lambdas  and pass them to threads without using casts or worrying about type viola- tions.  Furthermore, there is no reason to invent elaborate conventions for reporting errors from one   Section 41.1  Introduction   1193  thread to another; futures  §5.3.5.1, §42.4.4  can transmit exceptions.  Given that concurrent soft- ware is often complex and that code running in different threads is often separately developed, I consider type safety and a standard  preferably exception-based  error-handling strategy even more important than for single-threaded software.  The standard-library thread support also greatly sim- pliﬁes notation.  41.2  Memory Model The  C++  concurrency mechanisms  are  mostly  supplied  as  standard-library  components. These components rely on a set of language guarantees known as the memory model. A memory model is the result of discussions between machine architects and compiler writers about how best to repre- sent computer hardware. The memory model, as speciﬁed in the ISO C++ standard, represents a contract between the implementers and the programmers to ensure that most programmers do not have to think about the details of modern computer hardware.  To  understand the problems involved, keep one simple fact in mind: operations on an object in memory are never directly performed on the object in memory. Instead, the object is loaded into a processor  register, modiﬁed  there,  and  then  written  back. Worse  still,  an  object  is  typically  ﬁrst loaded from the main memory into a cache memory and from there to a register. For example, con- sider incrementing a simple integer x:     add one to x:  load x into cache element Cx load Cx into register Rx Rx=Rx+1; store Rx back into Cx store Cx back into x  Memory  can  be  shared  by  several  threads,  and  cache  memory  may   depending  on  the  machine architecture  be shared among threads running on the same or different ‘‘processing units’’  usually called something like processors, cores, orhyper-threads; this is an area of rapid evolution of both system facilities and terminology . This opens a host of opportunities for a simple operation  such as ‘‘add one to x’’  to get corrupted. It will be obvious to machine architecture experts that I am simplifying.  For the few who notice that I have not mentioned store buffers, I recommend Appen- dix C of [McKenney,2012].  41.2.1  Memory Location Consider two global variables b and c:     thread 1:     thread 2:  char c = 0; void f   {  c = 1; int x = c;  }  char b = 0; void g   {  b = 1; int y = b;  }  Now, x==1 and y==1 as anyone would expect.  Why is this even worth saying? Consider what might   1194  Concurrency   Chapter 41  happen if a linker allocated c and b in the same word in memory and  like most modern hardware  the machine could not load or store anything smaller than a word:  word:  c  b  Without a well-deﬁned and reasonable memory model, thread 1 might read the word containing b and c, change c, and write the word back into memory. At the same time, thread 2 could do the same with b. Then, whichever thread managed to read the word ﬁrst and whichever thread man- aged to write its result back into memory last would determine the result. We  might get 10, 01, or 11  but not 00 .  The memory model saves us from such chaos; we get 11. The reason that 00 can- not happen is that the initializations of b and c are done  by the compiler or the linker  before either thread starts.  The C++ memory model guarantees that two threads of execution can update and access sepa- rate memory locations without interfering with each other. This is exactly what we would naively expect.  It is the compiler’s job to protect us from the sometimes very strange and subtle behaviors of modern hardware.  How a compiler and hardware combination achieves that is up to the com- piler. We program a ‘‘machine’’ that is provided by a combination of hardware and very low-level  compiler-generated  software.  Bit-ﬁelds   §8.2.7   give  access  to  parts  of  a  word.  If two threads  simultaneously  access  two ﬁelds of the same word, all bets are off.  If b and c are two ﬁelds of the same word, most hardware has no way of avoiding the problem  the race condition  from the b-and-c example without using some form of  potentially very expensive  locking.  Lock and unlock operations are not a cost we could implicitly impose on bit-ﬁelds, which are commonly used in critical device drivers.  Conse- quently, the language deﬁnes memory location as the unit of memory for which sensible behavior is guaranteed to exclude individual bit-ﬁelds.  A memory  location is  either  an  object  of  arithmetic  type   §6.2.1 ,  a  pointer, or a maximal  sequence of adjacent bit-ﬁelds all having nonzero width. For example:  struct S {  };     location 1    location 2  char a; int b:5; unsigned c:11;    note: :0 is ‘‘special’’ §8.2.7  unsigned :0; unsigned d:8;    location 3 struct { int ee:8; } e;    location 4  Here, S has  exactly  four  separate  memory  locations. Don’t try  to  update  bit-ﬁelds b and c from separate threads without explicit synchronization.  From  the  explanation  above, you  might  conclude  that  if x and y are  of  the  same  type, x=y is guaranteed to result in x being a copy of y. This is true if and only if you don’t hav e a data race  §41.2.4  and if x and y are memory locations. However, if x and y are of a multiword struct they are not a single memory location, and if you have a data race, all behavior is undeﬁned, so make sure you have proper synchronization in place if you share data  §41.3, §42.3.1 .   Section 41.2.2  Instruction Reordering  1195  41.2.2  Instruction Reordering To gain performance, compilers, optimizers, and hardware reorder instructions. Consider:  x = initializ e  ;    no use of x_init in initialize   x_init = true;    ...  For this piece of code there is no stated reason to assign to x before assigning to x_init. The opti- mizer   or  the  hardware  instruction  scheduler   may  decide  to  speed  up  the  program  by  executing x_init=true ﬁrst.  We  probably  meant  for x_init to  indicate  whether x had  been  initialized  by initializer   or  not.  However, we did not say that, so the hardware, the compiler, and the optimizer do not know that.  Add another thread to the program:     thread 1: int x; bool x_init;  void init   {  }  }     thread 2:  extern int x; extern bool x_init;  void f2   {  int y; while  !x_init   y = x;    ...  this_thread::sleep_for milliseconds{10} ;     if necessary, wait for initialization to complete  Now we hav e a problem: thread 2 may never wait and thus will assign an uninitialized x to y.  Even if thread 1 did not set x_init and x in ‘‘the wrong order,’’ we still may have a problem.  In thread  2,  there  are  no  assignments  to x_init, so an optimizer  may  decide  to  lift  the  evaluation  of !x_init out of the loop, so that thread 2 either never sleeps or sleeps forever.  41.2.3  Memory Order The time needed to get the value of a word from memory into a cache, then into a register, can be  on a processor’s time scale  very long. At best, maybe 500 instructions are executed before the value reaches the register, and another 500 instructions are executed before a new value reaches its intended location. The ﬁgure 500 is a guess that depends on machine architecture and varies over time, but for the last decades it has steadily increased. When there is no rush to load and store a particular value because the computation is optimized for throughput, the time taken can be much higher. A value can be ‘‘away from its location’’ for tens of thousands of instruction cycles.  This is  one  of  the  facts  that  give  modern  hardware  its  amazing  performance,  but  it  also  opens  huge   1196  Concurrency   Chapter 41  opportunities for confusion as different threads look at a value at different times and in different places  in  the  memory  hierarchy.  For  example,  my  simpliﬁed  description  mentions  only  a  single cache; many popular architectures use a three-level cache.  To illustrate, here is a diagram of a pos- sible two-level cache architecture where each core has its own level-2 cache, a pair of cores share a level-1 cache, and all cores share the memory:  core 1  cache 2.1  core 2  cache 2.2  cache 1.1  core 3  cache 2.3  core 4  cache 2.4  cache 1.2  memory  Memory ordering is the term used to describe what a programmer can assume about what a thread sees when it looks at a value from memory. The simplest memory order is called sequentially con- sistent. In a sequentially consistent memory model, every thread sees the effects of every operation done in the same order. The order is as if the instructions were done sequentially in a single thread. A thread can still reorder operations, but at every point where another thread might observe a vari- able,  the  set  of  operations  performed  before  and   therefore   the  value  of  the  memory  location observed must be well deﬁned and the same for all threads. An operation that ‘‘observes’’ a value and  thereby  forces  a  consistent  view of a memory  location  is  called  an atomic  operation  see §41.3 .  A simple read or write does not impose an order.  There are many possible sequentially consistent orders for a given set of threads. Consider:     thread 1:     thread 2:  char c = 0; extern char b; void f1   {  c = 1; int x = b;  }  char b = 0; extern char c; void f2   {  b = 1; int y = c;  }  c = 1; x = b; b = 1; y = c;  b = 1; y = c; c = 1; x = b;  c = 1; b = 1; x = b; y = c;  Assuming  that  the  initialization  of c and b is  done  statically   before  any thread  starts ,  there  are three possible executions:  The results are 01, 10, and 11, respectively. The only result we cannot get is 00. Obviously, to get a predictable result, you need some form of synchronization of the access to the shared variables.  The sequential consistent order is just about all a programmer can effectively reason about, but on some machine architectures it imposes signiﬁcant synchronization costs that can be eliminated by relaxing the rules. For example, two threads running on separate cores might decide to initiate the reads of x and y before the writes of a and b or at least before the writes had completed. That could give the nonsequentially consistent result 00. More relaxed memory models allow that.   Section 41.2.4  Data Races  1197  41.2.4  Data Races From  these  examples,  every  sensible  person  will  conclude  that  we  have  to be very  careful  when programming threads. But how?  First, we must avoid data races. Two threads have a data race if both can access a memory location  as deﬁned in §41.2.1  simultaneously and at least one of their accesses  is  a  write. Note  that  deﬁning  ‘‘simultaneously’’ precisely  is  not  trivial.  If two threads have a data race, no language guarantees hold: the behavior is undeﬁned. This may sound drastic, but the effects of a data race can  as shown in §41.2.2  be drastic. An optimizer  or a hardware instruction scheduler  may reorder code based on assumptions about values and may execute sec- tions of code  affecting apparently unrelated data  or not based on such assumptions.  There are many ways of avoiding data races:  cid:129  Use only a single thread. That eliminates the beneﬁts of concurrency  unless you use pro-  cesses or co-routines .   cid:129  Put  a  lock  on  every  data  item  that  might  conceivably  be  subject  to  a  data  race. That  can eliminate the beneﬁts of concurrency almost as effectively as single threading because we easily  get  into  a  situation  where  all  but  one  thread  waits.  Worse  still,  heavy  use  of  locks increases the chances of deadlock, where a thread waits for another forever, and other lock- ing problems.   cid:129  Try to look carefully at the code and avoid data races by selectively adding locks. This may  be the currently most popular approach, but it is error-prone.   cid:129  Hav e a program  detect  all  data  races  and  either  report  them  for  the  programmer  to  ﬁx  or automatically insert locks. Programs that can do that for programs of commercial size and complexity are not common. Programs that can do that and also guarantee the absence of deadlocks are still research projects.   cid:129  Design the code so that threads communicate only through simple put-and-get-style inter- faces  that  do  not  require  two threads  to  directly  manipulate  a  single  memory  location  §5.3.5.1, §42.4 .   cid:129  Use a higher-level library or tool that makes data sharing and or concurrency implicit or suf- ﬁciently stylized to make sharing manageable. Examples include parallel implementations of algorithms in a library, directive-based tools  e.g., OpenMP , and transactional memory  often abbreviated to TM .  One way of looking at the rest of this chapter is as a bottom-up approach to arrive at support for one variant of that last style of programming. In the process, we encounter the tools needed to sup- port just about every way of avoiding data races.  Why must programmers suffer all this complexity?  An alternative would be to provide only a simple, sequentially consistent model with minimal  or no  opportunities for data races. I can offer two reasons:  [1]  That is not the way the world is. The complexities of machine architectures are real, and a systems programming language, such as C++, must provide the tools for programmers to live  with them. Maybe someday machine architects will deliver simpler alternatives, but for now someone must deal with a bewildering variety of low-level facilities provided by machine architects to deliver the performance that their customers demand.  [2]  We  the  C++  standards  committee   seriously  considered  that. We  would  have  liked  to provide  a  memory  model  that  was  an  improved version  of  what  Java  and  C  provide.   1198  Concurrency   Chapter 41  That would have sav ed a lot of work for the committee and for some programmers. How- ev er,  this  idea  was  effectively  vetoed  by  the  providers  of  operating  systems  and  virtual machines: they insisted that they needed roughly what was then provided by the various C++  implementations  –  what  is  now provided  by  the  C++  standard. The  alternative would be for your operating systems and your virtual machines to slow down ‘‘by a factor of two or more.’’  I guess that programming language fanatics might have welcomed an opportunity to simplify C++ at the expense of other languages, but doing so would have been neither practical nor professional.  Fortunately, most  programmers  never hav e to  work  directly  at  the  lowest  level of the  hardware. Most programmers do not need to understand a memory model at all and can think of reordering problems as amusing curiosities:  Write data-race-free code and don’t mess with memory order  §41.3 ; then the memory model guarantees that code executes as naively expected.  It’s even better than sequential consistency. I ﬁnd machine architecture a fascinating topic  e.g., see [Hennesey,2011] [McKenney,2012] , but as sensible and productive programmers, we stay away from the lowest levels of software whenever we can. Leave those for the experts and enjoy the higher levels that those experts provide for you.  41.3  Atomics Lock-free  programming  is  a  set  of  techniques  for  writing  concurrent  programs  without  using explicit locks. Instead, the programmer relies on primitive operations  directly supported by hard- ware   to  avoid  data  races   §41.2.4   for  small  objects   typically  a  single  word  or  a  double  word . Primitive operations that do not suffer data races, often called atomic operations, can then be used in the implementation of higher-level concurrency mechanisms, such as locks, threads, and lock- free data structures.  With the notable exception of simple atomic counters, lock-free programming is for specialists. In  addition  to  an  understanding  of  language  mechanisms,  a  detailed  understanding  of  speciﬁc machine  architectures  and  a  knowledge  of  somewhat  specialized  implementation  techniques  are needed.  Do not try lock-free programming with only the information provided here. The primary logical advantage of lock-free techniques over lock-based techniques is that classical locking prob- lems, such as deadlock and starvation, cannot happen. For each atomic operation, it is guaranteed that every thread will eventually  and typically soon  make progress even if other threads compete for  access  to  an  atomic  object. In  addition,  lock-free  techniques  can  be  signiﬁcantly  faster  than lock-based alternatives.  The standard atomic types and operations provide a portable alternative to traditional ways of expressing lock-free code. Those typically either rely on assembly code or system-speciﬁc primi- tives.  In this sense, the standard support for atomics is another step in C and C++’s long tradition of increasing portable and relatively comprehensible support for systems programming.  A synchronization  operation  is  something  that  determines  when  a  thread  sees  the  effects  of another thread; it determines what is considered to have happened before something else. Between synchronization  operations  a  compiler  and  a  processor  are  free  to  reorder  code  as  long  as  the semantic  rules  of  the  language  are  maintained. In  principle,  nobody  is  looking  and  all  that  is affected  is  performance. A synchronization  operation  on  one  or  more  memory  locations  is  a   Section 41.3  Atomics   1199  consume operation, an acquire operation, a release operation, or both an acquire and release opera- tion  §iso.1.10 .   cid:129  For an acquire operation, other processors will see its effect before any subsequent opera-   cid:129  For a release operation, other processors will see every preceding operation’s effect before  tion’s effect.  the effect of the operation itself.   cid:129  A consume operation is a weaker form of an acquire operation. For a consume operation, other  processors  will  see  its  effect  before  any subsequent  operation’s effect,  except  that effects  that  do  not  depend  on  the  consume  operation’s value  may  happen  before  the  con- sume operation.  An atomic operation ensures that the state of the memory is as required by the speciﬁed memory order   §41.2.2 . By  default,  the  memory  order  is memory_order_seq_cst  sequentially  consistent; §41.2.2 .  The standard memory orders are  §iso.29.3 :  enum memory_order {  memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_consume , memory_order_acquire , memory_order_release , memory_order_acq_rel, memory_order_seq_cst  };  The enumerations represent:     thread 1:     thread 2:  r1 = y.load memor y_order_relaxed ; x.store r1,memory_order_relaxed ;  r2 = x.load memory_order_relaxed ; y.store 42,memor y_order_relaxed ;  y.store 42,memor y_order_relaxed ; r1 = y.load memor y_order_relaxed ; x.store r1,memory_order_relaxed ; r2 = x.load memory_order_relaxed ;   cid:129  memory_order_relaxed: No operation orders memory.  cid:129  memory_order_release, memory_order_acq_rel, and memory_order_seq_cst: A store operation  performs a release operation on the affected memory location.   cid:129  memory_order_consume: A load  operation  performs  a  consume  operation  on  the  affected  memory location   cid:129  memory_order_acquire, memory_order_acq_rel, and memory_order_seq_cst: a  load  operation  performs an acquire operation on the affected memory location.  As  an  example,  consider   §iso.29.3   using atomic loads  and  stores   §41.3.1   to  express  a  relaxed memory order:  This is allowed to produce r2==42, making it appear that time went backward in thread 2. That is, memory_order_relaxed allows this execution order:   1200  Concurrency   Chapter 41  For explanations, see the specialist literature, for example, [Boehm,2008] and [Williams,2012].  It  is  entirely  architecture-speciﬁc  whether  a  given memory  order  makes  sense. Clearly, a relaxed memory model is not something to be directly used in applications programming. Utilizing a relaxed memory model is an even more specialized task than general lock-free programming. I see it as something done by a small subset of operating system kernel, device driver,  and virtual machine implementers. It can also be useful in machine-generated code  as gotos can be . If two threads  really  do  not  directly  share  data,  some  machine  architectures  deliver signiﬁcant  perfor- mance improvements through the use of a relaxed memory model at the cost of complexity in the implementation of message-passing primitives  e.g., future and promise; §42.4.4 .  To  allow signiﬁcant optimizations for architectures with relaxed memory models, the standard provides  an  attribute [[carries_dependency]] for  transmitting  memory  order  dependencies  across function calls  §iso.7.6.4 . For example:  [[carries_dependency]] struct foo∗ f int i  {     let the caller use memory_order_consume for the result: return foo_head[i].load memor y_order_consume ;  }  You can also put [[carries__dependency]] on function arguments, and there is a function kill_depen- dency   for stopping the propagation of such dependencies.  One of the designers of the C++ memory model, Lawrence Crowl, summarizes: ‘‘Dependency ordering  is  probably  the  most  complex concurrency feature.  It’s really  worth using when   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   you have a machine for which it matters, you have a very high bandwidth read-mostly atomic data structure, and you’re willing to spend a couple of weeks in testing and external reviews.  This is real expert territory.’’  Consider yourself warned.  41.3.1 atomic Types An atomic type is a specialization of the atomic template.  An operation on an object of an atomic type is atomic. That is, it is performed by a single thread without interference from other threads.  The operations on atomics are very simple: loads and stores, swapping, incrementing, etc., on a simple object  usually a single memory location; §41.2.1 . They hav e to be simple or the hardware can’t handle them directly.  The following tables aim to give  a  ﬁrst impression and an overview  only .  Unless explicitly  stated, the memory order is memory_order_seq_cst  sequentially consistent .  atomic   §iso.29.5   x.val represents the value of the atomic x; all operations are noexcept  atomic x; atomic x {}; atomic x {t};  x is uninitialized Default constructor: x.val=T{}; constexpr Constructor: x.val=t; constexpr   Section 41.3.1  atomic Types   1201  atomic   continued   §iso.29.5   x.val represents the value of the atomic x; all operations are noexcept  x=t t=x x.is_lock_free   x.store t   x.store t,order   t=x.load    t=x.load order   t2=x.exchang e t   t2=x.exchang e t,order   b=x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t  b=x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t,o1,o2    b=x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t,order    b=x.compare_exchang e_strong r t,t,o1,o2  b=x.compare_exchang e_strong r t,t,order  b=x.compare_exchang e_strong r t,t   Assignment of T: x.val=t Implicit conversion to T: t=x.val Are operations on x lock free? x.val=t x.val=t; memory order is order t=x.val t=x.val; memory order is order Exchange the values of x and t; t2 is x’s previous value Exchange the values of x and t; memory order is order; t2 is x’s previous value If b= x.val==r t , x.val=t, otherwise rt=x.val; rt is a T& b=x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t ; use o1 as the memory order when b==true; use o2 as the memory order when b==false b=x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t ; use order as the memory order  see §iso.29.6.1[21]  Like b=x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t,o1,o2  Like b=x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t,order  Like b=x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t   There are no copy or move operations for atomics.  The assignment operator and constructor take values of the contained type T and access the contained value.  A default atomic  without  an  explicit {}  is uninitialized  to  allow the  C  standard  library  to  be  compatible.  The is_lock_free   operation is there so that you can test if these operations are lock free or if they hav e been implemented using a lock. On all major implementations, is_lock_free   returns true for integral and pointer types.  The atomic facilities are designed for types that map to a simple built-in type. Expect atomic  to be implemented using locks if T objects are large.  The template argument type T must be triv- ially copyable  must not have user-deﬁned copy operations .  The initialization of an atomic variable is not an atomic operation, so an initialization may have a data race with an access from another thread  §iso.29.6.5 . However, a data race with an initial- ization is quite hard to achieve. As ever, keep initialization of nonlocal objects simple and prefer to initialize with constant expressions  you can’t hav e a data race before the program starts .  A simple atomic variable is close to ideal for a shared counter, such as a use count for a shared  data structure. For example:  template  class shared_ptr { public:     ...   1202  Concurrency   Chapter 41  ˜shared_ptr   {  if  −−∗puc  delete p;  }  private:  };  T∗ p;  atomic ∗ puc;      pointer to shared object    pointer to use count  Here, ∗puc is an atomic  allocated somewhere by a shared_ptr constructor , so that the decrement operation   −−  is atomic  and  the  new value  is  correctly  reported  in  the thread destroying  a shared_ptr.  The ﬁrst argument of a compare-and-exchange operation  rt in the table  is a reference so that  the object referred to can be updated if the operation fails to update its target  x in the table .  The  difference  between compare_exchang e_strong   and compare_exchang e_weak   is  that  the weak  version  can  fail  for  ‘‘spurious  reasons.’’  That  is,  some  peculiarity  of  the  hardware  or  the implementation  of x.compare_exchang e_weak rt,t  may  cause  a  failure  even if x.val==r t. Allowing such  failures  makes compare_exchang e_weak   implementable  on  architectures  where com- pare_exchang e_strong   would be difﬁcult or relatively expensive.  The classic compare-and-swap loop can be written like this:  atomic  val = 0;    ... int expected = val.load  ;  do {     read current value  int next = fct expected ;     calculate newvalue  } while  !val.compare_exchang e_weak expected,next  ;    writenext to val or to expected  The atomic val.compare_exchang e_weak expected,next  reads the current value of val and compares it to expected; if equal, it writes next to val. If some other thread has written to val since we read it in  preparation  to  an  update,  we  have  to try  again.  When we  try  again,  we  use  the  new value  of expected obtained from compare_exchang e_weak  . Eventually, the expected value will be written. The  value  of expected is  ‘‘the  current  value  of val as  seen  by  this  thread.’’  So,  since expected is updated to the current value each time the compare_exchang e_weak   is executed, we should never get an inﬁnite loop.  Operations like compare_exchang e_strong   are widely known as compare-and-swap operations  CAS operations . There is a potentially serious problem with all CAS operations  in any language and on any machine  known as the ABA problem. Consider adding a node at the head of a very simple lock-free singly-linked list if the data value is less than the head’s data:  extern atomic  head;      the shared head of a linked list  Link∗ nh = new Link data,nullptr ;  Link∗ h = head.load  ;  do {     makealink ready for insertion    read the shared head of the list  if  h−>data<data  break; nh−>next = h;     if so,inser telsewhere    next element is the previous head  } while  !head.compare_exchang e_weak h,nh  ;     writenh to head or to h   Section 41.3.1  atomic Types   1203  This is a simpliﬁed version of code that would insert data at the right position in an ordered linked list.  I read the head, use it as the next of my new Link, and then write the pointer to my new Link to head. I do that repeatedly until no other thread has managed to change the head while I was getting nh ready.  Let us examine this code in some detail. Call the value of head that I read A. If no other thread changed the value of head before I executed my compare_exchang e_weak  , it ﬁnds A in head and succeeds in replacing it with my nh. If some other thread changed the value of head to B after I read A, my compare_exchang e_weak   will fail, and I’ll go around my loop to read head again.  This  looks  right. What  could  possibly  go  wrong? Well,  after  I  read  the  value A, some  other thread changed the value of head to B and recycled the Link. Then, some thread reused the node A and  reinserted  it  at  the head of  the  list. Now my compare_exchang e_weak   ﬁnds A and  does  the update.  However,  the  list  had  changed;  the  value  of head went  from A to B and  then  back  to A. That change may be signiﬁcant in many different ways, but in this simpliﬁed example, A−>data may have changed so that the critical data comparison may be wrong. ABA problems can be very subtle and hard to detect. There are a variety of ways of dealing with the ABA problem [Dechev,2010].  I mention it here primarily to warn about the subtleties of lock-free programming.  Integral atomic types offer atomic arithmetic and bit operations:  atomic  for Integral T  §iso.29.6.3   x.val represents the value of the atomic x; all operations are noexcept  z=x.fetch_add y   z=x.fetch_add y,order   z=x.fetch_sub y   z=x.fetch_sub y,order   z=x.fetch_and y   z=x.fetch_and y,order   z=x.fetch_or y   z=x.fetch_or y,order   z=x.fetch_xor y   z=x.fetch_xor y,order   ++x  x++  −−x  x−−  x+=y  x−=y  x&=y  x=y  xˆ=y   x.val+=y; z is the previous x.val z=x.fetch_add y ; use order x.val−=y; z is the previous x.val z=x.fetch_sub y ; use order x.val&=y; z is the previous x.val z=x.fetch_and y ; use order x.val=y; z is the previous x.val z=x.fetch_or y ; use order x.valˆ=y; z is the previous x.val z=x.fetch_xor y ; use order ++x.val; return x.val x.val++; return previous x.val −−x.val; return x.val x.val−−; return previous x.val x.val+=y; return x.val x.val−=y; return x.val x.val&=y; return x.val x.val=y; return x.val x.valˆ=y; return x.val  Consider  the  popular double-checked locking idiom.  The basic  idea  is  that  if  initializing  some x must be done under a lock, you may not want to incur the cost of acquiring that lock every time you access x to see if the initialization has been done. Instead, you lock and initialize only if a variable x_init is false:   1204  Concurrency   Chapter 41  X x; mutex lx;  atomic  x_init {false};     we need a locktoinitializeanX    the mutextobeused to lockxdur inginitialization    an atomic used to minimizelocking     proceed if x is uninitialized     proceed if x is still uninitialized  void some_code   {  if  !x_init  {  lx.lock  ; if  !x_init  {  } lx.unlock  ;  }    ... use x ...  }     ... initializex... x_init = true;  Had init_x not been atomic, instruction reordering could have moved the initialization of x ahead of the apparently unrelated test of init_x  see §41.2.2 . Making init_x atomic prevents that.  The !x_init relies on the implicit conversion from an atomic  to a T. This code can be simpliﬁed further by using RAII  §42.3.1.4 . The  double-checked  locking  idiom  is  represented  in  the  standard  library  by once_ﬂag and  call_once    §42.3.3 , so you don’t hav e to write such code directly.  The standard library also supports atomic pointers:  atomic  for Pointers  §iso.29.6.4   x.val represents the value of the atomic x; all operations are noexcept  z=x.fetch_add y   z=x.fetch_add y,order   z=x.fetch_sub y   z=x.fetch_sub y,order   ++x  x++  −−x  x−−  x+=y  x−=y   x.val+=y; z is the previous x.val z=x.fetch_add y ; use order x.val−=y; z is the previous x.val z=x.fetch_sub y ; use order ++x.val; return x.val x.val++; return previous x.val −−x.val; return x.val x.val−−; return previous x.val x.val+=y; return x.val x.val−=y; return x.val  To allow the C standard library to be compatible, the atomic member function types have freestand- ing equivalents:  atomic_∗ operations  §iso.29.6.5   continues   All operations are noexcept  atomic_is_lock_free p  atomic_init p,v   Are objects of ∗p’s type atomic?

All operations are noexcept Store v in ∗p Assign ∗p to x Load ∗p into x Compare and exchange ∗p and ∗q; b= ∗q==v   41.3.2  Flags and Fences In addition to the support for atomic types, the standard library offers two lower-level synchroniza- tion facilities: atomic ﬂags and fences. The primary use of these is to implement the lowest-level atomic facilities, such as spinlocks and the atomic types. They are the only lock-free mechanisms that are guaranteed to be supported on every implementation  though all major platforms support atomic types .  Essentially  no  programmers  need  to  use  ﬂags  or  fences. Those  who  do  usually  work  closely  with machine architects.  41.3.2.1 atomic Flags  An atomic_ﬂag is  the  simplest  atomic  type  and  the  only  one  with  operations  guaranteed  to  be atomic for every implementation. An atomic_ﬂag represents a single bit of information. If neces- sary, the other atomic types can be implemented using atomic_ﬂag.  The two possible values of an atomic_ﬂag are called set and clear.  atomic_ﬂag  §iso.29.7   All operations are noexcept  atomic_ﬂag ﬂ; atomic_ﬂag ﬂ {}; atomic_ﬂag ﬂ {AT OMIC_FLAG_INIT}; b=ﬂ.test_and_set   b=ﬂ.test_and_set order   ﬂ.clear   ﬂ.clear order  b=atomic_ﬂag_test_and_set ﬂp  b=atomic_ﬂag_test_and_set_explicit ﬂp,order   atomic_ﬂag_clear ﬂp  atomic_ﬂag_clear_explicit ﬂp,order   The value of ﬂ is undeﬁned Default construct: the value of ﬂ is 0 Initialize ﬂ to clear Set ﬂ and b is ﬂ’s old value Set ﬂ and b is ﬂ’s old value; use memory order order Clear ﬂ Clear ﬂ; use memory order order Set ∗ﬂp; b is ∗ﬂp’s old value Set ∗ﬂp; b is ∗ﬂp’s old value; use memory order order Clear ∗ﬂp Clear ∗ﬂp; use memory order order  The bool return values are true for set and false for clear.   1206  Concurrency   Chapter 41  Using {} to  initialize atomic_ﬂag seems  to  make sense.  However,  there  is  no  guarantee  that 0 represents clear. A machine where clear is 1 is rumored to exist.  Clearing using AT OMIC_FLAG_INIT is  the  only  portable  and  reliable  way  of  initializing  an atomic_ﬂag. The AT OMIC_FLAG_INIT is  an implementation-supplied macro.  You can think of an atomic_ﬂag as a very simple spin lock:  class spin_mutex {  atomic_ﬂag ﬂag = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT;  void lock   { while ﬂag.test_and_set   ; } void unlock   { ﬂag.clear  ; }  public:  };  Note that spin locks can easily become very expensive.  As usual, I leave the memory orders and their proper use to the specialist literature.  41.3.2.2  Fences  A fence, also known as a memory barrier, is an operation that restricts operation reordering accord- ing to some speciﬁed memory ordering  §41.2.3 . The fence operations do not do anything else. Think of them as simply slowing down a program to a safe speed, allowing the memory hierarchy to reach a reasonably well-deﬁned state.  atomic_thread_fence order  atomic_signal_fence order   Fences  §iso.29.8   All operations are noexcept Enforce memory order order Enforce memory order order for a thread and a signal handler executed on that thread  Fences are used in combination with atomics  needed to observe the effects of the fences .  41.4 volatile The volatile speciﬁer is used to indicate that an object can be modiﬁed by something external to the thread of control. For example:  volatile const long clock_register;     updated bythe hardware clock  A volatile speciﬁer basically tells the compiler not to optimize away apparently redundant reads and writes.  For example:  auto t1 {clock_register};    ... no use of clock_register here ... auto t2 {clock_register};  Had clock_register not been volatile, the compiler would have  been perfectly entitled to eliminate one of the reads and assume t1==t2.  Do not use volatile except in low-level code that deals directly with hardware.   Section 41.4  volatile  1207  Do not assume that volatile has special meaning in the memory model. It does not. It is not – as in  some  later  languages  –  a  synchronization  mechanism. To  get  synchronization,  use  an atomic  §41.3 , a mutex  §42.3.1 , or a condition_variable  §42.3.4 .  41.5  Advice [1]  Use concurrency to improve responsiveness or to improve throughput; §41.1.

The  C++  standard  support  for  concurrency is introduced  in  a  tutorial  manner  in  §5.3. This  chapter and the previous one provide a more detailed and systematic view.  We call an activity potentially executed concurrently with other activities a task. A thread is the system-level representation of a computer’s facilities for executing a task. A thread can execute a task.  A thread may  share  an  address  space  with  other threads.  That is,  all threads in a single address  space  can  access  the  same  memory  locations. One  of  the  central  challenges  of  the  pro- grammer of a concurrent system is to make sure that threads access memory in a sensible manner.   1210  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  42.2  Threads A thread is an abstraction of the computer hardware’s notion of a computation. The C++ standard- library threads are intended to map one-to-one with the operating system’s threads.  We use threads when several tasks in a program need to progress concurrently. On a system with several process- ing  units   ‘‘cores’’ , threads allows  us  to  use  those  units. All threads work  in  the  same  address space.  If you want hardware protection against data races, use some notion of a process. Stacks are not shared between threads, so local variables are not subject to data races, that is, unless you incautiously pass a pointer to a local variable to another thread. In particular, bew are of by-refer- ence context bindings in lambdas  §11.4.3 . Deliberate and careful sharing of stack memory is use- ful and common, for example, we might pass sections of a local array to a parallel sort.  If a thread cannot proceed  e.g., because it has encountered a mutex owned by another thread , it  is said to be blocked or asleep.  id native_handle_type  thread t {};  thread t {t2}; thread t {f,args}; t.˜thread  ;  t=move t2  t.swap t2  t.joinable    t.join    t.detach    x=t.get_id   x=t.native_handle    n=hardware_concurrency     swap t,t2    thread  §iso.30.3.1   The type of a thread identiﬁer The type of a system’s thread handle; implementation-deﬁned  §iso.30.2.3  Default constructor: create a thread that does not  yet  have a task; noexcept Move constructor; noexcept Constructor: execute f args  on a new thread; explicit Destructor: if t.joinable  , then terminate  ; otherwise no effect Move assignment: if t.joinable  , then terminate  ; noexcept Exchange the values of t and t2; noexcept Is there a thread of execution associated with t? t.get_id  !=id{}?; noexcept Join t with the current thread; that is, block the current thread until t completes; throw system_error if a deadlock is detected  e.g., t.get_id  ==this_thread::get_id   ; throw system_error if t.id==id{} Ensure that no system thread is represented by t; throw system_error if t.id!=id{} x is the id of t; noexcept x is the native handle for t  of native_handle_type  n is the number of hardware processing units  0 means ‘‘don’t know’’ ; noexcept t.swap t2 ; noexcept  A thread represents a system resource, a system thread, possibly even with dedicated hardware:   Section 42.2  Threads   1211  thread  system thread  Consequently, a thread can be moved but not copied.  After being the source of a move, a thread no longer represents a thread of computation. In par-  ticular, it cannot be join  ed.  The thread::hardware_concurrency   operation  reports  the  number  of  tasks  that  can  simultane- ously proceed with hardware support. The exact meaning of that is architecture-dependent, but it is usually less than the number of threads offered by the operating system  e.g., through time multi- plexing  or  time  slicing   and  sometimes  higher  than  the  number  of  processors  or  ‘‘cores.’’  For example,  my  little  two-core  laptop  reports  four  hardware  threads   it  is  using  what  is  sometimes called hyper-threading .  42.2.1  Identity Each thread of execution has a unique identiﬁer represented as a value of type thread::id. If a thread does  not  represent  a  thread  of  execution,  its id is  the  default id{}. The id of  a thread  t can  be obtained by a call of t.get_id  .  The id of the current thread can be obtained by this_thread::get_id    §42.2.6 . A thread can have its id be id{} if  cid:129  it has not had a task assigned, it has terminated,  cid:129  it has been moved from, or  cid:129   cid:129  it has been detach  ed.  Every thread has an id, but a system thread may still be running even though it does not have an id  i.e., after a detach   .  A thread::id can be copied, and ids can be compared with the usual comparison operators  ==, <,  etc. , output using    §31.4.3.4 .  For example:  void print_id thread& t  {  if  t.get_id  ==id{}   cout << "t not joinable\n";  else  }  cout << "t's id is " << t.get_id   << '\n';  Note that cout is a global shared object so that those output statements are not guaranteed to pro- duce  output  characters  in  a  recognizable  sequence  unless  you  make sure  that  no  two threads are writing to cout at the same time  §iso.27.4.1 .   1212  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  42.2.2  Construction A thread constructor takes a task to be executed and the arguments required by that task. The num- ber and types of arguments must match what the task requires. For example:  void f0  ; void f1 int ;     no arguments    one int argument  thread t1 {f0}; thread t2 {f0,1}; thread t3 {f1}; thread t4 {f1,1}; thread t5 {f1,1,2}; thread t3 {f1,"I'm being silly"};      error :too manyarguments    error :too few arguments     error :too manyarguments    error :wrong type of argument  After  construction,  a thread starts  executing  its  task  as  soon  as  the  run-time  system  can  acquire resources  for  it  to  run. Think  of  that  as  ‘‘immediately.’’ There  is  no  separate  ‘‘start  the thread’’ operation.  If you want to build a set of tasks and link them together  e.g., to communicate through mes- sage queues , you ﬁrst build the tasks as function objects and then – when they are all ready to run – start threads. For example:  template  class Sync_queue  {     ...     aqueue providing put   and get   without data races  §42.3.4   };  };  };  struct Consumer {  Sync_queue & head; Consumer Sync_queue & q  :head q  {} void operator    ;     get messages from head  struct Producer {  Sync_queue & tail; Consumer Sync_queue & q  :tail q  {} void operator    ;     put messages on tail  Sync_queue  mq; Consumer c {mq}; Producer p {mq};     maketasks and ‘‘wire them together’’     ﬁnally: startthreads  thread pro {p};  thread con {c};     ...  Trying to intersperse thread creation with the setup of connections among the tasks to be run by the threads can easily become complicated and error-prone.   Section 42.2.2  Construction   1213  The thread constructors are variadic templates  §28.6 . This implies that to pass a reference to a  thread constructor, we must use a reference wrapper  §33.5.1 . For example:  void my_task vector & arg ;  void test vector & v  {  thread my_thread1 {my_task,v};  thread my_thread2 {my_task,ref v };  thread my_thread3 {[&v]{ my_task v ; }};    ...     oops: pass a copyofv    OK: pass v byreference    OK: dodge the ref   problem  The problem is that the variadic template uses bind   or some equivalent mechanism, so that a refer- ence is by default dereferenced and the result copied. So, if v was {1,2,3} and my_task increments elements, thread1 would never hav e any effect on v. Note that all three threads hav e a data race on v; this is an example of calling conventions, not of good concurrent programming style.  A default-constructed thread is primarily useful as the target for a move. For example:  vector  worker 1000 ;     1000 default threads  for  int i=0; i!=worker.siz e  ; ++i  {     ... compute argument for wor ker[i] and create wor ker thread tmp ... worker[i] = move tmp ;  Moving  a  task  from  one thread to  another  does  not  affect  its  execution.  A thread move  simply changes what the threads refer to.  42.2.3  Destruction Obviously, the thread destructor destroys the thread object.  To prevent a system thread from acci- dentally outliving its thread, the thread destructor calls terminate   to terminate the program if the thread is joinable    that is, if get_id  !=id{} .  For example:  output steady_clock::now   ; this_thread::sleep_for second{1} ;     §42.2.6  void heartbeat   {  while true  {  }  void run   {  thread t {heartbeat};    terminatebecause heartbeat   is still running at the end of t’sscope  If you really need to have a system thread proceed beyond the lifetime of its thread see §42.2.5.  }  }  }  }   1214  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  42.2.4 join   A t.join   tells the current thread not to proceed until t completes.  For example:  this_thread::sleep_for second{1} ;     §42.2.6 output "Alive!" ;  void tick int n  {  for  int i=0; i!=n; ++i  {  }  int main   {  thread timer {tick,10}; timer.join  ;  This will output Alive! ten times at about 1-second intervals.  Had the timer.join   been missing, the program would have terminated before tick   could have printed anything.  The join   made the main program wait for the timer to complete.  As mentioned in §42.2.3, trying to have a thread execute past the end of its scope  or more gen- erally, after  its  destructor  is  run   without  calling detach   is  considered  a  fatal   for  the  program  error. Howev er, we can forget to join   a thread. When we view a thread as a resource, we see that we should consider RAII  §5.2, §13.3 . Consider a simple test example:  void run int i, int n     warning: really poor code {  thread t1 {f}; thread t2; vector  v;    ... if  i<n  {  } v[i] = Foo{};    ... t1.join  ; t2.join  ;  thread t3 {g};    ... t2 = move t3 ;     move t3toouter scope     might throw  }  }  }  Here, I have made several bad mistakes.  In particular:   cid:129  We may never reach the two join  s at the end. In that case, the destructor for t1 will termi-  nate the program.   cid:129  We may reach the two join  s at the end without the move t2=move t3  having executed.  In  that case, t2.join   will terminate the program.  For this kind of thread use, we need a destructor that implicitly join  s.  For example:   Section 42.2.4  join    1215  struct guarded_thread : thread {  using thread::thread; ˜guarded_thread   { if  t.joinable    t.join  ; }     §20.3.5.1  Unfortunately, guarded_thread is  not  a  standard-library  class,  but  in  the  best  RAII  tradition guarded_thread makes our code shorter and less error-prone.  For example:  void run2 int i, int n  {     simple use of a guard  guarded_thread t1 {f}; guarded_thread t2; vector  v;    ... if  i<n  {  thread t3 {g};    ... t2 = move t3 ;     move t3toouter scope  } v[i] = Foo{};    ...     might throw  But why doesn’t the thread’s destructor just join  ? There is a long-standing tradition of using sys- tem  threads  that  ‘‘live  forever’’ or decide  for  themselves  when  to  terminate. Had  it  worked,  the timer executing tick    §42.2.2  would have been an example of such a thread. Threads monitoring data structures provide many more examples.  Such threads  and processes  are often called dae- mons. Another use for detached threads is to simply initiate a thread to complete a task and forget about it. Doing so leaves the ‘‘housekeeping’’ to the run-time system.  42.2.5 detach   Accidentally letting a thread try to execute beyond its destructor is considered a very bad error. If you really want a system thread to outlive its thread  handle , use detach  . For example:  void run2   {  thread t {heartbeat}; t.detach  ;      let heartbeat run independently  I hav e a philosophical problem with detached threads. Given a choice, I would prefer to  know exactly which threads are running, be able to determine if threads are making progress as expected, be able to check if threads that are supposed to delete themselves really do so, be able to know whether it is safe to use the results of a thread, be sure that all resources associated with a thread are properly released, and be sure that a thread does not try to access objects from the scope in which it was created after that scope has been destroyed.  };  }  }   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129   cid:129    1216  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  Unless I go beyond the standard library  e.g., using get_native_handle   and ‘‘native’’  system facili- ties , I cannot do so for detached threads. Also, how do I debug a system where the behavior of detached threads cannot be directly observed?  What happens if a detached thread holds a pointer to something in the scope in which it was created? That could lead to corrupted data, a system crash, or  a  security  violation. Yes,  obviously  detached  threads  can  be  useful  and  debugged.  After all, people have been doing it for decades. But people have been doing self-destructive things for cen- turies and deemed them useful. Given a choice, I prefer not to detach   threads.  Note  that thread provides  a  move assignment  and  a  move constructor. This  allows threads to migrate  out  of  the  scope  in  which  they were  constructed  and  often  provides  an  alternative  to detach  . We can  migrate threads to a ‘‘main  module’’ of a program,  access  them  through unique_ptrs or shared_ptrs, or place them in a container  e.g., vector   to avoid losing track of them. For example:  vector  my_threads;      keep otherwise detached threads here  void run   {  thread t {heartbeat}; my_threads.push_back move t  ;    ... my_threads.emplace_back tick,1000 ;  void monitor   {  for  thread& t : my_threads   cout << "thread " << t.get_id   << '\n';  }  }  }  For a more realistic example, I would associate some information with each thread in my_threads. Maybe I’d even launch monitor as a task.  If you must use a detach   a thread, do make sure that it does not refer to variables in its scope.  For example:  void home   {     don’t do this  int var; thread disaster{[&]{ this_thread::sleep_for second{7.3} ;++var; }} disaster.detach  ;  Apart from the warning comment and the evocative name, this code looks quite innocent. It is not: the system thread invoked by disaster   will ‘‘forever’’ keep writing to the address where home  ’s var was allocated,  corrupting  any data  that  may  later  be  allocated  there. This  kind  of  error  is extremely hard to ﬁnd because it is only loosely connected to the code in which it manifests itself, and repeated runs of the program will have different results – many runs may exhibit no symptoms. Such bugs have been called Heisenbugs in honor of the discoverer of the uncertainty principle.  Note  that  the  root  problem  in  that  example  is  a  violation  of  the  simple  and  well  known  rule ‘‘Don’t pass a pointer to a local object out of its scope’’  §12.1.4 .  However,  with a lambda, it is   Section 42.2.5  detach    1217  easy  and almost invisible  to create a pointer to a local variable: [&]. Fortunately, we hav e to say detach   to allow a thread to exit its scope; don’t do that without a very good reason, and then only after carefully considering what its task might do.  42.2.6  Namespace this_thread Operations for the current thread are found in namespace this_thread:  Namespace this_thread  §iso.30.3.1   x=get_id   yield   sleep_until tp  sleep_for d   x is the id of the current thread; noexcept Give the scheduler the opportunity to run another thread; noexcept Put the current thread to sleep until time_point tp Put the current thread to sleep for duration d  To get the identity of the current thread, call this_thread::get_id  . For example:  void helper thread& t  {  thread::id me {this_thread::get_id  };    ... if  t.get_id  !=me  t.join  ;    ...  }  Similarly, we can  use this_thread::sleep_until tp  and this_thread::sleep_for d  to  put  the  current thread to sleep.  The this_thread::yield   is used to give another thread a chance to proceed. The current thread is not blocked, so it will eventually be run again without any other thread having to do anything spe- ciﬁc to wake it.  Thus, yield   is primarily useful for waiting for an atomic to change state and for cooperative multi-threading.  Usually, it is better to use sleep_for n  than to just yield  . The argu- ment to sleep_for   gives the scheduler a better chance to make rational choices about which threads to run when. Consider yield   a feature for optimization in very rare and specialized cases.  On all major implementations threads are preemptable; that is, the implementation can switch from one task to another to ensure that all threads progress at a reasonable rate. However, for his- torical and language technical reasons, preemption is only encouraged rather than required by the standard  §iso.1.10 .  Usually, programmers should not mess with system clocks. But if a clock is reset  say, because it has drifted from the true time , a wait_until   would be affected, but not a wait_for  . The same applies to wait_until   and wait_for   for a timed_mutex  §42.3.1.3 .  42.2.7  Killing a thread I ﬁnd one important operation missing from thread. There is no simple standard way of telling a running thread that I have lost interest in its task, so would it please stop running and release all its resources.  For  example,  if  I  start  a  parallel ﬁnd    §42.4.7 ,  I  would  often  like to ask  remaining tasks to stop once I have an answer. There are various historical and technical reasons for the lack of this operation  called kill, cancel, and interrupt in various languages and systems .   1218  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  If  needed,  application  programmers  can  write  their  own  versions  of  this  idea. For example, many tasks involve a request loop. In that case, a ‘‘kindly commit suicide’’ message would allow the receiving thread to release all resources and then terminate. If there is no request loop, a task could periodically examine a ‘‘needed’’ variable to see if results are still wanted.  So, a general cancel operation may be difﬁcult to design and to implement on all systems, but I have nev er seen an application where a speciﬁc cancellation mechanism wasn’t relatively easy to implement.  42.2.8 thread_local Data As indicated by its name, a thread_local variable is an object owned by a thread and not accessible from other threads unless its owner  incautiously  gives them a pointer to it. In that, a thread_local resembles a local variable, but a local variable has its lifetime and access limited by its scope within a function, whereas a thread_local is shared among all functions of a thread and ‘‘lives’’ for as long as the thread. A thread_local object can be extern.  For most  uses,  having  objects  local   on  the  stack   is  preferable  to  having  them  shared; thread_local storage shares the logical problems of global variables.  As usual, namespaces can be used  to  limit  the  problems  with  nonlocal  data. However,  on many systems,  the  amount  of  stack storage  for  a thread is  rather  limited,  so thread_local storage  becomes  important  for  tasks  that require large amounts of nonshared data.  A thread_local is said to have thread storage duration  §iso.3.7.2 .  Each thread has its own copy If  con-  of  its thread_local variables.  A thread_local is  initialized  before  its  ﬁrst  use   §iso.3.2 . structed, it will be destroyed on thread exit.  An important use of thread_local storage is for a thread to explicitly keep a cache of data for exclusive  access.  That can  complicate  the  program  logic,  but  on  machines  with  shared  caches  it can sometimes deliver very signiﬁcant performance advantages.  Also, it can simplify and or lower the cost of locking by transferring data only in larger batches.  In general, nonlocal memory is a problem for concurrent programming because it is often non- trivial to determine if it is shared and thus a possible source of data races. In particular, static class members can be a major problem because they are often hidden from the users of a class, so that potential data races are easily missed. Consider a Map design with a per-type default value:  template  class Map { public:  Map  ;    ... static void set_default const K&,V& ;  static pair  default_value;  private:  };     set default for all Maps of type Map   Why would a user suspect a data race on two different Map objects?  Obviously, a  user who spotted set_default   among the members might suspect, but set_default   is an easily overlooked minor fea- ture  §16.2.12 .   Section 42.2.8  thread_local Data   1219  One-per-class   static  values  used  to  be  popular. They include  default  values,  use  counters, caches, free lists, answers to frequently asked questions, and many obscure uses. When used in a concurrent system, we have a classic problem:  This is a potential data race: which thread gets to ﬁrst execute set_default  ?     somewhere in thread 1:  Map ::set_default "Heraclides",1 ;     somewhere in thread 2:  Map ::set_default "Zeno",1 ;  Adding thread_local helps:  template  class Map {     ...  private:  };  static thread_local pair  default_value;  Now,  there  is  no  longer  a  potential  data  race. However,  there  is  no  longer  a  single default_value shared among all users either. In the example, thread 1 will never see the effect of a set_default   in thread  2. As  often  as  not,  that  was  not  what  was  intended  in  the  original  code,  so  by  adding thread_local, we simply  exchanged  one  error  for  another. Consider static data  members  suspect  always, because you don’t know if your code might someday be executed as part of a concurrent system , and do not consider thread_local a panacea.  A namespace variable, a local static, and a class static member can be declared thread_local. As for local static variables, the construction of a thread_local local variable is protected by a ﬁrst-time switch  §42.3.3 . The order of construction of thread_locals is undeﬁned, so keep the construction of different thread_locals independent of their order and use compile-time or link-time initialization whenever possible.  Like static variables, thread_locals are by default initialized to zero  §6.3.5.1 .  42.3  Avoiding Data Races The best way to avoid data races is not to share data. Keep interesting data in local variables, in free store not shared with other threads, or in thread_local memory  §42.2.8 . Do not pass pointers to such data to other threads.  When such data needs to be processed by another thread  e.g., by a parallel sort , pass pointers to a speciﬁc section of the data and make sure not to touch that section of the data passed until after the termination of the task.  These simple rules are based on the idea of avoiding attempts to simultaneously access data, so they don’t require locking and lead to maximally efﬁcient programs. Where they cannot be used, for example, because lots of data needs to be shared, use some form of locking:   cid:129  Mutexes: A mutex  a mutual exclusion variable  is an object used to represent the exclusive right to access some resource. To  access the resource, acquire the mutex, access, and then release the mutex  §5.3.4, §42.3.1 .   cid:129  Condition variables: A condition variable is a variable used by a thread to wait for an event  generated by another thread or a timer  §5.3.4.1, §42.3.4 .   1220  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  Strictly speaking, condition variables do not prevent data races. Rather, they sav e us from having to introduce shared data that might become a source of data races.  42.3.1  Mutexes A mutex is an object used to represent exclusive access to some resource. Thus, it can be used to protect against data races and to synchronize access to data shared between multiple threads.  Mutex Classes  §iso.30.4   mutex  recursive_mutex timed_mutex  recursive_timed_mutex lock_guard  unique_lock   A nonrecursive mutex; a thread will block if it tries to acquire a mutex that has already been acquired A mutex that can be repeatedly acquired by a single thread A nonrecursive mutex with operations to try to acquire the mutex for  only  a speciﬁed time A recursive timed mutex A guard for a mutex M A lock for a mutex M  The ‘‘plain’’ mutex is the simplest, smallest, and fastest mutex.  In exchange for added functional- ity, recursive and timed mutexes carry a small cost, which may or may not be signiﬁcant for a given application on a given machine.  Only one thread can own a mutex at any one time:  cid:129  To acquire a mutex means to gain exclusive ownership of it; an acquire operation may block  the thread executing it.   cid:129  To release a mutex means relinquishing exclusive ownership; a release operation will allow another thread to  eventually  acquire  the  mutex.  That is,  a  release  operation  will  unblock waiting threads.  If several threads are blocked on a mutex the system scheduler could in principle select the thread to be unblocked in such a way that some unfortunate thread would  never get to run. This is called starvation, and a scheduling algorithm that avoids starvation by giving each thread an equal chance to make progress is said to be fair. For example, a scheduler might always choose the thread with the highest thread::id to run next, thereby starving a thread with a low id. The standard does not guarantee fairness, but in reality schedulers are ‘‘reasonably fair.’’ That is, they make it extremely unlikely that a thread starves forever.  For example, a scheduler may pick the next thread to run ran- domly among those blocked.  By itself, a mutex doesn’t do anything.  Instead, we use a mutex to represent something else. We  use  ownership  of  a  mutex to represent  the  right  to  manipulate  a  resource,  such  as  an  object, some data, or an I O device.  For example, we could deﬁne a cout_mutex to represent the right to use cout from a thread:  mutex cout_mutex;     represent the right to use cout  template  void write Arg1 a1, Arg2 a2 = {}, Arg3 a3 = {}  {  thread::id name = this_thread::get_id  ;   Section 42.3.1  Mutexes   1221  cout_mutex.lock  ; cout << "From thread " << name << " : " << a1 << a2 << a3; cout_mutex.unlock  ;  If all threads use write   we should get output from different threads properly separated. The snag is that  every thread has  to  use  a  mutex as intended.  The correspondence  between  a  mutex and  its resource  is  implicit. In  the cout_mutex example,  a thread using cout directly   bypassing cout_mutex  can corrupt output. The standard guarantees that the cout variable is protected against corruption, but there is no protection against output from different threads becoming intermixed.  Note  that  I  locked  the  mutex only  for  the  one  statement  that  required  the  lock. To  minimize contention  and  the  chances  of  a thread becoming  blocked,  we  try  to  minimize  the  time  a  lock  is held by locking only where it is essential to do so. A section of code protected by a lock is called a critical section. To keep code fast and free of problems related to locking, we minimize the size of critical sections.  The standard-library mutexes provide exclusive  ownership  semantics. That is, a single thread  at a time  has exclusive access to the resource. There are other kinds of mutexes.  For example, multiple-reader-single-writer mutexes are popular, but the standard library does not  yet  offer one. If you need a different kind of mutex, use one offered by a speciﬁc system or write it yourself.  42.3.1.1 mutex and recursive_mutex  Class mutex offers a simple set of operations:  mutex  §iso.30.4.1.2.1   mutex m {}; m.˜mutex   m.lock   m.try_lock   m.unlock   native_handle_type nh=m.native_handle     Default constructor: m is not owned by any thread; constexpr; noexcept Destructor: undeﬁned behavior if owned Acquire m; block until ownership is acquired Try to acquire m; did acquisition succeed? Release m An implementation-deﬁned system mutex type nh is the system handle for the mutex m  A mutex cannot  be  copied  or  moved.  Think of  a mutex as  a  resource,  rather  than  a  handle  of  a resource.  In fact, a mutex is typically implemented as a handle to a system resource, but since that system resource cannot be shared, leaked, copied, or moved, it is usually a spurious complication to think of them as separate.  The basic uses of a mutex are very simple. For example:  mutex cout_mutex;     initialized to ‘‘not owned byany thread’’  void hello   {  cout_mutex.lock  ; cout << "Hello, "; cout_mutex.unlock  ;  }  }   1222  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  void world   {  cout_mutex.lock  ; cout << "World!"; cout_mutex.unlock  ;  }  }  int main   {  thread t1 {hello}; thread t2 {world};  t1.join  ; t2.join  ;  Given that, we will get the output  Hello, World!  or  World! Hello,  extern mutex wqm; extern list  wq;  void composer   {  list  requests;  while  true  {  for  int i=0; i!=10; ++i  {  Work w;    ... compose wor krequest ... requests.push_back w ;  } if  wqm.try_lock    {  wq.splice requests ;  wqm.unlock  ;  }  }  }  We will not get cout corrupted or some mixed-up output characters.  The try_lock   operation is used when we have some other work we might usefully do if some other thread is  using  a  resource. As  an  example,  consider  a  work  generator  that  composes  work requests for other tasks and places them on a work queue:     splice   requests into the list  §31.4.2   When some server thread is examining wq, the composer   simply makes some more work instead of waiting.   Section 42.3.1.1  mutex and recursive_mutex  1223  When using locks, we have to bew are of deadlock. That is, we must not wait for a lock that can never be released.  The simplest form of deadlock requires only one lock and one thread. Consider a variant of the thread-safe output operation:  Now,  if a thread calls write "Hello,","World!" , it will deadlock with itself when it tries the recursive call for the tail.  Recursive and mutually recursive calls are common enough for the standard to provide a solu- tion.  A recursive_mutex is just like a plain mutex, except that a single thread can acquire it repeat- edly. For example:  recursive_mutex cout_mutex;      changed to recursive_mutextoavoid deadlock  template  void write Arg a, Args tail...  {  cout_mutex.lock  ; cout << a; write tail... ; cout_mutex.unlock  ;  template  void write Arg a, Args tail...  {  cout_mutex.lock  ; cout << a; write tail... ; cout_mutex.unlock  ;  }  }  Now the recursive call of write   is correctly handled by cout_mutex.  42.3.1.2 mutex Errors  Trying to manipulate a mutex can fail.  If so, the mutex operation throws a system_error. Some of the possible errors reﬂect conditions in the underlying system:  Mutex Error Conditions  §iso.30.4.1.2   resource_deadlock_would_occur resource_unavailable_tr y_again operation_not_permitted device_or_resource_busy invalid_argument  A deadlock would occur Some native handle is not available The thread is not allowed to perform the operation Some native handle is already locked A constructor native handle argument is bad  For example:   1224  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42     tr yto lockasecond time  mutex mtx; try {  mtx.lock  ; mtx.lock  ;   } catch  system_error& e  {  mtx.unlock  ; cout << e.what   << '\n'; cout << e.code   << '\n';  }  I got the output  device or resource busy generic: 16  This looks like a good argument for using a lock_guard or a unique_lock  §42.3.1.4 .  42.3.1.3 timed_mutex and recursive_timed_mutex  A simple mtx.lock   is unconditional. If we don’t want to block, we can use mtx.try_lock  , but when we fail to acquire mtx, we often want to wait for a while before trying again.  The timed_mutex and recursive_timed_mutex offer support for that:  timed_mutex  §iso.30.4.1.3.1   timed_mutex m {}; m.˜timed_mutex   m.lock   m.try_lock   m.try_lock_for d   m.try_lock_until tp   m.unlock   native_handle_type nh=m.native_handle     Default constructor; m is not owned; constexpr; noexcept Destructor: undeﬁned behavior if owned Acquire m; block until ownership is acquired Try to acquire m; did the acquisition succeed? Try to acquire m for a maximum duration of d; did the acquisition succeed? Try to acquire m until time_point tp at the latest; did the acquisition succeed? Release m Implementation-deﬁned system mutex type nh is the system handle for the mutex  The recursive_timed_mutex interface  is  identical  to  the timed_mutex interface   just  as  the recur- sive_mutex interface is identical to the mutex interface .  For this_thread, we can sleep_until tp  a time_point and sleep_for d  a duration  §42.2.6 .  More generally, we can m.try_lock_until tp  or m.try_lock_for d  for  a timed_mutex m. If tp is  before  the current  point  in  time  or d is  less  than  or  equal  to  zero,  the  operation  is  equivalent  to  a  ‘‘plain’’ try_lock  .  As an example, consider updating an output buffer with a new image  e.g., in a video game or a  visualization :  extern timed_mutex imtx; extern Image buf;   Section 42.3.1.3  timed_mutex and recursive_timed_mutex  1225  void next   {  while  true  {  Image next_image;    ... compute ...  if  imtx.try_lock milliseconds{100}   {  buf = next_image; imtx.unlock  ;  }  }  }  }  The assumption here is that if the image cannot be updated reasonably fast  here, in 100 millisec- onds , the user would prefer a newer version of the image. Further, it is assumed that missing an image in a sequence of updated images will rarely be noticed, so that a more complicated solution is not needed.  42.3.1.4 lock_guard and unique_lock  A lock is a resource, so we must not forget to release it. That is, each m.lock   operation must be matched by an m.unlock   operation.  The usual opportunities for mistakes exist; for example:  void use mutex& mtx, Vector & vs, int i  {  mtx.lock  ; if  i<0  return; string s = vs[i];    ... mtx.unlock  ;  The mtx.unlock   is there, but if i<0 or if i is out of vs’s range and vs is range checked, the thread of execution never gets to the mtx.unlock   and mtx may be locked forever.  The  standard  library  provides  two RAII  classes, lock_guard and unique_lock, to handle  such  problems.  The ‘‘plain’’ lock_guard is the simplest, smallest, and fastest guard. In exchange for added func- tionality, unique_ptr carries a small cost, which may or may not be signiﬁcant for a given applica- tion on a given machine.  lock_guard   §iso.30.4.2   m is a lockable object  lock_guard lck {m};  lock_guard lck {m,adopt_lock_t};   lck acquires m; explicit lck holds m; assume that the current thread has already acquired m; noexcept Destructor: calls unlock   for the mutex held  lck.˜lock_guard    For example:   1226  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  The lock_guard’s destructor does the necessary unlock   on its argument.  As usual, we should only hold a lock for the minimal amount of time, so a lock_guard should not become an excuse for holding a lock until the end of a large scope if we only need the lock for a small section of the scope. Obviously, the checking of i does not require locking, so we could do that before acquiring the lock:  Furthermore,  imagine  that  we  only  needed  the  lock  for  the  read  of v[i]. Then,  we  could  put  the lock_guard in a small scope:  void use mutex& mtx, vector & vs, int i  {  lock_guard  g {mtx}; if  i<0  return; string s = vs[i];    ...  void use mutex& mtx, vector & vs, int i  {  if  i<0  return; lock_guard  g {mtx}; string s = vs[i];    ...  void use mutex& mtx, vector & vs, int i  {  if  i<0  return; string s; {  }    ...  lock_guard  g {mtx}; s = vs[i];  }  }  }  Is such complication of the code worthwhile? Without looking at the code ‘‘hidden in the ...’’  we cannot  tell,  but  we  should  deﬁnitely  not  use  a lock_guard just  out  of  unwillingness  to  consider where locking is needed. Minimizing the size of critical sections is in general a useful thing to do. If nothing else, it forces us to think about exactly where a lock is needed and why.  So, a lock_guard  and also a unique_lock  is a resource handle  ‘‘a guard’’  for an object that you  can lock to acquire ownership and unlock to release.  lock_guard  lockable object   Section 42.3.1.4  lock_guard and unique_lock  1227  Such  an  object  is  called  a lockable  object. The  obvious  lockable  object  is  of  a  standard-library mutex type, but users can deﬁne their own.  A lock_guard is  a  very  simple  class  with  no  interesting  operations. All  it  does  is  RAII  for  a mutex. To get  an  object  that  provides  RAII  and  operations  on  a  contained mutex, we use  a unique_lock:  unique_lock   §iso.30.4.2   m is a lockable object  unique_lock lck {};  unique_lock lck {m};  unique_lock lck {m,defer_lock_t};  unique_lock lck {m,tr y_to_lock_t};   unique_lock lck {m,adopt_lock_t};   unique_lock lck {m,tp};   unique_lock lck {m,d};   unique_lock lck {lck2};  lck.˜unique_lock   lck2=move lck   lck.lock    lck.tr y_lock    lck.tr y_lock_for d   lck.tr y_lock_until tp   lck.unlock    lck.swap lck2   pm=lck.release    lck.owns_lock   bool b {lck};  pm=lck.mutex    swap lck,lck2    Default constructor: lck does not hold a mutex; noexcept lck acquires m; explicit lck holds m but does not acquire it lck holds m and does a m.try_lock  ; if the try succeeds lck owns m; otherwise not lck holds m; assume that the current thread has already acquired m lck holds m and calls m.try_lock_until tp ; if the try succeeds, lck owns m; otherwise not lck holds m and calls m.try_lock_for d ; if the try succeeds, lck owns m; otherwise not Move constructor: lck holds the mutex  if any  held by lck2; lck2 does not hold a mutex Destructor: calls unlock   for the mutex held  if any  Move assignment: lck holds the mutex  if any  held by lck2; lck2 does not hold a mutex m.lock   m.try_lock  ; did acquisition succeed? m.try_lock_for d ; did acquisition succeed? m.try_lock_until tp ; did acquisition succeed? m.unlock   Exchange the lockable objects of lck and lck2; noexcept lck no longer owns ∗pm; noexcept Does lck own a lockable object? noexcept Conversion to bool; b==lck.owns_lock  ; explicit; noexcept ∗pm is the owned lockable object, if any; otherwise pm=nullptr; noexcept lck.swap lck2 ; noexcept  Obviously, the timed operations are only allowed if the contained mutex is a timed_mutex or a recur- sive_timed_mutex. For example:   1228  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  mutex mtx; timed_mutex mtx2;  void use   {  unique_lock  lck {mtx}; unique_lock  lck2 {mtx2};  lck.tr y_lock_for milliseconds{2} ;      error :mutexdoes not have member try_lock_for    lck2.tr y_lock_for milliseconds{2} ;  lck2.tr y_lock_until steady_clock::now  +milliseconds{2} ;    ...     OK  If you give  a duration or a time_point as a second argument to a unique_lock, the constructor will execute the appropriate try operation. The owns_lock   operations allow us to check whether such an acquisition succeeded. For example:  }  }  unique_lock  lck2 {mtx2,milliseconds{2}}; if  lck2.owns_lock    {  timed_mutex mtx2;  void use2   {     acquisition succeeded:    ... do something ...     timeout:    ... do something else ...  } else {  }  }  mutex mtx1;  mutex mtx2;      protects one resource    protects another resource  void task mutex& m1, mutex& m2  {  unique_lock  lck1 {m1}; unique_lock  lck2 {m2};    ... use resources ...  42.3.2  Multiple Locks It is fairly common to want to acquire multiple resources to do some task. Unfortunately, acquiring two locks implies the opportunity of deadlock. For example:   Section 42.3.2  Multiple Locks  1229  thread t1 {task,ref mtx1 ,ref mtx2 }; thread t2 {task,ref mtx2 ,ref mtx1 };  The ref   is the std::ref   reference wrapper from    §33.5 .  It is needed to pass a refer- ence through a variadic template  the thread constructor; §42.2.2 . A mutex cannot be copied or moved, so I must pass them by reference  or use a pointer .  Change the names from mtx1 and mtx2 to something that does not indicate order and separate the deﬁnitions of t1 and t2 from each other in the source text and it will no longer be obvious that there is a good chance that the program will eventually deadlock with t1 owning mtx1, t2 owning mtx2, and each trying to acquire its second mutex forever.  locks is a sequence of one or more lockable objects lck1, lck2, lck3, ...  Locks  §iso.30.4.2   x=try_lock locks   lock locks   Try to acquire all members of locks; the locks are acquired in order; x=−1 if all locks were acquired; otherwise x=n, where n is the lock that could not be acquired, and no locks are held Acquire all members of locks; do not deadlock  The actual algorithm for try_lock   is unspeciﬁed, but one possibility would be:  template   int try_lock M1& mtx, Mx& tail...  {  if  mtx.try_lock    {  int n = try_lock tail... ; if  n == −1  return −1; mtx.unlock  ;  return  n+1;  } return 1;     all locks acquired    backout     couldn’t acquire mtx  }  }  }  template   int try_lock M1& mtx  {  return  mtx.try_lock    ? −1 : 0;  void task mutex& m1, mutex& m2  {  unique_lock lck1 {m1,defer_lock_t}; unique_lock lck2 {m1,defer_lock_t}; lock lck1,lck2 ;    ... use resources ...  Given lock  , the buggy task   can be simpliﬁed and corrected:  Note that applying lock   directly to the mutexes, lock m1,m2 , rather than to the unique_locks would have left the programmer with the obligation to explicitly release m1 and m2.   1230  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  42.3.3 call_once   We  often want to initialize an object without getting into a race condition. The type once_ﬂag and the function call_once   offer a low-level, efﬁcient, and simple tool for that.  call_once  §iso.30.4.2   once_ﬂag ﬂ {}; call_once ﬂ,f,args   Default constructor: ﬂ has not been used Call f args  if ﬂ hasn’t yet been used  For example:  class X { public:  X  ;    ...  private:     ... static once_ﬂag static_ﬂag; static Y static_data_for_class_X; static void init  ;  call_once static_ﬂag,init   ;  };  }  X::X   {  }  }  One way to think about call_once   is as a way to simply modify preconcurrency code that relies on initialized static data.  Run-time initialization of a local static variable is implemented by call_once   or by a mecha-  nism very similar to call_once  . Consider:  Color& default_color   {     user code  static Color def { read_from_environment "background color"  }; return def;  This may be implemented as  Color& default_color   {     generated code  static Color def; static_ﬂag __def; call_once __def,read_from_environment,"background color" ; return def;  I use the double underscore preﬁx  §6.3.3  to emphasize that this latter version represents compiler- generated code.   Section 42.3.4  Condition Variables   1231  42.3.4  Condition Variables Condition variables are used to manage communication among threads.  A thread can wait  block  on a condition_variable until some event, such as reaching a speciﬁc time or another thread complet- ing, occurs.  condition_variable  §iso.30.5   lck must be a unique_lock   condition_variable cv {};  cv.˜condition_variable   cv.notify_one   cv.notify_all   cv.wait lck    cv.wait lck,pred    x=cv.wait_until lck,tp    b=cv.wait_until lck,tp,pred    x=cv.wait_for lck,d   b=cv.wait_for lck,d,pred   native_handle_type nh=cv.native_handle     Default constructor: throw a system_error if some system resource cannot be obtained Destructor: no thread may be waiting and not notiﬁed Unblock one waiting thread  if any ; noexcept Unblock all waiting threads; noexcept lck must be owned by the calling thread; atomically calls lck.unlock   and blocks; unblocks if notiﬁed or ‘‘spuriously’’; when unblocked calls lck.lock   lck must be owned by the calling thread; while  !pred    wait lock ; lck must be owned by the calling thread; atomically calls lck.unlock   and blocks; unblocks if notiﬁed or timed out at tp; when unblocked calls lck.lock  ; x is timeout if it timed out; otherwise x=no_timeout while  !pred    if  wait_until lck,tp ==cv_status::timeout ; b=pred   x=cv.wait_until lck,steady_clock::now  +d  b=cv.wait_until lck,steady_clock::now  +d,move pred   See §iso.30.2.3 nh is the system handle for cv  A condition_variable may  or may not  rely on system resources, so a constructor may fail for lack of such a resource. However, like a mutex, a condition_variable cannot be copied or moved, so it is best to think of a condition_variable as a resource in itself, rather than as a handle.  When a condition_variable is destroyed, all waiting threads  if any  must be notiﬁed  i.e., told to  wake up  or they may wait forever.  The status returned by wait_until   and wait_for   is deﬁned as:  enum class cv_status { no_timeout, timeout };  A condition_variable’s unique_lock is used by the wait functions to prevent wake-ups being lost due to contention on the unique_lock’s list of waiting threads.  The ‘‘plain’’ wait lck  is a low-level operation that should be used with extra care and usually in the  implementation  of  some  higher-level abstraction.  It can  wake up ‘‘spuriously.’’ That  is,  the system  may  decide  to  resume wait  ’s thread ev en though  no  other thread has  notiﬁed  it!   1232  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  Apparently, allowing  spurious  wake-up  simpliﬁes  implementation  of condition_variables on some systems.  Always use ‘‘plain’’ wait   in a loop. For example:  while  queue.empty    wait queue_lck ;  An  additional  reason  for  this  loop  is  that  some thread may  have  ‘‘snuck  up’’ and  invalidated  the condition  here, queue.empty    before the thread calling the unconditional wait   got to run. Such a loop basically is the implementation of a wait with a condition, so prefer those over the uncondi- tional wait  .  A thread can wait for an amount of time:  void simple_timer int delay  {  condition_variable timer; mutex mtx;  auto t0 = steady_clock::now  ; unique_lock  lck mtx ;  timer.wait_for lck,milliseconds{delay} ;     release and reacquire mtx auto t1 = steady_clock::now  ; cout   t1−t0 .count   << "milliseconds passed\n";     mutexprotecting timer     acquire mtx  }    implicitly release mtx  This  basically  shows  the  implementation  of this_thread::wait_for  . The mutex protects wait_for   against data races. The wait_for   releases its mutex as it goes to sleep and reacquires it as its thread is unblocked.  Finally, lck  implicitly  releases the mutex at the end of its scope.  Another simple use of a condition_variable is to control the ﬂow of messages from a producer to  a consumer:  template  class Sync_queue { public:  void put const T& val ; void put T&& val ; void get T& val ;  private:  mutex mtx; condition_variable cond; list  q;  };  }  template  void Sync_queue::put const T& val  {  lock_guard  lck mtx ; q.push_back val ; cond.notify_one  ;  The idea is that put   and get   will not get in each other’s way. A thread that does a get   will sleep unless there is a value on the queue for it to get.  That  is,  a  producer put   acquires  the  queue’s mutex, adds  a  value  at  the  end  of  the  queue,  calls   Section 42.3.4  Condition Variables   1233  notify_one   to wake a possibly blocked consumer, and implicitly releases the mutex. I provided an rvalue version of put   so that we can transmit objects of types that have move, but not copy, opera- tions, such as unique_ptr  §5.2.1, §34.3.1  and packaged_task  §42.4.3 .  I used notify_one   rather than notify_all   because I only added one element and wanted to keep put   simple.  The possibility of multiple consumers and the possibility of consumers falling behind the producer might make me reconsider.  The get   is a bit more complicated because it should only block its thread if the mutex precludes  access or if the queue is empty:  template  void Sync_queue::get T& val  {  unique_lock  lck mtx ; cond.wait lck,[this]{ return !q.empty  ; } ; val=q.front  ; q.pop_front  ;  A caller of get   will remain blocked until the Sync_queue is nonempty.  I used a unique_lock rather than a plain lock_guard because the lock_guard is optimized for sim-  plicity and does not offer the operations needed to unlock and relock the mutex.  I used [this] to enable the lambda to access the Sync_queue object  §11.4.3.3 . I return the value from get   through a reference argument, rather than as a return value, to be sure that an element type with a copy constructor that can throw will not cause trouble. That is the conventional  technique   e.g.,  the  STL stack adaptor  provides pop   and  the  containers  provide front   .  Writing a general get   that directly returns a value is possible, but surprisingly tricky.  For an example, see future ::get    §42.4.4 .  A simple producer-consumer pair can be very simple:  }  }  }  Sync_queue  mq;  void producer   {  while  true  {  Message m;    ... ﬁll m ... mq.put m ;  }  }  void consumer   {  while  true  {  Message m; mq.get m ;    ... use m ...   1234  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  thread t1 {producer}; thread t2 {consumer};  Using a condition_variable saves a consumer the bother of explicitly dealing with the case where it runs out of work to do. Had we simply used a mutex to control access to the Sync_queue, the con- sumer would have had to repeatedly wake up, look for work on the queue, and decide what to do when it found the queue empty.  I copy values into and out of the list I use to hold my queue elements. A copy of an element type may throw an exception, but if it does, the Sync_queue will remain unchanged and the put   or get   simply fails.  A Sync_queue is not itself a shared data structure, so we don’t use a separate mutex for it; only the put   and get    updating the head and the tail of the queue, which may be the same element  need to be protected against data races.  For some applications, the simple Sync_queue has a fatal ﬂaw: What if a consumer waits forever because a producer stopped adding values?  What if a consumer has other things to do so that it cannot wait for a long time? Often there are answers, but one common technique is to add a time- out to get  , that is, to specify a maximum time to wait:  void consumer   {  while  true  {  }  }  Message m; mq.get m,milliseconds{200} ;    ... use m ...  To make this work, we need to add a second get   to Sync_queue:  template  void Sync_queue::get T& val, steady_clock::duration d  {  unique_lock  lck mtx ; bool not_empty = cond.wait_for lck,d,[this]{ return !q.empty  ; } ; if  not_empty  {  val=q.front  ; q.pop_front  ;  } else  }  throw system_error{"Sync_queue: get   timeout"};  When using a timeout, we need to consider what to do after the wait: did we get data or did we just time  out? Actually, we don’t really  care  about  the  timeout,  but  only  whether  the  predicate  expressed in the lambda  is true or not, so that is what wait_for   returns.  I chose to report the fail- ure of a get   with a timeout by throwing an exception.  Had I thought that timing out would be a common and ‘‘nonexceptional’’ event, I would have returned a bool instead.   Section 42.3.4  Condition Variables   1235  The roughly equivalent modiﬁcation to put   would be to wait for the consumer to make inroads  into a long queue, but not for too long a time:  template  void Sync_queue::put T val, steady_clock::duration d, int n  {  unique_lock  lck mtx ; bool not_full = cond.wait_for lck,d,[this]{ return q.size  <n; } ; if  not_full  {  q.push_back val ; cond.notify_one  ;  cond.notify_all  ; throw system_error{"Sync_queue: put   timeout"};  } else {  }  }  For put  , the alternative of returning a bool to encourage the producer to always explicitly handle both cases seems more attractive than for get  . Howev er, to avoid getting into a discussion of how best to handle overﬂow, I again chose to signal a failure by throwing an exception.  I chose to notify_all   if the queue was full. Maybe, some consumer needs a nudge to continue. The choice between notify_all   and notify_one   depends on the behavior of the application and is not  always  obvious.  Notifying just  one thread serializes  access  to  the  queue  and  could  therefore minimize throughput when there are several potential consumers. On the other hand, notifying all waiting threads may wake up sev eral threads, causing contention on the mutex and possibly having threads repeatedly waking up just to ﬁnd the queue empty  emptied by other threads .  I fall back on the old rule: Don’t trust your intuition; measure.  42.3.4.1 condition_variable_any  A condition_variable is optimized for unique_lock . A condition_variable_any is functionally equivalent to a condition_variable but can use any lockable object for its operations:  condition_variable_any  §iso.30.5.2   lck can be any lockable object with the operations required  ... like condition_variable ...  42.4  Task-Based Concurrency So  far, this  chapter  focused  on  the  mechanisms  for  running  concurrent  tasks:  the  focus  was  on threads, avoiding race conditions, and synchronizing threads.  For many concurrent tasks, I ﬁnd this focus on mechanisms distracting from the real task  sic!  of specifying concurrent tasks. This sec- tion focuses on specifying a simple kind of task: a task that does one thing given arguments and produces one result.   1236  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  To support this task-based model of concurrency, the standard library offers:  Task Support  §iso.30.6.1   packaged_task  promise  future  shared_future  x=async policy,f,args  x=async f,args   Package a callable object of type F to be run as a task A type of object to which to put one result of type T A type of object from which to move one result of type T A future from which to read a result of type T several times Launch f args  to be executed according to policy Launch with the default policy: x=async launch::asynclaunch::deferred,f,args   The presentation of these facilities exposes many details that rarely need to bother an application writer. Please keep in mind the fundamental simplicity of the task model. Most of the more com- plicated details support rare uses, such as hiding uses of the messier threads-and-locks level.  The standard-library task support is just one example of what can be done to support task-based concurrency.  Often, we would like to provide a lot of small tasks and let ‘‘the system’’ worry about how to map their execution onto hardware resources and how to keep them out of problems with data races, spurious wake-ups, excessive waits, etc.  The importance of these facilities is their simplicity to a programmer. In a sequential program,  we usually write something like:  res = task args ;      perfor matask given arguments and get the result  The concurrent version becomes:  auto handle = async task,args ;     ... do something else ... res = handle.g et       perfor matask given arguments     get the result  Sometimes,  we  lose  sight  of  the  value  of  simplicity  as  we  consider  alternatives,  details,  perfor- mance, and tradeoffs.  By default, use the simplest technique and reserve the more complex solu- tions for where you know that they are really worthwhile.  42.4.1 future and promise As mentioned in §5.3.5, communication between tasks is handled by a future promise pair. A task puts  its  result  into  a promise, and  a  task  that  needs  the  result  retrieves the  result  from  the  corre- sponding future:  task 1:  task 2:  get    future  promise  set_value    set_exception    value  The ‘‘value’’ in this diagram is technically known as the shared state  §iso.30.6.4 .  In addition to   Section 42.4.1  future and promise  1237  the return value or exception, it contains the information needed for two threads to safely exchange the information. At a minimum, a shared state must be able to hold:   cid:129  A value of the appropriate type or an exception.  For a future ‘‘returning void’’  the value is  nothing.   cid:129  A ready bit to indicate whether a value or exception is ready to be extracted by a future.  cid:129  The task to be executed when a get   is called for a future for a task launched by async   with  the launch policy deferred  §42.4.6 .   cid:129  A use count, so that the shared state can be destroyed when and only when its last potential user relinquishes access. In particular, if a stored value is of a class with a destructor, its de- structor is called when the use count goes to zero.   cid:129  Some mutual exclusion data to enable unblocking of any thread that might be waiting  e.g.,  a condition_variable .  An implementation can take actions on a shared state:   cid:129  Construct: Possibly using a user-supplied allocator.  cid:129  Make ready: Set the ‘‘ready bit’’ and unblock any waiting threads.  cid:129  Release: Decrease the use count and destroy the shared state if this was the last user.  cid:129  Abandon: If it becomes impossible for a value or exception to be put into the shared state by a promise  e.g.,  because  the promise is  destroyed ,  a future_error exception  with  the  error condition broken_promise is stored in the shared state and the shared state is made ready.  42.4.2 promise A promise is the handle to a shared state  §42.4.1 . It is where a task can deposit its result to be retrieved through a future  §42.4.4 .  promise   §iso.30.6.5   continues   promise pr {};  promise pr {allocator_arg_t,a};  promise pr {pr2};  pr.˜promise    pr2=move pr   pr.swap pr2  fu=pr.g et_future   pr.set_value x  pr.set_value   pr.set_exception p   Default constructor: pr has a shared state that is not yet ready Construct pr; use allocator a to construct a shared state that is not yet ready Move constructor: pr gets pr2’s state; pr2 no longer has a shared state; noexcept Destructor: abandon the shared state; make the result a broken_promise exception. Move assignment: pr2 gets pr’s state; pr no longer has a shared state; noexcept Exchange the values of pr and pr2; noexcept fu is the future corresponding to pr The result of the task is the value x Set the result of the task for a void future The result of the task is the exception pointed to by p; p is an exception_ptr   1238  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  promise   continued   §iso.30.6.5   pr.set_value_at_thread_exit x   pr.set_exception_at_thread_exit p   The result of the task is the value x; don’t make the result ready until thread exit The result of the task is the exception pointed to by p; p is an exception_ptr; don’t make the result ready until thread exit pr.swap pr2 ; noexcept  swap pr,pr2    There are no copy operations for a promise.  A set function throws future_error if a value or exception is already set. It is only possible to transmit a single result value through a promise. That may seem restric- tive, but remember that the value is moved into and out of the shared state, rather than copied, so that we can cheaply pass a collection of objects. For example:  A task may then extract that map from a corresponding future at essentially zero cost.  promise > pr; map > m;    ... ﬁll m with a million   pairs ... pr.set_value m ;  42.4.3 packaged_task A packaged_task holds a task and a future promise pair.  packaged_task:  task 1:  get    future  promise  value  task 2:  set_value x   return x  set_exception px   throw x  We  pass a task  a function or a function object  that we want executed to a packaged_task. When our task executes a return  x, it causes a set_value x  on the packaged_task’s promise. Similarly, a throw  x causes a set_exception px  where px is an exception_ptr for x. Basically, the packaged_task executes its task, f args , like this:  try {  } catch ...  {  }  pr.set_value f args  ;      assume that the promise is called pr  pr.set_exception current_exception   ;  A packaged_task offers a fairly conventional set of operations:   Section 42.4.3  packaged_task  1239  packaged_task   §iso.30.6.9   packaged_task pt {}; packaged_task pt {f};  packaged_task pt {allocator_arg_t,a,f};  Default constructor: pt holds no task; noexcept Construct pt holding f; f is moved into pt; use the default allocator; explicit Construct pt holding f; f is moved into pt; use allocator a; explicit Move constructor: pt gets pt2’s state; after the move pt2 does not have a task; noexcept Move assignment: pt gets pt2’s state; decrease the use count for pt’s former shared state; after the move pt2 does not have a task; noexcept Destructor: abandon the shared state Exchange the values of pt and pt2; noexcept Does pt have a shared state?

A packaged_task may copy its task, and a copy of a task is assumed to yield the same result as the original. This is important because a task may be moved with its packaged_task onto the stack of a new thread.  To abandon a shared state  as is done by the destructor and the move  means making it ready. If  there is no value or exception stored, a pointer to a future_error is stored  §42.4.1 .  The  advantage  of make_ready_at_exit   is  that  the  result  is  not  available  until  destructors  for  thread_local variables have been executed.  handled by the packaged_task.  There is no get_promise   operation to match get_future  . The use of the promise is completely  For a really simple example we don’t even need any threads.  First deﬁne a simple task:  int ff int i  {  }  if  i  return i; throw runtime_error "ff 0 " ;  We can now package this function into packaged_tasks and call them:   1240  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  packaged_task  pt1 {ff}; packaged_task  pt2 {ff};     store ff in pt1    store ff in pt2  pt1 1 ;  pt2 0 ;      let pt1 call ff 1 ;    let pt2 call ff 0 ;  So far, nothing appears to have  happened.  In particular, we don’t see the exception triggered by ff 0 . In fact, pt1 1  did  a set_value 1  on  the promise attached  to pt1, and pt1 0  did  a set_excep- tion px  on the promise attached to pt2; that px is an exception_ptr to a runtime_error "ff 0 " .  Later, we can  try  to  retrieve  the  results. The get_future   operation  is  used  to  get  hold  of  the  future into which the packaged thread will deposit the result of its task.  auto v1 = pt1.get_future  ; auto v2 = pt2.get_future  ;  try {  cout << v1.get   << '\n'; cout << v2.get   << '\n';     will print    will throw  } catch  exception& e  {  cout << "exception: " << e.what   << '\n';  The output is:  1 exception: ff 0   }  }  We could have gotten exactly the same effect by simply writing:  try {  cout << ff 1  << '\n';    will print cout << ff 0  << '\n';    will throw  } catch  exception& e  {  cout << "exception: " << e.what   << '\n';  The point is that the packaged_task version works exactly like the version using ordinary function calls even when the calls of the task  here ff  and the calls of the get  s are in different threads.  We can concentrate on specifying the tasks, rather than thinking about threads and locks.  We  can  move  the future, the packaged_task, or both  around. Eventually, the packaged_task is invoked and  its  task  deposits  its  result  in  the future without  having  to  know either  which thread executed it or which thread will receive the result. This is simple and general.  Consider a thread that processes a series of requests. It could be a GUI thread, a thread owning access to a piece of specialized hardware, or indeed any server that serializes access to a resource through a queue. We  can implement such a service as a queue of messages  §42.3.4 , or we could pass tasks to be executed:  using Res =  * result type for server* ; using Args =  * argument types for server* ;   Section 42.4.3  packaged_task  1241  using PTT = Res Args ;  Sync_queue > server;  Res f Args ;  struct G {  Res operator   Args ;     ...     function: do something     function object: do something  }; auto h = [=] Args a  {  * do something*  };     lambda  packaged_task  job1 f ; packaged_task  job2 G{} ; packaged_task  job3 h ;  auto f1 = job1.get_future  ; auto f2 = job2.get_future  ; auto f3 = job3.get_future  ;  server.put move job1  ; server.put move job2  ; server.put move job3  ;  auto r1 = f1.get  ; auto r2 = f2.get  ; auto r3 = f3.get  ;  The server thread would take the packaged_tasks from the server queue and execute them in some suitable order. Typically, the tasks would carry data with them from the calling context.  The  tasks  are  written  essentially  like ordinary  functions,  function  objects,  and  lambdas. The server calls the tasks essentially like ordinary  callback  functions. The packaged_tasks are actually easier  for  the  server  to  use  than  ordinary  functions  because  the  handling  of  their  exceptions  has been taken care of.  42.4.4 future A future is a handle to a shared state  §42.4.1 . It is where a task can retrieve a result deposited by a promise  §42.4.2 .  future   §iso.30.6.6   continues   future fu {}; future fu {fu2}; Move constructor: fu gets fu2’s shared state, if any;  Default constructor: no shared state; noexcept  fu.˜future   fu=move fu2   fu2 no longer has a shared state; noexcept Destructor: release the shared state, if any Move assignment: fu gets fu2’s shared state, if any; fu2 no longer has a shared state; release fu’s old shared state, if any   1242  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  future   continued   §iso.30.6.6   sf=fu.share   x=fu.get    fu.get   fu.valid   fu.wait   fs=fu.wait_for d   fs=fu.wait_until tp   Move fu’s value into a shared_future sf; fu no longer has a shared state fu’s value is moved into x; if an exception was stored in fu, throw it; fu no longer has a shared state; don’t try to get   twice For future : like x=fu.get  , but don’t move any value Is fu valid? that is, does fu have a shared state? noexcept Block until a value arrives Block until a value arrives or for a duration d; fs tells if a value is ready, a timeout occurred, or execution was deferred Block until a value arrives or until a time_point tp; fs tells if a value is ready, a timeout occurred, or execution was deferred  A future holds a unique value and offers no copy operations.  The value, if any,  is moved out of a future. So get   can only be called once. If you potentially  need to read a result several times  e.g., by different tasks , use a shared_future  §42.4.5 .  It is undeﬁned what happens if you try to get   twice.  In fact, it is undeﬁned what happens if you try to do any operation except a ﬁrst get  , a valid  , or a destructor on a future that is not valid  . The  standard  ‘‘encourages’’ an implementation  to  throw a future_error with  the  error  condition future_errc::no_state in such cases.  If a future ’s value type, T, is void or a reference, special rules apply for get  :  cid:129   cid:129   future ::g et   doesn’t return a value: it just returns or throws an exception. future ::get   returns a T&. A reference isn’t an object, so the library must have transmit- ted something else, such as a T∗, and get   converts that  back  into a T&.  The status of a future can be observed by calling wait_for   and wait_until  :  enum class future_status  ready timeout deferred  The future has a value The operation timed out The execution of the future’s task is deferred until a get    The possible errors from operations on futures are:  future Errors: future_errc  broken_promise future_already_retrieved promise_already_satisﬁed no_state  A promise abandoned the state before supplying a value A second get   on a future A second set_value   or set_exception   on a promise   An operation tried to access a promise’s shared state before that state was created  e.g., get_future   or set_value     In  addition,  an  operation  on  the T value  of shared_future ::get   could  possibly  throw  e.g.,  an unusual move operation .  Looking at the future  table, I ﬁnd that I miss two useful functions:  cid:129  wait_for_all args : Wait until every future in args has a value.  cid:129  wait_for_any args : Wait until one future in args has a value.   Section 42.4.4  future  1243  I can easily implement a version of wait_for_all  :  template  vector  wait_for_all vector >& vf  {  vector  res; for  auto& fu : vf   res.push_back fu.g et   ;  return res;  }  {  That’s easy enough to use, but it has a ﬂaw: if I wait for ten futures, I risk my thread getting blocked ten times. Ideally, my thread would be blocked and unblocked at most once. However,  for many uses, this wait_for_all   implementation is good enough: if some of the tasks are long-running, the extra waits will not be signiﬁcant. On the other hand, if all tasks are short, they will most likely have ﬁnished after the ﬁrst wait.  An implementation of wait_for_any   is trickier. First we need a way of checking if a future is  ready. Surprisingly, that is done by using wait_for  . For example:  future_status s = fu.wait_for seconds{0} ;  Using wait_for seconds{0}  to get the status of a future is not obvious, but wait_for   will tell us why it resumed, and it tests for ready before suspending. It is common, but unfortunately not guaran- teed, that wait_for seconds{0}  returns immediately rather than trying to suspend for zero time.  Given wait_for  , we can write:  template  int wait_for_any vector >& vf, steady_clock::duration d      returnindexofready future    if no future is ready,wait for d before trying again  while true  {  for  int i=0; i!=vf.siz e  ; ++i  {  if  !vf[i].valid    continue; switch  vf[i].wait_for seconds{0}   { case future_status::ready:  return i;  break;  case future_status::timeout:  case future_status::deferred:  }  } this_thread::sleep_for d ;  }  }  throw runtime_error "wait_for_all  : deferred future" ;  I decided to consider a deferred task  §42.4.6  an error for my uses.  Note the check for valid  . Trying wait_for   on an invalid future  e.g., a future on which you have already done a get    will cause a hard-to-ﬁnd error. At best, you can hope for a  probably surpris- ing  exception being thrown.   1244  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  Like the implementation of wait_for_all  , this implementation has a ﬂaw: ideally, the caller of wait_for_any   should never hav e to wake up just to ﬁnd that no tasks had completed and should be unblocked immediately when one does. This simple implementation only approximates that. With a large d a useless wake-up is unlikely but implies the possibility of an unnecessarily long wait.  The wait_for_all   and wait_for_any   functions  are  useful  building  blocks  for  concurrent  algo-  rithms.  I use them in §42.4.6.  42.4.5 shared_future The result value of a future can be read only once: it is moved.  Thus, if you want to read the value repeatedly or potentially have it read by multiple readers, you must copy it, and then read the copy. That’s what a shared_future does.  Every usable shared_future is directly or indirectly initialized by moving the value out of a future with the same result type.  shared_future sf {}; shared_future sf {fu};  shared_future sf {sf2}; sf.˜future   sf=sf2 sf=move sf2  x=sf.g et   sf.g et    sf.valid   sf.wait   fs=sf.wait_for d   fs=sf.wait_until tp   shared_future   §iso.30.6.7   Default constructor: no shared state; noexcept Constructor: move value from future fu; fu no longer has a state; noexcept Copy and move constructor; the move constructor is noexcept Destructor: release the shared state, if any Copy assignment Move assignment; noexcept sf’s value is copied into x; if an exception was stored in fu, throw it For shared_future : like x=sf.g et   but doesn’t copy any value Does sf have a shared state? noexcept Block until a value arrives Block until a value arrives or for a duration d; fs tells if a value is ready, a timeout occurred, or execution was deferred Block until a value arrives or until a time_point tp; fs tells if a value is ready, a timeout occurred, or execution was deferred  Obviously, shared_future is very similar to future. The key difference is that a shared_future moves its value to a location where it can be repeatedly read and shared. As for future , special rules apply for get   when a shared_future ’s value type, T, is void or a reference:   cid:129   cid:129    cid:129   shared_future ::g et   doesn’t return a value: it just returns or throws an exception. shared_future ::get   returns a T&. A reference isn’t an object, so the library must have transmitted something else, such as a T∗, and get   converts that  back  into a T&. shared_future ::get   returns a const T& when T is not a reference.  Unless  the  returned  object  is  a  reference,  it  is const, so it can  safely  be  accessed  from  several threads without  synchronization. If  the  returned  object  is  a  non-const reference,  you  need  some form of mutual exclusion to avoid data races on the referred-to object.   Section 42.4.6  async    1245  42.4.6 async   Given future and promise  §42.4.1  and packaged_task  §42.4.3 , we can write simple tasks without worrying too much about threads.  Given those, a thread is just something you give a task to run. However, we still need to consider how many threads to use and whether a task is best run on the current thread or on another. Such decisions can be delegated to a thread launcher, that is, a func- tion that decides whether to create a new thread, to recycle an old thread, or simply run the task on the current thread.  Asynchronous Task Launcher: async     §iso.30.6.8   fu=async policy,f,args  fu=async f,args    Execute f args  according to launch policy policy fu=async launch::asynclaunch::deferred,f,args   The async   function is basically a simple interface to a launcher of unknown sophistication. A call of async   returns a future  where R is the type of its task’s result.  For example:  If a thread is launched to execute square 2 , we may have a record slow way of executing 2∗2. The notation can be simpliﬁed by the use of auto:  double square int i  { return i∗i; }  future  fd = async square,2 ; double d = fd.get  ;  double square int i  { return i∗i; }  auto fd = async square,2 ; auto d = fd.get  ;  In principle, a caller of async   could provide a huge variety of information to help the implementa- tion of async   decide whether to launch a new thread, rather than simply executing the task on the current thread. For example, we can easily imagine a programmer wanting to give the launcher a hint about how long a task is likely to run. However, only two policies are currently standard:  Launch Policies: launch  async deferred  Execute the task as if a new thread was created to do so Execute the task at the point of a get   for the task’s future  Note  the as  if. The  launcher  has  wide  discretionary  powers  when  it  comes  to  launching  a  new thread or not. For example, since the default policy is asyncdeferred  async or deferred , it is not too fanciful to imagine an async   that decided to use deferred for async square,2 , so that the execu- tion  reduced  to fd.get   calling square 2 . I could  even imagine  an  optimizer  reducing  that  whole code fragment to  double d = 4;  However, we should not expect an implementation of async   to be optimized for such trivial exam- ples.  Implementer efforts are better spent on realistic examples where the task performs a signiﬁ- cant amount of computation so that launching on a new or ‘‘recycled’’ thread could be reasonably considered.   1246  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  By a ‘‘recycled thread’’ I mean a thread from a collection of threads  a thread pool  that async   may create once and use over and over to execute a variety of tasks. Depending on the implementa- tion of system threads, this can drastically lower the cost of executing a task on a thread. If a thread is recycled, the launcher must take care that a task does not see leftover state from a previous task executed  on  the thread and  that  a  task  does  not  store  pointers  to  its  stack  or thread_local data  §42.2.8  in nonlocal storage. Such data could conceivably be used for security violations.  A simple and realistic use of async   would be to spawn a task to collect input from a user:  void user   {  }  auto handle = async []  { return input_interaction_manager  ; } ;    ... auto input = handle.g et  ;    ...  Such a task often requires some data from the caller. I used a lambda to make it obvious that I can pass arguments or allow access to local variables.  When using a lambda to specify a task, beware of capturing local variables by reference. That could lead to data races or unfortunate cache access patterns by two threads accessing the same stack frame. Also, beware that capturing members of an object  using [this]  §11.4.3.3   implies  that  the  members  of  the  object  are  accessed  indirectly  through this , rather than copied, so that the object is subject to data races unless you make certain that it is not. If in doubt, copy  pass or capture by value, [=] .  It is often important that we can select a scheduling policy ‘‘late’’ and change it as needed. For example, I might use launch::deferred for initial debugging.  That would eliminate errors related to concurrency until I had eliminated sequential errors. Also, I can often go back to launch::deferred to determine if an error really is related to concurrency.  Over time, more launch policies may become available, and maybe some systems offer better launch policies than others. In such cases, I might be able to improve the performance of my code by a local change of launch policy,  rather than by reworking subtle details of the program logic. This, again, is an effect of the fundamental simplicity of the task-based model  §42.4 .  Having launch::asynclaunch::deferred as the default launch policy can be a practical problem. Basically, it is not so much a default as a lacking design decision. An implementation might decide that  ‘‘no  concurrency’’ is a good  idea  and  always  use launch::deferred. If your  experiments  with concurrency show results  surprisingly  similar  to  single-thread  execution,  try  being  explicit  about the launch policy.  42.4.7  A Parallel ﬁnd   Example A ﬁnd   does a linear search of a sequence. Imagine having millions of items that are not easily sorted so that ﬁnd   is the right algorithm for ﬁnding something. This could be slow,  so instead of searching once starting at the beginning and going until the end, we might start 100 ﬁnd  s each on a hundredth of the data.  First, we represent the data as a vector of Records:  extern vector  goods;     data to be searched   Section 42.4.7  A Parallel ﬁnd   Example   1247  An individual  sequential  task is simply a use of the standard-library ﬁnd_if  :  template  Record∗ ﬁnd_rec vector & vr, int ﬁrst, int last, Pred pr  {  vector ::iterator p = std::ﬁnd_if vr.begin  +ﬁrst,vr.begin  +last,pr ; if  p == vr.begin  +last   return nullptr;   return &∗p;      at end: no record found    found: returnapointer to the element  Unfortunately, we hav e to decide on a ‘‘grain’’ of parallelism.  That is, we need to specify the num- ber of records to be searched sequentially.  const int grain = 50000;     number of records for a linear search  Picking a number like that is a very primitive  way of choosing a grain size. It is hard to choose well unless a lot is known about the hardware, the library implementation, the data, and the algo- rithm.  Experimentation is essential. Tools and frameworks that save us from having to pick a grain size  or  help  us  choose  can  be  most  useful. However,  for  a  simple  illustration  of  basic  standard- library facilities and the most basic techniques for their use, grain is sufﬁcient.  The pﬁnd    ‘‘parallel ﬁnd’’  function simply does the number of async   calls required by the  grain and the number of Records.  Then, it get  s the results:  template  Record∗ pﬁnd vector & vr, Pred pr  {  assert vr.siz e  %grain==0 ;  vector > res;  for  int i = 0; i!=vr.siz e  ; i+=grain   res.push_back async ﬁnd_rec ,ref vr ,i,i+grain,pr  ;  for  int i = 0; i!=res.size  ; ++i   if  auto p = res[i].get         look for a result in the futures    did the task ﬁnd a match?  return p;  return nullptr;      no match found  Finally, we can initiate a search:  void ﬁnd_cheap_red   {  assert goods.size  %grain==0 ;  Record∗ p = pﬁnd goods,  cout << "record "<< ∗p << '\n';  [] Record& r  { return r.price<200 && r.color==Color::red; } ;  }  }  }   1248  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  This ﬁrst version of a parallel ﬁnd   ﬁrst spawns a lot of tasks and then proceeds to wait for them in order. Like std::ﬁnd_if  , it reports the ﬁrst element that matches the predicate; that is, it ﬁnds the element with the lowest index that matches. That may be ﬁne, but:   cid:129  We could end up waiting for a lot of tasks that don’t ﬁnd anything  maybe only the last task  ﬁnds something .  match our criteria .   cid:129  We may  throw away a lot  of  information  that  could  be  useful   maybe  a  thousand  items  The ﬁrst problem may not be as bad as it sounds. Assume  somewhat recklessly  that launching a thread doesn’t cost anything and that we have as many processing units as there are tasks; then we would still get the result in roughly the time it took to process one task. That is, we would poten- tially get our result in the time taken to examine 50,000 records rather than millions. If we have N processing units, the results will be delivered in batches of results for N∗50000 records.  If no record is found until the last segment of the vector, the time will be roughly vr.siz e    N∗grain  units.  Instead of waiting for each task in order, we could try to look at the results in the order the tasks  completed.  That is, we could use wait_for_any    §42.4.4 .  For example:  template  Record∗ pﬁnd_any vector & vr, Pred pr  {  vector > res;  for  int i = 0; i!=vr.siz e  ; i+=grain   res.push_back async ﬁnd_rec ,ref vr ,i,i+grain,pr  ;  for  int count = res.size  ; count; −−count  {  int i = wait_for_any res,microseconds{10} ;  if  auto p = res[i].get         ﬁnd a completed task    did the task ﬁnd a match?  return p;  return nullptr;      no match found  }  }  A get   renders its future invalid, so we don’t get to look at a partial result twice.  I use count to make sure I don’t keep looking after all tasks have  reported back. Apart from that, pﬁnd_any   is  as  simple  as pﬁnd  . Whether  there  is  a  performance  advantage  to pﬁnd_any   over pﬁnd   depends on lots of things, but the key  observation is that to  potentially  gain advan- tages of concurrency,  we had to use a slightly different algorithm. Like ﬁnd_if  , pﬁnd   returns its ﬁrst  match,  whereas pﬁnd_any   returns  whichever match  it  ﬁrst  found. Often,  the  best  parallel algorithm for a problem is a variant of the idea for a sequential solution, rather than a simple repeti- tion of the sequential solution.  In this case, the obvious question is ‘‘But do you really only need one match?’’ Giv en concur- rency,  it makes more sense to ﬁnd all matches. Doing so is easy. All we need to do is to let each task return a vector of matches, rather than just a simple match:   Section 42.4.7  A Parallel ﬁnd   Example   1249  template  vector  ﬁnd_all_rec vector & vr, int ﬁrst, int last, Pred pr  {  vector  res; for  int i=ﬁrst; i!=last; ++i   if  pr vr[i]    res.push_back &vr[i] ;  return res;  This ﬁnd_all_rec   is arguably simpler than the original ﬁnd_rec  .  Now we just need to launch ﬁnd_all_rec   a suitable number of times and wait for the results:  template  vector  pﬁnd_all vector & vr, Pred pr  {  vector >> res;  for  int i = 0; i!=vr.siz e  ; i+=grain   res.push_back async ﬁnd_all_rec ,ref vr ,i,i+grain,pr  ;  vector > r2 = wait_for_all res ;  vector  r; for  auto& x : r2   for  auto p : x   r.push_back p ;  return r;     merge results  Had I just returned a vector > this pﬁnd_all   would have  been the simplest paral- lelizing  function  so  far. Howev er,  by merging  the vectors returned  into  a  single  one, pﬁnd_all   became an example of a common and popular group of parallel algorithms:  This is the basic idea that, when developed into a framework so that the details of concurrent execu- tion have been completely hidden, is commonly referred to as map-reduce [Dean,2004].  [1]  Create a number of tasks to be run. [2]  Run the tasks in parallel. [3]  Merge the results.  The example can be run like this:  void ﬁnd_all_cheap_red   {  assert goods.size  %grain==0 ;  auto vp = pﬁnd_all goods,  [] Record& r  { return r.price<200 && r.color==Color::red; } ;  for  auto p : vp   cout << "record "<< ∗p << '\n';  }  }  }   1250  Threads and Tasks   Chapter 42  Finally, we must  consider  if  the  effort  to  parallelize  was  worthwhile.  To do so,  I  added  simple sequential versions to my test:  void just_ﬁnd_cheap_red   {  auto p = ﬁnd_if goods.begin  ,goods.end  ,  [] Record& r  { return r.price<200 && r.color==Color::red; } ;  if  p!=goods.end     cout << "record "<< ∗p << '\n';  else  cout << "not found\n";  void just_ﬁnd_all_cheap_red   {  auto vp = ﬁnd_all_rec goods,0,goods.size  ,  [] Record& r  { return r.price<200 && r.color==Color::red; } ;  for  auto p : vp   cout << "record "<< ∗p << '\n';  }  }  For my simple test data and my  relatively  simple laptop with only four hardware threads, I did not ﬁnd any consistent or signiﬁcant performance differences.  In this case, the cost of thread creation in the immature implementation of async   dominates the effects of concurrency.  If I needed signif- icant parallel speedup right now, I would implement my own variant of async   based on a pre-cre- ated set of threads and a work queue, along the lines of a Sync_queue  §42.3.4  of packaged_tasks  §42.4.3 .  Note that such a signiﬁcant optimization can be done without changing my task-based parallel ﬁnd   program.  From the application’s point of view, replacing the standard-library async   with an optimized version is an implementation detail.  42.5  Advice [1]  A thread is a type-safe interface to a system thread; §42.2.

The C standard library provides quite a few functions that have proven useful over the years in a wide variety of contexts – especially for relatively low-level programming.  There  are  more  C  standard-library  functions  than  are  presented  here;  see  a  good  C  textbook, such as ‘‘Kernighan and Ritchie’’ [Kernighan,1988] or the ISO C standard [C,2011], if you need to know more.  43.2  Files The   I O system is based on ﬁles. A ﬁle  a FILE∗  can refer to a ﬁle or to one of the standard input and output streams: stdin, stdout, and stderr. The standard streams are available by default; other ﬁles need to be opened:   1254  The C Standard Library  Chapter 43  File Open and Close  f=fopen s,m   x=fclose f   Open a ﬁle stream for a ﬁle named s with the mode m f is the FILE∗ for the opened ﬁle if successful or nullptr Close ﬁle stream f; return 0 if successful  A ﬁle opened with fopen   must be closed by fclose   or the ﬁle will remain open until the operating system closes it. If that is a problem  is considered a leak , use an fstream  §38.2.1 .  A mode is  a  C-style  string  containing  one  or  more  characters  specifying  how a ﬁle  is  to  be  opened  and used after opening :  File Modes  "r" "w" "a" "r+" "w+" "b"  Reading Writing  discard previous contents  Append  add at end  Reading and writing Reading and writing  discard previous contents  Binary; use together with one or more other modes  There may be  and usually are  more options on a speciﬁc system. For example, x is sometimes used to mean ‘‘the ﬁle must not exist before this open operation.’’  Some options can be combined, for  example, fopen "foo","rb"  tries  to  open  a  ﬁle  called foo for  binary  reading. The  I O  modes should be the same for stdio and iostreams  §38.2.1 .  43.3  The printf   Family The  most  popular  C  standard  library  functions  are  the  output  functions. However,  I  prefer iostreams because that library is type-safe and extensible.  The formatted output function, printf  , is widely used  also in C++ programs  and widely imitated in other programming languages:  printf    n=printf fmt,args   n=fprintf f,fmt,args   n=sprintf s,fmt,args   Print the format string fmt to stdout, inserting the arguments args as appropriate Print the format string fmt to ﬁle f, inserting the arguments args as appropriate Print the format string fmt to the C-style string s, inserting the arguments args as appropriate  For each version, n is the number of characters written or a negative number if the output failed. The return value from printf   is essentially always ignored.  The declaration of printf   is: int printf const char∗ format ... ;  In other words, it takes a C-style string  typically a string literal  followed by an arbitrary number of  arguments  of  arbitrary  type.  The  meaning  of  those  ‘‘extra  arguments’’ is controlled  by   Section 43.3  The printf   Family   1255  conversion speciﬁcations, such as %c  print as character  and %d  print as decimal integer , in the format string. For example:  int x = 5; const char∗ p = "Pedersen"; printf "the value of x is '%d' and the value of s is '%s'\n",x,s ;  A character  following  a % controls  the  handling  of  an  argument.  The ﬁrst % applies  to  the  ﬁrst ‘‘extra argument’’  here, %d applies to x , the second % to the second ‘‘extra argument’’  here, %s applies to s , and so on. In particular, the output of that call to printf   is  the value of x is '5' and the value of s is 'Pedersen'  followed by a newline.  In  general,  the  correspondence  between  a % conversion  directive  and  the  type  to  which  it  is  applied cannot be checked, and when it can, it usually is not. For example:  printf "the value of x is '%s' and the value of s is '%x'\n",x,s ;     oops    0  d  − +  The set of conversion speciﬁcations is quite large  and growing over the years  and provides a great degree of ﬂexibility. Various systems support options beyond the ones offered by the C standard. See also the set of options used for strftime   formatting  §43.6 . Following the %, there may be: an optional minus sign that speciﬁes left-adjustment of the converted value in the ﬁeld; an optional plus sign that speciﬁes that a value of a signed type will always begin with a + or − sign; an optional zero that speciﬁes that leading zeros are used for padding of a numeric value. If − or a precision is speciﬁed this 0 is ignored; an optional  that speciﬁes that ﬂoating-point values will be printed with a decimal point ev en if no nonzero digits follow, that trailing zeros will be printed, that octal values will be printed with an initial 0, and that hexadecimal values will be printed with an initial 0x or 0X; an optional digit string specifying a ﬁeld width; if the converted value has fewer characters than the ﬁeld width, it will be blank-padded on the left  or right, if the left-adjustment indi- cator has been given  to make up the ﬁeld width; if the ﬁeld width begins with a zero, zero- padding will be done instead of blank-padding; an optional period that serves to separate the ﬁeld width from the next digit string; an optional digit string specifying a precision that speciﬁes the number of digits to appear after the decimal point, for e- and f-conversion, or the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string; a ﬁeld width or precision may be ∗ instead of a digit string. In this case an integer argu- ment supplies the ﬁeld width or precision; an  optional  character h, specifying  that  a  following d, i, o, u, x, or X corresponds  to  a  signed or unsigned  short integer argument; an optional pair of characters hh, specifying that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X argument is treated as a  signed or unsigned  char argument; an optional character l  ell , specifying that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X corresponds to a  signed or unsigned  long integer argument;  . d  hh  h  ∗  l   1256  The C Standard Library  Chapter 43  j  ll  L  an optional pair of characters ll  ell ell , specifying that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X corre- sponds to a  signed or unsigned  long long integer argument; an optional character L, specifying that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G corresponds to a long double argument; specifying that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X corresponds to a intmax_t or uintmax_t argu- ment; specifying that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X corresponds to a size_t argument; specifying that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X corresponds to a ptrdiff_t argument;  z t % indicating that the character % is to be printed; no argument is used; c  a character that indicates the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion characters and their meanings are: d i o x X f  The integer argument is converted to decimal notation; The integer argument is converted to decimal notation; The integer argument is converted to octal notation; The integer argument is converted to hexadecimal notation; The integer argument is converted to hexadecimal notation; The ﬂoat or double argument is converted to decimal notation in the style [−]ddd.ddd. The number of d’s  after the decimal point is equal to the precision for the argument. If necessary, the number is rounded. If the precision is missing, six digits are given; if the precision is explicitly 0 and  isn’t speciﬁed, no decimal point is printed; Like %f but uses capital letters for INF, INFINITY, and NAN. The ﬂoat or double argument  is  converted  to  decimal  notation  in  the  scientiﬁc  style [−]d.ddde+dd or [−]d.ddde−dd, where there is one digit before the decimal point and the number of digits after the decimal point is equal to the precision speciﬁcation for the  argument.  If necessary, the  number  is  rounded. If  the  precision  is  missing,  six digits are given; if the precision is explicitly 0 and  isn’t speciﬁed, no digits and no decimal point are printed; As e, but with an uppercase E used to identify the exponent; The ﬂoat or double argument is printed in style d, in style f, or in style e, whichever gives the greatest precision in minimum space;  E g  F e  G As g, but with an uppercase E used to identify the exponent; a  The double argument  is  printed  in  the  hexadecimal  format [−]0xh.hhhhp+d or [−]0xh.hhhhp+d; Like %a but using X and P instead or x and p; The character argument is printed. Null characters are ignored; The argument is taken to be a string  character pointer , and characters from the string are  printed  until  a  null  character  or  until  the  number  of  characters  indicated  by  the precision speciﬁcation is reached; however, if the precision is 0 or missing, all charac- ters up to a null are printed; The argument is taken to be a pointer. The representation printed is implementation- dependent; The unsigned integer argument is converted to decimal notation; The number of characters written so far by the call of printf  , fprintf  , or sprintf   is written to the int pointed to by the pointer to int argument.  A c s  p  u n   Section 43.3  The printf   Family   1257  In  no  case  does  a  nonexistent  or  small  ﬁeld  width  cause  truncation  of  a  ﬁeld;  padding  takes place only if the speciﬁed ﬁeld width exceeds the actual width.  Here is a more elaborate example:  char∗ line_format = "line %d \"%s\"\n"; int line = 13; char∗ ﬁle_name = "C++ main.c";  printf "int a;\n" ; printf line_format,line ,ﬁle_name ;  which produces:  int a; line 13 "C++ main.c"  Using printf   is unsafe in the sense that type checking is not done. For example, here is a well- known way of getting unpredictable output, a segmentation fault, or worse:  char x = 'q'; printf "bad input char: %s",x ;     %s should have been %c  The printf   function does, however, provide great ﬂexibility in a form that is familiar to C program- mers.  Because C does not have user-deﬁned types in the sense that C++ has, there are no provisions for deﬁning output formats for user-deﬁned types, such as complex, vector, or string. The format for strftime    §43.6   is  an  example  of  the  contortions  you  can  get  into  by  trying  to  design  yet another set of format speciﬁers.  The C standard output, stdout, corresponds to cout. The C standard input, stdin, corresponds to cin. The C standard error output, stderr, corresponds to cerr. This correspondence between C stan- dard I O and C++ I O streams is so close that C-style I O and I O streams can share a buffer. For example, a mix of cout and stdout operations can be used to produce a single output stream  that’s not uncommon in mixed C and C++ code . This ﬂexibility carries a cost. For better performance, don’t mix  stdio  and iostream operations  for  a  single  stream. To  ensure  that,  call ios_base::sync_with_stdio false  before the ﬁrst I O operation  §38.4.4 .  The stdio library provides a function, scanf  , that is an input operation with a style that mimics  printf  . For example:  int x; char s[buf_siz e]; int i = scanf "the value of x is '%d' and the value of s is '%s'\n",&x,s ;  Here, scanf   tries to read an integer into x and a sequence of non-whitespace characters into s. A non-format character speciﬁes that the input should contain that character. For example:  the value of x is '123' and the value of s is 'string '\n"  will read 123 into x and string followed by a 0 into s. If the call of scanf   succeeds, the resulting value  i in the call above  will be the number of argument pointers assigned to  hopefully 2 in the example ; otherwise, EOF. This way of specifying input is error-prone  e.g., what would happen if you forgot the space after string on that input line? . All arguments to scanf   must be pointers. I   1258  The C Standard Library  Chapter 43  strongly recommend against the use of scanf  .  So what can we do for input if we are obliged to use stdio? One popular answer is ‘‘use the  standard-library function gets  ’’:     very dangerous code: char s[buf_siz e]; char∗ p = gets s ;      read a line into s  The call p=gets s  reads characters into s until a newline or an end-of-ﬁle is encountered and a '\0' is placed after the last character written to s. If an end-of-ﬁle is encountered or if an error occurred, p is  set  to  the nullptr; otherwise,  it  is  set  to s. Nev er use gets s  or  its  rough  equivalent  scanf "%s",s  !  For years, they were the favorites of virus writers: By providing an input that over- ﬂows the input buffer  s in the example , a program can be corrupted and a computer potentially taken over by an attacker. The sprintf   function can suffer similar buffer-overﬂow problems.  The C11 version of the C standard library offers a whole alternate set of stdio input functions that take an extra argument to defend against overﬂow,  such as gets_s p,n . As for iostream’s  unformatted input, that leaves the user with the problem of deciding exactly which termination condition was encountered  §38.4.1.2; e.g., too many characters, a terminator character, or an end-of-ﬁle .  The stdio library also provides simple and useful character read and write functions:  Stdio Character Functions  x=getc st   x=putc c,st   x=getchar    x=putchar c   x=ungetc c,st   Read a character from input stream st; x is the character’s integer value or EOF if end-of-ﬁle or an error occurred Write the character c to the output stream st; x is the integer value of the character written or EOF if an error occurred x=getc stdin  x=putc c,stdout  Put c back onto the input stream st; x is the integer value of c or EOF if an error occurred  The result of these operations is an int  not a char, or EOF could not be returned . For example, this is a typical C-style input loop:  int ch;  while   ch=g etchar   !=EOF  {  * do something*  }     note: not ‘‘char ch;’’  Don’t do two consecutive ungetc  s on a stream.  The result of that is undeﬁned and non-portable.  There  are  many more  stdio  functions;  see  a  good  C  textbook   e.g.,  ‘‘K&R,’’  if you  need  to  know more.  43.4  C-Style Strings A C-style string is a zero-terminated array of char. This notion of a string is supported by a set of functions  deﬁned  in    or  ; note:  not    and  . These  functions operate on C-style strings through char∗ pointers  const char∗ pointers for memory that is only read, but not unsigned char∗ pointers :   Section 43.4  C-Style Strings  1259  C-Style String Operations  x=strlen s  p=strcpy s,s2   p=strcat s,s2  x=strcmp s, s2   p=strncpy s,s2,n   p=strncat s,s2,n   x=strncmp s,s2,n   p=strchr s,c   p=strrchr s,c   p=strstr s,s2   p=strpbrk s,s2    Count the characters  excluding the terminating 0  Copy s2 into s; [s:s+n  and [s2:s2+n  may not overlap; p=s; the terminating 0 is copied Copy s2 onto the end of s; p=s; the terminating 0 is copied Compare lexicographically: if s<s2, then x is negative; if s==s2, then x==0; if s>s2, then x is positive strcpy of max n characters; may fail to copy terminating 0 strcat of max n characters; may fail to copy terminating 0 strcmp of max n characters p points to the ﬁrst c in s p points to the last c in s p points to the ﬁrst character of s that starts a substring equal to s2 p points to the ﬁrst character of s also found in s2  Note that in C++, strchr   and strstr   are duplicated to make them type-safe  they can’t turn a const char∗ into a char∗ the way the C equivalents can . See also §36.3.2, §36.3.3, and §36.3.7.  C-Style String Numeric Conversions  p points to the ﬁrst character of s not used for the conversion;  b is the base of the number [2:36] or 0, meaning use C-source-code-style numbers  x=atof s   x=atoi s   x=atol s   x=atoll s   x=strtod s,p  x=strtof s,p  x=strtold s,p  x=strtol s,p,b  x=strtoll s,p,b  x=strtoul s,p,b  x=strtoull s,p,b   x is a double represented by s x is an int represented by s x is a long represented by s x is a long long represented by s x is a double represented by s x is a ﬂoat represented by s x is a long double represented by s; x is a long represented by s x is a long long represented by s x is an unsigned long represented by s x is an unsigned long long represented by s  The conversions to ﬂoating-point values set errno to ERANGE  §40.3  if their result doesn’t ﬁt into the target type. See also §36.3.5.  43.5  Memory The  memory  manipulation  functions  operate  on  ‘‘raw memory’’  no  type  known   through void∗ pointers  const void∗ pointers for memory that is only read :   1260  The C Standard Library  Chapter 43  q=memcpy p,p2,n   q=memmove p,p2,n  x=memcmp p,p2,n   q=memchr p,c,n   q=memset p,c,n  p=calloc n,s    p=malloc n    q=realloc p,n    free p   C-Style Memory Operations  Copy n bytes from p2 to p  like strcpy ; [p:p+n  and [p2:p2+n  may not overlap; q=p Copy n bytes from p2 to p; q=p Compare n bytes from p2 to the equivalent n bytes from p; x  Find c  converted to an unsigned char  in [p:p+n ; q points to that element; q=0 if c is not found Copy c  converted to an unsigned char  into each of [p:p+n ; q=p p points to n∗s bytes initialized to 0 on free store; p=nullptr if the bytes could not be allocated p points to n uninitialized bytes on free store; p=nullptr if the s bytes could not be allocated q points to n bytes on free store; p must be a pointer returned by malloc   or calloc  , or nullptr; if possible, reuse the space pointed to by p; if not, copy all bytes in the area pointed to by p to a new area; q=nullptr if s bytes could not be allocated Deallocate the memory pointed to by p; p must be nullptr or a pointer returned by malloc  , calloc  , or realloc    Note that malloc  , etc., does not invoke constructors and free   doesn’t inv oke destructors.  Do not use these functions for types with constructors or destructors. Also, memset   should never be used for any type with a constructor.  Note that realloc p,n  will reallocate  that is, copy  the data stored, from p onward, when it needs  more memory than is avaliable starting from p. For example:  int max = 1024; char∗ p = static_cast  malloc max  ; char∗ current_word = nullptr; bool in_word = false; int i=0; while  cin.get &p[i]  { if  isletter p[i]   { if  !in_word   current_word = p;  in_word = true;  } else  in_word = false;  if  ++i==max      ...  }  p = static_cast  realloc p,max∗=2  ;      double allocation  I hope you spotted the nasty bug: if realloc   was called, current_word may  may not  point to a loca- tion outside the current allocation pointed to by p.   Section 43.5  Memory   1261  Most uses of realloc   are better done using a vector  §31.4.1 . The mem∗ functions are found in   and the allocation functions in  .  43.6  Date and Time In  , you can ﬁnd several types and functions related to date and time:  Date and Time Types  clock_t time_t tm  An arithmetic type for holding short time intervals  maybe just a few minutes  An arithmetic type for holding long time intervals  maybe centuries  A struct for holding the time of a date  since year 1900   The struct tm is deﬁned like this:  struct tm {  int tm_sec; int tm_min; int tm_hour; int tm_mday;  int tm_mon; int tm_year;  int tm_wday;  int tm_yday;  int tm_isdst;     second of minute [0:61]; 60 and 61 represent leap seconds    minute of hour [0:59]    hour of day[0:23]    dayofmonth [1:31]    month of year [0:11]; 0 means Januar y note: not [1:12]     year since 1900; 0 means year 1900, and 115 means 2015    days since Sunday[0:6]; 0 means Sunday    days since Januar y1[0:365]; 0 means Januar y1    hours of daylight savings time  };  A system clock is supported by the function clock   supported by a few functions giving meaning to its return type clock_t:  t=clock     t=time pt    d=difftime t2,t1   ptm=localtime pt   ptm=gmtime pt   t=mktime ptm   p=asctime ptm   p=ctime t   n=strftime p,max,fmt,ptm   Date and Time Functions t is the number of clock ticks since the start of the program; t is a clock_t t is the current calendar time; pt is a time_t or nullptr; t is a clock_t; if pt!=nullptr ∗pt=t d is a double representing t2−t1 in seconds If pt==nullptr, ptm=nullptr; otherwise ptm points to the time_t local time for ∗pt If pt==nullptr, ptm=nullptr; otherwise ptm points to the time_t for Greenwich Mean Time  GMT  tm for ∗pt time_t for ∗ptm, or time_t −1  p is a C-style string representation for ∗ptm p=asctime localtime t   Copy ∗ptm into [p:p+n+1  controlled by the format string fmt; characters beyond [p:p+m  are discarded; n==0 in case of errors; p[n]=0   1262  The C Standard Library  Chapter 43  A example of the result of a call of asctime   is  "Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973\n"  Here is an example of how clock   can be used to time a function:  int main int argc, char∗ argv[]  {  int n = atoi argv[1] ;  clock_t t1 = clock  ; if  t1 == clock_t −1   {  cerr << "sorry, no clock\n"; exit 1 ;  }     clock_t -1  means "clock   didn’t wor k"  do_something  ;      timing loop  for  int i = 0; i<n; i++   clock_t t2 = clock  ; if  t2 == clock_t −1   {  cerr << "sorry, clock overﬂow\n"; exit 2 ;  } cout << "do_something   " << n << " times took "  << double t2−t1  CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " seconds" << "  measurement granularity: " << CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " of a second \n";  }  }  The explicit conversion double t2−t1  before dividing is necessary because clock_t might be an inte- ger. For values t1 and t2 returned by clock  , double t2−t1  CLOCKS_PER_SEC is the system’s best approximation of the time in seconds between the two calls.  Compare   with the facilities provided in  ; see §35.2. If clock   isn’t provided  for  a  processor  or  if  a  time  interval  is  too  long  to  measure, clock    The strftime   function uses a printf   format string to control the output of a tm. For example:  returns clock_t −1 .  void almost_C   {  const int max = 80; char str[max]; time_t t = time nullptr ; tm∗ pt = localtime &t ; strftime str,max,"%D, %H:%M  %I:%M%p \n",pt ; printf str ;  The output is something like:  06 28 12, 15:38  03:38PM   The strftime   formatting characters almost constitute a small programming language:   Section 43.6  Date and Time   1263  Date and Time Formatting  Abbreviated weekday name Full weekday name Abbreviated month name Full month name Date and time representation The year divided by 100 and truncated to a decimal integer [00:99] The day of the month as a decimal number [01:31] Equivalent to %m %d %y The day of the month as a decimal number [1:31]; a single digit is preceded by a space Equivalent to %Y−%m−%d; the ISO 8601 date format The last two digits of the week-based year as a decimal number [00:99] The week-based year as a decimal number  e.g., 2012  Equivalent to %b The hour  24-hour clock  as a decimal number [00:23] The hour  12-hour clock  as a decimal number [01:12] The day of the year as a decimal number [001:366] The month as a decimal number [01:12] The minute as a decimal number [00:59] A newline character The locale’s equivalent of AM PM for a 12-hour clock 12-hour clock time Equivalent to %H:%M The second as a decimal number [00:60] A horizontal-tab character Equivalent to %H:%M:%S; the ISO 8601 time format The ISO 8601 weekday as a decimal number [1:7]; Monday is 1 The week number of the year  the ﬁrst Sunday is the ﬁrst day of week 1  as a decimal number [00:53] The ISO 8601 week number as a decimal number [01:53] The weekday as a decimal number [0:6]; Sunday is 0  %V %w %W The week number of the year  the ﬁrst Monday is the ﬁrst day of week 1   as a decimal number [00:53] The locale’s appropriate date representation The locale’s appropriate time representation The last 2 digits of the year as a decimal number [00:99] The year as a decimal number  e.g., 2012  The offset from UTC in the ISO 8601 format −0430  4.5 hours behind UTC, Greenwich ; no characters if no time zone is determinable The locale’s time zone name or abbreviation; nothing if no time zone is known The character %  The locale referred to is the program’s global locale.  %a %A %b %B %c %C %d %D %e  %F %g %G %h %H %I %j %m %M %n %p %r %R %S %t %T %u %U  %x %X %y %Y %z  %Z %%   1264  The C Standard Library  Chapter 43  Some conversion speciﬁers can be modiﬁed by an E or O modiﬁer, indicating alternative imple-  mentation-speciﬁc and locale-speciﬁc formatting.

The purposes are   cid:129  To concisely list what is new in C++11  cid:129  To document differences that can cause problems for a programmer  cid:129  To point to ways of dealing with problems  Most compatibility problems surface when people try to upgrade a C program to a C++ program, try to port a C++ program from an older version of C++ to a newer one  e.g., C++98 to C++11 , or try to compile C++ using modern features with an older compiler. The aim here is not to enumer- ate every possible compatibility problem but rather to list the most frequently occurring problems and present their standard solutions.  When you look at compatibility issues, a key question to consider is the range of implementa- tions  under  which  a  program  needs  to  work.  For  learning  C++,  it  makes  sense  to  use  the  most   1268  Compatibility  Chapter 44  complete and helpful implementation. For delivering a product, a more conservative strategy might be in order to maximize the number of systems on which the product can run. In the past, this has been  a  reason   and  more  often  just  an  excuse   to  avoid  C++  features  deemed  novel.  However, implementations  are  converging,  so  the  need  for  portability  across  platforms  is  less  cause  for extreme caution than it once was.  44.2  C++11 Extensions First, I list the language features and standard-library components that have been added to C++ for the C++11 standard. Next, I discuss ways of coping with older versions  notably C++98 .  44.2.1  Language Features Looking at a list of language features can be quite bewildering.  Remember that a language feature is not meant to be used in isolation. In particular, most features that are new in C++11 make no sense in isolation from the framework provided by older features. The order is roughly that of ﬁrst occurrence in this book:  [1]  Uniform and general initialization using {}-lists  §2.2.2, §6.3.5  [2]  Type deduction from initializer: auto  §2.2.2, §6.3.6.1  [3]  Prevention of narrowing  §2.2.2, §6.3.5  [4]  Generalized and guaranteed constant expressions: constexpr  §2.2.3, §10.4, §12.1.6  [5]  Range-for-statement  §2.2.5, §9.5.1  [6]  Null pointer keyword: nullptr  §2.2.5, §7.2.2  [7]  Scoped and strongly typed enums: enum class  §2.3.3, §8.4.1  [8]  Compile-time assertions: static_assert  §2.4.3.3, §24.4  [9]  Language mapping of {}-list to std::initializer_list  §3.2.1.3, §17.3.4  [10]  Rvalue references  enabling move semantics; §3.3.2, §7.7.2  [11]  Nested template arguments ending with >>  no space between the >s; §3.4.1  [12]  Lambdas  §3.4.3, §11.4  [13]  Variadic templates  §3.4.4, §28.6  [14]  Type and template aliases  §3.4.5, §6.5, §23.6  [15]  Unicode characters  §6.2.3.2, §7.3.2.2  [16] [17]  Alignment controls: alignas and alignof  §6.2.9  [18]  The ability to use the type of an expression as a type in a declaration: decltype  §6.3.6.1  [19]  Raw string literals  §7.3.2.1  [20]  Generalized POD  §8.2.6  [21]  Generalized unions  §8.3.1  [22]  Local classes as template arguments  §11.4.2, §25.2.1  [23]  Sufﬁx return type syntax  §12.1.4  [24]  A syntax  for  attributes  and  two standard  attributes: [[carries_dependency]]  §41.3   and  long long integer type  §6.2.4   [[noreturn]]  §12.1.7   [25]  Preventing exception propagation: the noexcept speciﬁer  §13.5.1.1    Section 44.2.1  Language Features   1269  [26]  Testing for the possibility of a throw in an expression: the noexcept operator  §13.5.1.1  [27]  C99 features: extended integral types  i.e., rules for optional longer integer types; §6.2.4 ; concatenation  of  narrow wide  strings; __func__ and __STDC_HOSTED__  §12.6.2 ; _Pragma X   §12.6.3 ; vararg macros and empty macro arguments  §12.6  inline namespaces  §14.4.6   [28] [29]  Delegating constructors  §17.4.3  [30]  In-class member initializers  §17.4.4  [31]  Control of defaults: default  §17.6  and delete  §17.6.4  [32]  Explicit conversion operators  §18.4.2  [33]  User-deﬁned literals  §19.2.6  [34]  More explicit control of template instantiation: extern templates  §26.2.2  [35]  Default template arguments for function templates  §25.2.5.1  [36]  Inheriting constructors  §20.3.5.1  [37]  Override controls: override and ﬁnal  §20.3.4  [38]  Simpler and more general SFINAE rule  §23.5.3.2  [39]  Memory model  §41.2  [40]  Thread-local storage: thread_local  §42.2.8   I hav e not tried to list every minute change to C++98 in C++11. A historical perspective on these features can be found in §1.4.  44.2.2  Standard_Library Components The C++11 additions to the standard library come in two forms: new components  such as the regu- lar expression matching library  and improvements to C++98 components  such as move construc- tors for containers .  initializer_list constructors for containers  §3.2.1.3, §17.3.4, §31.3.2   [1] [2]  Move semantics for containers  §3.3.1, §17.5.2, §31.3.2  [3]  A singly-linked list: forward_list  §4.4.5, §31.4.2  [4]  Hash containers: unordered_map, unordered_multimap, unordered_set, and unordered_mul-  tiset  §4.4.5, §31.4.3   [5]  Resource management pointers: unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr  §5.2.1, §34.3  [6]  Concurrency support: thread  §5.3.1,  §42.2 ,  mutexes  §5.3.4,  §42.3.1 ,  locks   §5.3.4,  §42.3.2 , and condition variables  §5.3.4.1, §42.3.4   [7]  Higher-level concurrency support: packaged_thread, future, promise, and async    §5.3.5,  §42.4  tuples  §5.4.3, §28.5, §34.2.4.2   [8] [9]  Regular expressions: regex  §5.5, Chapter 37  [10]  Random numbers: uniform_int_distribution, normal_distribution,  random_engine, etc.   §5.6.3, §40.7   [11]  Integer type names, such as int16_t, uint32_t, and int_fast64_t  §6.2.8, §43.7  [12]  A ﬁxed-sized contiguous sequence container: array  §8.2.4, §34.2.1  [13]  Copying and rethrowing exceptions  §30.4.1.2  [14]  Error reporting using error codes: system_error  §30.4.3    1270  Compatibility  Chapter 44  [15] emplace   operations for containers  §31.3.6  [16]  Wide use of constexpr functions [17]  Systematic use of noexcept functions [18]  Improved function adaptors: function and bind    §33.5  [19] string to numeric value conversions  §36.3.5  [20]  Scoped allocators  §34.4.4  [21]  Type traits, such as is_integral and is_base_of  §35.4  [22]  Time utilities: duration and time_point  §35.2  [23]  Compile-time rational arithmetic: ratio  §35.3  [24]  Abandoning a process: quick_exit  §15.4.3  [25]  More algorithms, such as move  , copy_if  , and is_sorted    Chapter 32  [26]  Garbage collection ABI  §34.5  [27]  Low-level concurrency support: atomics  §41.3   More information about the standard library can be found in   cid:129  Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Part IV  cid:129  Implementation technique examples: vector  §13.6 , string  §19.3 , and tuple  §28.5   cid:129  The emerging specialized C++11 standard-library literature, such as [Williams,2012]  cid:129  A brief historical perspective can be found in §1.4.  44.2.3  Deprecated Features By deprecating a feature, the standards committee expresses the wish that the feature will go away  §iso.D .  However, the committee does not have a mandate to immediately remove a heavily used feature – however redundant or dangerous it may be. Thus, a deprecation is a strong hint to avoid the feature. It may disappear in the future. Compilers are likely to issue warnings for uses of dep- recated features.   cid:129  Generation of the copy constructor and the copy assignment is deprecated for a class with a  destructor. It is no longer allowed to assign a string literal to a char∗  §7.3.2 .   cid:129   cid:129  C++98 exception speciﬁcations are deprecated:  void f   throw X,Y ;     C++98; nowdeprecated  The support facilities for exception speciﬁcations, unexcepted_handler, set_unexpected  , get_unexpected  , and unexpected  , are  similarly  deprecated. Instead,  use noexcept  §13.5.1.1 .   cid:129  Some  C++  standard-library  function  objects  and  associated  functions  are  deprecated: pointer_to_binary_function, unary_function, ptr_fun  , mem_fun  , const_mem_fun_t, const_mem_fun1_t, const_mem_fun_ref_t, const_mem_fun_ref1_t, binder1st, bind1st  , binder2nd, bind2nd  . Instead, use function and bind    §33.5 .  pointer_to_unary_function,  mem_fun_ref1_t,  binary_function,  mem_fun_ref_t,  mem_fun1_t,  mem_fun_t,   cid:129  The auto_ptr is deprecated. Instead, use unique_ptr  §5.2.1, §34.3.1 .  In addition, the committee did remove the essentially unused expor t feature, because it was com- plex and not shipped by the major vendors.   Section 44.2.3  Deprecated Features   1271  C-style  casts  should  have  been  deprecated  when  the  named  casts   §11.5.2   were  introduced. Programmers  should  seriously  consider  banning  C-style  casts  from  their  own  programs. Where explicit type conversion is necessary, static_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast, or a combination of these can do what a C-style cast can. The named casts should be preferred because they are more explicit and more visible.  44.2.4  Coping with Older C++ Implementations C++ has been in constant use since 1983  §1.4 . Since then, several versions have  been deﬁned, and many separately developed implementations have emerged.  The fundamental aim of the stan- dards  effort  was  to  ensure  that  implementers  and  users  would  have  a  single  deﬁnition  of  C++  to work from. From 1998, programmers could rely on the ISO C++98 standard, and now we hav e the ISO C++11 standard.  Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for people to take their ﬁrst serious look at C++ using a ﬁve- year-old implementation. The typical reason is that such implementations are widely available and free.  Given a choice,  no  self-respecting  professional  would  touch  such  an  antique. Also,  many modern quality implementations are available for free. For a novice, older implementations come with serious hidden costs. The lack of language features and library support means that the novice must struggle with problems that have been eliminated in newer implementations. Using a feature- poor older implementation, especially if guided by an antique tutorial, warps the novice’s program- ming style and gives a biased view of what C++ is. The best subset of C++ to initially learn is not the set of low-level facilities  and not the common C and C++ subset; see §1.3 . In particular, to ease learning and to get a good initial impression of what C++ programming can be, I recommend relying on the standard library, and to heavily use classes, templates, and exceptions.  There are still places, where for political reasons or lack of suitable tool chains, C is preferred over C++.  If you must use C, write in the common subset of C and C++. That way, you gain some type safety, increase portability, and will be ready when C++ features become available to you. See also §1.3.3.  Use  an  implementation  that  conforms  to  the  standard  wherever possible,  and  minimize  the reliance  on  implementation-deﬁned  and  undeﬁned  aspects  of  the  language. Design  as  if  the  full language were available, and only use workarounds when necessary. This leads to better organized and more maintainable programs than designing for a lowest-common-denominator subset of C++. Also, use implementation-speciﬁc language extensions only when necessary. See also §1.3.2.  44.3  C C++ Compatibility With minor exceptions, C++ is a superset of C  meaning C11, deﬁned by ISO IEC 9899:2011 E  . Most  differences  stem  from  C++’s greater  emphasis  on  type  checking. Well-written  C  programs tend to be C++ programs as well. A compiler can diagnose every difference between C++ and C. The C99 C++11 incompatibilities are listed in §iso.C. At the time of writing, C11 is still very new and most C code is Classic C or C99.   1272  Compatibility  Chapter 44  44.3.1  C and C++ Are Siblings Classic C has two main descendants: ISO C and ISO C++. Over the years, these languages have ev olved at different paces and in different directions. One result of this is that each language pro- vides support for traditional C-style programming in slightly different ways. The resulting incom- patibilities can make life miserable for people who use both C and C++, for people who write in one language using libraries implemented in the other, and for implementers of libraries and tools for C and C++.  How can I call C and C++ siblings? Clearly, C++ is a descendant of C. However,  look at a  simpliﬁed family tree:  1967  Simula  BCPL  B  K&R C  Classic C  C with Classes  Early C++  ARM C++  C++98  C++11  C89  C99  C11  1978  1980  1985  1989  1998  2011  A solid line means a massive inheritance of features, a dashed line a borrowing of major features, and a dotted line a borrowing of minor features. From this, ISO C and ISO C++ emerge as the two major descendants of K&R C, and as siblings. Each carries with it the key aspects of Classic C, and neither is 100% compatible with Classic C. I picked the term ‘‘Classic C’’ from a sticker that used to be afﬁxed to Dennis Ritchie’s terminal.  It is K&R C plus enumerations and struct assignment.  Incompatibilities are nasty for programmers in part because they create a combinatorial explo-  sion of alternatives.  Consider a simple Venn diagram:   Section 44.3.1  C and C++ Are Siblings   1273  C89  C++98  C99  C++11  C11  The areas are not to scale. Both C++11 and C11 have  most of K&R C as a subset. C++11 has most of C11 as a subset. There are features belonging to most of the distinct areas. For example:  C89 only C99 only C++ only C89 and C99 C89 and C++ C++ and C99 C89, C++, and C99 C++11 only C11 only C++11 and C11  Call of undeclared function Variable-length arrays  VLAs  Templates Algol-style function deﬁnitions Use of the C99 keyword restrict as an identiﬁer    comments structs Move semantics  using rvalue references; &&  Type-generic expressions using the _Generic keyword Atomics  Note that differences between C and C++ are not necessarily the result of changes to C made in C++.  In several cases, the incompatibilities arise from features adopted incompatibly into C long after they were common in C++. Examples are the ability to assign a T∗ to a void∗ and the linkage of  global consts [Stroustrup,2002].  Sometimes, a feature  was  even incompatibly  adopted  into  C after it was part of the ISO C++ standard, such as details of the meaning of inline.  44.3.2  ‘‘Silent’’ Differences With  a  few exceptions,  programs  that  are  both  C++  and  C  have  the  same  meaning  in  both  lan- guages.  Fortunately, these exceptions  often referred to as silent differences  are rather obscure:   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   In C, the  size  of  a  character  constant  and  of  an  enumeration  equals sizeof int . sizeof 'a'  equals sizeof char . In C, an enumerator is an int, whereas a C++ implementation is allowed to choose whatever size is most appropriate for an enumeration  §8.4.2 . In C++, the name of a struct is entered into the scope in which it is declared; in C, it is not. Thus, the name of a C++ struct declared in an inner scope can hide the name in an outer scope.  For example:  In C++,   1274  Compatibility  Chapter 44  int x[99]; void f   {  }  struct x { int a; }; sizeof x ; sizeof struct x ;    * sizeofthe array inC,sizeofthe struct in C++*   * sizeofthe struct*   44.3.3  C Code That Is Not C++ The C C++ incompatibilities that cause most real problems are not subtle. Most are easily caught by compilers. This section gives examples of C code that is not C++. Most are deemed poor style or even obsolete in modern C. A comprehensive list of incompatibilities can be found in §iso.C.   cid:129   In C, most functions can be called without a previous declaration. For example:  int main   {     not C++; poor style in C  double sq2 = sqrt 2 ;  printf "the square root of 2 is %g\n",sq2 ;   * call undeclared function*   * call undeclared function*   Complete and consistent use of function declarations  function prototypes  is generally rec- ommended for C. Where that sensible advice is followed, and especially where C compilers provide options to enforce it, C code conforms to the C++ rule. Where undeclared functions are called, you have to know the functions and the rules for C pretty well to know whether you  have  made  a  mistake or introduced  a  portability  problem. For example,  the  previous main   contains at least two errors as a C program. In C, a function  declared  without  specifying  any argument  types  can  take any  number  of arguments of any type at all.  void f  ;   * argument types not mentioned*   void g   {  f 2 ;    * poor style in C; not C++*   Such use is deemed obsolete in ISO C. In C, functions can be deﬁned using a syntax that optionally speciﬁes argument types after the list of arguments:  void f a,p,c  char ∗p; char c; {  * ...*  }   * C; not C++*   Such deﬁnitions must be rewritten:  void f int a, char∗ p, char c  {  * ...*  }   cid:129   In C, structs can be deﬁned in return type and argument type declarations. For example:  }  }   cid:129    cid:129    Section 44.3.3  C Code That Is Not C++  1275  struct S { int x,y; } f  ; void g struct S { int x,y; } y ;   * C; not C++*   * C; not C++*   The C++ rules for deﬁning types make such declarations useless, and they are not allowed. In C, integers can be assigned to variables of enumeration type:   cid:129   enum Direction { up, down }; enum Direction d = 1;   * error :int assigned to Direction; OK in C*    cid:129  C++ provides many more keywords than C does. If one of these appears as an identiﬁer in a  C program, that program must be modiﬁed to make it a C++ program:  C++ Keywords That Are Not C Keywords  alignas  bitor  compl  explicit  new or_eq  static_cast  try xor   alignof bool const_cast false noexcept  private  template typeid  xor_eq  and  catch constexpr  friend  not protected  this  typename  and_eq char16_t  decltype  inline not_eq  public  thread_local using   asm  char32_t  delete mutable  nullptr  reinterpret_cast throw  virtual   bitand class dynamic_cast namespace operator static_asser t true wchar_t   cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   In addition, the word expor t is reserved for future use. C99 adopted inline. In C, some of the C++ keywords are macros deﬁned in standard headers:  C++ Keywords That Are C Macros  and  or   and_eq  or_eq   bitand  true  bitor wchar_t   bool  xor  compl xor_eq  false   not   not_eq  This implies that in C they can be tested using ifdef, redeﬁned, etc. In C, a global data object may be declared several times in a single translation unit without using the extern speciﬁer. As long as at most one such declaration provides an initializer, the object is considered deﬁned only once. For example:  int i; int i;  * just another declaration of a single integer ‘‘i’’; not C++*   In C++, an entity must be deﬁned exactly once; §15.2.3. In C, a void∗ may be used as the right-hand operand of an assignment to or initialization of a variable of any pointer type; in C++ it may not  §7.2.1 . For example:  void f int n  {  }  int∗ p = malloc n∗sizeof int  ;  * not C++; in C++, allocate using ‘‘new’’*   This is probably the single most difﬁcult incompatibility to deal with. Note that the implicit conversion of a void∗ to a different pointer type is not in general harmless:   1276  Compatibility  Chapter 44  char ch; void∗ pv = &ch; int∗ pi = pv; ∗pi = 666;     not C++    overwr itech and other bytes near ch  If you use both languages, cast the result of malloc   to the right type. If you use only C++, avoid malloc  . In C, the type of a string literal is ‘‘array of char,’’ but in C++ it is ‘‘array of const char,’’ so:   cid:129   char∗ p = "a string literal is not mutable";  p[7] = 'd';     error in C++; OK in C   cid:129  C allows transfer of control to a labeled statement  a switch or a goto; §9.6  to bypass an  initialization; C++ does not. For example:     OK in C; not C++  goto foo;     ... {  int x = 1;  foo:  }  if  x!=1  abort  ;  * ...*    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129    cid:129   In C, a global const by default has external linkage; in C++ it does not and must be initial- ized, unless explicitly declared extern  §7.5 .  For example:  const int ci;     OK in C; const not initialized error in C++  In C, names of nested structures are placed in the same scope as the structure in which they are nested. For example:  struct S {  struct T {  * ...*  } t;    ...  };  struct T x;     OK in C,meaning ‘‘S::T x;’’; not C++  In C++, the name of a class is entered into the scope in which it is declared; thus it cannot have the same name as another type declared in that scope. For example:  struct X {  * ...*  }; typedef int X;     OK in C; not C++  In C, an array  can  be  initialized  by  an  initializer  that  has  more  elements  than  the  array requires.  For example:  char v[5] = "Oscar"; printf "%s",v ;      OK in C,the terminating 0 is not used; not C++    likely disaster   Section 44.3.3.1  ‘‘Classic C’’ Problems   1277  44.3.3.1  ‘‘Classic C’’ Problems  Should you need to upgrade Classic C programs  ‘‘K&R C’’  or C89 programs, a few more prob- lems will emerge:   cid:129  C89 does not have the    comments  though most C89 compilers added them :  int x;     not C89   cid:129   In C89, the type speciﬁer defaults to int  known as ‘‘implicit int’’ .  For example:  const a = 7;   * in C89, type int assumed; not C++ or C99*    * f  ’sretur ntype is int bydefault; not C++ or C99*   f    {  }   * ..*   44.3.3.2  C Features Not Adopted by C++  A few additions to C99  compared with C89  were deliberately not adopted in C++: [1]  Variable-length arrays  VLAs ; use vector or some form of dynamic array [2]  Designated initializers; use constructors  The  C11  features  are  too  new to hav e been  considered  for  C++,  except  for  features  such  as  the memory model and atomics  §41.3  that came from C++.  44.3.4  C++ Code That Is Not C This section lists facilities offered by C++ but not by C  or adopted by C years after their introduc- tion in C++, as marked, so that they may be missing in old C compilers . The features are sorted by purpose.  However, many classiﬁcations are possible, and most features serve multiple purposes, so this classiﬁcation should not be taken too seriously.   cid:129  Features primarily for notational convenience:    comments  §2.2.1, §9.7 ; added to C99  const in constant expressions  §2.2.3, §10.4.2   [1] [2]  Support for restricted character sets  §iso.2.4 ; partially added to C99 [3]  Support for extended character sets  §6.2.3 ; added to C99 [4]  Non-constant initializers for objects in static storage  §15.4.1  [5] [6]  Declarations as statements  §9.3 ; added to C99 [7]  Declarations in for-statement initializers  §9.5 ; added to C99 [8]  Declarations in conditions  §9.4.3  [9]  Structure names need not be preﬁxed by struct  §8.2.2  [10]  Anonymous unions  §8.3.2 ; added to C11   cid:129  Features primarily for strengthening the type system:  [1]  Function argument type checking  §12.1 ; partially added to C  §44.3.3  [2]  Type-safe linkage  §15.2, §15.2.3  [3]  Free-store management using new and delete  §11.2    1278  Compatibility  Chapter 44  const  §7.5, §7.5 ; partially added to C  [4] [5]  The Boolean type bool  §6.2.2 ; partially added to C99 [6]  Named casts  §11.5.2    cid:129  Facilities for user-deﬁned types:  virtual functions and abstract classes  §20.3.2, §20.4   [1]  Classes  Chapter 16  [2]  Member functions  §16.2.1  and member classes  §16.2.13  [3]  Constructors and destructors  §16.2.5, Chapter 17  [4]  Derived classes  Chapter 20, Chapter 21  [5] [6]  Public protected private access control  §16.2.3, §20.5  [7] [8]  Pointers to members  §20.6  [9] [10] mutable members  §16.2.9.3  [11]  Operator overloading  Chapter 18  [12]  References  §7.7   static members  §16.2.12   friends  §19.4    cid:129  Features primarily for program organization  in addition to classes :  Inline functions  §12.1.3 ; added to C99  [1]  Templates  Chapter 23  [2]  [3]  Default arguments  §12.2.5  [4]  Function overloading  §12.3  [5]  Namespaces  §14.3.1  [6]  Explicit scope qualiﬁcation  operator ::; §6.3.4  [7]  Exceptions  §2.4.3.1, Chapter 13  [8]  Run-Time Type Identiﬁcation  Chapter 22  [9]  Generalized constant expressions  constexpr; §2.2.3, §10.4, §12.1.6   The C++11 features listed in §44.2 are not in C.  The keywords added by C++  §44.3.3  can be used to spot most C++-speciﬁc facilities.  How- ev er, some facilities, such as function overloading and consts in constant expressions, are not iden- tiﬁed by a keyword.  C++’s linking for functions is type-safe, whereas C’s rules do not require type safety when link- ing  functions. This  implies  that  on  some   most?   implementations,  a  C++  function  must  be declared extern  "C" to  be  compiled  as  C++  and  also  conform  to  C  calling  conventions   §15.2.5 . For example:  double sin double ;  extern "C" double cos double ;      maynot link to C code    will link to C code  The __cplusplus macro can be used to determine whether a program is being processed by a C or a C++ compiler  §15.2.5 .  In addition to the features listed, the C++ library  §30.1.1, §30.2  is mostly C++-speciﬁc. The C standard library offers type-generic macros in   and _Complex number support in <com- plex.h>, approximating  .  C also offers  , offering _Bool and the alias bool to approximate C++’s bool.   Section 44.4  Advice   1279  44.4  Advice [1]  Before using a new feature in production code, try it out by writing small programs to test the  standards conformance and performance of the implementations you plan to use; §44.1.  [2]  For  learning  C++,  use  the  most  up-to-date  and  complete  implementation  of  Standard  C++  [3]  The common  subset  of  C  and  C++  is  not  the  best  initial  subset  of  C++  to  learn;  §1.2.3,  that you can get access to; §44.2.4.  §44.2.4.  [4]  Prefer standard facilities to nonstandard ones; §36.1, §44.2.4. [5]  Avoid deprecated features such as throw-speciﬁcations; §44.2.3, §13.5.1.3. [6]  Avoid C-style casts; §44.2.3, §11.5. [7]   ‘‘Implicit int’’  has  been  banned,  so  explicitly  specify  the  type  of  every  function,  variable, const, etc.; §44.3.3.  [8]  When converting a C program to C++, ﬁrst make sure that function declarations  prototypes   and standard headers are used consistently; §44.3.3.  [9]  When converting a C program to C++, rename variables that are C++ keywords; §44.3.3. [10]  For portability and type safety, if you must use C, write in the common subset of C and C++;  §44.2.4.  [11]  When converting a C program to C++, cast the result of malloc   to the proper type or change  all uses of malloc   to uses of new; §44.3.3.  [12]  When converting  from malloc   and free    to new and delete, consider  using vector,  push_back  , and reserve   instead of realloc  ; §3.4.2, §43.5.  [13]  When converting a C program to C++, remember that there are no implicit conversions from  ints to enumerations; use explicit type conversion where necessary; §44.3.3, §8.4.  [14]  A facility deﬁned in namespace std is deﬁned in a header without a sufﬁx  e.g., std::cout is  declared in   ; §30.2.  [15]  Use   to get std::string    holds the C-style string functions ; §15.2.4. [16]  For each standard C header   that places names in the global namespace, the header    places the names in namespace std; §15.2.2.  [17]  Use extern "C" when declaring C functions; §15.2.5.
