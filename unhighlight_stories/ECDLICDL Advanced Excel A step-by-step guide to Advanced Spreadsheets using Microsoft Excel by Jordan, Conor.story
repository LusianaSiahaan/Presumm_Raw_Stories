Contents   Section 1 – Formatting  Apply Conditional Formatting  This applies formatting to cells depending on the value of the cells. This can be used to highlight values that are lower or higher than average e.g. when calculating profit or loss. Users can apply suitable formatting depending on the rules set for a range of cells. This makes viewing values in a spreadsheet easier.  1.  Open the workbook ‘Conditional Formatting’  2.  Highlight cells B3 to G3 3.  On the Home tab in the Styles group, select Conditional  Formatting  4.  Select New Rule   5.  Select Format Only Cells that Contain 6.

Save the worksheet as “Sales”   Custom Number Formats  Users of spreadsheets can determine how numbers will appear according to different formats. Custom number formats allow users to adjust how dates and time appears, whether a digit should appear in a range of cells or whether there should be a thousand or decimal separator. This is useful as if keeps the same formatting for a range of cells in a spreadsheet. d m h  0 ? , .  Day number e.g. 4 Month e.g. 6 hours Displays only digits Displays leading zeros Adds spaces either side of decimal point Thousands separator Decimal separator  Custom Number Formats  1.

Right-click on another Sheet Tab and choose Unhide 11.                      Click OK   Save as a Template  Excel allows users to save spreadsheet templates that can be used repeatedly. This is useful for tasks that are repeated often such as the creation of an invoice. The formatting and appearance of a template will be the same each time a user opens it. It is also possible to modify an existing template. This allows the user to adjust the contents of a template that can be used again and again.  1.

Hide rows 4 & 5 in the worksheet 7.  Save the workbook as a template named ‘Budget’   Section 2 – Formulas & Functions  Date & Time  There are formulas that can be used to display date and time in a spreadsheet. This can be used to show only today’s date for instance. The time and date can them be updated whenever a user wants to use a template without having to enter the date or time manually for example.  In cell B2, enter =today   In cell B3, enter =now   In cell B4, enter =day B2  cell In cell B4, enter =month B2  In cell B4, enter =year B2   This enters today’s date This enters the current date & time This enters the day value of the selected  This enters the month value of a cell This enters the year value of a cell   And, Or & Not  Logical functions such as And, Or & Not are used to determine if the contents of selected cells meet certain specified criteria. The answer cell will display a true or false statement depending on whether the criteria met is true or false. For instance, if you want to check whether a calculation is correct among two separate cells, you can use the And function to see whether the answer is True depending on the calculation performed. The Or function is used to specify whether two conditions are met. The Not function is used to determine whether a calculation is Not meeting certain conditions.  1.  Create the following worksheet:  2.  Select cell E3 3.  On the Formulas tab in the Function Library select Logical 4.  Select AND   5.  Select cell D3 6.  Click OK 7.
