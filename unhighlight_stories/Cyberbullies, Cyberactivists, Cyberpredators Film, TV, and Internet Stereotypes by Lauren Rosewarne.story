Advance Praise for  Cyberbullies, Cyberactivists, Cyberpredators  “Lauren Rosewarne’s Cyberbullies, Cyberactivists, Cyberpredators: Film, TV,  and Internet Stereotypes is mind-boggling. The scholarship is beyond com- prehensive and the analysis is astute, clear, and fair-minded. This book is  a treasure for students of popular culture and for anyone interested in the  demonization of technology.”  —David Anderegg, PhD, Professor of Psychology,  Bennington College Author of Nerds: How Dorks, Dweebs, Technies and  Trekkies Can Save America  “Timely, engaging and witty, Dr. Rosewarne’s book explores a fascinating  paradox: the real world’s enthusiastic and loving embrace of the Internet  contrasted  with  the Web’s  dangerous  and  often  horrific  reflection  in  the  media. Focusing on the dramatic depiction of the users and losers hiding  anonymously behind computer screens—netgeeks, nerds, neckbeards, hat- ers, hackers, perverts, and gothic misanthropes, Dr. Rosewarne smoothly  integrates her provocative viewpoint with hundreds of media examples and  wide-ranging research in psychology, sociology, law, media criticism, gender,  and racial studies. She succeeds in exposing our fears about this technology  as a medium of crime, rape culture, terrorism, and xenophobia.”  —Dan Dinello, Professor Emeritus,   Columbia College Chicago Author of Technophobia! Science Fiction Visions of  Posthuman Technology  “Lauren Rosewarne has an encyclopedic knowledge of geeks, computer nerds,  cyberbullies, cyberpredators, and other dodgy denizens of the Internet. This  book displays not only her amazingly in-depth knowledge of these stereo- types as they are portrayed in popular culture but her sophisticated analysis  of why they tend to be so negative, all wrapped up in entertaining prose.”  —Deborah Lupton, Centenary Professor, Faculty of  Arts & Design, University of Canberra Author of Digital Sociology   “This detailed and thoughtful treatment of mass mediated depictions of  the Internet  and its users  makes a significant contribution to contempo- rary media studies. The book systematically examines the way television  and film characterize, narrativize, and often demonize the Internet and  its users. Lauren Rosewarne offers an exhaustive study of representations  of cybersex, cybergeography, cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and cyberac- tivism. Her work is a must read for students and scholars interested in  the ways new technologies are incorporated and symbolized into modern  society.”  —A. Susan Owen, PhD, Professor,   University of Puget Sound Co-author of Bad Girls: Cultural Politics and Media  Representations of Transgressive Women  “Rosewarne  covers  a  wide  range  of  cyber-subjects  and  subjectivities  in  an  approachable,  yet  meticulous  manner,  analyzing  hundreds  of  films,  programs, games, and other key texts central to digital culture. Readers,  students and researchers interested in the Internet and cyber-culture as a  site of power, desire, and identity will no-doubt find this comprehensive  and probing book essential reading.”  —Derek A. Burrill, Associate Professor, Dept. of   Media and Cultural Studies, UC Riverside Author of Die Tryin’: Videogames,   Masculinity, Culture  “Rosewarne shines the light on cyber tropes and stereotypes used in a vari- ety of media outlets. The text is an admirable mix of theoretical assessment  and pop culture references that helps everyone from academics to casual  media users understand the cumulative power of media representations.”  —Patrice A. Oppliger, PhD, Assistant Professor of  Mass Communication, Boston University Author of Bullies and Mean Girls in Popular Culture  “Lauren Rosewarne’s Cyberbullies, Cyberactivists, Cyberpredators provides  a rich and vibrant ethnography of several major online personality types.  This book will introduce the reader to a cast of delightfully eccentric char-   acters: the netgeek, the neckbeard, the bully, the hacker, the predator, the  pervert. As Dr. Rosewarne clearly demonstrates, these Internet archetypes  are sometimes beautiful, sometimes frightening, and always fascinating.  Best of all, Dr. Rosewarne uses lively and engaging descriptive prose to  show how these Internet personality types are represented  and often mis- represented  in a wide variety of popular films and television shows. This  book will be of great interest to scholars who study the sociology, anthro- pology, psychology, or history of the Internet, and anyone who wants to  learn about the complexities of representation in popular culture.”  —Lewis Call, Associate Professor and Chair of   History, California Polytechnic State University,   San Luis Obispo Author of BDSM in American Science Fiction   and Fantasy  “Cyberbullies, Cyberactivists, Cyberpredators addresses the construction of  Internet culture as both dangerous and threatening. Elucidating on such  topics as the netgeek, hacker, and cybergoth, Rosewarne critiques repre- sentations of gender, race, sexuality, disability, and even vegetarianism in  a lucidly written account of our technophobic media culture.”  —Sarah E. S. Sinwell, Assistant Professor,   Department of Film and Media Arts, University of Utah  “For  scholars  and  consumers  of  media,  this  is  a  skillfully  constructed,  must-read text. Lauren Rosewarne’s contribution provides a much needed  examination of contemporary and controversial discourses inherent with- in digital spaces and media technologies. This book makes a significant  addition to the emergent scholarship on contemporary engagements with  the nature of identity and stereotyping in the digital era. The taxonomy  proposed has the ability to contextualize mainstream controversies cur- rently manifesting in digital spaces that are eroding the experiences for  some marginalized users.”  —Kishonna L. Gray, PhD, Assistant Professor,   School of Justice Studies, Eastern Kentucky University Author of Race, Gender, and Deviance in Xbox Live:  Theoretical Perspectives from the Virtual Margins   “In  Cyberbullies,  Cyberactivists,  Cyberpredators  Lauren  Rosewarne  spot- lights some of the dark and disturbing recesses of popular culture and  the Internet. What happens, she asks, when past oddball stereotypes be- come mainstream . . . when yesterday’s movies and today’s virtual reality  become—real? Cyberbullies deftly illuminates disparities between media  representations and media-saturated reality. Parts are NSFW.”  —Thomas J. Misa, Director, Charles Babbage Institute,  University of Minnesota Editor of Gender Codes: Why Women Are   Leaving Computing  “Lauren Rosewarne’s book provides a deep perspective on how society has  come to perceive, and represent, the many faces of people who have made  their lives around the Internet and the technologies that drive it. Society’s  relationship with technology, the Internet and its inhabitants is compli- cated and portrayed as something to be feared. Rosewarne takes the reader  through a detailed and insightful view of six common cyber-stereotypes  and provides a thoroughly referenced analysis of how they are portrayed  in film, TV, the news, and the Internet itself. Through this, Rosewarne  examines the roots of this largely negative portrayal to an explanation of  why the Internet and the people commonly associated with it should be   mis represented in this way.  This is a fascinating book that anyone who is interested in how technology  shapes society should read. This is especially true of the journalists, TV, and  film writers and producers largely responsible for these views. Rosewarne’s  book is a fascinating and highly readable analysis that is thoroughly researched  and referenced.”  —Dr David Glance, Director, UWA Centre for   Software Practice Co-Author of Security and the Networked Society   Cyberbullies,   Cyberactivists,  Cyberpredators    Cyberbullies,  Cyberactivists,  Cyberpredators Film, TV, and Internet Stereotypes  Lauren Rosewarne   Copyright   2016 by Lauren Rosewarne All rights reserved.

They could follow him on Twitter. Like him on Face- book. They could murder him on Craigslist. A gag, of course, but timed well  to coincide with my writing of this book. In his quip, Corden referenced  the common way that the Craigslist website has come to be thought of  in the wake of its link to several high-profile murders; one that was at  the center of the television biopic The Craigslist Killer  2011 . Broader  than Craigslist, however, the idea of the Internet as a thing, a place, and a  broadcast device that can be used to experience and inflict evil has been a  theme in film and television for over twenty years. Corden himself starred  in the British biopic One Chance  2013 , one of over 500 popular media  examples discussed in this book where the Internet is frequently depicted  as dangerous. In one scene, the protagonist, Paul Potts  Corden , was on  a first date with a woman he had met online, Julz  Alexandra Roach .  Soon into the date Julz receives a telephone call: “Oh, it’s just my mum,”  she  explains  to  Paul,  “making  sure  that  I’m  still  alive  and  you  haven’t  murdered me.” Given Paul’s pleasant demeanor and the frothy nature of  the film, the remark is humorous, but it’s also poignant because whether  presented  as  a  joke,  a  fear,  or  an  eventuality,  time  and  time  again  the  Internet and, more specifically, its users are portrayed in screen fiction as  malevolent.  This strange and skewed presentation has, in fact, been on my radar  since April 1999. I was in my second year of university, I didn’t have class  that day and, coincidentally, it was my birthday. As is often the case during    x   I n T R O D U C T I O n  big media events—for better, for worse1—television news was reporting  on the Columbine massacre throughout the day. During the coverage,  and more so in the days that followed, mentioned repeatedly was that  the teen perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, enjoyed playing  computer games like Doom and Quake. I was struck by how reports per- sistently mentioned that computers had been seized from the perpetrators  homes, that the boys gamed with one another using networked machines,  and, notably, that the duo may have “used the Internet to predict and  boast about when the massacre would take place.”2 Widely reported was  Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas’s speculation that the  “Internet is very involved in this case.”3 The Internet was, according to the  news media, apparently every bit as culpable as the teen gunmen.4  In  the  years  that  followed,  Internet-themed  “clues”  would  be  men- tioned in a wide variety of crime reports. In the aftermath of the Vir- ginia Tech massacre in 2007, the perpetrator, Seung-Hui Cho, would be  revealed as a fan of online games including Counterstrike. Following the  massacre  in  Norway  in  2011,  Anders  Breivik  would  be  exposed  as  an  avid player of Call of Duty. During my preparation of this manuscript,  Vincent Stanford in Australia was arrested for murder: his fondness for  online gaming was frequently reported.5 In these examples and dozens  like them, the Internet, and specifically first-person shooter games, are  presented as playing a key role in crime: as somehow fueling violent fan- tasies and training killers.  While  game  play  was  mentioned  repeatedly  in  these  reports—thus  complying  well  with  the  powerful  effects  thesis  of  the  media  that  posi- tions  computer  games  as  highly  influential  and,  notably,  coercively  malevolent6—inflammatory reporting on game play is just one example  of how online activity gets framed in news coverage and, increasingly in  popular discourse. The Internet, for example, was considered complicit in  the German cannibalism case from 2001: Armin Meiwes had gone online  to recruit a young, well-built man who wanted to be eaten  a story that,  incidentally, became a subplot in the Australian horror film Feed [2005] .  In 2005 in Japan, Hiroshi Maeue used the Internet to frequent an online  suicide club: Maeue made suicide pacts with three people who he later  murdered  a storyline used in the Irish drama Love Eternal [2013] . In  2007 in the United States, Michael John Anderson advertised for a nanny  on Craigslist. He lured applicant Katherine Ann Olson to his home and  murdered her. Anderson became the first murderer to get the moniker the  “Craigslist Killer,” a label that has since been extended to numerous other  killers who also used the classifieds website to source victims.      I n T R O D U C T I O n    xi  The negative framing of the Internet in news media is curious because  despite years of research demonstrating that the powers of the media are  much  more  modest  than  earlier  hypodermic  syringe  models  proposed,  in practice such research gets readily ignored: Many people still want to  believe that there is an explanation for bad things; the persuasive powers of  the media being the default answer. Second, this negative media coverage  has been transpiring at the very same time that Internet use has become  ubiquitous. Nowadays we’re all barely an arm stretch away from doing a  Google search. Our smart phones are constantly pinging, reminding us of  our permanent connectivity. To most of us, the idea of it seeming nerdy  to always be online seems like an anachronistic archetype: either we’re all  nerds now or more likely, mere computer use is no longer central to the  definition.  Despite  all  the  changes  happening  in  real  life  regarding  our  fervent  embrace of technology and our constant connectivity, film and television  tell a very different story. Be it in news reports portraying online gaming,  online dating, and online trading as red flags, or in the raft of fictional  representations  of  users  as  creepy,  perverted,  or  dangerous,  a  paradox  exists: Internet use on screen is invariably a signifier of something bad. Be  it social isolation, social awkwardness, deviancy, or malicious intent, the  Internet continues to be framed as dangerous technology.  I didn’t intend to write a book exclusively about negative stereotypes;  in fact, even though I kept seeing strange and clichéd presentations play  out in news media, my lived experience and the clear way technology has  impacted—largely for the better—our lives tricked me into thinking that  popular  media  may  have  evolved  from  the  treatments  offered  in  early  World Wide Web–era films with foreboding titles like The Net  1995 ,  The Digital Prophet  1996 , Killer Net  1998 , Every Mother’s Worst Fear   1998  and The Cyberstalking  1999 . Into the 2000s, however, films like  FearDotCom  2002 , Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life  2005 , and Cyber- stalker  2012  are still being produced and the Internet persists as a screen  bogeyman.  As  I  watched  a  veritable  torrent  of  films  and  television  episodes  in  preparation  for  this  manuscript—clustering  them  into  narrative-theme  categories—the negativity was overwhelming: on screen, if attention gets  drawn to a character’s Internet use, it’s invariably a signifier of trouble.  Such negativity is partly explained by the dramatic effect argument—as  I explored previously in my research on menstruation, rarely is an ordi- nary bodily function depicted on screen unless it serves a narrative pur- pose or reveals something about the character.7 Therefore, perhaps with    xii   I n T R O D U C T I O n  Internet use as common as eating, breathing, or indeed menstruating, it is  no surprise that normal or casual Internet use is largely absent.  And yet, when the Internet is a theme—when characters date online,  or when a crime is being investigated—the technology predictably is pre- sented as a clue, a risk factor, and a rationale for deviance or danger.  This  book  centers  its  analysis  on  the  depiction  of  the  Internet  user.  Of  the  many  characters  who  get  defined  by  their  online  activity—the  geek, the neckbeard, the cyberbully, the hacker, the cyberpredator, and  the cyberperv—their Internet use is at the heart of their characterization:  they are socially isolated, criminals and perverts because of their Internet  use.  Such  portrayals  provide  an  opportunity  to  analyze  how  our  fears,  anxieties, and assumptions about strange and unwieldy technology are  represented in our entertainment media.  While  early  Internet  films  are  discussed  in  this  book—for  example,  the sci-fi film WarGames  1983 , which is often considered one of the  earliest depictions of the technology—this book largely concentrates on  portrayals in post-1990 films and television episodes that coincide with  the rapid spread of the Web, and in turn fictionalize the revolution of  information accessibility, security, communications, and socialization, if  not also humanity.  In focusing my study on portrayals of Internet users, I have been able to  further my own research into the way popular media tackles very human,  very bodily topics like gender and sexuality, deviancy and crime. Equally,  I have been able to extend my work on the relationship between real-life  and screen depictions, and society versus Hollywood, in turn proposing  a range of ways to think about this often fraught interplay that is both  entertaining, influential and also sometimes highly concerning.   1  He’s a little strange but he’s a  genius: The netgeek  Social awkwardness, an anachronistic dress sense, and general fanaticism  are attributes frequently used in film and television to clue an audience  in  to  the  nerdiness  or  geekiness  of  a  character.  While  in  popular  par- lance, as well as on screen, such labels are frequently used interchange- ably,1 nerd and geek do have disparate meanings that are often vigorously  defended: The nerd is generally characterized by a high intellect thus mak- ing  encounters  with  “ordinary”  people  fraught,  and  the  geek  harbors  a  manic obsession  think comic books or computer games  leading to simi- lar ostracism.2 Both nerds and geeks are discussed together in this chapter  due to the commonalities in their presentations. Something that often  unites both is technology: The nerd invariably has an advanced interest in  and knowledge of technology, and, while not always the geek’s obsession,  technology  is  often  integral  in  facilitating  other  obsessions—computer  games being an example.3  While this chapter focuses on the Internet as technology that preoc- cupies  nerd  and  geek  characters,  in  fact,  both  had  a  pop  culture  pres- ence  long  before  the  World  Wide  Web.  The  overzealous  teacher’s  pet  Eugene  Eddie Deezen  in Grease  1978 , the computer science students  of Revenge of the Nerds  1984 , or the nerdy backyard inventors like Data   Jonathan Ke Quan  in The Goonies  1985  and Wayne in Honey, I Shrunk  the Kids  1989  helped lay the groundwork for the tropes associated with  the Internet-era nerd that I dub “The Netgeek” in this chapter. In Grease,  Eugene, with his thick glasses, formal—or “square”—attire, and whiny    2   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  voice was the perpetual victim of the T-Birds bullying. In Revenge of the  Nerds and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids the nerds were similarly characterized  by their thick-framed glasses, pocket protectors, and sartorial stuffiness,  often accented by neckties. Data in The Goonies added another attribute  to the stereotype, and one analyzed later in this chapter: He was Asian.  Like the nerd, the geek first appeared on screen well before mainstream  Internet use, notably, in many incarnations completely separate from it:  The comic book geek, Eugene  Jerry Lewis , in the musical-comedy Artists  and Models  1955  is an early example. Eugene didn’t merely love comics  but spent his nights dreaming about them.4 The character, in fact, blamed  comic books for his social—and seemingly also psychological—peculiarities:  “I almost became a dope reading comic books and I realised that is why I  am a little retarded.” More recent characterizations include music obsessed  Barry   Jack  Black   in  the  drama  High  Fidelity   2000 ,  Seymour   Steve  Buscemi  and his vinyl records in the drama Ghost World  2001 , Andy   Steve Carell  and his action figures in the comedy The 40-Year-Old Vir- gin  2005 , Augie  Christopher Mintz-Plasse  and his medieval role-play  in the comedy Role Models  2008 , and Dave  Aaron Taylor-Johnson  in  the action-comedy Kick-Ass  2010 , who like Eugene in Artists and Mod- els, was also fanatical about comic books. While these characters are not  obsessed with computers, nevertheless, akin to the pre-Internet nerds in  Grease, Revenge of the Nerds, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and The Goonies,  each character possesses qualities like social awkwardness, outdated cloth- ing, and a lack of success with members of the opposite sex; attributes also  typical for the Internet-age geeks dubbed netgeeks in this chapter.  While the netgeek is invariably a stereotype associated with men—and  while thus far I have indeed only mentioned male geeks and nerds—factors  including the successes of feminism, the mainstreaming of technology,  and the rise of “geek chic” have seen an increase in female netgeek charac- ters. While nerdy Lisa in The Simpsons  1989–  initially predated the Web  and technology has never been central to her nerdiness, the nerdiness of  many contemporary female characters does indeed center on computing:  Mac  Tina Majorino  from the mystery series Veronica Mars  2004–2007   and Penelope Garcia  Kirsten Vangsness  in the crime-drama Criminal  Minds  2005–  are two examples of a small but growing number of female  netgeeks who, while sharing the social awkwardness and uncoolness of  their  male  counterparts,  also  embody  attributes  marking  them  as  dis- tinctly modern.  This  chapter  begins  with  a  discussion  of  some  of  the  challenges  associated  with  identifying  the  netgeek  character  and  then  focuses  on       T H E   n E T G E E K    3  examining,  and  also  problematizing,  their  social,  physical,  intellectual,  and racial attributes.  Identifying the Netgeek  In an age where the vast majority of men and women use technology  frequently—so much so, in fact, that many of us are permanently mere  inches away from our smartphones—it seems incongruous that high-level  Internet use would mark a character as an outlier: As Wired columnist  Warren Ellis contended, “It’s not really geeky to use that level of technol- ogy anymore . . . A 16-year-old girl using SnapChat on her iPhone isn’t a  geek, she’s a functioning modern teenager.”5 Psychologist David Anderegg  made a similar point in his book Nerds: “If every teenage or college kid  who played games at a computer or video terminal were called a nerd,  there would be no one left to do the name-calling.”6 Whereas it was once  easy to pick out the nerds in films like Revenge of the Nerds mentioned ear- lier, or 1980s nerd classics like Zapped!  1982 , WarGames  1983 , Weird  Science  1985 , and Real Genius  1985  via their high-level computer use,  nowadays,  pinpointing  these  characters  is  more  difficult.  This  section  focuses on two factors that have made identifying the netgeek distinctly  challenging: the mainstreaming of geekery and the rise of geek chic.  Geek Goes Global  Until  the  early  2000s,  geeks  and  nerds  on  screen  were  invariably  the butt of jokes, social pariahs and even on those occasions when one  “saved the day”—Eugene in Artists and Models, for example, became an  unlikely hero when he dreamt up the secret formula for rocket fuel— such characters were generally defined by their status as someone differ- ent. In fact, in many screen examples, the central objective for geeks and  nerds was assimilation through the elimination of their pariah-attributes.  Many youth-oriented films boast memorable Pygmalion makeover scenes  where  nerds  and  geeks—commonly,  but  not  exclusively,  females7—are  aesthetically transformed. In the romantic-comedy She’s All That  1999 ,  for example, the geeky and tormented high school artist Laney  Rachael  Leigh Cook  was, by the end of the film, made over into a girl apparently  worthy of the affections of the Prom King, Zack  Freddie Prinze Jr. : Key  in her makeover was losing her paint-splattered overalls and, notably, her  thick-framed glasses. In the Disney film The Princess Diaries  2001 , to  become appropriately presentable as the new princess of Genovia, Mia   Anne Hathaway  similarly needed a physical overhaul and, like Laney,    4   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  had  to  lose  her  big  glasses  and  frizzy  hair.  Cultural  theorists  Elizabeth  Ford and Deborah Mitchell date the makeover film back to the romance  Now, Voyager  1942  wherein the dowdy spinster Charlotte  Bette Davis   received a makeover courtesy of her sister-in-law: orthopaedic shoes, thick  eyebrows, and, again, glasses were eliminated in favor of more fashion- able, form-fitting attire and plucked brows.8 Discussing the “nerd tran- scended” plotline of the Disney film High School Musical  2005 —where  nerdy teen Gabriella  Vanessa Hudgens  becomes a high school musical  star and ultimately sings the “Breakin’ Free” song  referencing, presum- ably,  her  “breaking  free”  from  the  social  constraints  of  high  school — Anderegg highlighted that the key message is actually far less transgressive  than it might appear:   1  In the right social world of high school, nerds and geeks are at the  bottom of the social hierarchy; and  2  If you are miraculously talented  in something else, like music, you can get out of your straitjacket. One  message is about the norms of high school; the other is a lovely fantasy.9  This analysis equally applies to nerdy Artie  Kevin McHale  in  Glee   2009–2015 : despite his glasses and wheelchair, his involvement with the  glee club elevated his social status.  In  the  2000s,  however,  something  started  to  change.  While  I  don’t  believe it was as wholesale a change as Neil Feineman made out in his  2005 book Geek Chic, nevertheless today geek and nerd are no longer syn- onyms for social pariahs. In fact, the once-maligned passions and fashions  derided as the pursuits of society’s outcasts have become widely embraced.  While  many  screen  presentations  still  fail  to  reflect  social  change,  off- screen geeks and nerds have found their way into both fashion and the  mainstream.  Thick-framed  glasses  and  obsessions  with  “nerdy”  things  like comic books have been rebranded as testimony to alternative, inde- pendent, and counterculture interests at a time when such interests have  cultural cache. Whereas once the nerd look was derided—and served as  a predictable source of comedy on screen—today it is difficult to distin- guish this look from the modern hipster who is often construed as an  ironic homage to society’s outcasts. Pastimes once derided, now in fact  represent a popular revolt against mass-produced culture and serve as sig- nifiers of individuality; something Anderegg highlighted: “Young adult  urban hipsters embrace nerd geek stereotypes and costumes because this  is  a  way  of  distancing  themselves  from  mainstream  America.”10  Feine- man  also  discussed  this  idea,  contending  that  while  “the  most  narrow       T H E   n E T G E E K    5  definition of a geek is the computer obsessed technician . . . [t]he broad,  more useful definition includes the brainy, single-minded outsiders drawn  to a wide range of creative pursuits—from raves to Japanese animation— who live beyond the mainstream.”11 The celebration of quirky individual- ity was, in fact, what film theorist Timothy Shary noted made the nerd  characters in the comedy Napoleon Dynamite  2004  distinctly modern:  Napoleon Dynamite is not so much a revision of past nerd depictions as  it  is  a  darkly  comic  celebration  of  being  strange  in  the  contemporary  educational venue, where all students know that everyone is subject to  the spotlight of lurid and instant mass communication. The film’s suc- cess  primarily  derives  from  the  irreverence  it  has  for  social  sensitivities  about  acceptance,  and  its  exposure  of  the  absurdity  typified  by  school  popularity.12  The embrace of things beyond the mainstream has been crucially— albeit  ironically—important  in  the  popularizing  and,  in  turn,  main- streaming of geek chic, so much so, in fact, that Ellis contends that the  term geek may no longer even be appropriate:  People will call Buffy the Vampire Slayer [1997–2003] geek culture and  yet it ran for seven years and is one of the most successful TV shows of  all time. You could argue that superhero and fantasy movies are modern  cinema. Geek hasn’t beaten the mainstream, it’s the new iteration of the  mainstream. You don’t have to buy a fanzine on mail order to be part of it  anymore. You can be part of a digital community that draws you together  and keeps building your interest.13   Despite geek culture now being so hard to distinguish simply from pop  culture,14 it is worth noting that geeks and nerds on screen are still often  distinct characters and frequently ones lower in the social strata: Anderegg  made this point in his discussion of High School Musical mentioned earlier  and notably in his criticism of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory  2007– :  What The Big Bang Theory teaches us is that sometimes geeky guys can get  a girl, but usually the less geeky guys are the ones who succeed, and when  the really geeky guys get a girl, it’s often an equally geeky girl.15   While, as noted, the screen doesn’t yet fully reflect the real-life nerd geek  revolution, some changes have occurred and depictions are no longer as  black white or popular ostracized as they once were. The Big Bang Theory,    6   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  along with the drama series The O.C.  2003–2007 , are two television shows  often credited for this shift. In her discussion of the teen character Seth   Adam Brody  from The O.C., Nancy Krulik described what she deems was  the beginning of geek chic on television:  The nerds of the world can stand a little taller now that Adam Brody has  come along. Adam’s O.C. character, Seth Cohen, may be the geek of his  teen crowd, but he’s still the one all the gorgeous girls are fighting over.  Thanks to Adam, these days geek is chic.16   Kaya Oakes in her book Slanted and Enchanted similarly credits The  O.C. in helping to mainstream qualities that were traditionally associated  with the socially excluded and readily maligned:  The media were willing and able to borrow the most appealing aspects of  indie culture, from music to comics and style, and use them to market  products that had never previously been thought of as indie. At least part  of the blame can be laid on the shoulders of the clever producers of the  Fox television show The O.C., who created the character of Seth Cohen, a  comic-book loving, emo-listening, ironic-T-shirt-wearing, skateboarding  outsider.17  Seth’s geekiness wasn’t connected to science or technology; rather, it  was centered on his intellect, social awkwardness, and most notably his  “indie”  tastes;  something  referenced  by  communications  scholars  Lori  Bindig  and  Andrea  Bergstrom  in  their  analysis  of  the  series:  “Seth  is  depicted as pasty and thin from time spent alone reading comic books,  listening to alternative music, and dreaming of attending an Ivy League  school on the East Coast.”18 For Seth, outsider interests were the basis of  his geekiness and, depending on one’s perception of the timeline, coin- cided with—or even ushered in—a watershed moment when outsider  or  indie  interests achieved mass appeal.  Much like Seth in The O.C., the portrayal of the nerds in The Big Bang  Theory has received extensive analysis. On a cursory level, the depiction  of  the  four  scientist  protagonists  is  completely  in  sync  with  nerd  pre- sentations that audiences have long been laughing at. Each male in The  Big  Bang  Theory  is,  in  varying  degrees,  socially  awkward  and  obsessed  with  technology—especially  computer  games—as  well  as  comic  books  and associated collectibles. Sheldon’s  Jim Parsons  social awkwardness is  so severe, in fact, that he is speculated to be  although never diagnosed  on the show  on the autism spectrum19  analyzed later in this chapter .       T H E   n E T G E E K    7  Taking cues from the anachronistic and unfashionable stylings of nerds  from  earlier  eras,  Howard’s   Simon  Helberg   clothing  is  heavily  influ- enced  by  the  1960s:  brightly  colored  shirts,  very  tight  pants,  and  gar- ish belt-buckles.20 Raj’s  Kunal Nayyar  discomfort with members of the  opposite sex—typical for nerds—was so strong in the first seasons that  he could only talk to women while under the influence of alcohol. Leon- ard’s  Johnny Galecki  nerdiness is notably embellished by his extensive  allergies, something aligning him with the routine framing of nerds as  infirm; an idea often conveyed through glasses and wheelchairs.21 One  explanation for the popularity of The Big Bang Theory is that even well  into the 2000s, nerds continue on screen as characters to laugh at; that  the audience’s familiarity with nerd characters from the 1980s means that  Sheldon, Howard, Raj, and Leonard are easy sources of comedy. Such  a criticism posits that the show isn’t a celebration of nerds but rather is  premised  on  their  continued  mockery.  Cultural  theorist  Chris  Russell  discussed this idea, spotlighting that “The Big Bang Theory is argued to  present  an  outsider’s  view  of  what  nerds  are,”  and  identifying  that  the  show has been derided as a kind of nerd minstreling or blackface.22 The  Big Bang Theory however, has also received some interesting commenda- tions. Communications theorist Deanna Sellnow noted that something  distinguishing these nerd portrayals is that the characters are actually the  protagonists—the  heroes—and  not  relegated  to  supporting  roles  as  has  typically been the case.23 Literature scholar Janice Shaw presented a dif- ferent accolade, celebrating that rather than simply being a show about  nerds, The Big Bang Theory is actually a commentary about the Zeitgeist:  The tech-savvy “kidults” of the series are representatives of a new tech- centered society where we are all nerds:  Longheld concepts of what it means to be an adult are challenged in The  Big Bang Theory by presenting the behavior of a marginalized group of  nerds as the extension of a generation reassessing its priorities in reaction  to a culture of consumerism and electronic recreation. This generation has  grown up in a society that offers little financial or marital security, and  instead prioritizes short-term goals and rewards.24   While shows like The O.C. and The Big Bang Theory offer new takes on an  old screen archetype, it would be naive to think that a wholesale overhaul  of geek and nerd depictions has transpired: As illustrated by innumerable  modern examples, such characters are still frequently maligned. In “The  One  with  Barry  and  Mindy’s  Wedding”  episode  of  the  sitcom  Friends   1994–2004 , for example, the  gentle  deriding of geeks—particularly    8   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  netgeeks—occurred in a conversation about Chandler’s  Matthew Perry   new girlfriend:  Phoebe  Lisa Kudrow :     Ooh, someone’s wearing the same clothes they  had on last night. Someone get a little action? I may have.  Chandler  Matthew Perry :  Monica  Courteney Cox :   Woo hoo, stud! Ross  David Schwimmer :   What’s she look like? Chandler:     Well, we haven’t actually met. We just stayed  up all night talking on the Internet. Woo hoo, geek!  Monica:    In the “Strangers on the Treadmill” episode of the sitcom Modern Fam- ily  2009– , Haley  Sarah Hyland  chastised her sister, Alex  Ariel Win- ter , saying, “Oh, my God, you’re such a geek! Now, do you want to be  smart, or do you want to popular?” In the “All about Steve” episode of the  animated series American Dad!  2005– , the baseball player Derek Jeter  tells Stan, “Your son’s a geek.” Stan protests, “That can’t be!” before suc- cumbing to a montage of memories of his son, Steve, as a ventriloquist  and in a marching band. When Stan flings open Steve’s bedroom closet  door to discover sci-fi action figures he screams, “Noooooo!” Regardless of  the real-life nerd geek rebranding, each of these scenes presents nerdish- ness as associated with social exclusion  explored later in this chapter  and  invariably existing as an identity completely separate from popularity or  attractiveness.  Something that is notably renegade about The Big Bang Theory is that  the  characters  are  unabashed  about  their  nerdiness:  Sheldon,  Howard,  Raj,  and  Leonard  aren’t  preoccupied  with  changing  and,  in  fact,  they  embrace  their  otherness  and  use  it  to  their  advantage—each  character  has career success, close social ties, and even romantic interests.25 This  embrace of nerdiness is actually something detectable in other Internet- era  screen  examples.  In  an  early  scene  from  the  crime-drama  Antitrust   2001 , for example, the hacker Teddy  Yee Jee Tso  nonchalantly pro- nounces, “we are geeks.” In the aforementioned American Dad! episode,  “All About Steve,” television writer Dan Vebber addresses an audience at  a  sci-fi  convention  with  the  phrase  “Fellow  Dorks.”  Neither  comment  was a lament, an insult, or self-deprecation but a simple statement of fact.  Whereas words like dork, geek, and nerd were once exclusively used as  slurs, in more recent presentations there is potential pride in such labels;  that the netgeek is a subculture people now often want to be a part of,  rather than simply get relegated to.      T H E   n E T G E E K    9  Geek Gets Cool  In the past, characters like Clark Kent  Christopher Reeve  in Super- man  1978 , Seymour  Rick Moranis  in Little Shop of Horrors  1986 ,  Skippy  Marc Price  in the sitcom Family Ties  1982–1989 , Arvid  Dan  Frischman  in the sitcom Head of the Class  1986–1990 , and Steve Urkel   Jaleel  White   in  the  sitcom  Family  Matters   1989–1998 —each  with  their oversized glasses and anachronistic attire—were readily identifiable  as nerds simply because they looked the part. The nerd uniform was in fact  referenced in the “Woolly Bullies” episode of the crime-drama 21 Jump  Street  1987–1991 : Officer Doug  Peter DeLuise  went undercover in a  high school to investigate a group of hackers. Doug’s disguise was simple:  thick-framed glasses, a tie, and a pocket protector; the nerd uniform was  his way to assimilate. The same uniform was adopted in the based-on- a-true-story  drama  Cyberstalker   2012 ,  in  the  thriller  Dot.Kill   2005 ,  and also in the television drama Selling Innocence  2005 , three examples  where the nerdy IT experts were actually killers in disguise.  In  Paul  Dickson’s  book  Slang:  The Topical  Dictionary  of  Americanism,  geek chic is defined as “fashion inspired by computer geeks—heavy black- rimmed glasses, nerd packs  shirtpocket plastic sleeves for pens and pencils ,  etc.”26 While this might be the look of Clark Kent and Steve Urkel, in recent  years it is an aesthetic that—like the very technology that once exposed  the nerd—has been mainstreamed: As computer scientist Tom Crick noted,  “Geek chic is just as pervasive  and fashionable  as the technology we all  depend on for everyday tasks.”27 Andrew Harrison, writing for the newspa- per The Guardian, identified just how heartily this look has been embraced:  Cheer up, Britain—the clever people have won at last. Just look around  you. If you went to a music festival, visited the beach or left the house  this summer you’ll have seen incontrovertible evidence on T-shirts. They  were everywhere, declaring the wearer to be a GEEK, NERD or DORK  in that big fat confident slab-serif typeface that usually says you’re talking  to someone who proudly attends PENN or NYU. Topshop brought out  the three designs last Christmas, contestant Jordan Lee Davies wore the  Geek shirt on The Voice [UK, 2012–] in April, and they were bootlegged  quicker  than  you  can  say  “gaga  artpop  torrentz.”  By  spring  they  were  unavoidable, seen on the chests of schoolkids, Ibiza ravers and TOWIE  [The Only Way Is Essex  2010 ] nitwits alike, worn by everyone apart from,  well . . . geeks, nerds and dorks.28   Harrison spotlights a trend that was not about an increase in actual geeks  or nerds29 but was centered on the appropriation of the aesthetic: The    10   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  mainstream wanted to look like the traditionally marginalized and to, as  noted earlier, exist apart from commercial notions of “cool.”30  While the popularity of being outside of the mainstream was a driving  factor in geek chic, Harrison identifies another factor and one that, again,  is seemingly ironic: the role of celebrities:  Celebs got in on the act, with R&B producers The Neptunes rebranding  as N.E.R.D. and stars as unlikely as Justin Timberlake, David Beckham  and Myleene Klass donning thick-rimmed specs in the mid-noughties.  Sitcoms The IT Crowd [2006–2013] and The Big Bang Theory set out to  satirise a geek world that was becoming more visible and powerful—face  it, can you fix your own PC?—but did so with a surprising measure of  warmth, making unlikely heroes out of Reynham Industries’ [Maurice]  Moss [Richard Ayoade] and the poster boy for high-functioning OCD,  Caltech theoretical physicist Sheldon Cooper PhD.31   Fashion writer Hadley Freeman went so far as to identify the “eternal  popularity of geek-chic” as attributable to high-end fashion brands such  as Comme des Garçons, Jil Sander, and Prada.32  While Harrison identified that celebrities wearing geek chic helped to  make it fashionable, popular media also had a role. In the sitcom Ugly  Betty  2006–2010 , for example, the titular character  America Ferrera   looked  every  bit  the  stereotypical  female  nerd:  thick-framed  glasses,  conservative, and old-fashioned clothing and even braces initially. Betty  might have been socially awkward, but she didn’t possess any technologi- cal giftedness nor any passions that marked her as especially geeky, rather,  she simply looked the part. While in Ugly Betty the character worked at a  high fashion magazine and thus her aesthetic rendered her as an outlier  in her workplace  even if, in the world at large, she was helping to rede- fine cutting edge , in more recent examples Betty’s geeky, conservative,  and  anachronistic  style  has  been  repackaged  as  “modern  hipster.”33  In  the  romantic-comedy   500   Days  of  Summer   2009 ,  both  leads, Tom   Joseph  Gordon-Levitt   and  Summer   Zooey  Deschanel ,  donned  col- orful, conservative attire. Jess  Zooey Deschanel  from the sitcom New  Girl  2011–  also wears similar, almost-librarian clothing and is routinely  described as being “adorkable.”34 Like Betty, Jess is socially awkward and  equally  has  no  particular  affinity  with  technology:  Her  nerdishness  is  simply aesthetic. Cultural theorist Claire Jenkins discussed the title char- acter  from  the  British  series  Doctor Who   1963– —her  work  centered  specifically on Matt Smith who played the Doctor between 2010 and  2013—as an example of geekery through fashion and not technology:       T H E   n E T G E E K    11  “By appropriating nerdiness through fashion choices, rather than actually  being a boffin, Smith the Doctor depicts a playful heterosexual masculin- ity.”35 While the characters in Ugly Betty,  500  Days of Summer, New Girl,  and Doctor Who don the geek chic look without any tech proficiency, in  Criminal Minds fashion and prowess get fused. Penelope is known for her  high-level computer skills as well as her distinct glasses and colorful and  conservative clothing; a look that, in previous generations would have  outed her as lamentably bookish is construed as “funky and cool” in the  era of geek chic.36  While in real life most people have embraced the Internet and inte- grated it into daily life, the netgeek on screen remains a distinct figure  who has not yet been fully mainstreamed. While the majority of us might  be users of the Internet, few have the same passion, enthusiasm, or under- standing of it as the screen’s netgeek.  A Passionate Embrace  In his book The Geek Handbook, Alex Langley noted that “anyone who  has a passion for the things they love is a geek—it’s the heart of what  being a geek is about.”37 The role of passion is indeed essential to depic- tions. Be it Steve Urkel’s bug obsession in Family Matters, Seymour’s vinyl  record addiction in  Ghost World or Augie Farks and his preoccupation  with  medieval  role-play  in  Role  Models,  a  key  attribute  of  the  geek  on  screen is a love of something that goes beyond the ordinary. While Steve,  Seymour,  and  Augie  have  other  attributes  linking  them  with  nerds  of  old—glasses, dated clothing, peculiar speech patterns—fanaticism is what  marks them as truly geeky.  For the netgeek characters focused on in this chapter, their interest in  technology goes beyond the constant e-mail checking and social media– updating that ordinary people engage in; their interest is passionate and  obsessive and their knowledge of the workings of such technology renders  them as outliers.  Internet  addiction  takes  a  variety  of  forms  on  screen.  A  comically  extreme presentation transpired in the Canadian comedy-drama Control  Alt Delete  2008 . The netgeek Lewis  Tyler Labine  was so obsessed with  netporn that his real-life romantic relationship crumbled. As Lewis’s pre- occupation exacerbated, he began having sex with computers by drilling  into them to create a penetrable hole. More commonly, however, passion  is framed in more predictable ways: One common method is via Asperger’s  syndrome. Neurologists Robert Melillo and Gerry Leisman, for example,    12   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  described  the  connection  between  Asperger’s  and  obsessive  tendencies:  “The  most  striking  characteristic  of  the  syndrome  is  strong  interest  in  arcane subjects . . . The key point to the diagnosis is that their obsessive  behavior significantly impairs their social functioning.”38 Stephen Brad- shaw in his work on the syndrome makes a similar point: “Children with  Asperger’s Syndrome are obsessive by nature; they may pursue interests  which are beyond socially acceptable or normally accepted boundaries.”39  While the Asperger’s connection to the netgeek character is discussed in  greater detail later in this chapter, for this section it is worth noting that  on screen the diagnosis provides an explanation for the tech-obsessions of  characters like Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory.  Be it attributable to Asperger’s or not, an obsession with anything can  lead a person to being socially isolated: by choice or because they have  been socially excluded.  Social Isolation  Discussed earlier was Bindig and Bergstrom’s reference to The O.C.’s  Seth as being “pasty.”40 The idea of nerds and geeks having a pallor reflec- tive of an indoor, isolated lifestyle is widely identifiable. The sci-fi film  Powder  1995  presents an extreme version of this: The genius outsider,  Jeremy  Sean Patrick Flanery , is so very white he is an albino. In most  examples, however, the presentation is more subtle.  In the sci-fi film One Point O  2004 , Nile  Eugene Byrd  cautioned  his  computer  programmer  neighbor  Simon   Jeremy  Sisto :  “You  really  need to get out. I mean, you look pale, man. And the place looks like shit.  Look, go to a club, fuck a girl.” Sociologist Tim Jordan in his discussion  of The Matrix  1999 , described the protagonist, Neo  Keanu Reeves , “as  a pale hacker who refuses to leave his room.”41 In the “Y2dicK” episode  of the sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun  1996–2001 , Luddite professor Dick   John Lithgow  gets his first computer and instantly becomes addicted to  the Internet, so much so, in fact, that he locks himself away in his office  for several days. When his colleague, Mary  Jane Curtin , finds him and  pushes him outdoors, Dick complains about how bright it is. In mere  days Dick had ascribed to the hermit netgeek stereotype. Dick stopped  going to class to give lectures, rather, sent his students a link to his web- cam site. He didn’t go out for food, he ordered in. He even turned down  an invitation to go to a street festival, instead opting to watch the web- cam broadcast. A similar scene transpired in the sci-fi thriller Surrogates       T H E   n E T G E E K    13   2009 , centered on a world where, from the comfort and safety of their  homes, humans operate lifelike robotic surrogates. At the end of the film,  the computer network controlling the surrogates shuts down making all  the surrogates immediately inoperable. Operators were abruptly forced  to leave their homes and suddenly hundreds of pale, pajama-clad people  made  tentative  steps  into  the  daylight,  something  they  hadn’t  done  in  years. In these examples, not going outside is a crude way to allude to the  isolation of the netgeek. Isolation, in fact, is a popular frame for numer- ous early Internet-themed storylines.  In the opening scene of one of the earliest Internet-themed films The  Net  1995 , the telecommuting computer programmer, Angela  Sandra  Bullock , has a phone conversation with one of her  unnamed  clients:  Client:    Angela,  I’d  love  to  show  you  my  appreciation,  take  you  out  to   dinner tonight, some drinks. Get you out of the house.  Angela:  Oh, I’m very flattered and appreciative, but I— Client:  You gotta eat. Angela:   It’s . . . Unfortunately I already have dinner plans. So . . . Client:   How about tomorrow? The next day? Angela:  These plans are kind of a standing arrangement.  Not only is Angela a netgeek, but she embodies one of the key attri- butes of this screen archetype: She favors the company of her computer.  In The Net, Angela’s social isolation is shown via her ordering pizza online  and her human “contact” being limited to Internet forums. Decades on  and the hacker protagonist of the sci-fi series Mr. Robot  2015– , Elliot   Rami Malek , is framed similarly: in the pilot, he repeatedly declines  opportunities for social interaction, electing to remain alone even if lone- liness is a consequence. In other screen examples Internet-driven isola- tion is alluded to via dialogue. In the television thriller Every Mother’s  Worst Fear  1998 , after visiting a chat room, teen Martha  Jordan Ladd   is lured from her home by a cyberpredator  discussed further in Chap- ter 5 . Martha’s mother, Connie  Cheryl Ladd , embarks on an investi- gation and obtains a recommendation for a computer expert from her  colleague, Carl  Andrew McIlroy : “He’s a little strange but he’s a genius,”  Carl explained, “You have to go to him, he never goes out. Ever.” Con- nie sought out the expert—Bruce  David Lewis —by leaving a phone  message requesting an Internet crash course. Bruce’s reply was: “I don’t  meet, get together, have lunch or go for walks. And I don’t have people  over.” Carl had warned Connie that Bruce was a “little strange”; Bruce’s    14   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  own words proved this. After Connie and Bruce started working together,  Bruce’s isolation in fact became a joke:  Bruce:   You can call me on the phone. Connie:  Anytime I need you? Bruce:   It’s not like I won’t be here.  The same insular, indoor-life themes were spotlighted in the comedy  Hot Tub Time Machine  2010  in a conversation between Adam  John  Cusack  and his chubby, gamer nephew, Jacob  Clark Duke :  Adam:    Turn on a light, Jake. Open a window. Go outdoors. Jesus Christ!  Why don’t you get out of the house this weekend, huh?  Jake:   What should I do out of the house, Uncle Adam? Adam:     I don’t know. Anything that corresponds with reality. Apply for a  job. Maybe try to go to college. I don’t know. That all sounds kind of overrated.  Jake:    In the romantic-comedy Wish I Was Here  2014 , when Aidan  Zach  Braff   visited  his  brother,  Noah   Josh  Gad ,  Noah  was  alone  in  his  darkened mobile home. “Sunlight Noah, Noah sunlight,” Aidan chas- tised. The “Body of Evidence” episode of the British crime series New  Tricks   2003–   framed  Internet-aided  isolation  similarly.  Martin  was  found  murdered  following  an  online  date.  His  mother,  Moira   Lor- raine Ashbourne , explained to detectives her son’s preoccupation with  computers:  Martin spent half his life in here. Up until all hours, tapping away at that  computer . . . He said he could speak to people all over the world with that  thing without ever having to leave the house . . . But I wanted him to leave  the house, though. Get out. Meet real people, not computer ones. All he  ever did was go to work, come home, get on that thing.   Similar ideas played out in the Irish drama Love Eternal  2013 : young  Ian  Robert de Hoog  had stopped going to school and spent his time  locked in his room chatting about death online. Ian had over five thou- sand “friends” on social media and yet lived like a hermit.42 In the “Kitty”  episode of CSI  2000–2015 , social isolation was again alluded to in a  scene  where  investigators  Avery   Patricia  Arquette   and  Nick   George  Eads  analyzed the online dating profile photo of a murder suspect:      T H E   n E T G E E K    15  Nick:  Caucasian male, twenty . . . Barbells on the floor, guy works out. Avery:  He’s anti-social, he doesn’t like the gym. Nick:     Yeah and he doesn’t like to take out the trash either. Cans are stuffed.  To-go cups, food containers, he orders in a lot.  Avery:   He’s agoraphobic. He doesn’t like to leave, even to eat.  In the aforementioned Hot Tub Time Machine scene, Jake was gaming  in a dark, basement-like room. A basement location, in fact, highlights  another  way  that  isolation  manifests  on  screen:  Netgeeks  computing  in dark, private, and also invariably messy spaces. In the heist film The  Score  2001 , the hacker Steve  Jamie Harold  lives in the basement of  his mother’s home. In the action-drama Live Free or Die Hard  2007 ,  Frederick  “Warlock”  Kaludis   Kevin  Smith   also  hacks  from  the  same  location. In the “Voyeur’s Web” episode of NCIS  2003– , a webmaster is  found working from his mother’s basement: “Oh, that’s kind of depress- ing,” jibed the investigator DiNozzo  Michael Weatherly . A similar barb  about the basement cliché was made in the “Mikado” episode of the sci- fi  series  Millennium   1996–1999 ,  when  the  protagonist  Frank   Lance  Henriksen  visited the dark, messy apartment of an IT specialist, Brian   Allan Zinyk :  Brian:  Sorry about the mess. It’s the maid’s day off. Frank:    Don’t worry about it. Your apartment’s exactly how I imagined it  would be.  In the American Dad! episode “All About Steve,” the isolated netgeek  cliché was referenced when a cyberterrorist was identified as the contribut- ing editor of a geek magazine titled Wizards and Shut-Ins. In “The Comic  Con” episode of the sitcom Brotherly Love  1995–1997 , Lloyd  Michael  McShane  conducted his online dating from his basement. In the “Intim- idation Game” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  1999– , the  gamers produced their misogynistic videos from a parent’s basement. In  the 2009 Swedish film Män som hatar kvinnor  The Girl with the Dragon  Tattoo , as well as the U.S. version  2011 , the computer hacker character,  Plague  Tomas Köhler and Tony Way, respectively , worked from dark  and messy apartments. In the short-lived comedy series Dweebs  1995 ,  the netgeeks initially ran their computer business from a windowless base- ment; throughout the five seasons of the IT Crowd, Roy  Chris O’Dowd   and Maurice similarly worked in a cluttered basement.   16   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The why of social isolation in these examples is attributable to numerous  recurrent themes in Internet portrayals including early fears of addiction,  the Internet as self-sustaining, and the Internet as a place where geeks and  nerds can exist without the rejections of the real world; each of which are  discussed in the following sections.  Fears of Addiction  Every Mother’s Worst Fear, as the title makes apparent, is an example of  films made in the earliest years of the Web, each premised on the idea of  new technology as dangerous. Techno- and cyberphobias are themes, in  fact, that run through many examples discussed in this book whereby a  narrative emphasizes that the Internet has unknown, and likely dangerous,  capabilities:  Technophobia is now an everyday response to the risks and threats gener- ated by advanced industrialization. The critique of science is normalized and  domesticated, exercised in a hundred little ways. It forms the basis for mas- sive public anxiety about the safety of everything from the processed food we  consume to the steps we are making toward a biologically engineered future,  often described, in popular shorthand, as “tampering with nature.”43  Cyberphobia  is  an  irrational  fear  and  dislike  of  electronic  and  internet  communications and technology.44 “Cyberphobia” is in part based on the futuristic fear that impersonal and  inhuman machines could eventually govern society, and that the differ- ences between people and machines would eventually become hazy.45  Cyberphobia is not a new disease. Humans have been afraid of machines  in one way or another since time and humans began together. What many  in this position fail to realize is that they’re up against their own definition  of life; if it’s limited and the machine exceeds their definition of them- selves, then it’s conceivable the machine could overpower them.46   While the fear referenced in the Every Mother’s Worst Fear title centers  on the Internet as a means to prey upon children, the film also more subtly  alludes to fears of addiction. Bruce became so obsessed with the Internet  that he socially isolated himself. This idea also transpired in the aforemen- tioned 3rd Rock from the Sun episode: Dick’s addiction developed in mere  moments, so great and all-encompassing were the temptations proffered.  The  same  scenario  played  out  in  the  “Construction  Junction”  episode  of the sitcom Roseanne  1988–1997  when Jackie  Laurie Metcalf , like       T H E   n E T G E E K    17  Dick, experienced similar instant addiction the first time she logged on.  Instant addiction was also a theme in “The Barbarian Sublimation” epi- sode in The Big Bang Theory, when Penny  Kelly Cuoco  became instantly  addicted to online gaming the first time she played. The unsubtle under- current here is that the Internet has special powers: that a person can,  almost instantly, become seduced by its temptations and elect to isolate  themselves away from the real world.47  On one hand, the fears implicit in these examples are ones that haunt  any new technology. In early research on the Internet addiction fears fea- tured prominently. Addiction fears, of course, once haunted radio48 and  then television49: As media theorist Roger Silverstone explained, “the reg- ular cycle of moral panics associated with the introduction of new media  is most often associated with the fear of addiction.”50 It is unsurprising,  therefore, that pop culture both seriously as in Every Mother’s Worst Fear,  and  comparatively  humorously as in 3rd Rock from the Sun, Roseanne,  and The Big Bang Theory, offers fictionalized depictions of the fears in a  culture: As Silverstone alluded, the media plays a pivotal role in creat- ing moral panics, portraying them, and potentially even fueling them.  In  these  examples,  fiction  undoubtedly  gave  voice  to—if  not  rationale  for—the Internet-based fears of real life.  Something that makes Internet-driven isolation plausible within a nar- rative is the depiction of the technology as fostering a perverse kind of  self-sufficiency; something conveyed through the portrayal of the ease of  ordering food, socializing, teaching, and even “attending” a street festival.  The Internet and Self-Sufficiency  In the “Y2dicK” episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun, Dick—in a moment of  rapture—exclaimed “the entire planet is at my fingertips!” Here, the char- acter introduces the idea of the Internet offering a kind of self-sufficiency:  that should a netgeek wish to physically isolate, going online provides the  means to do so; that a character might be alone in a basement but via  online connectivity can satisfy their needs for food, intellectual stimula- tion, and even social contact; ideas identifiable in a range of examples.  In  the  thriller  Copycat   1995 ,  the  psychologist  Helen   Sigourney  Weaver  had isolated herself in her home in the aftermath of an attack.  The Internet had become her primary means of contact with the outside  world: Helen played chess online and, following a panic attack, entered  a chat room and typed “Anybody awake? Need to talk.” Helen kept the  world largely at bay but the Internet allowed her controllable access when  desired.   18   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The  self-sustaining  nature  of  the  Internet  was  actually  verbalized  in  The Center of the World  2001 , a romantic-drama centered on the lonely,  nerdish dot.com mogul Richard  Peter Sarsgaard  who had purchased the  services of a stripper, Florence  Molly Parker , for a weekend. In one con- versation, Florence asked him about isolation:  Florence:   Richard:    So, is it weird just being all alone in front of your computer all  day?  No. Well, the thing about computers is that you’re kind of con- nected to everybody and everything. It’s like you’re at the center  of the world.  For characters like Angela in The Net, Martin in New Tricks, Dick in  3rd Rock from the Sun, Jackie in Roseanne, and Helen in Copycat, their  ability to form connections with other people via computers showcases  screen attempts to examine the capabilities of new technology. While ulti- mately negative value judgments are made about these “connections”— Angela in The Net is presented as an outsider, Dick in 3rd Rock from the  Sun and Jackie in Roseanne both had to be physically separated from the  Internet, Helen’s net-aided isolation in Copycat was presented as symp- tomatic of mental illness, and Martin in New Tricks got murdered—it is  worth acknowledging that fear was not the only theme apparent in these  examples, but rather presented it as a consequence of the new and exciting  technology.  For characters like Dick in 3rd Rock from the Sun and Jackie in Rose- anne, prior to them going online for the first time, they were not actually  socially withdrawn. Equally, after the Internet was taken from them, Dick  and Jackie returned to their normal lives. These narratives, therefore, pres- ent the Internet as having special properties: that it can create an addiction  in characters who don’t have a specific propensity toward either technol- ogy or being a hermit. While this “special properties” analysis works for  Dick and Jackie, and Penny in The Big Bang Theory discussed earlier, for  other characters, the Internet, in fact, served as an outlet for characters  with preexisting nerd and geek tendencies. Film critic Roger Ebert, for  example, discussed Angela in The Net, describing her as a character who,  “in  the  old  days,  would  have  been  a  librarian  or  schoolmarm.”51  For  characters like Angela—as well as Elliot in Mr. Robot and Bruce in Every  Mother’s Worst Fear—they likely would have been recluses even without  the Internet, akin to the nerds and geeks of the pre-Internet era who chan- neled energies into other solo pursuits. Shyness and social awkwardness,       T H E   n E T G E E K    19  therefore, rendered the Internet a desirable place where such characters  aren’t  asked  to  come  out  of  their  shell  as  is  often  the  case  in  makeover  films, but instead have the opportunity to be themselves in a world—in a   cyberspace—where  their  quirks  are  actually  valued.  In  such  examples,  rather than having special properties, the Internet simply serves as an out- let for certain personality types: a place without the vagaries and notably  rejections of the real world.  A Place without Rejection  At the end of The Center of the World, after things soured with Florence,  Richard was, once again, left alone with his computer and delivered a  monologue highlighting some key advantages of the Internet as perceived  by the netgeek:  You don’t need to open your door. You don’t need to leave. You create a  frontier to put your mattress with the cables and the CPUs, and you claim  that piece of space. The world breaks in waves at your fingertips. You make  its choices. You decide. And it sings for you when you ask.   In real life Richard experienced rejection and sexual rebuffs from Flor- ence; online, however, he was in his element: It was a place where he had  control, where he was successful, and where he could retreat when the  offline world rejected him. While in practice the Internet can still offer  rejection,52  it  nevertheless  is  perceived  as  a  place  better  catering  to  the  obsessions  and,  also,  personal  shortcomings  of  nerds  and  geeks;  some- thing psychologists Monica Whitty and Adam Joinson observed:  Some people arguably benefit more from the unique space that is cyber- space.  Shy  and  socially  anxious  individuals  have  been  found  to  prefer  many spaces online to get to know others. In particular, it has been found  that shy people enjoy meeting potential romantic partners in newsgroups  and on online dating sites.53   A woman quoted in psychologist Kimberly Young’s work on the Inter- net personalized these ideas, identifying: “I get tongue-tied in real life, but  I don’t get finger-tied on the Net.”54 For all the ways that nerds and geeks  are socially challenged in real life, the Internet provides an outlet—and  comparatively inclusive place—for them.  A  key  component  of  the  netgeek  character  is,  obviously,  an  affinity  with technology: As discussed, intellectual characters like Steve in Family  Matters, Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory and Elliot in Mr. Robot—whose    20   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  social  problems  at  least  partly  stem  from  the  lack  of  order  in  the  real  world—are portrayed as having a connection with the seemingly ordered,  machinelike nature of technology. With this in a mind, a recurrent theme  in netgeek presentations is the idea that such characters don’t merely have  an affinity with technology but are actually like technology.  More Machine Than Man  In the sci-fi drama Transcendence  2014 , Will’s  Johnny Depp  con- sciousness was uploaded to a computer allowing him to continue “inter- acting” after his death55; as his colleague Max  Paul Bettany  remarked,  “Maybe it was all inevitable. An unavoidable collision between mankind  and technology.” The same theme was used in the television sci-fi film  NetForce  1999  and is also central in the wide variety of films that explore  artificial intelligence,56 each depicting extreme presentations of the role of  technology in facilitating a blur between human and machine. In most  netgeek narratives, however, the idea is presented as more metaphorical  than physical.  In Anderegg’s work, a nine-year-old girl described a nerd as being “like  a human computer.” This definition aligns well with Benjamin Nugent  who, in his book American Nerd, described one type of nerd as: “dispro- portionately male, is intellectual in ways that strike people as machinelike,  and socially awkward in ways that strike people as machinelike . . . They  get stuck with the name ‘nerd’ because their outward behavior can make  them seem less than, and more than, human.”57 This more machine than  man idea is detected in numerous presentations. The next section explores  the idea of netgeeks as a different, less-than-human breed; that this “breed”  might even have Asperger’s; netgeeks having their own language; netgeeks  as being more brains than brawn; and finally the theme of the netgeek  machine’s unattractiveness.  A Different Breed  In the German hacker-drama 23  1998 , the protagonist, Karl  also  known by his screen name “Hagbard”   August Diehl , was interviewed  by  a  television  host.  The  host  introduced  Karl  by  explaining:  “Com- puter  nerds  like  Hagbard  are  our  future.  Raised  on  microchips,  bits  and  bytes  are  their  toys.”  In  Control  Alt  Delete,  the  manager  Angela   Alisen Down  gave a “motivational” speech to her programmers: “God  help us, the fate of the world rests with the pencil-necked geeks. People  like me don’t ask much of people like you.” In the pilot episode of the        T H E   n E T G E E K    21  high school sitcom Freaks and Geeks  1999–2000 , again the geek versus  normal idea was referenced when the nerd Sam  John Francis Daley   expressed his interest in a female classmate, and his equally nerdy friend,  Neal  Samm Levine , attempted to deter him, “We’re not her species . . .  She’s a cheerleader, you’ve seen Star Wars [1977] twenty-seven times. Do  the math.” The undercurrent of these examples is that nerds are differ- ent: that they are raised differently, that they live their lives differently   perhaps even, as discussed earlier, in basements ,58 and that an us versus  them dynamic exists between them and normal people.59 While all of the  netgeek characters discussed thus far are testimony to this idea, in 23,  Control Alt Delete, and Freaks and Geeks the difference is verbalized and  a nerd is diagnosed as somehow innately different. This breed-difference  idea is, in fact, articulated frequently on screen. In the Every Mother’s  Worst  Fear  discussed  earlier,  Carl  warned  Connie,  for  example,  that  Bruce was “a little strange.” In the pilot episode of The IT Crowd, when  the new employee, Jen  Katherine Parkinson , asked her boss Denholm   Chris Morris  about the IT team she would be managing, he confidently  proclaimed, “Standard nerds!” Lisbeth Salander, the hacker protagonist  of  Stieg  Larsson’s  2005  novel  Män  som  hatar  kvinnor   The  Girl  with  the Dragon Tattoo  is socially awkward, if not misanthropic, and, while  never diagnosed as such in the book  although her colleague, Blomqvist,  does indeed suspect it , has been widely speculated to have Asperger’s.60  It is unsurprising, therefore, that in the film versions Lisbeth being a  little strange becomes central to the plot. In the Swedish film, Lisbeth   Noomi Rapace  is described by her boss, Armanskij  Michalis Kout- sogiannakis , to the client, Frode  Ingvar Hirdwall  as “a special little  girl. But make no mistake, she’s our best researcher.” The same scene  played out in the U.S. version: Armansky  Goran Visnjic  tells Frode    Steven Berkoff : “No one here particularly likes her. I find it’s much  better if she works from home . . . She’s different . . . in every way.”  While in both the Swedish and U.S. versions Lisbeth looks more punk  rocker than female nerd—in line with the cybergoth aesthetic that is com- mon for female hackers  Chapter 4 —Lisbeth is a very typical netgeek char- acter: She is comfortable in cyberspace and almost toxic outside. While the  Internet is the tool that enables Lisbeth to do her job and to minimally social- ize—akin to characters like Angela in The Net, Bruce in Every Mother’s Worst  Fear, Elliot in Mr. Robot and Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory—rather than the  Internet making her this way  in the way, for example, that it made temporary  hermits out of Dick in 3rd Rock from the Sun, Jackie in Roseanne, and Penny  in The Big Bang Theory , rather, Lisbeth is drawn to the technology because it    22   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  allows her to compensate for her quirks. On screen, Asperger’s—sometimes  formally diagnosed as such but more commonly simply implied—provides a  “born that way” answer to many of the netgeek’s characteristics.  The Netgeek and Asperger’s  In a scene from the pilot of the sitcom Betas  2013–2014 , a bar is pop- ulated by male computer programmers. One of the programmers, Trey   Joe Dinicol , approaches an attractive woman, Lisa  Margo Harshman ,  seated at the bar. He tries to make an advance but Lisa abruptly stops him:  Lisa:    I thought putting my bag on the stool would be a pretty clear sign I’m  not looking to get hit on by every Aspy in the joint. Oh, but that’s the  thing about you guys, isn’t it, you’re not exactly aces when it comes to  reading people.  Here, Lisa verbalizes the popular screen connection between computer  programmers and Asperger’s and also identifies the most common Aspy  characteristic: poor social skills.  In American Nerd, Nugent observed: “If you line up the traits of people  and fictional characters who are nerds with the traits that comprise Asperg- er’s, the overlap is hard to ignore.”61 In literary scholar Jordynn Jack’s dis- cussion of autism, she made a similar point, identifying that Asperger’s  characters “are usually depicted as a professionally successful yet socially  inept  geek  or  nerd.”62  While  the  screen  does  offer  formally  diagnosed  Asperger’s characters—for example, Max Braverman  Max Burkholder   in  Parenthood   2010–2015   or  Jerry  Espenson  in  Boston  Legal   2004– 2008 —more common is the presentation of netgeek characters who are  socially awkward, obsessive, and often machinelike, but where the audi- ence is left to develop their own diagnosis.63 Noted earlier were academ- ics who have diagnosed Lisbeth Salander. Such arm’s-length diagnoses,  in fact, happen in discussions about a variety of netgeek characters. The  protagonist, Temperance  Emily Deschanel , in the crime-drama Bones   2005– , for example, has received this kind of armchair diagnosis,64 as  has Elliot in Mr. Robot,65 Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory,66 Maurice in  The IT Crowd,67 and Abed  Danny Pudi  in Community  2009– .68 Jesse   Ashley Zukerman , the hacker in the Australian crime-drama series The  Code  2014– , has been suspected of Asperger’s by commentators,69 as has  the Mark Zuckerberg  Jesse Eisenberg  character in the biopic The Social  Network  2010 70 and Dr. House  Hugh Laurie  in the medical-drama  House  2004–2012 .71 In the pilot of the sitcom Silicon Valley  2014– ,       T H E   n E T G E E K    23  the computer programmer Dinesh  Kumail Nanjiani , was actually intro- duced while perusing a website for people with Asperger’s, although no  condition was actually spoken of. Another example is Noah in Wish I Was  Here, who, while again not diagnosed in the film, is presented as a socially  incompetent,  computer-obsessed  genius  with  some  kind  of  condition  making him “different.”72  The link between Asperger’s, netgeeks, and being machinelike is a topic   specifically addressed by Nugent:  The form of social awkwardness that Asperger’s engenders is machinelike . . .  it means that their social awkwardness is created by difficulty in reading the  kind  of  human  communication  that  machines  also  find  difficult  to  read   facial expression, eyes, tone of voice .73  While an assumed lack of emotions is both a link between Asperger’s  and netgeeks on screen—in “The Proton Transmogrification” episode of  The Big Bang Theory, for example, this idea is explicitly verbalized when  Howard says to Sheldon, following the death of Sheldon’s mentor, “You’re  being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?”—more com- monly  this  idea  is  presented  via  a  lack  of  emotionality  in  speech.  In  research on the syndrome, repeatedly spotlighted is the vocal flat-affect.74  On screen and in line with this idea, the netgeek character—whether for- mally diagnosed with Asperger’s or not—is often conveyed by a character  sounding different to those around them: that their speech patterns are a  way to establish that they are different while also contributing to them  seeming—at least vocally—machinelike.  In a Different Voice  In their discussion of screen examples  including The Big Bang Theory ,  linguists Roberta Piazza, Monika Bednarek, and Fabio Rossi spotlight the  way language is used to present characters as outliers: “Linguistic devi- ance in telecinematic discourse has important functions and many differ- ent effects from the construal of somehow ‘antisocial,’ ‘abnormal’ or ‘not  quite human’ characters.”75 A variety of deviations from “normal” speech  are discussed in this section, each working to frame the netgeek as both  unusual and, notably, machinelike.  One of the classic characteristics of the on-screen nerd is speaking in  a voice that sounds not quite human: a robotic, flat-affect voice void of  intonation or emotion. The computer that Stephen Hawking  Eddie Red- mayne  speaks through in the biopic The Theory of Everything  2014  is    24   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  a good, albeit exaggerated, illustration of this. In the “Y2dicK” 3rd Rock  from the Sun episode, Dick actually developed a robotic voice himself dur- ing the height of his addiction: When Mary accidentally short circuited  his computer, Dick—without an ounce of tone or emotion—said, “You’ve  made me so angry, Mary.” Dick’s addiction had made him machinelike.  This idea is taken to the extreme in the early Internet-themed sci-fi film  The Digital Prophet  1996 , whereby a computer-like, emotionless state is  in fact presented as a higher state of being by the comic-obsessed homi- cidal nerd, Newman  Annie Haslett .  Noted  earlier  were  Nugent’s  remarks  about  nerds  and  people  with  Asperger’s being unable to read facial expressions and tone  something  that was explicitly mentioned by Lisa in Betas . This forms the basis for  another  machinelike  speech  quirk  on  screen.  Research  contends  that  those with Asperger’s often have difficulty with metaphor or nuance; as  psychologist Kathryn Stewart explains: “Their reliance on concrete think- ing and literal interpretation of language affects their understanding of  analogy  and  metaphor.”76  Piazza,  Bednarek,  and  Rossi  discussed  this  in the context of Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory, identifying that his  identity comes from him “taking idiomatic expressions ad literam.” “The  Luminous Fish Effect” episode provided a good illustration of this in an  exchange between Sheldon and Penny:  Penny:   Sheldon:    Well, maybe it’s all for the best, you know I always say, when one  door closes, another one opens.  No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or  there are motion sensors involved.  Temperance in Bones is presented as similarly unable to process idiom  or sarcasm. The need for information to be delivered to such characters in  plain language, and without inflection, is a key characteristic of numerous  netgeeks in screen fiction who in fact also deliver information this way  themselves. One way that this is identifiable is via dialogue that sounds  distinctly different from the way “normal” people speak. Nugent noted  that a key attribute of nerds is that they tend to speak “in language unusu- ally similar to written standard English.”77 Shary made a similar point  noting  that  such  characters  are  often  characterized  by  “speaking  with  big words.”78 Nerdishness illustrated through big words and excessively  formal language transpires in many examples. Penelope from Criminal  Minds illustrates this well. Aside from her clothing, Penelope’s speech also  helps frame her as distinctly geeky, something detectable in her character- istic phone greetings:      T H E   n E T G E E K    25  Penelope:   Penelope:   Penelope:    Oracle of Quantico. Speak if you deign to hear truth. [“Some- body’s Watching”]  He who seeks the queen of all knowledge speak and be recog- nized. [“North Mammon”]  Office of Unfettered Omniscience. Penelope Garcia is in. Speak,  oh fortunate one. [“Plain Sight”]  Penelope’s words mark her as someone whose dialogue outs her as dif- ferent;  someone  who  is  nerdy  but,  in  line  with  modern  presentations  where the identity is worn proudly, is not trying to change or assimilate.79 Like Penelope, Steve in Family Matters also uses needlessly formal lan- guage: His “good day, gentleman”–type greetings are a typical illustration  of  this.  Equally,  other  aspects  of  his  speech  work  to  further  embellish  his status as an outlier. On one hand, Steve actually doesn’t sound very  machinelike,  in  fact,  he  possesses  the  whiney,  nasally  voice  associated  with nerds from earlier generations such as in Zapped!, WarGames, Grease,  and Revenge of the Nerds. Steve’s voice does, however, work to emasculate  him and perpetuate the idea that he—that nerds—are weak, wimpy, and  unmanly. Such an attribute encourages the audience to dislike a charac- ter and also potentially feel justified in doing so. In the series Dweebs,  while it centered on standard issue bespectacled nerds, like Steve, Morley   David  Kaufman   also  had  a  nasal,  whiney  voice.  In  the  sitcom  Saved  by  the  Bell   1989–1993 ,  the  nerd  Samuel  Powers   Dustin  Diamond   was more commonly known by the nickname “Screech,” a reference to  his high-pitched and, again, whiney voice. In the “Internet Troll” epi- sode of the sitcom Maron  2013– , when the protagonist  Marc Maron   finally uncovered the identity of “DragonMaster”—the titular troll—he  was exposed as Darryl  Erik Charles Nielsen , a chubby nerd with glasses  wearing a Viking hat and who, again, had a squeaky nerd voice. Having  “annoying” attributes such as a strange or irritating voice makes it easy for  audiences to feel justified in laughing at these characters based on their  seemingly comic differences.  Theorists note that a common characteristic of people with Asperger’s  is encyclopedic knowledge of favored subjects. As psychologist Teresa Bol- ick identified: “The most popular special interests of boys with Asperger’s  Syndrome  are  types  of  transport,  and  specialized  areas  of  science  and  electronics, particularly computers.”80 While for Abed in Community his  encyclopedic knowledge centers on pop culture, for characters like Shel- don in The Big Bang Theory, and in fact also, Raj, Howard, and Leon- ard  although to lesser degrees than Sheldon , as well as Temperance in  Bones, the obsession is science and technology. In practice, encyclopedic    26   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  knowledge sees these characters spewing forth reams of information in a  machinelike fashion, in turn distancing them from those around them:  Abed does this on Community about pop culture, Spencer Reid  Matthew  Gray  Gubler   in  Criminal  Minds—a  character  speculated  by  Gubler81  as well as by fans82 as having Asperger’s—does this on topics related to  psychology and criminology, in NCIS, the computer specialist Timothy  McGee  Sean Murray  does this, and in the “Body of Evidence” episode  of New Tricks discussed earlier, the tendency for netgeeks to speak in inde- cipherable jargon was referenced by one of the detectives, Gerry  Dennis  Waterman , when he verbalized his loathing for the “e-crimes boys”: “I  can’t stand them hanging around talking gibberish. Treating us like we’re  moronic  dinosaurs  because  we’re  not  on  Facebook.”  A  scene  from  the  pilot of The IT Crowd also referenced this idea, albeit in a subtle, unspo- ken way: Maurice was explaining his programming work to Jen and all  she—and the audience—could hear was static.  Encyclopedic  knowledge—particularly  when  it  is  delivered  monoto- nously or in boring slabs—frames a character as intelligent but also anti- social, demonstrated notably by their apparent obliviousness to the lack  of interest  or understanding  of those around them. A character’s ability  to hold so much information in their head also casts them as otherworldly  and computer-like.  The idea of a netgeek language is also identified when netgeeks are  depicted  in  groups  and  are  framed  as  speaking  in  their  own  dialect.  In The Big Bang Theory, for example, a routine joke involves the four  central  netgeeks  speaking  in  jargon—often  about  scientific  or  tech  topics—and Penny  positioned to represent the oblivious audience  is  excluded from their foreign tongue. Penny, in fact, is a contemporary  take on the character Carey  Farrah Forke  in Dweebs who was hired  as the office manager of Cybertech but knew nothing about computers  and was reliant on the nerdy office gopher, Todd  Adam Biesk , to act  as a translator:  Carey:  Morley:    Carey:   Vic  Corey Feldman :   Karl  Stephen Tobolowsky :   [calling out] Todd?  He’s running the diagnostics on a new mother  board.  No he’s not. He’s zapping the perimeter RAM  on the power PC.  Ah  get  out  of  here.  He’s  trying  to  find  the  Ethernet card to go in the PCI slot. Doesn’t anybody here speak English?      T H E   n E T G E E K    27  In a scene from the heist film The Italian Job  2003 , the netgeek Lyle   Seth Green  was explaining in extensive technical detail his computer  surveillance operations to the team when one of the thieves, Handsome  Rob  Jason Statham , instructed him to “speak English.” As in The Big  Bang Theory, the geeks in Dweebs and Lyle in The Italian Job are presented  as not only speaking in their own language, but in one that “normal”  people can’t understand.  Discussed earlier was the idea of the netgeek as pasty: such a pallor alludes  to an indoor and also presumably sedentary life. While one of the conse- quences  of  sedentariness—obesity—is  discussed  in  Chapter  2,  another  component specifically relevant to this discussion is physical weakness.  More Brains Than Brawn  Psychologist Andrew Smiler identified that the nerd stereotype “appears  to refer to a physically weak, unattractive, poorly dressed male who favours  academics and is not particularly engaged in the social scene.”83 On screen  such ideas are easily detected. In Grease, Eugene is physically bullied by  the T-Birds.  The  Simpsons’  nerds—Milhouse  and  Martin—are  similarly  frequently the victims of Nelson’s bullying, and such geek-bullying regu- larly transpired in Freaks and Geeks. In Web–era portrayals, the nerdish  title character  Jon Heder  in Napoleon Dynamite was subject to similar  abuse, as was Laney in She’s All That. In the pilot episode of Dweebs, it is  revealed that the netgeeks Vic and Morley had met in high school and  bonded over their shared victimization; as Vic explained, “We had our  heads stuffed into adjoining toilets.” Such characters are the victims of  bullying because they are assumed as weaker and thus easy targets.  Presenting  a  netgeek  as  weak,  of  course,  is  another  way  to  subtly   problematize—if  not  demonize—technology  and,  in  turn,  its  users.  Anderegg contended that part of the negative portrayal of geeks and nerds  in Western culture is attributable to “American anti-intellectualism.”84 On  screen this plays out through the depiction of the negative consequences  of studying too hard or sitting behind a computer too long: Social isola- tion  occurs  and,  as  relevant  for  this  section,  physical  decrepitude  tran- spires.85 This is a way for characters who might be smart to, nevertheless,  be  framed  as  not  “having  it  all”;  such  characters  may  be  intelligent—  certainly more so than the audience—but they are also weaker and socially  isolated; a cost to their intellectual superiority.  While the psychology of bullying is explored elsewhere86—and while  the screen depiction of cyberbullying is explored in Chapter 4—bullied    28   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  netgeeks serve several purposes in screen narratives. In Napoleon Dyna- mite, from the very first scene Napoleon is portrayed as unlikeable: He is  abrasive and socially awkward. Establishing him as unpleasant is impor- tant because when he gets bullied the attack is, therefore, less sad and  more  inevitable,  if  not  actually  funny.87 While  establishing  a  character  as weak and unmanly can be done through voice—as with Steve Urkel  in  Family  Matters—it  is  more  commonly  done  through  physicality.  In  sociologist Anthony Synnott’s discussion of masculinity, he identified that  for “men who are not manly, and not masculine, a long series of epithets  apply: wimps, wusses, nerds, dorks, dweebs, sissies, yellow-bellied, cow- ards, mama’s boys, babies.”88 Whereas presenting characters as machine- like is a rather literal way to portray them as less human, another is to  depict them as less than by showing them as possessing fewer of the mark- ers associated with prized masculinity in Western culture such as control,  individualism, independence, and aggression.89 This connection between  the bullied nerd and masculinity is illustrated well in the pilot episode of  Freaks and Geeks when, after being bullied, Sam called out for help from  a teacher. The bully, Alan  Chauncey Leopardi , teased Sam, “My God,  you’re such a woman!” and the teacher, Mr. Kowchevski  Steve Bannos ,  offered a similar rebuke, “Sam, want some advice? Be a man.”90  Technology helps to bolster the emasculation idea. Throughout history  connections have been made between men, technology, and emascula- tion. Initially, as discussed by sociologist Jennifer Light, this was achieved  through the removal of the physical aspects of jobs in turn rendering them  more passive  i.e., apparently more feminine :  The introduction of technology also facilitated women’s entry into paid  labor . . . Once a job was feminized this classification gathered momen- tum, often broadening to including other occupations. By World War II,  computing was feminized across a variety of fields.91   While Light highlights a more institutional feminization facilitated by  technology in the generic, this has also been identified as happening on  a microlevel through the use of specific technologies. Media scholar John  Fiske, for example, identified that television has often been considered as  contributing to feminization:  Fantasy or escapism is often “feminized,” that is, it is seen as a sign of  feminine  weakness  resulting  from  women’s  inability  to  come  to  terms  with  masculine  reality. It is a sort of daydreaming that allows women or  children to achieve their desires in a way that they are never capable of in       T H E   n E T G E E K    29  the “real world,” a compensatory domain which results from and disguises  their “real” lack of power.92   On one hand, since its inception the Internet has been largely thought  of  as  male—dominated  by  men,  shaped  by  men,  understood  by  men.  Certainly, as illustrated via the high number of male netgeek characters,  the  Internet  is  still  frequently  presented  on  screen  as  gendered.  How- ever, while the Internet might often be considered male-dominated, it is  important to note that it is rarely thought of as masculine. As Light noted,  work that does not necessitate brawn is routinely thought of as feminine   presumably, work that is done indoors is feminine when contrasted with  the masculine domain of the great outdoors .93 If Fiske’s ideas are applied  to the Internet, another element of feminization is apparent via games  and chat rooms, each providing characters opportunities for escape. Syn- nott spotlighted that men who do not fit within models of hegemonic  masculinity94 are frequently subjected to social exclusion, if not bullying.  Even in modern netgeek narratives where the bullying of nerds is not a  key theme—The Big Bang Theory is one such example—the idea of the  netgeek being of inferior strength is nevertheless still apparent. A scene  from  “The  Justice  League  Recombination”  episode  illustrates  this  well:  The four netgeek protagonists were dressed up as superheroes for a New  Year’s Eve party. At the end of the evening they witness a car being stolen  and, while their costumes give a hint that they might seek justice, instead,  they run away: in line with the stereotypical risk-adverse way that a stan- dard nerd would react.95  While in narratives like Grease and some of the 1980s nerd-film exam- ples  discussed  earlier,  emasculation  is  presented  through  a  character’s  physical bullying and apparent cowardice, worth noting, the geeks in the  modern portrayals—Napoleon Dynamite and The Big Bang Theory—can  be interpreted as products of the rebranding of nerds and geeks: There  exists, therefore, an ability to construe the “new” masculinity embodied by  the netgeek as something actually positive and potentially even progressive.  In Nugent’s discussion of geek chic, for example, he spotlights that part of  the counterculture driver is the idea of subverting stereotypes about gen- der and sexuality: “Dressing like a nerd rejects conventional ideas about  what  a  hunky  young  man  looks  like.”96  With  celebrities  and  pop  cul- ture granting legitimacy to nerdy and geeky behavior, in certain contexts  the idea of masculinity has expanded. Within narratives, occasionally the  wimpy netgeek and the feminized computer operator are framed not as  bullied outsiders, but rather as reflective of the cultural changes that the    30   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  netgeek embodies and is potentially even proud of. This idea is well illus- trated in a chase scene toward the end of Antitrust when Redmond  Tyler  Labine  asks Milo: “What’s with the Mission: Impossible 3 [2006] bullshit,  Milo? You’re a geek!” In this scene, the stereotypes are acknowledged but  they are not construed as limiting, rather are treated as comic.  Stereotypes  about  the  weakness  of  netgeeks  are  part  of  the  beauty  brains and brawn brains dichotomies: that you either possess one set of  attributes or the other, but certainly not both; as Anderegg noted: “We  all ‘know’ the central fact of the nerd geek stereotype: that smart people  can’t  also  be  sexy,  and  sexy  people  can’t  also  be  smart.”97  This  idea  is,  of course, the underlying premise of the reality television show Beauty  and the Geek  2005–2008 . The either or component partly explains why  smart characters aren’t usually permitted to also be attractive; that their  gift of intellect—and quite possibly their future riches  discussed later in  this chapter —forms part of the basis for their mockery. Worth noting,  however, the either or component is also the undercurrent—as well as  the explanation—for the real or assumed unattractiveness of such char- acters. Laney in She’s All That for example, was not actually unattractive  prior to her makeover; as Ford and Mitchell identify, “like most makeover  heroines,  Laney’s  before  signifiers  barely  conceal  the  loveliness  under- neath.”98 The premise of the film, however—that Zack could make any  girl the prom queen—only works if audiences accept the rule that smart  characters are unattractive.  On screen, physical weakness, emasculation, and unattractiveness have   an important social cost: sexual rejection. The Sexual Reject  The idea of the netgeek as a sexual reject brings together numerous  themes discussed thus far in this chapter. This section has centered on  netgeeks being machinelike and this is certainly one component: Weird  speech  patterns  and  social  awkwardness  render  a  netgeek  unappealing  simply by virtue of their less than human qualities. Another component is  that machines not only aren’t sexually desirable but are often assumed not  to actually harbor sexual desires either. In communications scholar Sarah  Sinwell’s discussion of asexuality, she identified that “film and television  frequently construct asexuality by desexualizing bodies and identities that  do not fit cultural codes of desirability.”99 This description certainly fits  the portrayal of many netgeeks on screen.  As noted already in this chapter, for many netgeeks, their obsession  with technology, and their choice to engage with their computers rather       T H E   n E T G E E K    31  than other humans, frames them as having low or nonexistent sex lives  or  at least crippling social anxieties that thwart such socializing . Sheldon in  The Big Bang Theory is a classic example of this: across the course of many  episodes  he  rebuffs  the  sexual  advances  of  his  girlfriend  Amy   Mayim  Bialik , so frequently in fact that he is suspected as asexual.100 Even with a  character like Temperance from Bones, who actually is portrayed as sexual,  her desires are presented as more about fulfilling a need—akin to food or  water—rather than about romance; as Jack noted: “[Temperance] Bren- nan is a female character but her portrayal on the show often emphasizes  masculine traits such as a matter-of-fact, unromantic view of sex.”101 This  analysis is equally applicable to a character like Sonya  Diane Kruger  in  the crime-drama series The Bridge  2013–2014 , who—like Sheldon and   Temperance—is assumed to have Asperger’s102 and is also shown to have  a matter-of-fact, unromantic attitude toward intercourse.  In  most  examples,  however,  the  netgeek’s  sexless  predicament  is  not  because they aren’t interested in sex or intimacy, but rather, because sexual  intimacy does not exist as an option: that such characters are widely con- sidered undesirable if not, in fact, repellent.  Thus  far  I  have  discussed  netgeek  characteristics  including  paleness,  weakness,  social  awkwardness,  and  a  lack  of  stylishness.  Considered  together, such attributes frame characters as unappealing and provide an  explanation for their sexual rejection. Steve in Family Matters, for example,  who was in love with Laura  Kellie Shanygne Williams  across the course  of the series, was constantly rebuffed by her: He was a permanent victim  of his nerdishness and his identity was fixed as sexually repellent. Such  unrequited nerd-love plays out in a variety of screen examples. Skippy’s  crush on Mallory  Justine Bateman  in Family Ties, for example, and Long  Duk Dong’s  Gedde Watanabe  crush on Samantha  Molly Ringwald  in  the romantic-comedy Sixteen Candles  1984  are two examples. In Freaks  and Geeks Neal carries around a notebook to conceal his unrequited sexual  interest in Lindsay  Linda Cardellini ; nerdy Sandy  Alan Cumming  does  the  same  thing  in  the  comedy  Romy  and  Michele’s  High  School  Reunion   1997 . The truism of the unrequited love of nerds is also referenced in  Antitrust. At the beginning of the film, Redmond showed Milo  Ryan Phil- lippe  around the NURV campus and pointed out fellow employee, Lisa   Rachael Leigh Cook , noting that every male geek was interested in her:  Redmond:   Milo:    Lisa actually looked at you . . . Every geek here’s got a thing for  Lisa but she won’t let anyone get near her— I have a girlfriend.   32   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Redmond:    What?  You’ve  got  a  girlfriend?  Like  a  three-dimensional  girl- friend? That’s really rare around here.  In his book Generation Multiplex, Shary noted that “nerds are also  either virgins or sexually inactive, a condition that most films attempt  to  eradicate  through  the  transformation  into  other  school  types   but  nerds who remain nerds almost never have sex .”103 While unrequited  love is one illustration of this, other kinds are also detected. The 1980s  comedy Real Genius—predating the World Wide Web—centers on the  lives of tech nerds. In one scene, Chris  Val Kilmer —a nerd himself,  but one who seems more gregarious and socially active than his peers— takes a group of standard issue nerds to a party and introduces them  to  a  house  populated  by  female  beauty  students:  “Given  the  type  of  people you are and the environment you’re in, you have to admit the  strong probability that this may be the only chance you will ever have  in your entire lives to have sex.” This scene illustrates the us versus them  breed difference idea discussed earlier, but also reflects the undersexed  nerd stereotype popular in 1980s nerd films where such characters are  perpetually involved in high jinks–fueled attempts at sexual congress.  Despite the recent rebranding of nerds and geeks, the sexually rejected  nerd archetype apparent in Real Genius is readily identifiable in World  Wide Web–era examples.  In one of the earliest Internet-themed films, Hackers  1995 , the net- geek, Joey  Jesse Bradford , was nerdy enough to actually name his com- puter “Lucy”; the subtle idea being that this was as close to a “woman”  as he was ever going to get. In the comedy Celebrity Sex Tape  2012 ,  one of the nerds—Ed  Jonathan Brett —acknowledged the perennial  predicament  of  the  netgeek  on  screen:  “It’s  time  we  stopped  playing  video games. We need to get some tail physically, not digitally”; a quest  at the heart of the narrative. The 40-Year-Old Virgin similarly centered  on geeky Andy’s attempts to lose his virginity; the comedy The Virginity  Hit  2010  was also about the teen nerd, Matt’s  Matt Bennett , same  sex mission. The undersexed netgeek was an archetype also referenced in  the drama On_Line  2002 : as John  Josh Hamilton  recorded his video  blog, his friend and webcam business partner, Moe  Harold Perrineau ,  interrupted to address Josh’s audience, “Hello geeks! . . . I know you’re  all just looking for some really hot, horny lesbian sex so check out our  website . . . Real, live women and they’ll really talk to you!” In the docu- mentary Lil Bub & Friendz  2013 , Grant Mayland was termed “Min- neapolis’s 1 cat video fan” and in his self-summary painted himself as       T H E   n E T G E E K    33  a  central  casting  undersexed  nerd:  “This  is  my  OKCupid  profile  and  this is for Internet dating. I’ve had this since I was 19 . . . Six things  I  could  never  do  without:  science,  passion,  blood,  love,  hate,  occult  symbolism.” That Grant’s OKCupid profile was still active during the  interview—he  seemed  substantially  older  than  19—indicates  that,  in  sync with the screen’s typical netgeek portrayal, Grant is permanently  unsuccessful at dating.  A variation of the undersexed netgeek presentation is the portrayal of  their digital relationships—i.e., that they are not man enough to get a  flesh and blood one so they turn to machines to fulfill their needs. The  fantasy film Weird Science—centered on two nerds who use a computer  to  build  a  perfect  woman—is  an  example  of  this.  In  modern  incarna- tions,  netgeeks  turn  to  chat  rooms,  social  media  platforms  and  online  dating. On screen often these relationships are used to further perpetu- ate the idea that netgeeks can’t get real girlfriends, i.e., ones that don’t  “live in the Internet.” In the Friends episode discussed earlier, Chandler  was mocked as a geek because he hadn’t yet met his girlfriend. In Napo- leon Dynamite, Napoleon’s netgeek brother, Kip  Aaron Ruell , was asked  about his new girlfriend to which he explained: “Things are getting pretty  serious right now. I mean, we chat online for like two hours every day so I  guess you could say things are getting pretty serious.” Kip, like Chandler,  hadn’t actually met his new girlfriend. This same idea is identifiable in  an early scene from the British biopic One Chance  2013  in a conversa- tion between the overweight geeky Paul  James Corden  and his coworker  Braddon  Mackenzie Crook :  Braddon:  And how’s your girlfriend? Paul:   Braddon:  And are you actually planning on meeting her at any point?  Oh, she’s brilliant. She really is. She’s absolutely fantastic.  In the romantic-comedy Can’t Hardly Wait  1998 , this idea again plays  out in dialogue between two teenage nerds, Geoff  Joel Michaely  and  Murphy  Jay Paulson :  Geoff:   Murphy:   Geoff:  Murphy:    Isn’t this the weekend that you’re supposed to meet your girlfriend  from the internet?  Yeah, but she has some photo shoot in Fiji . . . for a catalog or  something. Oh, man. That sucks.  Yeah.  I  guess  that’s  just  the  price  you  pay  for  dating  Christie  Turlington.104   34   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Such presentations reference the chicken-and-egg idea about netgeeks  and sexlessness: i.e., that they are socially awkward and sexually repellent  and thus are unable to get women, versus their inability to get women in  turn propelling such characters into other preoccupations like computing  and thus substantiating the idea that they are socially awkward and sexu- ally repellent; something Sinwell discussed:  These characters are represented as asexual not because they do not experi- ence sexual attraction, but rather because they are not sexually attractive;  they are not allowed to have a sexuality because, if they were, normative  codes of sexual desirability would be threatened.105   Be it reflective of the rebranding of nerds and geeks in the Zeitgeist or  because the screen does sometimes dare to offer deviant presentations, in  some scenes the sexless nerd archetype gets subverted; as Sinwell identified  in her discussion of Napoleon Dynamite, as well as in reference to the action- comedy series Chuck  2007–2012 , “nerds are starting to be represented as  sexual beings.”106 Temperance in Bones and Sonya in The Bridge, are further  examples of this; Leonard’s on-again, off-again relationship with Penny in  The Big Bang Theory is another. Antitrust was mentioned earlier: The netgeek  Milo did actually have a girlfriend and even though she was a secret agent  planted by NURV, the two did end up together. In the “Bugged” episode  of Family Matters, when Steve finally met his Internet connection “Bugsn- Hugs,” she—Agnes  Amy Hunt —was attractive, thus subverting all expec- tations about the kind of woman Steve would presumably attract; as Urkel  remarked: “I’ve never met a bug collector with shaved legs before.” In another  transgression, Agnes is also very keen on Steve, attempting repeatedly  albeit  unsuccessfully  to seduce him. In Control Alt Delete the overweight netgeek  Lewis  initially  had  a  girlfriend  who  was  very  sexually  interested  in  him.  Lewis, however, ruined it with his netporn addiction  a topic discussed fur- ther in Chapter 6 . Even after his having-sex-with-computers deviance was  exposed, Lewis still managed to attract another woman.  Anderegg observed that “sometimes geeky guys can get a girl, but usu- ally the less geeky guys are the ones who succeed”107—and while, as dis- cussed, such subversions are identifiable, they are not the rule. Equally,  when such relationships do transpire, they are routinely framed as pecu- liar: Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory, for example, has a largely chaste  relationship with his equally geeky girlfriend Amy. Sheldon and Penny’s  on-again, off-again courtship is permanently underpinned by the ques- tion of whether two such different breeds can actually successfully couple.       T H E   n E T G E E K    35  In Criminal Minds, despite geeky Penelope’s multiseason crush on her col- league Morgan  Shemar Moore , she actually couples for several seasons  with Kevin  Nicholas Brendon : a bespectacled, garishly dressed nerd; a  suitably—and equally—geeky match for her, unlike the hunky, appar- ently out-of-her-league Morgan.  The routine association between netgeeks and paleness was discussed  earlier. While indeed, such a presentation is about a character’s indoor  lifestyle and nerdy infirmness, it also makes a subtle racial point, too.  Race and the Netgeek  In his discussion on nerds, Nugent quoted musician Brian Eno who  made some interesting points about skin color and computers: “Do you  know what I hate about computers? The problem with computers is that  there is not enough Africa in them. That’s why I can’t use them for very  long.”108 In his discussion of the quote, Nugent explained, “There is an  implied continuum here, with nerds and machines on one side, and Africa  on the other, and people with just the right amount of Africa, like Brian  Eno, in the center.”109 Eno implies both that there is something staid and  boring about whiteness110 and also that whiteness exists in opposition to  other skin colors that have, apparently, more culture and are more sexy  and interesting. While the vast majority of netgeeks are indeed white—if  not hyperwhite as suggested by Nugent111—the black and Asian netgeeks  are also worth discussing.  The Black Netgeek  In line with some of the points made by Nugent, the scientist Ron  Eglash referenced the Eno quote and discussed some of the characteristics  of the black versus white mythology:  Africans as oversexual and Asians as undersexual, with “whiteness” por- trayed  as  the  perfect  balance  between  these  two  extremes.  Given  these  associations, it is no coincidence that many Americans have a stereotype  of Asians as nerds and of Africans as anti-nerd hipsters.112  The idea of Africans as “antinerds” is actually one that plays out com- monly on screen: that presentations of black characters are in line with  stereotypes  including  their  construction  around  their  sexuality113  and  their intellectual inferiority.114 While there is, for example, a deluge of  African American characters depicted on screen as criminals,115 there is a    36   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  notable paucity of presentations casting them as scholars. Steve Urkel in  Family Matters is discussed throughout this chapter. While black—and  considered, in fact, as the first black nerd on television116—Steve’s African  Americanness was never part of his identity construction: He was simply  the nerd within a sitcom about a family that happened to be black.117  Equally, while Steve has gotten extensive attention in this chapter because  he illustrates numerous netgeek concepts well, the series stopped being  produced decades ago in the late 1990s. While black nerd examples can  be detected in more recent examples—the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel- Air  1990–1996 , the comedy Class Act  1992 , the adventure film Juras- sic Park  1993 , the drama George Washington  2000 , and more recently  in High School Musical and the comedy Dear White People  2014 —geeks  and nerds on screen are commonly white. Aside from Steve Urkel, other  black netgeek characters do, however, exist: in Celebrity Sex Tape, Douglas   Andre Meadows  is a fat, black webmaster. In the aforementioned epi- sode of Maron, one of Darryl’s friends is an unnamed black nerd  JaMar- lin Fowler . Maurice, one of the protagonists in the sitcom The IT Crowd,  is a black man who, incidentally, was identified at number seven on Lang- ley’s list of top television geeks.118  Interestingly, while there is a paucity of black netgeeks on screen, a num- ber of black hackers can be identified: Nikon  Laurence Mason  in Hack- ers, Luther  Ving Rhames  in Mission: Impossible  1996 , Glen  Anthony  Anderson  in the adventure film Transformers  2007 , Alec  Aldis Hodge   in the drama series Leverage  2008–2012 , and Brody  Shad Moss  in CSI:  Cyber  2015–  are examples. While these men are each computer whizzes,  they don’t possess the nerdy qualities normally associated with the netgeek.  While part of this is because they are framed more as outlaw than computer  geek  explored further in Chapter 4 , another explanation may lie with them  complying with the popular archetype of the black man as criminal.119  In the “Proof of Concept” episode of Silicon Valley, the programmer  protagonists visit the “Tech Crunch Disrupt” conference where start-up  companies tout their ideas to investors. In one scene a montage of pitches  are shown: In all except one, the presenter is Asian. Silicon Valley is a com- edy and thus this scene is intended as funny, but it also makes a statement  about the technology industry and, notably, about the Asian netgeek; a  stereotype detected throughout screen fiction.  The Asian Netgeek  The  connection  between  Asians  and  technology  is  not  a  new  one:  Nugent, for example, noted that “in the 1980s, opinion columnists warned       T H E   n E T G E E K    37  that the Japanese were taking over the world through their unrivalled love  of machines and their mechanistically corporate cast of mind.”120 Thirty  years on and the depiction of Asians excelling in the fields of science and  technology continues to get attention.121 The representation of studious  Asians in the popular imaginary means that on screen, as Nugent suggests,  they continue to be portrayed as “more machinelike  industrious, asexual   than whites by cultural inheritances and or genetic predisposition. There- fore, Asians tend to be nerds.”122 Nugent, in fact, likens the contemporary  studious Asian archetype to the disparaging portrayals of Jews in previous  generations.123 Arguably the screen demonization of Asians through their  depiction as netgeeks is, again, reflective of the aforementioned “Ameri- can anti-intellectualism”124 that Anderegg identified: that Asian intellec- tual and technological prowess might be threatening to Americans, but  that balance gets restored when such characters are emasculated.  One  example  that  Nugent  discusses  is  Long  Duk  Dong  in  Sixteen  Candles, a character marked by “cheerful industriousness and social inept- itude” and who embodies the perennial problem of Asian men “being  attracted to women who would rather be with white men.”125 Film and  television in fact presents a wide variety of Asian netgeek characters. The  protagonist  of  Betas  is  Nash   Karan  Soni ,  an  East  Asian  netgeek;  the  entrepreneur, Michael  Leonardo Nam , is another Asian example. Other  notable Asian netgeeks include Abed in Community, Dinesh in Silicon  Valley, Raj in The Big Bang Theory, Data from Goonies, Razor  Darren Lee   and Blade  Peter Y. Kim  in Hackers, Teddy in Antitrust, Lloyd  Aaron  Takahashi  in Mr. Robot and Hiro  Masi Oka  in the sci-fi series Heroes   2006–2010 .  In  the  drama  The  Newsroom   2012–2014 ,  Neal   Dev  Patel  is an East Asian blogger with advanced understanding of technol- ogy and a geeky obsession with Bigfoot. In the “Canary” episode of NCIS,  the team apprehended the world’s second most wanted cyberterrorist: an  East Asian man, Ajay Khan  Vik Sahay . Uday Shankar  Anjul Nigam  is  the East Asian cybercriminal in NetForce. In the biopic Takedown  2000 ,  the cybersecurity expert was Tsutomu Shimomura  Russell Wong . In the  comedy Mean Girls  2004 , “Asian nerds” were included in Janis’s  Lizzy  Caplan   overview  of  the  school  “tribes”   and  were  contrasted  with  the  “Cool Asians” . The sci-fi series Torchwood  2006–2011  offered a female  Asian netgeek: Naoko  Toshiko Sato . Nikita  Maggie Q  in the action  series Nikita  2010–2013 , Mai Linh  Maggie Q  in Live Free or Die Hard,  and Helen-Alice  Liza Lapira  in the sitcom Super Fun Night  2013–2014   are other female Asian netgeek examples. Asian dominance of the Internet  was also comically referenced in the “Make Love, Not Warcraft” episode    38   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  of the animated series South Park  1997–  when the central characters  were  playing  World  of Warcraft  and  Cartman  commented  on  the  high  number of players: “I bet half of these people are Koreans.”  Besides race, there are certain qualities that distinguish the Asian net- geek from white and black presentations, notably, such characters tend to  be “peculiar” in ways other than simply geeky. Sociologist Rosalind Chou  described Asian American men as “symbolically castrated,”126 and Sinwell  identified the common desexualizing of Asians noting that “asexual exis- tence has also been associated with Asian-ness in U.S. film, particularly in  the construction of Asian men . . . ethnic otherness still connotes a threat  that is neutralized by representing these characters as asexual.”127 While  there are indeed sexless and sometimes asexual Asian characters on screen,  there is also a notably high number of sexually deviant Asian netgeeks,  too; a topic cultural theorist Jodi Kim discussed: “Asian American men  have been either cast as sexually lascivious, and therefore threatening to  white female chastity and domesticity, or more often as asexual, queer  or otherwise falling outside the bounds of proper heteronormativity.”128  Such Asian lasciviousness is apparent in Celebrity Sex Tape. Kwan  How- ard Cai  is the Asian nerd who is not only a netgeek with minimal English  skills but is extremely socially awkward: At a party, for example, he said,  “Holy shit, look at those titties!” In another scene—while filming some  netporn—Kwan snuck on set and masturbated. Kwan’s behavior was pre- sented as weird and puerile and framed him as distinctly repellent. In the  comedy  Paul  Blart:  Mall  Cop   2009 ,  the  East  Asian  character,  Pahud   Adhir Kalyan , displayed his creepiness by keeping tabs on his girlfriend  by tracking her phone using GPS technology. Forensic specialist Vince  Masuka  C. S. Lee  in the crime-drama Dexter  2006–2013  is another  notable example of the deviant Asian, constantly saying sexually inappro- priate things in the workplace:  Vince:  The boss’ sweater melons look bigger on TV [“An Inconvenient Lie”]  So I hear a rumor you’re tracking all our Internet activity. So is it  Vince:  true? ’Cause I can explain all that she-male stuff [“Dex, Lies, and  Videotape”]  When  it  comes  to  matters  of  the  heart:  always  follow  your  dick!  [“Get Gellar”]  Vince:   In these examples Vince’s remarks were sexually inappropriate. In the  series  pilot  of  Mr.  Robot,  Lloyd’s  comments  are  sexually  aggressive:  he       T H E   n E T G E E K    39  describes, for example, a hack as being “like a crazy serial rapist with a  very big dick.”  While studious and wise Asian stereotypes are common, characters like  Long  Duk  Dong,  Kwan,  Pahud, Vince  and  Lloyd  illustrate  that  while  Asian netgeek characters are, sometimes, allowed a sexuality, it is often  one that perpetuates their difference from other characters and works to  downplay their expertise as well as ensure their continued demonization. The  final  characteristic  of  screen  netgeeks  discussed  in  this  chapter  is the idea that they are destined for greatness; a device that potentially  works to help excuse the misery and mockery they are subjected to in set- tings like high school.  The  Net Geek Will Inherit the Earth  Artists and Models provided an early example of a geek character, Eugene,  who was—albeit accidentally—able to save the day. Whereas geeks and  nerds are commonly the source for comedy and are so frequently failures  in social situations, it is worth spotlighting examples where netgeeks are  presented as “saving the day” and ultimately framed as heroes.  Joseph Gelmis, in his review of the nerd-themed comedy Lucas  1986 ,  identified that “the nerd is to the high school movie of the ’80s, what the  rebel without a cause was to the high school flicks of 30 years ago: an  unlikely hero.”129 While in 1980s films, nerd characters like Data in The  Goonies and those in Revenge of the Nerds were indeed unlikely heroes, in  more modern examples the constitution of success for the netgeek has  been reframed.  The comedy Control Alt Delete centered on a department charged, at  the end of the millennium, with the task of preventing a Y2K disaster and  opened  with  the  unit  manager,  Angela,  requesting  assistance  from  her  team of nerdy programmers:  It looks as though my head programmer position just opened up so, um,  who wants to be a hero? Anyone? I’m sorry [crying] I would do this myself  if my brain operated on ones and zeros but God help us, the fate of the  world rests with the pencil-necked geeks. People like me don’t ask much of  people like you. Just make our microwaves cook and our cellphones talk.  Talk and once every hundred years stop our computers from blowing up.   As  it  turned  out,  Lewis  did   albeit  inadvertently   actually  stop  the  computers from “blowing up” by short-circuiting the server  albeit while    40   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  having sex with it . While, akin to the 1980s heroes, Control Alt Delete  provided an example of the netgeek who saved the day, Lewis did so in  a manner that reflects a very contemporary malady: netporn addiction   explored further in Chapter 6 . Similarly, in Paul Blart: Mall Cop, while  Pahud’s tracking of his girlfriend’s phone was presented as creepy, by the  end of the film, it was actually his tech-prowess that saved the hostages:  Pahud saved the day using modern tools, albeit ones associated with pri- vacy invasion.  Another kind of modern netgeek heroism on screen is the geek-made- good; something that Richard  Thomas Middleditch  verbalized in the  pilot of Silicon Valley:  For thousands of years guys like us have gotten the shit kicked out of  us. But now, for the first time we are living in an era where we can be in  charge and build empires. We could be the Vikings of our day.130   The real-life overhaul in perceptions of geeks was discussed earlier. A  key aspect of this rebrand centers on money and the enormous financial  successful of geeks like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. Net- geek heroism is underpinned in several screen narratives by profits earned  from intellect. In the comedy Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion,  Sandy was the school nerd. Come the titular reunion and an adult Sandy  arrives  by  helicopter;  it  is  revealed  that  he  had  “invented  some  special  kind of rubber that’s used in every tennis shoe in North America.” In  the romantic-comedy Sydney White  2007 , at the end of the film, the  netgeek, Terrence  Jeremy Howard , had perfected a formula that he sold  for $10 million. In the pilot of Dweebs, the nerds—once bullied at high  school—moved from their basement into a high-rise office and cashed a  check for $3 million; as the boss Warren  Peter Scolari  remarked, “If I  had a million for every time I was given a wedgie . . . wait, I do.” In Can’t  Hardly Wait, William  Charlie Korsmo  was the school nerd; bullied and  seeking revenge. During the film’s epilogue, however, it was revealed that  “William went to Harvard, where he became one of the most popular  students. He also formed a software company that is now valued at 40  million dollars. He is currently dating a supermodel.” William was able  to rebrand himself because he was a nerd who, like Sandy in Romy and  Michele’s High School Reunion and Terrence in Sydney White, had money  and, under capitalism, money buys the things that nerds often lack: style,  friends, sex-appeal, and in Sandy’s case even cosmetic surgery. While the  geek-made-good  stereotype  is,  like  most  computer-themed  examples,       T H E   n E T G E E K    41  generally one associated with men, a female example transpired in the  romantic-comedy You Again  2010 : Marnie  Kristen Bell , who had been  bullied throughout high school and ostracized in college, grew up to be  a beautiful and successful corporate executive. Similarly, in the “Stealing  First Base” episode of The Simpsons, Lisa—despondent after being teased  for being gifted—is visited by First Lady Michelle Obama. In her pep talk  to Lisa’s school, the First Lady says, “So kids, be nice to Lisa, because the  overachievers will someday be running the country, and you don’t want  them to be too screwed up.”  While promises of future power and riches is one way that the net- geek becomes a hero, it is also in line with many of the ideas—if not the  rationalizations—about nerds and their demonization. The “future riches”  idea, in fact, was discussed by Shary who noted, “This notion that a better  life is waiting for the nerd is common to most of these films, a suspended  promise of success in a world where intelligence and sensitivity are val- ued, a world unlike school.”131 Arguably such a framing justifies bullying  and ostracism on the grounds that in the future the netgeeks will rule the  world132 as well as reiterating the screen rule that overachievers can’t have  it all.  This chapter identified and analyzed many of the stereotypes associated  with the portrayal of the netgeek on screen. While much has changed  in society at large, the netgeek is still commonly portrayed as someone  inherently different from those around them. Equally, while such charac- ters might be construed as more accepted today than at any other time in  recent history, such characters are still not fully integrated: Yes, hipsters  might wear their oversized glasses and ironically old-fashioned cardigans  but on-screen netgeeks also speak strangely and are frequently defined by  their status as an outlier. Chapter 2 expands on some of the themes of this  chapter—notably the idea of the Internet user as sedentary—to explore  the cyberspace caricature of the neckbeard.    2  The worse you look the   smarter they think you are:   The neckbeard  Neckbeard is a pejorative term used to describe an overweight male Inter- net user who, like the netgeeks discussed in Chapter 1, is defined by his  social peculiarities. More than just social awkwardness, however, such a  character is often malicious online, engaged in trolling and other antisocial  behavior. Obesity, unkemptness, bad skin, a lack of personal hygiene, junk  food consumption, and misogyny are attributes commonly associated with  this character and are each examined, and problematized, in this chapter.  Whereas geeks and nerds predate the Internet age, the neckbeard is nota- bly a product of it: The ability to a live a life almost exclusively online,  and to use such a tool—anonymously—to cause trouble, is a specifically  modern phenomena. While not a term or concept that has received exten- sive academic attention, neckbeard was nevertheless added to the Oxford  Online dictionary in 20141 and is a slur used widely online.  In  this  chapter  the  qualities  of  the  neckbeard  as  manifested  in  film  and television are explored. Just as the neckbeard is largely absent from  academic literature, the character does not actually have a large presence  in film and television either: while it is a term referenced in innumer- able online discussions, is a feature of infinite memes, was the subject of  a webseries  Fat Guy Stuck in the Internet [2007] , and had a role in the  music video for the Ariana Grande song “One Last Time”  2015 , the    44   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  neckbeard is not effortlessly located in popular media. While such char- acters do exist, more easily detected are the individual attributes of the  archetype  the unkemptness, the obesity, the trolling  that are frequently  presented individually as metonyms for Internet users.  Given that neckbeard is a description grounded in appearance—Oxford  Online  defines  it  as  “growth  of  hair  on  a  man’s  neck,  especially  when  regarded  as  indicative  of  poor  grooming”2—the  starting  point  for  this  discussion is aesthetics. I explored in Chapter 1 the enormous crossover  between the style of geeks and nerds and the contemporary, fashionable  look of hipsters. The popularity of beards in recent years is part of this  trend. The “beard” of the neckbeard, however, is not a reference to the  stylishly cultivated facial hair worn by men at the vanguard of fashion,  but rather describes hair grown on places other than the face, for example,  under the chin. Such hair is invariably indicative of a messy, slovenly, and  notably  unattractive  person.  Equally,  whereas  thick-framed  glasses  and  cardigans may have recently been reappropriated as fashionable by the  mainstream  Chapter 1 , chin hair, bad skin, and obesity are still widely  considered  as  loathsome  qualities  and  suggestive  of  a  disregard  toward  personal appearance.  The starting point for this discussion is the screen connection between   gender, computing, and style.  Men, Computing, and Fashion  In the drama Antitrust  2001 , Brian  Nate Dushku  commented to his  fellow programmers about job interview attire: “The worse you look the  smarter they think you are.” On one hand this remark seems incongru- ous in a Zeitgeist that so heavily values appearance and where time and  money spent on looks is not merely appropriate but, seemingly, a sign of  a sound mind. And yet, in the world of computing this idea actually has  some relevance: The nerd-look is invariably used on screen to mark a char- acter as a netgeek; something illustrated particularly well in the “Woolly  Bullies” episode of the crime-drama 21 Jump Street  1987–1991 , as well  as in the films Dot.Kill  2005  and Cyberstalker  2012 , where men suc- cessfully disguise themselves as nerds simply by donning the stereotypical  glasses and pocket protectors  Chapter 1 .  Whereas certain industries have a reputation for glamor and stylish- ness,  the  world  of  computing—be  it  attributable  to  media  depictions,  reality, or a combination of both—exists at the opposite end of the spec- trum. In the pilot of the sitcom Dweebs  1995 , for example—centered       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    45  on the four male founders of a software company called Cyberbyte—Karl   Stephen Tobolowsky   identified  himself  as  a  nerd  and  gestured  to  his  clothing  as  proof:  “Everything  I  own  is  the  color  of  mulch.”  Aestheti- cally Karl fits popular perceptions of those working in computing: The  industry is assumed to be populated by people—by men—who appar- ently don’t know anything about fashion or grooming and thus dress for  comfort and functionality.  More than just being an unfashionable industry, computing appears to  attract specific criticism for being populated by men who are distinctly  unkempt. Like the dark and messy basements they reside in  Chapter 1 ,  physically such characters often appear similarly. This idea was alluded to  by sociologist Deborah Lupton in her work on the body of the computer  user. Lupton discussed a visit that the computer entrepreneur Bill Gates  made to Australia in the early 1990s, and quoted from a newspaper that  identified his preference for McDonalds over fine dining and that, nota- bly,  spotlighted  his  appearance:  “The  overwhelming  impression  Gates  gives you is that he’s so focused on his work that he’s oblivious to life’s  little chores, even if it’s just to clean some of the grease off his glasses.”3 In  a scene from the biopic Pirates of Silicon Valley  1999 , the Bill Gates char- acter  Anthony Michael Hall  messily eats pizza while driving a car. The  idea of Bill Gates—a man widely considered as a computer genius—not  being bothered with grooming highlights a theme underpinning screen  portrayals of computer users: that appearance—that fashion—is far less  interesting to them than their work. The real-life computer entrepreneur  Mark Zuckerberg actually verbalized this idea in 2014 when he was asked  about the why of his daily gray T-shirt and black hoodie “uniform”: “I  want to clear my life so I have to make as few decisions as possible beyond  serving  this  community.”4  On  screen,  Trey   Joe  Dinicol   in  the  “Kid  Charlemagne” episode of the sitcom Betas  2013–2014  made the same  point: “I just don’t care about style. I care about efficiency. You know,  research shows that wasting brain power on small decisions like fashion  actually erodes your ability to make big ones.” In spite of the rise of geek  chic  Chapter 1 , the connection between computing and a disinterest in  personal appearance seemingly still exists.  The netgeek’s single-minded obsession with technology was discussed  in Chapter 1. Brian in Antitrust, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg also ref- erence this idea: that for some netgeeks, their work is simply more impor- tant than their appearance. The depiction of such single-mindedness, of  course,  actually  began  long  before  computers.  Absent-minded  profes- sors and mad scientists are familiar stereotypes: scholars so absorbed in    46   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  their intellectual pursuits that they neglect the small details of life. Shana  Priwer and Cynthia Phillips in their work on Albert Einstein discussed  this idea: “Einstein became the prototype for a certain type of genius as  portrayed in popular media and literature. With his wild white hair and  lack of socks, Einstein certainly fits our mental picture of an eccentric  scientific genius.”5 The cotemporary news coverage of the physicist Brian  Cox illustrates particularly well how enduring the Einstein image is. In  a 2014 British newspaper article, for example, Cox was introduced in a  manner that has become typical him: “With his trendy haircut, rock-star  credentials  and  obvious  enthusiasm  for  his  subject,  this  professor  is  as  far away from the starchy image of a stuffy academic as Mercury is from  Neptune.”6 Such a profile only makes sense in a world where the Einstein  image remains the default perception of academics, particularly for those  in the sciences. That Cox gets so much mainstream attention—and with  much of it involving commentary on his appearance—highlights that he  is considered an anomaly: Intellectuals are more commonly thought of,  akin to Einstein, as work-obsessed grunts who are not interested in styling  their hair, let along the vagaries of fashion. In Chapter 1, I discussed char- acters whose obsession with the Internet saw them elect to isolate them- selves with their computers rather than leave the house: so intent was their  single-mindedness. A consequence is that appearance falls by the wayside.  Folklorist Simon Bronner, in his discussion of academic archetypes, spot- lighted that nerds in the popular imaginary are “undersized, bespectacled,  and unkempt.”7 In entomologist Mary Barbercheck’s work on nerds in  advertisements, she similarly noted, “Nerds can be recognized by their  unkempt hair, heavy-framed glasses, and pocket protectors.”8 Information  technology scholar Nathan Ensmenger made the same point, noting that  the nerd is “invariably represented as eccentric, unkempt, antisocial—and  male.”9 The point made in each of these discussions is that the netgeek  rarely leaves the house and has little contact with others, thus dressing up  and grooming are rendered unnecessary.10  While  change  is  occurring  incrementally,  computing  is  still  largely  thought of, and certainly portrayed on screen, as a male profession. While  the television series Mad Men  2007–2015 —about the male-dominated  advertising  industry  of  the  1960s—exists  as  an  outlier  example  where  men’s dapper styling was a key component,11 generally the “frivolity” of  fashion is construed as women’s  or homosexual men’s  domain. While  men’s interest in grooming has, of course, changed in recent years, ush- ering  words  like  metrosexual  and  manscaping  into  popular  parlance,  computing—be it as a profession or more simply as recreation—has not       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    47  completely  benefited  from  an  image  makeover  and  stereotypes  of  the  industry’s staff largely remain in sync with those spotlighted by Bronner,  Barbercheck, and Ensmenger. One explanation centers on the gendered  nature of the industry. Without anybody to impress, a workplace exists  full of men keen to prove that they are less emasculated than their nerdy  colleagues; that they may be in a feminized profession  Chapter 1  but  that they have not been feminized themselves.12 This idea plays out in the  pilot of the British sitcom The IT Crowd  2006–2013 , for example, when  Jen  Katherine Parkinson  first arrived for work in Roy  Chris O’Dowd   and Maurice’s  Richard Ayoade  basement. Before speaking to her, Roy  quickly applied deodorant all over his body and Moss checked his teeth  in the mirror: Apparently only the presence of a woman motivated the  men to groom.  That Roy and Maurice only groomed because of Jen’s sudden appear- ance alludes to another screen rationale for unkemptness: The absence of  a feminine influence. The notion of a “feminine touch” is common in the  world of interior design whereby soft furnishings such as throw pillows  and drapery are associated with women, with femininity. As applied to this  discussion, while the absence of a feminine touch is evident in every scene  where a man computes from a dark and messy basement  Chapter 1 ,  men existing without the influence of women is clearly illustrated through  attire: Men dress terribly when they don’t have women either to impress  or to teach them otherwise. This latter idea was well illustrated in the  pilot of Dweebs when Cyberbyte got its first office manager, Carey  Far- rah Forke . While it is a theme throughout the series, in the pilot, one  of Carey’s first workplace accomplishments was taking Karl to buy new  clothes. Even after her lack of computer skills was exposed, Carey was  allowed to remain in her position: While unspoken, she served as a well- received civilizing force on the men. First airing over a decade later, the  sitcom The Big Bang Theory  2007–  bares much narrative semblance to  Dweebs. Like Carey, Penny  Kaley Cuoco  occupies the “dumb blonde”  role and while she may know nothing about the men’s world of science,  she—like Carey—exists to make the men more well-rounded: She takes  care of a number of feminine duties such as “emotional work”13 as wit- nessed  by  her  doling  out  relationship  advice  to  Sheldon   Jim   Parsons   and Leonard  Johnny Galecki ; the men are, according to the nerd stereo- type, machinelike  Chapter 1  and, thus, clueless about feelings. In “The  Werewolf Transformation” episode, Penny takes her feminine duties seri- ously enough to actually cut Sheldon’s hair.14 Similar ideas play out in The  IT Crowd: Maurice and Roy constitute the IT department of Reynham    48   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Industries and had been, at least until the pilot, working alone in the base- ment. In the pilot, however, Jen was hired to manage them. Like Carey  in Dweebs, Jen lied on her resume: She, in fact, knew nothing about com- puters either  in line with gender stereotypes where women are expected  to  know  nothing  about  science  or  technology .15  Also,  like  Carey  and  Penny, Jen functioned to compensate for some of the men’s deficiencies.  In the first episode, she identified Maurice and Roy’s social deficits and in  the process found a niche for herself on the team: “People like you need  a person to deal with people. A people person like me.” In line with ste- reotypes of nerds as social failures—and in sync with gender stereotypes  associating women with sociability and emotional intelligence16—one of  Jen’s first achievements was throwing a party for the IT department to  ingratiate Maurice and Roy to their colleagues  a party that started off  well until Maurice told a sexually inappropriate story, typical of a socially  clueless nerd, thus ruining things .  The idea of women civilizing men is considered a controversial asser- tion, particularly among feminists. The conservative writer George Gilder,  for example, claimed in Men and Marriage that “women domesticate and  civilize male nature. They can jeopardize male discipline and identity, and  civilization as well, merely by giving up the role.”17 Such a position served  to justify Gilder’s advocacy for women’s roles as housewives and mothers.  While Gilder’s views seem thoroughly anachronistic, characters like Carey  in Dweebs, Penny in The Big Bang Theory, and Jen in The IT Crowd do, in  fact, illustrate the role—if not the necessity—of the “feminine touch” in  the male-dominated world of computing.  Single-minded computer obsession, isolation, immaturity, and separa- tion from women are all factors that can lead to one of the most obvious  visual traits of the neckbeard, and one explicitly named by Bronner, Bar- bercheck and Ensmenger: Unkemptness.  Unkemptness  On  screen  most  nerds  actually  aren’t  unkempt:  As  discussed  in  Chapter  1,  most  of  the  netgeeks  mentioned—like  Steve  Urkel   Jaleel  White  in the sitcom Family Matters  1989–1998  or Sheldon in The Big  Bang Theory—are actually very well groomed. Steve, in fact, is an example  of the overdressed nerd who wears ties even when inappropriate, and, in the  aforementioned “The Werewolf Transformation” episode of The Big Bang  Theory, Sheldon is so meticulous about the scheduling of his haircuts that  being just one day overdue sees him lamenting that he feels “like a teen       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    49  heartthrob.” That said, unkemptness, of course, is common in portray- als of men working in computing. In the sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun   1996–2001 , Dick  John Lithgow  was normally a well-groomed college  professor. In the “Y2dicK” episode, however, he used the Internet for the  first time and became a victim of instant addiction. A clear illustration  of his new obsession was his disheveled appearance: When Dick was dis- covered in his office after several days of uninterrupted Web browsing, he  was dressed in a bathrobe and T-shirt, both heavily stained. In the Irish  drama Love Eternal  2013 , in line with his Internet addiction, young Ian   Robert de Hoog  abruptly stopped going to school—stopped, in fact,  leaving the house—and spent his time chatting to his friends online. His  hair was matted and he was surrounded by moldy food. In the biopic Jobs   2013 , the dishevelment of the title character  Ashton Kutcher  is men- tioned repeatedly; in one scene Steve’s boss at Atari commented, “People  are complaining about your behavior. And your odor. Are you showering  like we discussed?” In the pilot of the The IT Crowd, Roy was introduced  as  unshaven,  wearing  rumpled  attire,  and  eating  snack  foods;  he  then  licked clean each individual finger, slowly, in an exaggerated way to show- case his disgustingness. In the “Fifty Fifty” episode, the same character  went on a date with an unnoticed brown smudge—that could have been  either chocolate or feces—on his forehead; he had clearly not bothered to  even look in the mirror beforehand. Such disheveled uncouthness is, in  fact, widely detected. In the sci-fi film Surrogates  2009 , Bobby  Devin  Ratray  was the fat and coarse system administrator: In one scene, sitting  at his terminal, he let out an exaggerated burp and said, “Oooooh boy,  I felt that one coming.” The hacker character Plague  Tomas Köhler  in  the Swedish film Män som hatar kvinnor  The Girl with the Dragon Tat- too   2009 —who also appeared in its follow-up Luftslottet som sprängdes   The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest   2009  and the spin-off minise- ries Millennium  2010 —is another example of the slovenly neckbeard:  He has dirty hair and unstylish clothing and is notably fat. In one scene  when Lisbeth  Noomi Rapace  visited him, Plague commented that she  smelled of alcohol, to which Lisbeth sarcastically retorted, “And you just  showered?” Plague’s uncouthness was particularly well illustrated during  her visit when he used the toilet, with the door open. The character Plague   Tony Way  in the U.S. version of  Girl  with  the  Dragon Tattoo  2011   was presented in this same slovenly way. In the “Mayored to the Mob”  episode of the animated series The Simpsons  1989– , Jeff Albertson, bet- ter known as the Comic Book Guy—the series’ fat, pony-tailed, bearded  neckbeard—met a woman at a comic book convention. The Comic Book    50   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Guy asked her, “How do you feel about 45-year-old virgins who still live  with their parents?” to which the woman responded, “Comb the Sweet  Tarts out of your beard and you’re on,” in turn comically drawing atten- tion to his dishevelment.18 The “Bullseye” episode of Law & Order: Special  Victims  Unit   1999– ,  centered  on  an  overweight  couple—Jeff   Daniel  Stewart Sherman  and Amber Sarmonsky  Melissa Rain Anderson —who  were both disheveled gaming addicts: while both had dirty hair and dirty  clothes, Jeff also had a beard and in one scene Detective Benson  Mariska  Hargitay  rebuked him, “You stink like you haven’t bathed in a month.”  Jeff’s aggressive conduct toward detectives solidified his neckbeard creden- tials. Like Amber, Penny in the “The Barbarian Sublimation” episode in  The Big Bang Theory also  albeit for only one episode  became an online  gaming addict and in the process succumbed to dishevelment: Her clothes  were stained and she had stopped showering. In the “Make Love, Not  Warcraft” episode of the animated series South Park  1997– , Jenkins— the  griefer19  character—was  fat,  filthy,  and  seemingly  part-bearded,  part-acne-ridden, and, in line with personality attributes explored later in  this chapter, he was generally an awful person.20  While Dick in 3rd Rock from the Sun and Roy in The IT Crowd illus- trate that slim, or at least average-sized, male characters can be slovenly,  slenderness and unkemptness in fact actually have no established cultural  connection: More common is the unkempt fat person portrayal. In West- ern culture, as psychotherapist Colleen Heenan noted, “Thinness equates  with moral constraint or self-discipline. The slim and ‘toned’ body is the  epitome  of  the  managed  and  useful  body  within  consumer  culture.”21  Conversely, however, fatness is routinely bound to untidiness: to be fat is  to have given up, to have let oneself go and to have stopped conforming  to societal expectations: that is, to be deviant. In cultural theorist Niall  Richardson’s work on transgressive bodies, he discussed this idea:  Consider one of the most commonly cited descriptions of fat people: the  fat slob. Firstly, this term is distinctly classed as “slob” suggests the true  underclass, the body which does not even engage in the labour force but  simply slobs around the house. Secondly, it conflates the idea of the dirty,  unkempt house with the unkempt body as if fat itself were a form of dirt  or pollution.22  While Plague, the Comic Book Guy, Jenkins, and Jeff were each over- weight characters portrayed as physically disheveled, more common on  screen is the caricature of the fat male netgeek who, while not physically       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    51  dirty, is rendered as such because he is overweight in a culture that assumes  that fatness—akin to dirty hair—is a sign of a person’s physical, moral,  and potentially even sexual deviance.  Fatness and Internet Use  While Plague, the Comic Book Guy, Jenkins, and Jeff exist as fairly  typical neckbeard characters—each embodies the typical fatness, dishevel- ment, and facial hair  and, as addressed later in this chapter, the neckbeard  personality attributes —fatness and computing actually have a specific and  extensive history in film and television linking fatness with computing.  In the sitcom Head of the Class  1986–1990 —centered on a class of  high-achievers—Dennis Blunden  Dan Schneider  was fat and also the  class  computer  whiz.  In  the  hacker-drama  Sneakers   1992 ,  “Mother”   Dan  Akroyd   was  an  overweight,  conspiracy  theorist,  and  computer  genius.  In  the  adventure  film  Jurassic  Park   1993 ,  Dennis   Wayne  Knight ,  was  an  overweight  computer  programmer.  In  the  short-lived  adult animated series Spicy City  1997 , Flaxson was the obese hacker  investigator. In “The Comic Con” episode of the sitcom Brotherly Love   1995–1997 , the fat, bearded Lloyd  Michael McShane  started online  dating from his basement. In the animated film Monster House  2006 ,  Reginald “Skull” Skulkinski was a fat gamer. In the action-drama Live  Free or Die Hard  2007 , Frederick “Warlock” Kaludis  Kevin Smith  was  a bearded, fat hacker. In the Canadian comedy Control Alt Delete  2008 ,  the protagonist was Lewis  Tyler Labine , an overweight, bearded pro- grammer. In the sci-fi thriller Gamer  2009 , Gorge  Ramsey Moore — obese, naked, eating sandwiches made of waffles dipped in syrup—was  a compulsive gamer. In the drama series 24  2001–2010 , Edgar Stiles   Louis Lombardi  was an overweight computer engineer with a lisp. In an  unnamed episode of season three of the British crime series Luther  2010– 2013 , an obese murder victim, Jared Cass, was described by detectives as  a “sickness beneficiary, cyber activist . . . whatever that might be.” In the  romantic-comedy Wish I Was Here  2014 , Noah  Josh Gad  was an over- weight computer geek who entertained himself by sending misogynistic  Tweets. In the biopic Takedown  2000 , the overweight and bearded Dan   Ethan  Suplee   was  one  of  the  computer  technicians  assigned  to  track  down the hacker Kevin Mitnick  Skeet Ulrich . Bobby in Surrogates, also  fat, was mentioned earlier. In the comedy Hot Tub Time Machine  2010 ,  Jacob  Clark Duke  was a chubby compulsive gamer. In the Disney ani- mated  series  Kim  Possible   2002–2007 , Wade  Load  was  a  10-year-old    52   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  overweight computer genius with a punny name; in the Disney live action  series A.N.T. Farm  2011–2014 —akin to Head of the Class it centered  on a class of prodigies—Angus Chestnut  Aedin Mincks , was a chubby  preteen computing wunderkind. In the animated series Archer  2009– ,  Bilbo is a fat and underskilled computer nerd. In the sitcom Commu- nity  2009– , Neil  Charley Koontz  is the overweight nerd whose main  hobby is playing Dungeons and Dragons. In Jobs, Steve’s partner, Steve  Wozniak  Josh Gad , is overweight and bearded.23 Trax  Jordan Raskop- oulos  was the fat, bearded hacker in the Australian biopic Underground:  The  Julian  Assange  Story   2012 .  In  the  “Internet Troll”  episode  of  the  sitcom Maron  2013– , the troll who had been hassling the title character   Marc Maron  was a chubby nerd named Darryl  Erik Charles Nielsen .  In the crime-drama series CSI: Cyber  2015– , Daniel  Charley Koontz   is  a  fat,  bearded  cybersecurity  expert.  In  the  “Re-Do”  episode  of  the  police-drama Blue Bloods  2010– , Hugh Stayton  Henry Zebrowski  is a  bearded fat man who operates an “ironic” crime site called LuckyStabby- Knife.com. While the fat computer netgeek is a stereotype normally asso- ciated with men, Amber from the aforementioned “Bullseye” episode of  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was a fat female gamer, and Penelope   Kirsten Vangsness  from the crime-drama Criminal Minds  2005–  is a  larger-than-average female computer whiz whose interest in online gam- ing is mentioned in numerous episodes.  Just as the netgeek is an archetype associated with white men, equally  the neckbeard has a similar racial profile: each of the examples discussed  thus far are fat, often-bearded white males. Attributes of the neckbeard  character can, however, also be seen in some more racially diverse presen- tations. In the adventure film Transformers  2007 , Glen  Anthony Ander- son  is a fat black hacker. In Control Alt Delete, one of Lewis’s colleagues is  a fat black man, Keith  Keith Dallas , who moonlights as a webmaster for  an erotic webcam site. In the comedy Celebrity Sex Tape  2012 , Douglas   Andre Meadows , is a black, overweight webmaster whose life revolves  around gaming and netporn. The Asian neckbeard is an ever rarer pre- sentation, likely attributable to the general absence of Asian characters  in Western cinema and even more so the paucity of fat Asian characters.  The Singaporean romantic-drama Be with Me  2005  provide a nod to  this  trope  via  the  unnamed  apartment  block  security  guard   Lawrence  Yong  who is both overweight and bearded. Much of the guard’s “leisure”  activities involve spying on a female tenant  Lynn Poh  using the build- ing’s CCTV technology. While the character wasn’t malicious—in fact,  he  is  presented  more  simply  as   a   in  love  and   b   cripplingly  socially       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    53  awkward—his spying, facilitated by computer technology, is nevertheless  invasive and the character is rendered desperate and creepy.24 Another fat  Asian nerd featured in the Indian thriller Arrambam  2013 : via flashback,  the hacker Arjun  Arya  was shown to have been a fat computer nerd  while at college.  Not all of these fat computer operators, of course, exhibit all of the  neckbeard  qualities—they  aren’t  all  bearded  or  all  misogynistic,  for  example—but each help to make a solid case for the screen’s persistent  coupling of fatness and computing. This focus-on-fat highlights a num- ber of themes discussed thus far in this book: In the following sections  I examine the role of junk food, the sedentary lifestyle, and the assumed  lack of sex appeal of the computer user as identifiable through weight- centered depictions.  Junk Food  Bill Gates’s supposed preference for burgers over haute cuisine was men- tioned earlier. This idea alludes to a common presentation in Internet- themed narratives: the coupling of netgeeks and junk food. In an early  scene in the Internet-themed drama The Net  1995 , Angela  Sandra Bull- ock  declined a dinner invitation from her client. Not only did she turn  down an opportunity to leave her home and to socialize but as soon as  the call ended she ordered a pizza online. This presentation, in line with  a variety of others discussed in Chapter 1, highlights that for characters  whose involvement with the Internet leads to self-imposed isolation, junk  food is regularly consumed. When Dick got addicted to the Internet in  the “Y2dicK” episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun, part of the demonstra- tion of his addiction was the fast food containers all over his office: he  had apparently not even left his desk to eat. The same thing transpired  in the “Kitty” episode of CSI  2000–2015  whereby the online dating  profile photo of a murder suspect showed overstuffed trash cans and food  containers, something that the crime scene investigators Avery  Patricia  Arquette  and Nick  George Eads  discussed:  Nick:  Cans are stuffed. To-go cups, food containers, he orders in a lot. Avery:  He’s agoraphobic. He doesn’t like to leave, even to eat.  The socially isolated Plague in the Dragon Tattoo films was similarly   presented in the vicinity of pizza and cereal boxes.  While in these scenes the junk food Internet link is presented as part  of a social isolation narrative  Chapter 1 , in a variety of other examples,    54   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  the consumption of such food is depicted more simply as part of the  lifestyle of netgeeks: that Internet users are a different breed  Chapter  1  and that this breed consumes high quantities of fast food. Lisbeth   Rooney  Mara   in  the  U.S.  version  of  The  Girl  with  Dragon  Tattoo,  appeared,  for  example,  to  subsist  on  ramen  noodles,  Coke,  and  ciga- rettes.  The  pilot  of  Betas  opened  with  an  overweight  netgeek  messily  eating Cheetos; the pilot of The IT Crowd opened with Roy eating snack  foods. In the “Fifty Fifty” episode of the IT Crowd Roy actually eats a  bucket of fried chicken. The Comic Book Guy in The Simpsons is shown  constantly drinking soda and eating junk food: In the “Bart the Fink”  episode, he pushed a wheelbarrow full of tacos and remarked, “Yes, this  should provide adequate sustenance for the Doctor Who [1963–] mara- thon.” The British miniseries Killer Net  1998  opened with a man at  a computer throwing an empty soda can into a bin already filled with  soda cans. In the crime-drama Hackers  1995 , in one scene the hacker  The Plague  Fisher Stevens  is introduced taking a phone call from his  bedroom; soda cans and snack food debris surrounds his bed. During a  business meeting the same character eats a candy bar; the other hacker  characters are frequently shown with soda cans and pizza boxes. In Anti- trust, mentioned earlier, computer mogul Gary  Tim Robbins  is shown  throughout the film either carrying or eating from a can of Pringles.25 In  the “Make Love, Not Warcraft” episode of South Park, Cartman, Kyle,  Stan, and Kenny consume so much ramen noodles, energy drinks, and  Hot Pockets that they end up acne-ridden and obese. Hot pockets were  similarly a theme in the romantic-comedy Sydney White  2007 : Soror- ity queen Rachel  Sara Paxton  paid a nerd with Hot Pockets to hack  her love rival’s computer. In the television drama Cyber Seduction: His  Secret  Life   2005 ,  Justin   Jeremy  Sumpter —the  titular  teen  netporn  addict—is repeatedly shown drinking soda; the more addicted to porn  he becomes, the more soda he consumes. In the comedy I-See-You.Com   2006 , three nerds watch Audrey  Baelyn Neff  masturbate via a web- cam: One was shown eating a donut. In Pirates of Silicon Valley, as he  builds one of the first personal computers Steve Wozniak  Joey Slotnick   is in the vicinity of empty Coke bottles and Twinkie wrappers. In Gamer,  Gorge eats his waffle sandwiches while playing an online reality simula- tion game. In the “Bullseye” Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode  discussed earlier, the Sarmonskys’ house was filthy, notably littered with  food packaging. In the drama August  2008 , David  Rip Torn  ques- tioned his net-entrepreneur son, Tom  Josh Harnett , about his start-up  business and also alluded to the key role of junk food:      T H E   n E C K B E A R D    55  What do you actually do, Tom? . . . I’m serious. I was there last Friday . . .  You know what I saw? Oreos . . . What I saw was a whole bunch of kids,  bright  young  kids,  they’re  all  just  sitting  around. When  they  got  tired  of sitting—which was more often than not—they got up to go to the  kitchen to eat some Oreos.  In  film  theorists  Geoff  King  and Tanya  Krzywinska’s  work  on  sci-fi  cinema, they discussed Dennis from Jurassic Park, describing him as the  “archetypal nerd” and briefly mentioned his dietary habits:  Dennis Nedry  an anagram of ‘nerdy’ , is a programmer in charge of the  computer  that  controls  the  park.  His  workstation  is  littered  with  coke  cans, crisp packets and candy-bar wrappers. Overweight, lazy, greedy for  junk food and money, he fulfils the stereotypical attributes of the com- puter  nerd.  Lacking  both  nutritional  and  moral  fibre,  he  becomes  the  main catalyst for the disastrous release of the dinosaurs.26  While King and Krzywinska do allude to Dennis’s diet as indicative  of both a paucity of “nutritional and moral fibre,” the whys of the net- geek junk food connection are seldom examined beyond the trope sim- ply being stated: Lupton, for example, noted that “this type of computer  body is physically repugnant according to commonly accepted notions of  attractiveness . . . Their bodies are soft, not hard, from too much physi- cal inactivity and junk food”27 but did not extensively discuss the whys.  Something similar transpired in the work of computer scientist Thomas  Orr who identified that “computer people frequently consume too much  junk food, drink too much caffeine, and get too little exercise.”28  The first obvious explanation for the junk food presentation is access.  In the aforementioned 3rd Rock from the Sun episode, after discovering  the capabilities of the Internet, Dick exulted, “The entire planet is at my  fingertips!” The “Y2dicK” episode in fact showcased a variety of things  that the new technology could facilitate: From the comfort of his office,  Dick could conduct “surgery” and “attend” a street festival. Not having  to go out for food was another thing that Dick’s new online life offered.  Showcasing capability was particularly important for narratives like The  Net, Hackers, and the 3rd Rock from the Sun episode: Each transpired in  the 1990s and thus existed as early mainstream Internet depictions where  the technology was new, exciting, and scary and where themes of Internet  self-sufficiency  Chapter 1  were depicted  as well as problematized .  Another explanation centers on the social isolation themes discussed  already in this chapter: that netgeeks seek opportunities to avoid social    56   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  interaction and therefore ordering in food is a way to portray the lengths  they will go to avoid people. This issue was identified explicitly by Avery  in  the  CSI  episode  discussed  earlier  where,  of  the  murder  suspect,  she  noted,  “He’s  agoraphobic.  He  doesn’t  like  to  leave,  even  to  eat.”  Dick  in 3rd Rock from the Sun—during the worst parts of his addiction—was  unable to do anything other than stare at his computer; when he heard  a knock at the door he couldn’t even turn his head from the screen and  instead just robotically said: “Just slide the pizza under the door please.”  In such a portrayal, the food-type is less important than the mode by  which it is obtained; ideally without human contact or having to divert  one’s attention from their monitor.  A final explanation offered in this section for the recurrent presence of  junk food relates to the Mark Zuckerberg quote discussed earlier about  netgeek workaholics: Work obsession often thwarts characters from tak- ing the time to eat properly. Research on hacking repeatedly identifies  that  participants  will  work  exhausting  hours  where  food—like  fashion  as  discussed  earlier—gets  rendered  an  afterthought:  as  sociologist  Paul  Taylor noted, “The typical hacker thinks nothing of eating one meal a  day and subsisting on junk food, or of sleeping from 4am to noon.”29  This idea was illustrated well in the pilot of Dweebs when Warren  Peter  Scolari  remarked to the new office manager, Carey, “Explain something  to me. Lunch. What’s . . . What’s that all about? . . . I understand the  need for food in the middle of the day . . . I just don’t understand why  it needs to be lunch. Everybody off sitting together, chit-chatting, laugh- ing.” The underpinning here is that Warren is so single-minded about his  work that food is rendered as an afterthought and its social consumption  an unnecessary luxury. Connected to this idea—and referenced in Tay- lor’s comments—are the possibly nocturnal or, at least, irregular hours  kept by netgeeks. In Chapter 1, I noted that many netgeek characters  isolate themselves in dark spaces. A variation of this is that netgeeks and  neckbeards  as well as hackers discussed in Chapter 4  are routinely pre- sented as conducting their activities at night. It, therefore, stands to rea- son that for characters who work nocturnally, junk food might be their  best or even only option: that ordering a pizza is far preferable to cooking  a meal late in the evening. Nocturnality and fighting one’s body clock  is  actually  referenced  in  examples  where  coffee  and  energy  drinks  are  presented as essential in keeping characters alert for long hours. In one  scene from Hackers, the titular characters were watching a late night TV  show called Hack the Planet when one of the show’s stars—Blade  Peter  Y. Kim —holds up a can of Jolt soda: “For late night hacks, Jolt Cola,       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    57  soft drink of the elite hacker.” In another scene, one of the hackers, Joey   Jesse Bradford , attends an addicts meeting: “My name’s Joey but I’m  not an addict,” he says while chain-smoking and drinking coffee. In the  “Elephant’s Memory” episode of Criminal Minds, Penelope is advised to  cut back on coffee. In NCIS  2003–  the forensic scientist and computer  whiz Abby  Pauley Perrette  is addicted to the highly caffeinated beverage  Caf-Pow. In the biopic The Fifth Estate  2013 , the hacker Julian  Bene- dict Cumberbatch  actually asks for some energy drink, “It might be a  long night,” he says. In the “Proof of Concept” episode of Silicon Valley  Richard’s  Thomas Middleditch  long night of programming is supple- mented by cans of Red Bull. Red Bull similarly fuels Matt’s  Justin Long   late-night hacking in Live Free or Die Hard. The junk food diet is simi- larly mentioned repeatedly in work on hacking30 and is illustrated well by  Kevin  Austin Abrams , a teen programmer, in the “Third Party Insourc- ing” episode of the sitcom Silicon Valley  2014– , who boasted about just  how quickly he could get a job done: “I pound Mello Yello, Oreos, and  Adderall and I don’t sleep until I’m done.”  While certainly not all the characters discussed in this section are fat,  the presence of junk food in computer-themed narratives exists to nor- malize  the  fatness computing  link  and  to  provide  a  why  for  the  obese  presentations discussed earlier.  While junk food is one component of the persistent computing fatness   coupling, another is the sedentary nature of such work.  A Sedentary Lifestyle  In the opening of Surrogates, the narrator remarked, “We’re not meant  to experience the world through a machine.” This comment references  the  notion  of  computers  making  people  machinelike  and  less  human   Chapter  1   and,  as  relevant  to  this  chapter,  proposes  that  time  spent  using a computer is not “living”; is not real. While this idea was popular  in early Internet-themed narratives—and is a theme in work on techno-  and cyberphobia  Chapter 1 —it gets verbalized by Officer Nancy Parras   Elizabeth Marvel  in “The Kindness of Strangers” episode of the police- drama The District  2000–2004 : “Kids should be out doing things with  each other with real human beings not virtual ones.” These examples not  only highlight the, apparently, preferential reality of life off screen, but  that  “doing  things”  outside  is  essential  to  humanity  and  that  comput- ing sabotages this.31 The television holiday film A Snow Globe Christmas   2013  took this theme further: In the parallel universe of life inside a    58   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  snow globe, the Internet has not been invented thus bolstering the magi- cal world’s true perfection.  One way, therefore, to interpret the junk food fatness computing tri- umvirate  is  that  screen-time  actually  encourages  bad  food  choices:  the  comments of Lupton and Orr hint to this and certainly research does  indeed establish a connection between screen-time  computer use as well  as television  with junk food consumption. This is partly thought to be  attributable to advertising as well as the mindless snacking that seden- tary activity can foster.32 A more nuanced interpretation, however—and  one in line with a theme presented throughout this book—is the special  powers attributed to the Internet and the technology’s apparent ability to  coerce uncharacteristic behavior: Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life provides  a particularly good example of this. Justin’s Internet time was wreaking all  kinds of havoc on his life including encouraging excessive netporn and  soda consumption. While not a 1990s film, nevertheless, this film was a  conservative, made-for-television example where the Internet is presented  as  dangerous:  In  this  case,  it  is  complicit  in  coercing  out-of-character  behavior in a boy who was once a high school swimming champion and  who, because of the Internet, became a porn and soda junkie.  In Chapter 1, I identified some of the earliest fears of the Internet being  embodied in film and television representations, notably user isolation.  While fears centered on computers and Internet use are modern incar- nations, general anxieties about convenience innovations actually have a  long history: As transportation and domestic appliances were invented to  save time and energy, the worry was that humans would go soft; this idea  was discussed in Chapter 1 in the context of the supposed “feminizing”  of jobs that necessitated less physical labor. Just as the early appearances  of the Internet in film and television often reflected fears of user isola- tion and cyberpredators  Chapter 5 , equally fears of fatness are embod- ied  in  presentations  of  characters  with  “computer  bodies”:  that  this  is  what happens to the body—to humanity—when we so fervently embrace  such technology; we go soft, that we go to fat. In a culture so loathing  of fatness—discussed in the next section—the body going to fat is a sign  of regression, of lack of productivity, of society doing what—according  to  Surrogates—we  weren’t  meant  to  do  and  living  through  computers  rather than our physical selves. A good illustration of this transpired in  the aforementioned “Make Love, Not Warcraft” episode of South Park.  Jenkins was proving an indomitable force in the online game World of  Warcraft so the central schoolboy characters—Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and  Kenny—committed to beating him through hours of game play. Across       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    59  the course of their pursuit, Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny each became  mini-neckbeards themselves: Through excessive junk food consumption  and scant physical activity, the characters became lazy, long-haired, over- weight, and covered with acne. While the portrayal was humorous—in  sync with the irreverent if not subversive nature of the series—nevertheless,  the negative transformation of the characters can be construed as a cau- tionary tale about excessive computer use and as a metaphor more broadly  for humanity’s fervent embrace of the Internet.  In Chapter 1, I noted that invariably the netgeek is portrayed as unat- tractive. While such a character’s lack of attractiveness is often illustrated  through  his  portrayal  as  weak,  wimpy,  clumsy,  or  having  an  annoying  voice, fatness is a major contributor.  Sex Appeal and Fatness  In marketing theorist Olan Farnall’s discussion of the history of nerd  depictions in the media, he red-flagged that the character “could be either  skinny or fat but not muscular or stereotypically masculine.”33 Whereas  the wimpiness of the netgeek is discussed in Chapter 1, the neckbeard  exists at the other end of the size spectrum. Despite their size differences,  the fat neckbeard and the skinny netgeek share an important trait: Exces- sive computing has had negative effects on their physical appearance and,  in  turn,  has  rendered  them  sexually  unattractive. While  the  netgeek  is  unattractive because he has been emasculated by his physical weakness, in  fact, emasculation is equally a concern for obese neckbeards, too.  The emasculating nature of fatness has been discussed in several schol- arly works. Historian Sander Gilman, in his book on fatness, for example,  noted, “The meanings associated with the fat body are produced in the  spheres in which fat and masculinity are often seen as embodiments.”34  In  sociologist  Lee  Monaghan’s  work  on  deviance,  he  similarly  noted,  “In  contemporary  Anglophone  culture,  fatness  symbolizes  lack  of  self- discipline and adherence to masculine imperatives such as being active  and in control.”35 Richardson made a similar point:  For masculinity, should fat levels increase to such an extent that the male  body develops fat around the breast area—gynecomastia or “moobs”  male  boobs —then this body is contaminated by fat and has been disfigured by  no longer conforming to polarities of gender.36  “Moobs” were actually referenced in “The Ned-liest Catch” episode of  The Simpsons when the Comic Book Guy tells his love interest, Edna, “I    60   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  still wear your bra.”37 While the unattractiveness of fatness in Western  culture is easily demonstrated, the aspect of this most relevant to a discus- sion on computing is that fatness is just another way to further emasculate  and render unattractive a character who—as discussed in Chapter 1—has  already been made less manly by their involvement in the nonphysical, if  not also fantasy-oriented world of computing.  While emasculation is one component of the loathing of fatness in  our culture, there are other rationales for this. In philosopher Winfried  Menninghaus’s work on disgust, for example, the widespread human  aversion to “folds, wrinkles, warts, excessive softness, visible or overly  large  bodily  openings,  discharge  of  bodily  fluids   nasal,  pus,  blood ,  and old age” are noted.38 For characters presented as not merely over- weight  but  obese  to  the  point  of  disgust—Jenkins,  Kyle,  Stan,  and  Kenny in South Park and Gorge in Gamer for example—they exist as  incarnations of this disgust. Not only are such characters presented as  excessively soft and blubbery, but their pustulous skin and sweatiness  in fact bolsters this idea; such characters are nothing more than their  grotesqueness.  Another component of the perceived unattractiveness of fatness is the  connotation of deviance: physical as well as moral and sexual. While in  some examples such an idea is unstated, in others it is confirmed via a  character’s engagement in morally deviant behavior. Fat Dennis in Juras- sic Park, for example, was the bad character who smuggled the dinosaur  embryos out of the Park. In other examples, deviance is centered on sex:  The Comic Book Guy in The Simpsons, for example, is presented as subtly  sexually  strange;  in  “The Treehouse  of  Horror  X:  Desperately  Xeeking  Xena” episode he suggested to actress Lucy Lawless, “While we’re wait- ing, here are some names you may call me on our wedding night: Obi  Wan, Iron Man, Mr Mxyzptlk, and of course, Big Papa Smurf.” In other  examples, such as Gamer and Control Alt Delete, deviance is more explicit,  as examined in the next section. Such presentations normalize the idea of  audiences finding such characters unattractive, and in fact spotlight that  it is deviant to feel otherwise; that attraction to such a repellent character  is, in itself, fetishistic.39  While  fatness  is  seemingly  incompatible  with  masculine  ideals  and  attractiveness, in fact, more so than merely being unattractive, fatness is  widely loathed in our culture and thus its presentation on screen is often  used to encourage, as well as justify, an audience’s hatred of a character,  akin to how we are urged to hate nerds  Chapter 1 .      T H E   n E C K B E A R D    61  The Loathing of Fat  Fat-loathing is a topic that has received extensive academic attention.40  Communications scholar Jennifer-Scott Mobley, for example, noted in  the opening of her book on fatness that “Americans hate fat people. To  be fat is to be aberrant, to be ‘othered,’ and to be stigmatized in America.  At least that is what the news and media suggest.”41 One branch of the  burgeoning field of fat studies that is particularly relevant to this discus- sion centers on stereotypes. Cultural theorist William Hamilton discussed  these in the Encyclopedia of Obesity:  Many people assume that an obese individual is lazy, uncontrolled, and  unmotivated.  Those  three  characteristics  would,  in  general  opinion,  explain  why  and  how  a  person  could  accumulate  a  disproportionate  amount of body fat. In a less malicious form, obese individuals may be  seen as jolly or funny. Often, an obese person can be assumed to take on a  Santa Claus or funny-fat-man role. While these do not seem to be as harm- ful stereotypes as lazy and incompetent, the underlying assumption is that  the obese person is less of a person and more of an object of ridicule . . .   More commonly, the funny-fat-man is irresponsible, unkempt, and has  poor decision making skills.42  While  the  reasons  underpinning  the  use  of  any  stereotype  equally  underpin the use of a fat one—for humor, to “other,” to ostracize—in  the context of this chapter, the presentation is about creating a justifica- tion for character resentment. In a culture that  a  hates fat people and   b  assigns a variety of disparaging traits to them, it is no surprise that  on screen fatness is a trait used to demonize. Noted earlier, Dennis in  Jurassic Park was a villain: While his behavior helped to illustrate this,  even prior to his evil acts, his fatness provided a clue to his forthcoming  badness; he was fat in a society that abhors fatness and links it to personal  failings. While a fat man who resembles Santa Claus may be assumed  as kindly, such a figure also exists primarily to entertain. A fat character  who is unattractive physically and personally will frequently be assumed  as an antagonist. In the South Park episode discussed earlier, a griefer was  randomly killing off characters in the World of Warcraft. Eventually the  human  behind  the  malicious  online  behavior  was  exposed  as  an  acne- ridden disheveled fat man: Jenkins. This image, of course, makes com- plete sense: Audiences expect such awful behavior from such a physically  repulsive character. Such an image makes even more sense in the world  of computing where the user is presumed as fat because of the sedentary    62   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  nature of the task. Whereas it is hard to imagine an attractive man both- ering to play computer games—let alone spend time exclusively causing  trouble in them—a fat person, conversely, is assumed in our culture to  be unhappy, to be socially isolated and to self-loathe to an extent where  antisocial online activity is an outlet. The rationale for such behavior, in  fact, was alluded to in the “Internet Troll” episode of Maron discussed  earlier. After being trolled, Marc decided to take matters into his own  hands, declaring:  I’m  taking  a  stand  against  Internet  bullies.  These  maladjusted  assholes  who anonymously spew lies and hate. It’s not just about me though, man.  I’m doing this for all those sexually confused college kids who are jumping  off bridges ‘cos they were bullied. This is a crusade for decency.  While we don’t know enough about Marc’s troll in Maron, to under- stand whether he is actually a “maladjusted asshole,” audiences can none- theless see that he is a chubby nerd and they are likely already familiar  with the low status of fat nerds in pop culture. This low status was particu- larly well illustrated in “The Homer They Fall” episode of The Simpsons. In  one scene, the Comic Book Guy tried to return a too-small Ultimate Belt  to a gadget store and the following exchange occurred:  Comic Book Guy:   Store Clerk:    No, I do not have a receipt. I won it as a door prize at  a Star Trek convention, although I find their choice of  prize highly illogical, as the average Trekker has no need  of a medium-size belt.  Wow, a fat sarcastic Star Trek fan. You must be a devil  with the ladies . . . Gee, I hate to let you down, Casa- nova, but no receipt, no return.  The clerk’s comments are in line with popular perceptions of the neck- beard: Such characters are not only presented as sexually undesirable, but  actively exist as figures of ridicule. Such ridicule undoubtedly feeds into  their  perceptions  of  self  and,  in  turn,  renders  them  as  characters  with  undesirable  personalities  shaped  by  their  social  exclusion.  While  these  characters can be read as “maladjusted,” another interpretation is that they  are angry: that their treatment by society—by women in particular—has  left them bitter, if not actively rage-filled. As noted already, fat people are  widely loathed in American culture. Undoubtedly this loathing takes a  toll and thus may at least partly explain the negative behavior of some  fat people online. Certainly the reasons why a fat person might be angry       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    63  are  detected  in  numerous  screen  examples.  In  the  “My  Big  Fat  Geek  Wedding” episode of The Simpsons, for example, the Comic Book Guy  remarked, “I adore Edna. She’s near mint and comes from a very limited  edition—females who will talk to me.” In the “My Sister, My Sitter” epi- sode, the character makes a similar-themed remark: “Oh, loneliness and  cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.” While these comments are included  for humor—after all, the Comic Book Guy, like many fat portrayals, is a  comic presentation43—they also provide insights into his personality and  behavior. While the Comic Book Guy’s lack of female attention could  be  attributable  to   a   his  personality  and   b   his  nerdishness,  it  is  also  highly likely that it is due to his weight and that a life of rejection cen- tered on his fatness has left him resentful. In 2014, Elliot Rodger went  on a real-life killing spree in the United States. Prior to his rampage he  recorded a manifesto—called “Elliot Rodger’s Retribution”—that detailed  that part of his motive was women’s indifference to him.44 While not a  fat person, Rodger’s behavior nonetheless exists as an extreme example of  men—specifically male nerds45—acting out, and is indicative of the idea  of there being negative behavioural consequences to men being spurned  by women: an idea with great resonance to fat man portrayals on screen.46 One central underpinning to such fat characters is the cautionary tale  they  provide  to  audiences  about  the  dangers  of  excessive  Internet  use.  Fatness is visually a sign of excess and thus it stands to reason that a per- son so unrestrained as to get fat in the first place would have no restraint  online; be that evident in the time they spent online or how they conduct  themselves. The Sarmonskys in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit were  both clichéd fat slobs whose inability to control their Internet usage led  to neglect of their home and child. While Gorge in Gamer was physically  deviant—presented as fat, naked, and gorging on waffle-sandwiches—his  physical appearance is also completely in sync with his online activity.  Through his control of real-life avatars, he was able to vicariously engage  in real acts of sexual abuse; Gorge—in line with King and Krzywinska’s  discussion of Dennis in Jurassic Park—lacked “both nutritional and moral  fibre.”47 While obesity is connected to deviance because it fits outside of  social expectations of the body, there is also a role for sexual deviance;  Gorge  is  overindulgent  sexually  too,  getting  pleasure  outside  of  “nor- mal” sexual behavior via his online predatory activity. Such an analysis  is  equally  applicable  to  Lewis  in  Control  Alt  Delete.  Physically,  Lewis’s  obesity was inextricably linked to his excesses, notably his netporn addic- tion and notably his “perverse” behavior of having sex with computers. In  the television drama Selling Innocence  2005 , this same idea is referenced.    64   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The  film  centered  on  a  website  peddling  salacious  photos  of  underage  girls. In one scene a party was held for the website’s clients to meet the  young models. The teen model Mia  Sarah Lind  was approached at the  party by one of the overweight site users  Donovan Workun :  Oh, you must think we’re a bunch of disgusting, repulsive toads . . . You  know, I’m never going to be with a beautiful woman, Mia. I’m too poor,  too fat. But when I look at your pictures, it’s like your smile is meant for  me and me alone. So thanks for that.  In this scene, this socially awkward, overweight man articulated that  his use of the website was, in essence, the entirety of his sex life: that, in  lieu of real contact with women, he fulfilled his fantasies online.  The neckbeard’s fatness likely leads to social exclusion, which, in turn,  renders such a character angry. Such anger can be construed as a compo- nent of the antisocial behavior that is key to the neckbeard’s construction:  He is malicious online. While cyberbullying is a topic treated to a chapter  of its own  Chapter 3 , in the following sections, the manifestations of  some of the antisocial behaviors of neckbeards—as well as those charac- ters with neckbeard attributes—are examined, including amateur criti- cism, online misogyny, and hate-play.  The Amateur Critic  “Everyone’s a critic” and the cruder “Opinions are like assholes. Every- body’s got one”48 are phrases with enhanced relevance online: The pro- fessional  critic  once  held  a  position  of  esteem  while  the  audience  for  amateurs was limited. The Internet however, changed this by broadcast- ing the opinions of laypeople at the very same time as traditional sources  of professional criticism—newspapers and magazines—were in decline.  While the opinion of an amateur critic is, of course, theoretically no less  valid than a paid critic with a newspaper column,49 whereas the columnist  generally has the burden of exposing their identity and thus taking respon- sibility for criticisms espoused, online anybody can criticize and condemn  and remain totally anonymous. On one hand it is argued that anonymity  can facilitate greater honesty because a person is not self-censoring for fear  of judgment. Such an idea is the underpinning of Oscar Wilde’s famous  “Give a man a mask and he’ll tell you the truth” quote  one that Julian  Assange in fact repeats in the biopic The Fifth Estate . In work on research  methods, for example, this idea has traction in the context of the conceal- ment of the identity of study participants. As explained by social scientist       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    65  Ian  Greener,  “offering  anonymity  will  lead  to  respondents  being  more  honest, and feeling that they can say what they believe without being con- cerned whether their answers will in some way be used against them.”50  On the other hand, something Greener also highlights—and something  specifically relevant in cyberspace—is that anonymity isn’t always associ- ated with honesty but in fact can encourage deceptive conduct:  People taking part in research can behave in remarkably dishonest ways  when the assurance of anonymity is in place. Research participants have  been shown to be more likely to steal and to lie about test results they have  taken, for example, when they believe they are anonymous.51  Psychologists Monica Whitty and Adam Joinson flagged some of the  unique properties of the Internet including both that the anonymity fos- tered encourages openness but also deceit.52 While, as discussed in Chap- ter  5,  anonymity  encourages  self-revelation  and  in  turn  often  hastens  intimacy online, as related to this chapter anonymity also creates a variety  of negative outcomes such as the capacity to engage in online criticism  while concealing identity.  Academic research has spotlighted the widespread presence, as well as  pitfalls, of online criticism in a variety of arenas, for example television,53  film,54  restaurants,55  and  even  public  transportation.56  References  to  reviews exist in a wide variety of film and television examples highlighting  the capacity for disgruntled customers—male and also female—to vent  online  but also to be needlessly malicious . In the “Money” episode of  the sitcom The Office  2005–2013 , the power of the amateur review was  comically referenced by Dwight  Rainn Wilson  in his mention of the  review site TripAdvisor: “TripAdvisor is the lifeblood of the agrotourism  industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you may as well close up shop.  That’s what took down the Stalk Inn, one of the cutest little asparagus  farms you’ll ever see.” The business review site Yelp was mentioned in the  “Extras” episode of the sitcom Hot in Cleveland  2010–  when  Melanie   Valerie Bertinelli  divulged how she had recently performed a little too  overenthusiastically during sex: “I went a little overboard. I mean, I was  like someone reviewing their own business on Yelp.” In the “Happy Birth- day, Zeek” episode of the family-drama Parenthood  2010–2015 , after  getting into an argument with her caterer, Christina  Monica Potter  also  mentioned Yelp,  letting  the  caterer  know  that  she  would  be  posting  a  scathing review. In the “I’m Moving On” episode of the drama series Hart  of Dixie  2011–2015 , after being robbed by a contractor, Wade  Wilson    66   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Bethel  yelled: “I will not be writing a very favourable online review!”  Yelp is also mentioned in the “A Little Yelp from My Friends” episode of  the sitcom Selfie  2014 , when Eliza  Karen Gillan  was scouring social  media for information on her colleague, Joan  Jennifer Hasty , and dis- covered that Joan was a “super reviewer” on the site. In the “Here’s This  Guy” episode of the same series, online reviews of medical professionals  were discussed; Eliza, in fact, left a fake review for a romantic rival on  one such site. Medical review sites are also mentioned in the “Crazy for  You” episode of the crime-drama series Stalker  2014–2015 : The website  ShrinkRank.net was described as “like Yelp for therapists.” In the “Home  Invasions”  episode  of  the  legal-drama  The  Practice   1997–2004 ,  a  site  reviewing Boston lawyers was discussed. Amateur reviews on the Internet  Movie Database  IMDb  were mentioned in the “Motorcycle” episode of  the comedy series Portlandia  2011–  when Claire  Carrie Brownstein   described the negative consequences of her partner, Doug  Fred Armisen ,  having too much “screen time”, leading him to the site: “He does a lot  of user comments for movies that have not come out yet and then it’s  just  downhill  from  there.”  The  overweight  IT  guy,  Bree   Jon  Bass ,  in  the “What Kind of Day Has It Been” episode of the drama The News- room  2012–2014  is similarly shown posting scathing film reviews. In  the comedy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back  2001 , Holden  Ben Affleck   also spotlighted this trend, identifying, “The Internet has given everybody  in America a voice. For some reason, everybody decides to use that voice  to bitch about movies.” Mentioned several times in this chapter is the  Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons. While aesthetically he looks every  bit the neckbeard, his online behavior bolsters this. In the episode “The  Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show,” for example, the following exchange  transpired between him and Bart, again in reference to amateur reviews:  Comic Book Guy:   Bart:    Last night’s Itchy & Scratchy was, without a doubt, the  worst episode ever. Rest assured that I was on the Inter- net within minutes registering my disgust throughout  the world.  Hey, I know it wasn’t great, but what right do you have  to complain?  Comic Book Guy:  As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.  In The Simpsons: Hit and Run video game from 2003, the Comic Book  Guy  made  a  similar  comment:  “I  have  no  time  to  converse  with  you.  I must be the first to register my disgust on the Internet regarding the  new McBane film.” Discussed earlier was the Maron episode where Marc’s       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    67  comedy was criticized by the chubby nerd Darryl. While some of Darryl’s  Tweets were simply mean-spirited—for example, “I would say don’t quit  your day job, but you don’t have one and it’s too late to get one”—others  were much more brutal, for example; “Do us all a favor and kill yourself  because that would be hilarious.” Sites where women review ex-boyfriends  are  also  mentioned  in  the  “Lowdown”  episode  of  Betas  as  well  as  the   “C Is for Curiouser & Curiouser” episode of the sitcom A to Z  2014– 2015 . The website Raters is similarly mentioned in “The Gang Group  Dates” episode of the sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia  2005– ,  where girls rate guys they date. A website reviewing the sexual prowess  of gamers was similarly discussed in the “The Last Shot” episode of the  Canadian series jPod  2008 . Rankings of the appearance of women also  have a presence on screen: the biopic The Social Network  2010  and Syd- ney White both reference this.  Mentions of online amateur reviews highlight both a social revolution  in regard to criticism but also, as specifically relevant to this section, illus- trate the kind of character assassination that can transpire easily online;  something associated with neckbeards but also engaged in by a variety of  characters. This trend, in fact, is fueled by anonymity, something discussed  in research on online reviews. Food writer Rachel Hutton, for example,  contended that, “anonymity also means not having to take responsibil- ity for one’s words. Opinions need not be justified with knowledge . . .  Anonymous  critiques  also  tend  to  be  harsher  than  bylined  comments.  Anonymous comment forums can also foster smear campaigns.”57  On one level, such examples showcase the democratic nature of the  Internet  where  anybody  can  participate  in  public  debate.  The  flipside,  however, is that such behavior highlights the capacity for people to use the  Internet to engage in the kind of discourse that they would not participate  in in real life, face-to-face situations: that socially awkward characters like  the Comic Book Guy or Darryl in Maron have a bravado in cyberspace  that they do not possess in real life. Such courage, in fact, was referenced  in the “Bullies” episode of The Newsroom, when news anchor Will  Jeff  Daniels  dryly quipped, “Certainly more courage than it takes to post  an anonymous comment on a website.” Cyber courage is a topic refer- enced in numerous scholarly discussions about online behavior where the  ability  to  not  only  conceal  identity  but  reconstruct  it  is  identified.  The  philosopher  Aaron  Ben-Ze’ev,  for  example,  noted  in  his  book  on  love  online, “Anonymity in cyberspace can be compared to wearing a mask:  in both cases, the sense of anonymity is powerful and makes you feel dif- ferent.”58 While the field of technoself studies explores how identity has    68   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  altered as a result of technology,59 it is equally important to think of the  self as constantly being reconstructed while using technology: the sexual  self, for example, while in erotic chat rooms or while sexting, the brave  self while videogaming, or the hostile self while engaged in online com- mentary. Online a person can escape their real-life identity as a nerd or  a fat loner and feel empowered, even if only temporarily. Mean-spirited  reviews of film and television are rather innocuous examples compared to  other kinds of antisocial online activity like cyberbullying  Chapter 3 .  Amateur criticism exists at the tame end of the spectrum and, given  that  a  character  writing  a  negative  film  or  restaurant  review  online  is  unlikely to be a display that would further the plot,60 it is, therefore, more  likely that such behavior needs to be more abusive to justify inclusion in a  screen narrative. One common demonstration of this is through displays  of misogyny.  Online Misogyny  The British drama Chatroom  2010  centers on a group of teens inside  a series of chat rooms. In an early scene an exchange transpires between  Mo  Daniel Kaluuya  and Eva  Imogen Poots :  Mo:  Well I’m Mo. Eva:  Who do you hate, Mo?  Encapsulated in this brief exchange is something that the Internet has  come to be associated with: hatred. Legal scholars Abraham Foxman and  Christopher Wolf, for example, identify the extent to which the Internet  is a powerful—and expanding tool—for the spreading of hate:  With each advance in Internet technology, from the appearance of web- sites and the interactivity of AOL through the blossoming of social media  sites  like  Facebook, Twitter,  and  YouTube  and  the  recent  explosion  in  mobile computing, we have seen how anti-Semites, racists, anti-Islamists,  homophobes,  misogynists,  anti-immigrants,  and  other  kinds  of  haters  have embraced the new technology to spread their lies, to recruit, and to  mislead. Almost as bad is the bad behavior by otherwise good people who  use the comment sections of online news stories and services like Face- book and YouTube to vent their hidden hatreds or generate dark humor at  the expense of minorities. We frequently refer to the spread of hate online  as a “virus” whose infection spreads much as disease through a vulnerable  population.61      T H E   n E C K B E A R D    69  In this section hatred is discussed in the specific context of acts against  women.  Mentioned  throughout  this  chapter   as  well  as  discussed  in  Chapter  1   is  the  perceived  male-dominance  of  cyberspace.  A  number  of theorists have spotlighted that computing remains an industry where  the gender gap that was identified in the early years of the World Wide  Web,62 in fact, remains intact and perhaps is even worsening.63 The real- life  controversy  known  as  Gamergate  in  2014  highlighted  the  issue  of  fraught gender relations in the world of gaming, both in playing and pro- duction.64 Narratives set around the computer industry—the IT Crowd,  for example, along with Dweebs, Betas, Silicon Valley, Control Alt Delete,  and  the  “Only  the  Lonely”  episode  of  Ally  McBeal   1997–2002 —are  further testimony to this.  Computer-aided women-hating takes a number of forms in screen fic- tion. While the most obvious example is through predatory behavior  the  focus of Chapter 5 , something that characterizes the neckbeard is that  his hostility is largely restricted to dialogue; the neckbeard, akin to the  cyberbully discussed in Chapter 3, is an often physically passive character  positioned behind a computer screen rather than the kind—discussed in  Chapter 5—who would actually go out and rape or kidnap a woman: as  Elizabeth  Bridget Regan  remarked during the “Cyber Threat” episode  of NCIS: Los Angeles  2009– , “Computer geeks they’ll attack you online,  they won’t jump out of vans with guns.” While misogyny through online  activity is not considered as less harmful, it is certainly less frequently con- nected to real-world action.  Misogyny through Dialogue  Misogyny as connected to the Internet transpires in a range of ways  on screen. One easily identifiable example is dialogue that exhibits sexist  attitudes toward women expressed by men who work in computing. As a  variety of examples show, computing on screen is generally presented as  a male profession: not only dominated by male employees, but also rein- forcing the idea that knowledge about computers is male. In turn, such  male dominance creates an environment where misogynist comments are  made because women—who might lodge a sexual harassment grievance  or dare to “feminize” a space—are simply not there. While such presenta- tions aren’t always exclusively about mocking women—and instead can  also  function  as  an  indictment  on  the  misogynist  character—they  do  work to spotlight the gendered nature of the industry.65 In the Taiwan- ese romantic-drama Ci qing  Spider Lilies   2007 , for example, one of    70   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  the male employees at the Cyber Investigations Bureau instructs his male  colleague, “These young women can play people better than you. They  pretend. Pretend to be an innocent girl. They are all flirty and snobbish  inside. They cheat money out of men to buy famous brands . . . There’s  not a good one amongst them . . . These women need a man to teach  them a lesson.” This attitude acknowledges a changing Internet landscape  where among other trends, women are increasingly profiting from their  sexualization rather than exclusively being a victim of it  Chapter 6 . The  quote also references the backlash against feminism where moves toward  women’s  equality  are  construed  by  some  men  as  threatening,  if  not  as  sinister.66 Such backlash is actually presented as a narrative theme in the  “Generation of Vipers” episode of the British mystery series Lewis  2007–   discussed later, where a feminist professor gets murdered.  Another example of such misogyny transpired in Control Alt Delete, a  film about a male-dominated computer company charged with the task  of preventing the Y2K disaster. Of all the characters, Lewis—bearded and  overweight—looks physically most like a neckbeard however, his bearded  and thinner colleague Gustafson  Geoff Gustafson , is in fact the office  misogynist. Throughout the film, Gustafson makes numerous comments  that are not merely workplace inappropriate but are distinctly misogy- nist and showcase his attitudes toward women, which while certainly not  shared by his entire company, nevertheless work to reflect values held by  some men in computing. In one scene, for example, Gustafson recounted  his weekend to his male colleagues:  So this chick sucks cock like she’s having a fucking asthma attack. And  then if this can’t get any better, then she tells me that she won the bronze  medal in gymnastics when she was, I don’t know, twelve. She pops up into  a handstand starts bobbing up and down on my dick. Swear to God, best  night of my life.  While Gustafson’s anecdote actually makes a number of his male col- leagues  uncomfortable—and,  in  fact,  he  is  the  film’s  antagonist  so  his  behavior works to further contribute to his loathsomeness—he is a good  example of misogyny transpiring through dialogue and, notably occurring  in a male-dominated IT workplace. Another example of this dynamic was  encapsulated in the sexual harassment case at the heart of the “Only the  Lonely” episode of Ally McBeal where the software company boss  Michael  Gross  had a policy of having employees wear swimwear to work on Fri- days, something many of the women felt uncomfortable about.      T H E   n E C K B E A R D    71  While misogyny happens in male-dominated workplaces, it is also  identifiable in the world of online gaming, something that the real- life Gamergate case spotlighted. In screen fiction, a scene from Hack- ers illustrates this well: Dade  Jonny Lee Miller  was watching Kate   Angelina  Jolie   game:  “That’s  a  nice  score  for  a  girl,”  he  remarked  derisively. In the “Make Love, Not Warcraft” episode of South Park,  the characters were in the World of Warcraft game and at one point,  after his diarrhea-inducing diet was commented on by Kyle  who was  playing a female character within the game , Cartman retorted, “Hey,  I don’t need to take any lip from a frickin’ girl.” While Cartman’s com- ment  was,  technically,  directed  at  Kyle,  the  retort—encompassing  a  familiar misogynist refrain—highlights that gaming, like most things  associated with computing, is gendered as male.67 Similarly-gendered  language is used in the “Internet Troll” episode of Maron. When Marc  eventually tracks down Darryl, the troll, to the comic book store, one  of Darryl’s friends explains the appeal of trolling: “You get all worked  up . . . and start to cry like a little bitch.” Marc, in fact, called the nerd  out for his “sexism.” This mainstreamed sexism among male computer  users is also showcased in the “Oh Shenandoah” episode of The News- room. In one scene, at the mention of the journalist, Erin Andrews,  the male webmaster, Bree, remarked, “Yowza. I want to get with that  so bad.” Bree also, incidentally, invented an app that facilitates stalk- ing,  notably  of  celebrities.  The  Gamergate-themed  “Intimidation  Game” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit took these ideas  substantially  further.  Sarah   Susannah  Flood ,  a  gamer  and  gaming  company employee, was verbally and physically hassled at a gaming  convention; across the course of the episode, the misogyny escalates  to a kidnapping.  Misogynistic dialogue from male netgeeks alludes to numerous themes  central  to  this  book.  The  first  centers  on  the  absence  of  women:  Men  involved in computing are stereotyped in screen narratives as having little  ability to interact successfully with women; thus this might be the motive  for their misogynistic dialogue or a social exclusionary consequence of  it. In Chapter 1, for example, the social awkwardness of the netgeek was  described. While this may manifest in bumbling and clumsiness around  women,  it  can  also  transpire  in  offensive  dialogue;  their  awkwardness  leads to completely inappropriate content—something illustrated well in  the pilot of The IT Crowd when Maurice ruined a party by telling an inap- propriate sex worker story. In the pilot of Mr. Robot  2015– , the netgeek  Lloyd’s  Aaron Takahashi  comments about a hacker—“It’s like a crazy    72   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  serial rapist with a very big dick”—also illustrates this. Another aspect— and  something  also  discussed  in  Chapter  1—is  such  verbal  misogyny  relates to a character’s feelings of emasculation. For characters like Gus- tafson in Control Alt Delete, in a passive if not also nerdy profession, brag- ging about himself through highly sexual—if not offensive—dialogue is  one way for him to attempt to assert masculinity and distinguish himself  from his nerd colleagues.  In Ci qing  Spider Lilies  and Control Alt Delete misogyny is identifiable  in conversations between men. In other examples, it transpires through  online activity.  Misogyny through Trolling  Elsewhere I have discussed the unique nature of cyberspace as related to  the harassment of women, noting that “the internet allows for behaviours  as manifested in trolling of the calibre that does not occur offline.”68 The  sexologists Sandra Leiblum and Nicola Döring also explore this issue, spe- cifically spotlighting the highly sexual nature of such trolling:  Feminists who question the patriarchal structure of society and raise their  voices with their own Web sites are confronted with sexualized threats   “You’re just a cunt”  . . . just as female users who simply enter into a  sociable online chatroom and are immediately greeted with anonymous  messages such as “Need a fuck?” or “How large are your boobs?”69  As Leiblum and Döring highlight, and as something Gamergate—both  in real life and as apparent in its fictionalized depiction in the “Intimida- tion Game” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit—trolling when  directed toward women routinely takes on a very sexually aggressive tone;  women are routinely attacked based on their sexuality in ways that men  don’t experience. On screen numerous scenes depict gendered harassment  whereby women are subjected to comments on their appearance in con- texts completely unrelated. One manifestation of this is the kind of hotness- rating sites mentioned in The Social Network and Sydney White. A more  common example is user comments on video sites. In a scene from the  crime-drama series The Fall  2013– , for example, the teenager Katie  Ais- ling Franciosi  had uploaded a video of herself singing. One of the first com- ments posted read: “Nice rack u got there girl.” The same thing occurred  in the “She Said OK” episode of the comedy-drama Girls  2012– : Marnie   Allison Williams  was upset that her ex-boyfriend had uploaded a video  of  her  singing  and  lamented  the  situation  to  her  friends  Hannah   Lena       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    73  Dunham  and Shoshanna  Zosia Mamet , in the process spotlighting the  sexualized trolling she had experienced:  Hannah:  Marnie:  Shoshanna:   People are so mean in the comment section. Oh, my God, it’s crazy.  “Please stab this Disney princess in the face and shut her the  fuck up.” Don’t . . . I don’t want to read . . . I don’t read comments.  Marnie:  Shoshanna:  The guy likes your tits.  In the British film Cyberbully  2015 , the teenager Jennifer  Haruka  Abe  who had uploaded videos of herself singing, was similarly trolled:  She was called a “whore” and “ugly.” In the Japanese horror film Satsu- jin Douga Sit  Death Tube: Broadcast Murder Show   2010 , a number of  characters are imprisoned in different rooms—awaiting their murder— and are being observed by webcam while viewers type real-time feedback.  The  comments  directed  to  the  only  female  prisoner  included  “What’s  your type of guy?” and “Please show your tits.” In the “5 1” episode of  The Newsroom, the reporter Sloan Sabbith  Olivia Munn , read out a mes- sage emailed to her by a viewer: “Miss Sabbith, a lady always buttons her  top button. If you buttoned your collar on television, you would be a  lady. If you spilled water all over your front, I would like that, too.” In a  later episode, when the station’s blogger, Neal  Dev Patel , attempted to  orchestrate some fake trolling about Sloan, the first example he thought of  was “something along the lines of she screwed her way to the top and she’s  got a big ass.” In the “Run” episode of the same series, following a partisan  Tweet she sent, journalist Hallie  Grace Gummer  received a variety of  aggressive, sexual Tweets such as, “[you’re] a stupid fucking libtard whore  who should have been dismembered on Boylston Street after first getting  sodomized by a jihadist.”70 Discussed earlier was the Luther episode where  Jared defaced the memorial website of a murdered teenage girl with the  text “Die U Slut.” Jared had also been impersonating the dead girl by  sending awful messages to her parents: for example, “help me daddy, it’s  so hot in hell,” and sending pictures of corpses with Cathy’s name written  on them along with Photoshopped images of her face on porn images. In  Wish I Was Here, Noah typed a direct Tweet to Miley Cyrus suggesting  that she “Eat a bag of dicks!”71 At the extreme end of the spectrum, in  the “Intimidation Game” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,  female  gamers  and  programmers  were  subjected  to  misogynistic  troll- ing as well as physical violence. After Sarah was physically attacked at a    74   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  gaming convention by men opposed to her female employer’s presence in  the gaming world, trolls posted sexualized comments on gaming forums,  contending, “She was asking for it,” and “Bitch Got What She Deserved.” Philosopher Martha Nussbaum discussed online misogyny and identi- fied the Internet’s “ability to create a whole world in which an objectified  version of the person replaces the real person; its ability to disseminate  this spoiled identity widely and rapidly; and its ability to cause large-scale  disruptions in the real world.”72 Nussbaum noted that such objectifica- tion is experienced by both celebrity and noncelebrity victims and argued  that “much of the damage done by the spread of gossip and slander on  the Internet is damage to women.”73 While these issues are discussed fur- ther in the context of cyberbullying in Chapter 3, the Law & Order: Spe- cial Victims Unit, The Fall, Girls, Satsujin Douga Sit, Cyberbully, Luther,  The Newsroom, and Wish I Was Here scenes highlight the capacity for the  Internet to turn women into sex objects. Whereas netporn does this as its  raison d’etre, this is particularly relevant in the context of it happening  in parts of the Internet completely disconnected from sex. The characters  trolled in this section were women and simply because of this they got  judged and, notably, objectified.  While  the  whys  of  misogyny  are  multifaceted,74  discussed  earlier  in  reference  to  Elliot  Rodger  was  the  idea  of  men—specifically  men  of  a  socially  excluded  type  like  nerds  or  the  overweight—being  resentful  toward women. One aspect of this centers on women’s “gatekeeper” role  in regard to sexuality where they get the opportunity to accept or reject  men’s advances and, in turn, some men like Rodger are left highly resent- ful. In his manifesto, Rodger actually highlighted his problem with this:  You girls have never been attracted to me. I don’t know why you girls  aren’t attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It’s an injustice, a  crime, because . . . I don’t know what you don’t see in me. I’m the perfect  guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me,  the supreme gentleman . . . If I can’t have you, girls, I will destroy you.  [laughs] You denied me a happy life, and in turn, I will deny all of you life.  [laughs] It’s only fair.75  The  idea  of  women  objectified  and  demonized  as  sluts  online  can  be interpreted in part, as grounded in the neckbeard’s feelings of rejec- tion toward women and thus besmirching them on the grounds of their  unshared  sexuality.   The  topic  of  slut-shaming  is  discussed  further  in  Chapter 3 .      T H E   n E C K B E A R D    75  Outside of trolling, blogs provide another means by which misogyny is  enacted online. While blogs can fulfill numerous functions—in Chapter  5, for example, I discuss their confessionary and exhibitionist properties— in some examples they are also an outlet for misogyny. While research  has examined real-life misogynistic blogs,76 this idea is dramatized in The  Social Network. After Mark Zuckerberg’s  Jesse Eisenberg  date with Erica   Rooney Mara  ends badly, he returns to his room to write a venomous  blog entry:  Erica Albright’s a bitch. Do you think that’s because her family changed  their name from Albrecht, or do you think it’s because all BU girls are  bitches?  For  the  record,  she  may  look  like  a  34C,  but  she’s  getting  all  kinds of help from our friends at Victoria’s Secret. She’s a 34B, as in barely  anything there. False advertising.  Misogyny through Act  In numerous examples, misogyny transpires through deeds. The over- weight black webmaster, Douglas, in the comedy Celebrity Sex Tape was  mentioned earlier. The gist of the film is a group of nerds who are forced  to make porn featuring B-grade celebrities in order to pay back a debt  after  Douglas  uploaded  a  secretly  recorded  sex  video  of  Ed   Jonathan  Brett  and B-grade celebrity Mellony  Amanda Ward , in turn, prompt- ing Mellony’s representatives to seek compensation. On the one hand,  Douglas, in fact, could simply be read as an entrepreneur: As a webmaster,  one of his objectives is to direct traffic to his website. Douglas, however,  is also a character constructed around his use of women as recreation: He  is often shown watching netporn and even sings a self-penned song called  “Playing with my wang.” At the very least Douglas’s behavior, therefore,  highlights the character’s lack of a moral compass  in line, interestingly,  with other fat computing men like Jeff in the “Bullseye” episode of Law &  Order: Special Victims Unit, Dennis in Jurassic Park, Gorge in Gamer, and  Lewis in Control Alt Delete . Keith in Control Alt Delete raised similar con- cerns regarding misogny: His webcam site is sex-themed and, in turn, he  profits from men who want to watch women. While his behavior can also  be construed as pimp-like, conversely he can be construed as facilitating  women like Jane  Sonja Bennett —who was the star of one of his webcam  shows—to both financially profit from her participation and also have her  exhibitionist sexual quirks catered to  discussed further in Chapter 6 .  A more overtly misogynistic example of the consequences of a mali- ciously uploaded video transpired in the “Generation of Vipers” episode    76   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  of Lewis. Feminist professor Miranda Thornton  Julie Cox —who was  later murdered—seized a mobile phone from a student during a lecture. It  turned out that her student had been watching a video that Miranda had  posted to a dating website. The video had been leaked and then uploaded  to  the  college  humor  site  Barker.biz  and  was  captioned:  “Man-hating  feminist who’s punting for a poke.” While the uploading of the video was  an act of misogyny, equally, just as Katie’s video in The Fall, Marnie’s in  Girls, and Jennifer’s in Cyberbully each attracted sexualized commentary,  Miranda’s video solicited a variety of mean and notably gendered com- ments such as “She sounds like a miserable cow. I hope she dies miserable  and alone” and “She’s no loss, good riddance, bitch.”77  In  line  with  the  preceding  discussion—and  the  contentions  of  Nussbaum—the  behavior  of  characters  like  Douglas  in  Celebrity  Sex  Tape,  Keith  in  Control  Alt  Delete,  and  Kit  in  Lewis  can  be  explained  by  commerce  and  are  examples  of  men  profiting  from  the  sexualiza- tion of women—in Celebrity Sex Tape and Lewis this was notably hap- pening  against  the  will  of  the  women  involved   akin  to  revenge  porn  discussed in Chapter 3 —and, as Nussbaum highlights, such behavior  disproportionately impacts women; sex continues to disproportionately  affect them in ways that men rarely experience. A perfect example of this  is apparent in the made-for-television drama Betrayed at 17  2011 . A  secretly recorded sex tape involving teenager Lexi  Amanda Bauer  and  Greg  Andy Fischer-Price  goes viral: Lexi is the one teased and called  a slut; Greg receives no such backlash, in line with the slut stud double  standard  Chapter 3 .  Another interpretation relevant to the portrayals of Keith in Control  Alt Delete and Douglas in Celebrity Sex Tape—as well as the black porn  merchant  Moe   Harold  Perrineau   in  the  drama  On_Line   2002 —is  the  common  presentation  of  the  black  man  as  pimp.  Feminist  scholar  Mariamne Whatley discussed this pop culture archetype:  This  image  feeds  into  deeper  myths  in  the  American  psyche,  however,  since it is an extension of the view of the Black man as representing dan- gerous,  uncontrolled,  and  exciting  sexuality,  from  which  womanhood  much be protected. Because a pimp is a man who controls women’s sexual  lives, he is a powerful figure. A Black man who controls white women  sexually may become a particularly threatening figure.78  I  discussed  the  idea  of  black  characters  generally  presented  as  anti- nerds in Chapter 1. One way that a black netgeek can be made more       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    77  interesting—or at least less nerdy—is through sex: that through the sell- ing of sex he can bring a little “Africa” to something as nerdy as comput- ing  Chapter 1 .  A final—and extreme—presentation of misogyny online discussed in  this chapter exists in the context of gaming. In the sci-fi film The Lawn- mower Man  1992 , the use of virtual reality software enabled Jobe  Jeff  Fahey  to rape Marnie  Jenny Wright  within the game: in this scene a  computer, and notably the Wild West nature of cyberspace  Chapter 5 ,  was exploited to execute an extreme act of misogyny. Gamer provides a  more recent example of the same themes: Gorge, the neckbeard, is a mor- bidly obese man who sits, naked, in his wheelchair and controls real-life  avatars in a sim-game. Gorge controls male avatars who rape women as  well as women avatars who get raped, all the while masturbating. One  interpretation for George’s sexually aggressive behavior is revenge for his  isolation from real-life women: that he is acting out online the grievances  that he harbors offline.  Something underpinning the behavior of neckbeards—and characters  indulging in neckbeard-like behavior—is the idea of hatred. While in this  section the hatred was directed at women specifically, in the next section  the more general idea of the Internet serving as an outlet for more broad- brush contempt is explored.  Neckbeards and Hatred  In 1998, the psychologist Al Cooper identified the triple-A of the Inter- net: Anonymity, which has already been discussed, along with Accessibility  and Affordability.79 These factors, which underpin much online activity,  are also an undercurrent of online acts of hatred where individuals—as  well as groups—have cheap and easy access to a communication device  that allows them to discretely distribute hate-filled works.  While physical attributes like beards, obesity, and general unkemptness  are common components of a neckbeard, more personal qualities such as  hate are also key. The griefer Jenkins in South Park is a good example of  a character with general, unfocused—and notably unexplained—hatred.  In the aforementioned episode of Luther, the neckbeard Jared terrorized  a family whose young daughter had been murdered. Like Jenkins, Jared  was nothing more than a caricature of an angry fat man. In the “Ham- merhead Sharks” episode of The Practice, Anthony  Silas Weir Mitchell   is a character who randomly sends death threats to women online: again  behavior seemingly fueled simply by unfocused hate.   78   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Proposed  earlier  was  obesity:  that  a  character’s  weight  has  led  them  to a variety of negative experiences in life—including social exclusion— and thus, anger and hatred at the world is vented online: a place where  the characters are uniquely emboldened. This might equally explain the  actions  of  characters  like  Jenkins  and  Jared  but  also  Darryl  in  Maron.  While Darryl was chubby—and thus potentially experienced the same  negative experiences as Jenkins—more obviously, Darryl was a nerd: He  had the squeaky nerd voice  Chapter 1 , was known to only have few  friends,80 and thus, in line with the predictable social exclusion experi- enced by nerds in real life as well as on screen, turned to the Internet for  revenge. Discussed earlier was the opportunity for people online to expe- rience an identity that differs from their subordinated status in real life.  On screen this is illustrated well in the aforementioned “Make Love, Not  Warcraft” episode of South Park: Stan’s dad, for example, drew specific  attention to this when he noted that in real life he might just be a geolo- gist but in World of Warcraft he could be a hero. By going online and caus- ing trouble, characters like Jenkins and Darryl get to feel a kind of power  that is unavailable to them in the real world; a topic discussed further in  the context of cyberbully  Chapter 3 .  Another aspect to the hateful activities of fat and nerdish characters  online is simply that they have the time to engage in such behavior because  of their lack of other activities. In the South Park episode, for example,  Cartman asked Jenkins: “Don’t you have better things to do than going  online  killing  people?”  Later  in  the  episode,  the  staff  at  Blizzard—the  manufacturer  of  the  World  of Warcraft  game—convened  a  meeting  to  discuss the Jenkins problem. One of the staffers asked, “What kind of  person  would  do  this?”  to  which  another  responded,  “Only  one  kind.  Whoever this person is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour  of everyday for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we’re dealing with  someone who has absolutely no life.” Something Cartman alluded to and  the Blizzard staff confirmed is an idea that underpins the online behavior  of characters like the Comic Book Guy in The Simpsons as well as Jared in  Luther: that they have little else in their life so have the time to engage in  online hate-play, as well as discussed, the rage to do so.  Another element—but one not necessarily completely separate from  social  exclusion  and  feelings  of  resentment—is  the  schadenfreude  and  sadism factors where hate-play serves as a kind of recreation: that neck- beard characters gain a specific kind of pleasure from causing trouble and  chaos in the lives of other people. In the Lewis episode discussed earlier,  for example, when the detectives approached the CEO of the Barker.biz       T H E   n E C K B E A R D    79  website, Kit  Daniel Lapaine , to ask him about the morality of upload- ing the leaked dating video, Kit’s comments included his ethos to “let  the light shine in” and that, “I don’t really care about original, but I do  care about funny.” Kit was distancing himself from the contents—and  consequences—of the video because his mission was simply to get traffic  to his website, no matter how mean-spirited the material and no matter  the social cost; that, in fact, he was able to experience pleasure—and in  his case profit—from the public’s negative reaction. This happens in other  examples, too. The “Internet Troll” episode of Maron has been discussed  throughout this chapter. When Marc finally confronted Darryl about his  online harassment, Darryl was in the presence of two of his unnamed  nerd friends; one a blond man  Michael J. Sielaff  and the other black   JaMarlin Fowler :  Marc:    I don’t understand why you have to attack me in a public  forum.  Blond Nerd:  Um, because it’s fun. Black Nerd:   You get all worked up . . . and start to cry like a little bitch.  The nerds in this scene spotlight a pleasure that is apparently reaped  from negative online activity such as griefing and trolling: as Alex Pham  noted in his Chicago Tribune article: “For a griefer, it’s not the killing that  is fun, because combat is inherent in many of these games. It’s the misery  it causes other players,”81 something discussed further in Chapter 3 in the  context of cyberbullying as recreation.  This  chapter  examined  neckbeard  characters,  as  well  as,  more  com- monly, neckbeard characteristics, to analyze what such portrayals reveal  about  gender,  appearance,  weight,  and  personality.  Such  presentations  highlight  that  on  screen  the  male-domination  of  the  Internet  is  still  a  theme, but that the presentation of computer users—via negative physical  portrayals as well as their depiction as socially isolated—work to further  the idea that such characters are a different breed to others  Chapter 1   and that physical and personality unattractiveness are key components.  Chapter 3 expands on some of the themes discussed in the context of  screen portrayals of the cyberbully.    3  I only typed words on a  computer: The Cyberbully  The British drama Chatroom  2010  depicted online interactions by using  actors to physically perform what would otherwise be typed exchanges.  In one scene, a young boy is towered over by older boys screaming at him.  This  scene  provides  an  interesting  way  to  think  about  online  behavior  as sharing many of the properties of a schoolyard attack: that the same  fears, intimidation, and pain exist regardless of “where” the attack tran- spires. While the cyberbully can’t quite accomplish the physical brutality  of a punch, a wedgie, or a slushie-dump, the Internet can nonetheless be  used to achieve many of the same results such as belittlement, terror, and  harassment. These ends can be achieved in a variety of ways including, as  psychologists Ersilia Menesini and Christiane Spiel summarize, “offensive  e-mails or text messages; insults through chat rooms or instant messag- ing; photos or video on mobile or web; exclusion from social networks or  appropriation of other’s credentials and identity information.”1  The notion of the Internet as a fearful place is a theme apparent in  numerous screen examples discussed in this book whereby narratives— particularly  those  produced  in  the  earliest  years  of  the  World  Wide  Web—exploit fears and anxieties about new technology. The idea that  the Internet can make a person, particularly a young person, vulnerable  has much traction in screen fiction: in the context of bullying, narratives  frequently demonstrate that whereas bullying was once restricted to the  parameters of school—the school grounds and the limits of the school  day—the Internet enables such behavior to happen at any time and for    82   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  it to occur repeatedly with an infinite audience. This idea was verbalized  by an unnamed female teen in the American drama Cyberbully  2011   during a group therapy session for cyberbullying victims:  In elementary school it was like “hey there goes Jelly Donut,” you know,  stuff like that. And it sucked, right? But at least I could go home and get  some peace. Now it’s like I can’t even post pictures on my own profile ‘cos  people want to be telling me how fat or disgusting I am. This stuff follows  me home.  As  this  scene  exemplifies,  anybody  with  Internet  access—be  it  via  their laptop or smartphone—can be bullied; equally, anyone with access  to such technology can do the bullying. Film and television regularly  depict  the  Internet  as  the  threat—particularly  so  in  early  examples  when the technology wasn’t particularly well understood—rather than  it simply being the medium by which the bullying is carried out. While  in a small number of films, particularly those in the horror genre, the  Internet  is  actually  presented  as  having  a  life  and  malevolence  of  its  own—the Japanese film Kairo  Pulse   2001 , along with the American  remakes Pulse  2006 , Pulse 2: Afterlife  2008 , Pulse 3  2008 , as well  as  the  American  horror  film  Stay  Alive   2006   each  centered  on  the  Internet itself acting inexplicably nefariously2—in the vast majority of  examples, the Internet is only so fearful because users exploit its unique  properties such as anonymity, physical distance, and the perception that  social media use is somehow compulsory for young people. In the sec- tions that follow, these properties are examined as themes at the heart of  cyberbullying narratives.  Revictimization  is  the  starting  point  for  this  discussion  and  a  key  factor in distinguishing cyberbullying from the schoolyard terror of the  pre-Web era. The public nature of many online attacks means that vic- tims experience abuse in an ongoing fashion in turn, exacerbating and  prolonging the trauma. Other themes explored include the flexibility of  roles: whereas in schoolyard bullying the victim is frequently the weaker  kid preyed upon by someone older and stronger, online and the weaker  kid can effortlessly become the bully themselves in a world where physi- cal brawn is less important than computer prowess. Age and gender are  also examined in this chapter, along with emerging social concerns such  as slut-shaming and revenge porn that are well illustrated in cyberbul- lying attacks against girls and women. These themes are each explored  to expose the challenges that the Internet poses in the context of peer       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    83  interaction, as well as its role in amplifying established concerns about  new technology.  Revictimization  While in physical bullying the idea of recurrence and repetition are key in  many definitions,3 in the context of cyberbullying, a single electronic attack  can in fact have recurrent and repetitious effects. This point is illustrated  well  in  narratives  where  an  uploaded  video  goes  viral  and  has  recurrent  and repetitious impact; a concept aptly illustrated in the American Cyber- bully. During the height of her bullying, the teen protagonist, Taylor  Emily  Osment , attempted suicide. In the aftermath, Dr. Rilke  Marcel Jeannin   counseled Taylor’s  mother,  Kris   Kelly  Rowan ,  and  tried  to  explain  the  teen’s response:  Being bullied online, that can push a kid over the edge. It’s like a group  assault,  very  traumatic.  Anyone  with  a  computer  can  see  it,  it’s  always  there, 24 7. Makes the victim feel even more trapped, unable to escape  from it.  On  screen  the  public  nature  of  much  cyberbullying—be  it  man- ifesting  in  slurs  posted  on  social  media  or  in  a  humiliating  uploaded  video—exacerbates an occurrence by increasing the audience, the embar- rassment,  and  also  the  sense  of  permanence  with  the  material  being  online in perpetuity. Dr. Rilke’s mention of a group assault is something  that makes cyberbullying a markedly different experience to a physical  attack. When Taylor,  for  example,  asks  her  mother  “How  am  I  going  to face going to school on Monday?” she alludes to her suspicion that  her bullying would continue over the weekend, away from school, and  in turn more people would be exposed to her torment. Taylor’s fear of  returning to school is one similarly expressed by cyberbullied teens in the  drama Disconnect  2012  and the thriller Trust  2010  and, as explored  later in this chapter, also underpinned the suicide attempts in both films.  While cyberbullying can take the form of online harassment via social  media—as  experienced  by  Taylor  in  Cyberbully—another  form  is  via  video. While this can be achieved through the uploading of private and  secretly recorded videos—for example, sex tapes as discussed later in this  chapter—a common method portrayed on screen is where physical acts  of bullying are recorded and then uploaded to a video sharing site thus  creating the capacity for revictimization; a dynamic that was discussed in    84   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  a 2012 Supreme Court of Canada case—A.B. v. Bragg Communications  Inc.—where Justice Abella found that:  if we value the right of children to protect themselves from bullying, cyber  or otherwise, if common sense and the evidence persuade us that young  victims of sexualized bullying are particularly vulnerable to the harms of  revictimization upon publication, and if we accept that the right to pro- tection will disappear for most children without the further protection  of anonymity, we are compellingly drawn in this case to allowing A.B.’s  anonymous legal pursuit of the identity of her cyberbully.4  In the “Knuckle Up” episode of Cold Case  2003–2010 , a video of a  murder victim, being beaten was discovered online. While it was initially  suspected that the beating was an example of the intersection between  physical and cyberbullying, in fact, the victim had been a member of a  fight club. In other examples, however, a duel kind of bullying occurs  whereby a physical assault is recorded and uploaded thus instigating a  second, online attack. The drama Girl Fight  2011  centered on an assault  experienced  by  teen  Haley   Jodelle  Derland   that  was  committed  by  her so-called friends and then uploaded. In the British horror-comedy  Tormented  2009 , Darren  Calvin Dean  was a victim of extensive physi- cal bullying; he became cyberbullied when footage of one of his attacks  was uploaded. In the “Bully for You” episode of the family-drama Lincoln  Heights   2006–2009 ,  the  teens  Malik   Zachary  Williams   and Taylor   Mishon Ratliff  were beaten up by bullies in separate attacks and vid- eos of their assaults were posted online. This same plot was at the heart  of the “Perfect Storm” episode of the Canadian police-drama Flashpoint   2008–2012 : teen Billy  Calum Worthy  was beaten and he was ordered  to “admit” that he’s gay while being videorecorded. The footage was then  distributed  via  e-mail.  In  the  horror  film  Carrie   2013 ,  after  the  title  character  Chloë Grace Moretz  gets her first period in front of classmates  in a locker room, not only is her terror laughed at and mocked by her  classmates, but the episode is filmed on a cell phone.  While  in  Tormented,  Flashpoint,  and  Carrie  victims  respond  to  their  abuse  by  seeking  violent  revenge,  in  some  examples,  the  assault—and  notably the revictimization occurring in the aftermath—leads characters  to attempt suicide. The link between cyberbullying and suicide is, in fact,  made in a range of examples. Mentioned earlier was the American Cyber- bully: The public nature of Taylor’s cyberbullying led to a suicide attempt.  Toward the end of the British Cyberbully  2015 , the teen cyberbullying  victim,  Casey   Maisie Williams ,  appeared  to  be  toying  with  the  same  idea.  In  the  drama  Disconnect,  after  a  sexually  compromising  photo  of       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    85  teen, Ben  Jonah Bobo , gets broadcast by social media, his school life  quickly becomes intolerable and he makes a suicide attempt. In the televi- sion drama Odd Girl Out  2005 , after a vicious campaign of online bul- lying, the teenager Vanessa  Alexa Vega  overdoses on pills. In Trust, in the  aftermath of Annie’s  Liana Liberato  rape, a website was established to  mock and malign her. Annie perceived herself as under group attack and  attempted suicide. In an unnamed episode from the first season of the dra- maThe Affair  2014– , in a subplot some teen girls had cyberbullied a peer,  Jody, leading her to attempt suicide. While in the American Cyberbully  and the British Cyberbully, as well as in Disconnect, Odd Girl Out, Trust,  and The Affair, the suicide attempts were unsuccessful, in other examples  young bullied teens do actually kill themselves. While Casey’s attempt in  the British Cyberbully was unsuccessful, one of her former classmates, Jen- nifer  Haruka Abe , did kill herself after being systematically abused online.  In Tormented, Darren’s bullying in real life—and then his revictimization  online—led  to  his  suicide.  In  the  Polish  film  Sala  samobójców   Suicide  Room   2011 , in the aftermath of Dominik’s  Jakub Gierszal  cyberbully- ing about his homosexuality, he visited the Suicide Room website—a vir- tual reality site—and by the end of the film commit suicide there  and also  in real life . The television drama Sexting in Suburbia  2012  opened with  teen Dina’s  Jenn Proske  suicide: Her naked selfie had been circulated  leading to widespread—and inescapable—slut-shaming. In the “Queen of  Snark” episode of the legal-drama Harry’s Law  2011–2012 , the teenager  Sela  Sarah Steele  operated a blog that had disclosed the sexuality of her  teen classmate Hannah  Mary Jon Nelson . In the blog, Sela suggested  that Hannah needed help coming out and encouraged classmates to give  Hannah a “knowing nod.” Sela was charged with homicide and during  her trial Hannah’s best friend, Jenny  Noemi Del Rio , claimed that those  nods were “what sent Hannah over the edge.”5 Something similar trans- pired in “The Truth about Lying” episode of the police-drama Blue Bloods   2010– : A teen lesbian, Amy  Christina Choe , committed suicide by  stepping  in  front  of  a  train.  She  had  been  subjected  to  extensive  slut- shaming online.6 The thriller Unfriended  2014  centered on the suicide of  Laura Barns  Heather Sossaman  who—after an embarrassing video of her  went viral—commit suicide. While each of these examples centered on  teen suicides, in the “Sweet Revenge” episode of the crime-drama Major  Crimes  2012– , an adult woman committed suicide after sexually explicit  photos of her were uploaded to a revenge porn website leading to the loss  of her job.  The distribution of reputation-compromising materials creates a situa- tion of repeated and inescapable abuse: each new person that sees a video    86   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  contributes to a victim’s feelings of attack and their perception that con- tinuing  with  their  normal  life  is  impossible.  Similarly,  once  a  video  is  distributed a situation is created where it is largely impossible to remove  it. The idea of the indelible electronic footprint was actually mentioned,  albeit comically, in the “Physical Graffiti” episode of the sitcom  NewsRadio   1995–1999 , when Joe  Joe Rogan  remarked, “You can’t take something  off the Internet. It’s like taking pee out of a swimming pool.” Worth not- ing, attempts to do the impossible, however, were at the heart of the “She  Said OK” episode of the comedy-drama Girls  2012–  as well as “The  Genoa  Tip”  episode  of  the  drama  The  Newsroom   2012–2014   where  women desperately tried to remove embarrassing videos from the Web.  The same idea was alluded to in the aforementioned Major Crimes episode  when the lucrative industry surrounding the erasing of reputation-ruin- ing images was discussed  although the impossibility of success is noted . Mentioned in the introduction of this book was the idea of the Inter- net  being  considered  as  responsible  for  real—as  well  as  on-screen— cyberbullying. In the next section this is examined in further detail.  The Internet as Instigator  The  American  film  Cyberbully  opened  with Taylor  exchanging  snide  comments with her best friend Samantha  Kay Panabaker  via social media,  in turn such behavior is subtly presented as normal for female teens. The  British film Cyberbully presented the same idea: Casey exchanged mean  comments with friends online as part of ordinary social discourse. In both  films the normalization of the Internet in communication was presented  as a way to showcase an almost seamless transition from characters using  the technology to be casually mean to them becoming bullied by it. Both  Taylor and Casey in fact become victims of cyberbullying, predicated on  them having been so mean themselves via the same tool. The same idea  was at the heart of the drama Girl Fight: one of the motivations for Haley’s  attack was because she had written mean comments on social media about  one of her friends; as one of her attackers, Alexa  Tess Atkins  contended,  “She deserved it. She was talking trash about me online. She hurt me!”  Partly these scenes illustrate the common “she started it”–type expla- nations  for  quarrels  whereby  participants  will  regularly  deflect  their  complicity. Such behavior can also be construed, in part, as connected to  the girls will be girls idea explored later in this chapter. Another interpre- tation, however, is that the bitching and gossip that once was contained  within private conversations, is now frequently conducted in public and,       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    87  therefore, creates a situation whereby such behavior can quickly gain an  audience and take on more wide-reaching connotations.  The Internet is also portrayed on screen as instigating bullying by being the  medium by which terror is carried out: that the Internet creates the vulnerabil- ity. In the American Cyberbully, for example, Taylor is given a computer for  her birthday. In Trust, 14-year-old Annie is given a laptop for her birthday by  her father, Will  Clive Owen . In the “Web” episode of Law & Order: Special  Victims Unit  1999– , the computer technician, Ruben  Joel de la Fuente ,  had given a computer to his nephew. In each of these examples adults—via  the gift of the Internet—put young people in peril: In Cyberbully, Taylor gets  cyberbullied, in Trust Annie meets an online pedophile and is then raped and  cyberbullied, and, in “Web,” Ruben’s nephew met an online pedophile and  was then sexually assaulted. In Cyberbully and Trust notably, the seemingly  innocent gift of a computer was presented as the tool by which well-adjusted  and relatively popular girls become victims; that their lives prior to the Internet  were comparatively perfect.7 Such examples also showcase how the Internet  has thoroughly altered perceptions of safety. This idea is alluded to in sev- eral scenes in Trust, for example, where Annie’s father, Will, and mom, Lynn   Catherine Keener , lock up the house, checking the doors and windows and  setting the alarm: such scenes highlight that while Will and Lynn try to pre- vent threats in the old-school, physical way, in reality, these are now arriving  via the computer, and more specifically via the very computer they had given  their daughter. This idea got verbalized in the “Chat Room” episode of Law &   Order: Special Victims Unit, in a comment made by detective Elliot Stabler  to his daughter: “You know how I lock up all the doors and windows? Now  they’re coming in through there,” he said, and pointed to the computer.  Another aspect to the idea of the Internet as instigator is the appeal  of  bullying  videos  going  viral.  Both  on  screen  and  off,  the  Internet  is  often  perceived  as  a  place  where  fame  can  be  achieved;8  psychologists  Jean Twenge and Keith Campbell identify that this pursuit can see fame  sought at any cost:  High school teens have been fighting even before there were high schools.  What’s new, and potentially related to narcissism, is  the  trend towards  seeking fame by hurting—or even killing—someone else. Internet sites  and  24-hour  cable  news  have  made  it  increasingly  possible  to  become  famous, and many people don’t care if what they get instead is infamy.9  Characters attempting to achieve Internet fame are displayed in numer- ous screen examples: in the dramas The Fall  2013– , Girls, and the British    88   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Cyberbully, for example, videos of girls singing are uploaded in the hope  they  get  discovered  like  other YouTube  stars  such  as  Justin  Bieber  and  Cody  Simpson.  In  other  examples  fame  quests  motivate  characters  to  record bullying attacks in the hope that their material goes viral; that fame  is desired regardless of the way it is achieved and no matter the cost. A rel- atively humorous example of this occurs in the “Crappy Birthday to You”  episode of the Canadian series jPod  2008  when Ethan  David Kopp  was  humiliated after Kam Fong  Raugi Yu , a colleague of his father, uploaded  a karaoke video of him and paid his staff to rig the click results to make it  go viral. In The Virginity Hit  2010 , the psychology grad student Becca   Savvanah  Welch   posted  a  video  she  had  secretly  recorded  of  teenage  Matt’s  Matt Bennett  attempts to win her over, including him perform- ing oral sex on a rubber doll and waiting over 400 minutes for her to  return to the apartment in an effort to make famous her research. A more  serious example of fame motivating bad online behavior transpired in Girl  Fight. At one point during the assault on Haley, one of the perpetrators,  Taylor  Taylor Hui , remarked, “Hey guys, I can record it on my phone  and then we can post it online . . . Do you know how many hits that  would get us? Girlfights get tonnes of hits. Tonnes.” Even after the girls  were arrested they were shown giggling and laughing and smiling at the  cameras, enjoying their notoriety. In one scene the girls were in jail watch- ing the television news coverage of their story: “Guys, this is national tele- vision.  Like,  we’re  famous,” Taylor  says,  excitedly.  Another  of  the  girls  responds, “Oh my God, this is so cool.” Similar themes are apparent in  the “Cyber-Lebrity” episode of CSI: Miami  2002–2012 : jealous of her  swim team colleague’s newfound Internet fame, Miranda  Brianne Davis   murdered her. When Miranda was arrested she was shown enjoying her  own newfound fame as a beautiful assailant. The same themes were appar- ent in the “Babes” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit where  videos of homeless people being beaten were uploaded. This narrative also  played out in the “Open Secrets” episode of Blue Bloods whereby a group  of kids uploaded footage of themselves knocking people to the ground. In  the “Samaritan” episode of the same series, videos taken by train robbers  were uploaded to a website NYCThugz.net.  In a scene from Girl Fight, Haley’s mom, Melissa  Anne Heche , dis- cussed the attack video with the District Attorney, Jane Dennett  Lanette  Ware , in the lead up to the court case:  Melissa:    They wanted to put it onto the Internet. Show off what they’d done  like, like a trophy, I guess.      T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    89  Jane:   I wish I could say that’s a new one on me, but it’s not. The chance to be  seen on the Internet is like fuel to fire for kids looking to do something  wrong. It can make them cross that line.  Here, Jane alludes to an idea that is extensively discussed in academic  work on the Internet—and examined throughout this book—and is also  a narrative theme in film and television: that the Internet has special prop- erties that can coerce bad behavior.  In  a  celebrity-obsessed  culture  it  is  no  surprise  that  teenagers  uti- lize the Internet to achieve fame. Taylor’s comments and the joy more  broadly that the girls seem to experience during their arrests and incar- ceration highlight that cyberfame is highly prized, regardless of the cost.  In communication scholar Patrice Oppliger’s work on bullies on screen,  she discusses the impact that video-sharing sites like YouTube have had  on bullying.10 While, as Oppliger notes, young people have been cyber- bullied in real life based on the videos they have posted themselves—and  certainly this was what happened to Jennifer in the British Cyberbully— the  popularity  of  attack  videos  in  real  life  was  also  identified,  in  turn  spotlighting the capacity for screen examples to be viewed as mirroring a  burgeoning offline social problem.  In one of the final scenes of the Internet-themed thriller Perfect Stranger   2007 , the journalist Rowena  Halle Berry  wrote in an article, “[The  Internet]  is  a  world,  you  think,  where  actions  have  no  consequences,  where  guilt  is  cloaked  by  anonymity,  where  there  are  no  fingerprints.”  Here,  Rowena  highlights  an  important  feature  of  the  Internet  in  the  context of bad behavior such as cyberbullying: that anonymity fuels it.  The ability to disguise identity online proffers both positive and negative  attributes. For the purposes of this discussion, however, the ability to go  online and bully is an example of the bad and is a key theme in the idea  of the Internet as instigating attacks. On the most basic level, the ability  to conceal identity means that stopping spates of cyberbullying is made  substantially more difficult given that identifying the perpetrator is often  impossible. This idea is illustrated well in the deluge of narratives where  tracking down a cyberpredator is presented as onerous  Chapter 5 . In the  cyberbullying-themed Trust and Disconnect, for example, fathers attempt  to track down the men who have terrorized their children online and in  both examples harass the wrong men. In the British Cyberbully, Casey in  fact never discovers who her cyberbully is.  In the sections that follow, the role of anonymity in cyberbullying is   explored.   90   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Anonymity and Bad Behavior  In Chapter 2, I introduced social scientist Ian Greener’s work on ano- nymity as related to academic inquiry; he identified that “people taking  part in research can behave in remarkably dishonest ways when the assur- ance of anonymity is in place.”11 The dishonesty Greener referred to high- lights that being anonymous online provides people the opportunity to  act in ways that they wouldn’t if exposing their identity—or, as Rowena  in Perfect Stranger put it, having their fingerprints on it—was the cost;  such acts are incongruous with their public self. The Internet, therefore,  exists  as  a  kind  of  unreal  space  whereby  an  individual  doesn’t  feel  the  same level of connection to, ownership of, accountability for, or embar- rassment over their interactions; existence online is conceptualized as at  least somewhat different from reality. While this idea has been extensively  discussed by psychologist Sherry Turkle in realms such as gaming,12 this  idea is also examined in literature on cyberbullying. Psychologists Robin  Kowalski, Sue Limber, and Patricia Agatston, for example, identified that,  “Without the threat of punishment or disapproval, people may carry their  actions much further than they normally would.”13 Psychologists Noam  Lapidot-Lefler and Azy Barak similarly contended that “the psychological  restraints that often serve to block or conceal emotions and undisclosed  needs are found to be lowered in cyberspace in various online interper- sonal behaviors.”14 Inherent in these analyses is that cyberspace creates a  situation where people act in ways that are inconsistent—if not actively  at odds—with their real-life self. In the American Cyberbully, for example,  when cyberbullying victim and perpetrator Samantha was asked about  the bullying that she had engaged in, she admitted, “It’s hard to picture  myself like that.” For Samantha it was difficult to reconcile the impres- sion she held of herself with the person she had become online. This same  dynamic transpired in the British Cyberbully: For most of the film Casey  was unable to rationalize that her own online activity—mean comments  on uploaded videos, etc.—also made her a cyberbully; her self-perception  was markedly different.  While anonymity is one aspect of this, another is the Internet con- ceived of as a place separate and distinct from real life. A theme discussed  throughout  this  book  and  apparent  in  academic  discussions  about  the  Internet is the idea of cyberspace as a world of its own: that online life  is often conceived of as different from other parts of life—time moves  differently,  people  act  differently,  and  different  rules  apply—and  thus,  anonymity or alternate identities can be considered as something not only       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    91  separate from reality and from the real self, but also akin to a kind of  game. While this idea has relevance to actual computer-gaming in a pre- Web world—whereby an individual enters another world, dons a differ- ent identity, and different rules apply—given that going online involves  the same hardware that has long been used for gaming, it is conceivable  that for some people the entire online experience is construed as life in  another dimension. Different rules, needless to say, can be part of the  explanation for the Internet serving as an instigator in online bullying.  One theory that helps to illuminate these concepts is dissociative imagi- nation, something that happens when, as cultural theorist Kishonna Gray  explains, “users make the mistake of assuming virtual worlds are make- believe spaces . . . suggesting that their virtual life is a game where the  rules don’t apply to real life.”15 In the drama Men, Women & Children   2014 , Internet safety crusader, Patricia  Jennifer Garner , applied these  ideas to compulsive gaming in a conversation with a fellow parent, Kent   Dean Norris : “Your son has created an avatar of himself . . . When he’s  plugged in, your son thinks that that world, the world of Guild Wars is  the real world. Our world doesn’t matter anymore. His friends don’t mat- ter. School doesn’t matter. You don’t matter.” In the first season of the  political-drama House of Cards  2013– , Francis  Kevin Spacey  is shown  playing an online first-person shooter game in a conscious effort to escape  his real world. In the “Bullseye” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims  Unit, Jeff  Daniel Stewart Sherman  and Amber Sarmonsky  Melissa Rain  Anderson   appeared  to  have  dissociated  from  the  real  world  and  their  real-world  responsibilities  through  their  compulsive  gaming.  Psycholo- gists Dorothy Espelage, Mrinalini Rao, and Rhonda Craven specifically  discussed dissociative imagination in the context of cyberbullying, not- ing that the theory explains “the belief that the personas one creates in  cyber-environments  remain  in  an  online  world,  limiting  responsibility  for  real-world  consequences.”16  This  notion  of  separating  online  activ- ity from real-life consequences plays out in numerous examples. In the  “Babes” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, for example, cyber- bullying initially seemed to have led to a pregnant teen’s apparent suicide.  The adult cyberbully, Peggy  Debi Mazar , was unwilling to accept her  responsibility: “I didn’t tie a rope around the bitch’s neck. I only typed  words on a computer.” Peggy perceived a clear separation between behav- ior  conducted  online  and  in  real  life.  Such  themes  were  also  apparent  in Perfect Stranger when Rowena commented, “It’s a world, you think,  where actions have no consequences.” Dissociative imagination allows a  cyberbully  to  rationalize  that  their  behavior  is  just  “play.”  This  idea  is    92   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  illustrated in scenes where cyberbullies verbally excuse their behavior with  language associated with gaming rather than aggression. In the American  Cyberbully, for example, Samantha attempted to explain her cyberbully- ing, “You can’t see the other people, and you can do or say anything and it  doesn’t seem to matter. It doesn’t feel real.” In a scene from Chatroom, one  of the teenage characters, William  Aaron Taylor-Johnson , spoke of just  “messing”  with  Emily   Hannah  Murray ;  something  that,  as  discussed  later in this chapter, involved coercing her to engage in uncharacteristic  antisocial behavior. Such ideas were also evident in Disconnect: After his  acts of cyberbullying led to his target’s suicide attempt, Frye  Aviad Ber- nstein , tried to explain, “It was supposed to be a joke . . . We were just  trying to mess with him . . . We didn’t think he’d hurt himself.” The teen  cyberbully Whitney  Julia Goldani Telles  made a similar claim in The  Affair: “It was just a joke.”  On one hand, these comments can be likened to any physical bul- lying where such behavior is downplayed or rationalized as less serious  and more so a rite of passage and reflective of bullies construing their  actions  as  “just  a  joke”  and  that  accusations  made  by  their  victims  are simply about their inability to “take a joke.”17 While determining  the degree to which a bully actually believes this or is just saying it is  impossible to ascertain, certainly such an excuse has greater plausibility  in cyberspace where the real world fantasy world often blurs. Commu- nications theorists Michel Walrave and Wannes Heirman discussed this  idea in their work on cyberbullying noting, “Cyber-perpetrators who  argue  this way may be genuinely convinced that they  are  not doing  anything wrong, since they consider cyber-bullying to be an imaginary  act of bullying.”18  Another  theory  explaining  cyberbullying,  and  in  turn  depictions  thereof—particularly in the context of anonymity and technology coerc- ing bad behavior—is the online disinhibition effect, a concept that explains  how an individual’s sense of self online can be perceived as completely  separate  from  their  real  life  identity;  something  Barak  and  Liat  Hen  explained:  The online disinhibition effect is assumed to be a product of several psy- chological factors that operate in cyberspace and have a great impact on  people’s behavior. The main factors are considered to be anonymity, invis- ibility, lack of eye contact, neutralization of people’s status, asynchronicity  as a major mode of communication, and textuality of communication.  As a result of these factors . . . an individual goes through a disinhibition       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    93  process, whereby behaviors  including verbal expressions  not normally  displayed in the physical environment, or not as intensively or prevalently,  are expressed and become more frequent on the internet.19  Samantha in the American Cyberbully, who was both a victim of cyber- bullying as well as a perpetrator, explained this well: “You know, I’d always  thought of bullies as people at school who pick on you. But when you do  it online, you don’t even realise you’re doing it.” While anonymity and dis- inhibition enable acts of bullying to transpire, the concept of dissociative  anonymity—or more, commonly, the “you don’t know me” idea—helps  to explain how the Internet specifically facilitates conduct that would be  unlikely to transpire offline; something psychologist John Suler outlined:  When people have the opportunity to separate their actions online from  their in-person lifestyle and identity, they feel less vulnerable about self- disclosing and acting-out. Whatever they say or do can’t be directly linked  to the rest of their lives. In a process of dissociation, they don’t have to own  their behavior by acknowledging it within the full context of an integrated  online offline identity. The online self becomes a compartmentalized self.  In the case of expressed hostilities or other deviant actions, the person can  avert responsibility for those behaviors, almost as if superego restrictions  and moral cognitive processes have been temporarily suspended from the  online psyche. In fact, people might even convince themselves that those  online behaviors “aren’t me at all.”20  As Samantha in Cyberbully explained: “You can’t see the other people,  and you can do or say anything and it doesn’t seem to matter. It doesn’t  feel real.” Chatroom provided a slightly different take on this idea: Wil- liam’s “messing” with Emily motivated her to spread feces over a car and  in another scene splash paint over a door. It was apparent that such behav- ior was completely uncharacteristic; through Emily’s chat room interac- tions with William, however, she was encouraged into unusual bullying  behavior; she was less guarded online in turn allowing William a level  of influence that he likely wouldn’t have had offline. Most relevant for  this  section,  Emily  rationalized  being  a  cyberbully  because   a   cyber- space is perceived as less real and as having less offline consequences and   b  identity is unlikely to be exposed thus eliminating the deterrent of  punishment.  While anonymity motivates people to do things they wouldn’t do in a  face-to-face situation,21 it also—and perhaps even more  worryingly—can  increase the severity of the behavior engaged in: Not only are people willing    94   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  to do and say things online that they wouldn’t do in real life, but the  dynamics of the Internet can amplify the levels of aggression and vitriol.22  Noted earlier was the role of fame in this amplification. In the “Queen of  Snark” episode of Harry’s Law, the attorney, Harry  Kathy Bates , men- tions cyberbullying in her closing statement in defense of Sela:  [Assistant District Attorney] Ms. Mendelsohn [Camryn Manheim] asked  the  question,  how  does  a  decent  kid  like  Sela  become  a  vicious  snark  queen? It didn’t happen in a vacuum, you can be sure of that. Consider the  world she’s been raised in. Cruelty sells, and it sells big. The most success- ful blogs flaunt their snark badges. The Huffington Post, The Daily Beast,  Perez Hilton—have you read these things? And newspapers, too. Page Six  of the New York whatever. And how about television? Cable news shows  trade  on  mean.  Some  of  these  media  darlings—Ann  Coulter  called  Al  Gore a fag. Glenn Beck, Keith Olbermann, Bill Maher, Rush Limbaugh  they don’t get sanctioned for being cruel, they get book deals. This is our  media, folks. Sela didn’t invent mean.  Here,  Harry  highlights  that  the  Internet  has  helped  to  normalize  a  culture of going online and being mean. Given the meanness apparent— and  normalized—in  online  journalism  it  is,  perhaps,  no  surprise  that  cyberbullying often doesn’t seem like a crime, and in fact is often even  perceived as a legitimate way to get famous.  Anonymity and Exaggerated Evil  Alluded to earlier was the idea of the potential for good to come from  online  anonymity.  As  related  to  disinhibition,  anonymity  can  help  to  create bonds and facilitate intimacy in ways that people often struggle  with offline. Cyberbullying, however, is an example of a specific type of  disinhibition that boasts no such positives. Suler coined the term toxic  disinhibition to describe online behavior that is primarily about using the  technology for bad:  We witness rude language, harsh criticisms, anger, hatred, even threats. Or  people visit the dark underworld of the Internet—places of pornography,  crime, and violence—territory they would never explore in the real world.  We may call this toxic disinhibition.23  While  toxic  disinhibition  is  detected  in  numerous  scenes  discussed  throughout  this  chapter,  it  is  actually  referenced  in  dialogue  in  the       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    95  “Generation of Vipers” episode of the British crime-drama Lewis  2007– .  The episode centered on an online dating video that a feminist professor  had recorded and that got leaked to a college humor website prior to her  murder. Reading through the comments posted under the leaked video,  the detectives Lewis  Kevin Whately  and his colleague Hathaway  Lau- rence Fox  appeared shocked by the level of vitriol:  Lewis:  Hathaway:   Lewis:   Who are these people?  Welcome to the world of Internet trolling. Leave your inhibi- tions at the door. Leave your humanity at the door, more like.  Just as the meek and mild Emily in Chatroom was suddenly motivated  to splash around paint and feces, the screen offers a variety of examples  whereby the technology facilitates a character’s departure from humanity  and from the self-control of real life and whereby the perceived different  rules of the Internet encourage toxic conduct. In Chapter 2, I discussed  how the neckbeard character, Jared, in the British crime-drama  Luther   2010–2013  inexplicably harassed the parents of a murdered schoolgirl  by defacing an online tribute site and digitally altering photos to place the  murdered girl’s head onto a porn star’s body. Jared had no reason to feel  animosity toward the victim’s family; for him trolling was simply a nasty  kind of recreation akin to the behavior of griefers in online gaming where  fun is reaped simply from being destructive. Something similar transpired  in  Trust.  In  the  aftermath  of  Annie’s  rape  by  a  cyberpredator,  she  was  harassed online by classmates: Similar to what happened in Luther, Annie’s  head was transposed onto a body of a porn star captioned with “Annie  loves dick” and “whore.” Annie’s cyberbullies had no personal grievance  with her—such bullies likely would never physically act out their abuse  offline—but  the  anonymity  of  the  Internet  motivated  her  peers  to  act  horribly simply because they could do so with little consequence.  While  thus  far  I  have  discussed  the  anonymity  of  the  bully,  it  is  worthwhile  acknowledging  the  consequences  of  the  victim  remaining  anonymous too. While the bully generally knows the identity of their  victim, the victim may chose to remain silent about their perpetrator.  Whereas the cuts, grazes, and bruises of physical bullying often makes  concealing  an  attack  difficult,  the  consequences  of  cyberbullying  are  much easier to hide and, as research identifies, attacks may never get  disclosed.24 In the aforementioned group therapy scene in the American  Cyberbully, for example, the necessity to talk to adults about such attacks    96   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  was highlighted; something that is seemingly not the natural inclination  of victims, as identified in academic research.25  Whereas in schoolyard bullying the roles are fairly fixed in regard to  those who bully and those who get bullied, online there is greater fluidity  with victims also participating in bullying and vice versa.  New Bullies and New Victims  In the American Cyberbully, Taylor and her best friend Samantha each  fulfilled roles of being cyberbullies as well as victims of it. The same thing  transpired for Casey and her anonymous cyberbully in the British Cyber- bully: Both characters held bullying and bullied roles. In the “Queen of  Snark”  episode  of  Harry’s  Law,  Sela  was  on  trial  for  homicide  because  of her vicious blog. As it turned out, Sela had been a victim of bullying  herself;  as  she  explained:  “It  began  a  little  out  of  anger,  a  little  out  of  jealousy, I guess . . . There were a lot of popular girls, the pretty girls, a  clique that . . . they would make comments about my looks or clothes,  my complexion during sophomore year. When I started blogging, it was  mainly about sniping back at them a little.”  While there is cross-over in regard to victims of bullying in real life and  those who are targeted online and equally so in regard to the old school  perpetrators versus Web–era ones,26 the unique properties of the Internet  mean that people who wouldn’t normally bully—perhaps because they  are adverse to confrontation or are normally rule-abiding—are given a  means to do so because their identities are concealed and thus the conse- quences of their actions are mitigated. Equally, the Internet is able to help  render vulnerable people who would not normally be victims of school- yard bullying due to the capacity for stealth attacks.  New Bullies  While  the  Internet  can  make  bullying  easy,  more  specifically  it  can  encourage bullying activity by people who would not normally be bullies;  a topic addressed by Kowalski, Limber, and Agatston:  Ironically, it is their very anonymity that allows some individuals to bully  at all. Children and youth who are smaller and physical weaker than many  of their peers tend to bully others less frequently for the simple reason  that they are outsized. Yet with electronic communications, they can hide  behind an assumed identity and wreak havoc.27  Mentioned repeatedly in this chapter is the film Perfect Stranger: Across  the course of the narrative, Rowena engaged in chat room conversations       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    97  with a man she assumed was her employer Harrison Hill  Bruce Willis ,  who she planned to frame for a murder. As it turned out, Rowena actually  hadn’t been chatting with Harrison at all, but rather with her colleague,  Miles  Giovanni Ribisi , who had an obsession with her and had imper- sonated Harrison online. This, along with Jared’s campaign of harassment  in Luther, provide good examples of Internet-specific bad behavior: Con- ducting such behavior offline would almost be impossible, but the Internet  encourages characters to “leave [their] humanity at the door.”  In the “Perfect Storm” episode of Flashpoint discussed earlier, after the  video of Billy’s bullying went viral, he took his father’s gun to school and  filmed himself seeking revenge on one of his bullies, Tony  Kyle Mac .  While this revenge scenario happens in several bullying narratives that  don’t include the Internet as a specific theme,28 the digital recording of  the initial assault on Billy appeared to egg the bullies on further; they  played up for the camera and their attack was potentially more brutal for  the imagined audience  the same thing that transpired in Girl Fight . The  fact that Billy then decided to record his own revenge highlights both  the role such technology can play in these attacks as well as the idea of  the Internet aiding in the creation of new bullies: Getting public revenge  for public abuse was undoubtedly a motive driving Billy. Discussed earlier  was Chatroom whereby through her participation in online chat rooms,  meek and mild Emily was manipulated into engaging in uncharacteris- tic bullying: the influence of William and the unreal properties of the  Internet facilitated this unusual behavior. In the British film Cyberbully,  after her ex appeared to send out a mean Tweet about her, Casey became  a bully by getting help to hack his Twitter account and using it to send  out embarrassing Tweets in revenge. The American Cyberbully provides  a similar example. While perhaps not as meek and mild as Emily, nev- ertheless Samantha is presented as a conservative, conscientious student.  Samantha became a victim of nasty remarks from classmates in a school  chat room, and at the same time she created an alternate persona online  to befriend her best friend Taylor and then spread rumors about her on a  social media site; Samantha is both bullied and a bully. Something similar  transpires in the family-comedy Shredderman Rules  2007 : Middle school  student Nolan  Devon Werkheiser , like many of his classmates, was a  victim of Bubba’s  Andrew Caldwell  physical bullying. Nolan, however,  turns the tables and anonymously created the “Shredderman” website to  display secretly recorded footage of Bubba to publicly expose his bullying.  The site also included a game where players could dunk Bubba’s head in  toilets; something that graphically replicates the kind of bullying Bubba  inflicted on his victims: Nolan was both bullied and a bully.   98   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Just as Jared in Luther and Miles in Perfect Stranger highlighted the  ease by which technology can make cyberbullies out of men who prob- ably  wouldn’t  have  bullied  in  “real  life,”  equally  Emily  in  Chatroom,  Samantha in Cyberbully, and Nolan in Shredderman Rules were assisted  in  becoming  unlikely  schoolyard  bullies  with  the  help  of  technology;  the Internet can create victims out of those who wouldn’t normally be  picked on.  New Victims  In  the  “We  Are  Everyone”  episode  of  Elementary   2012– ,  Sherlock   Jonny Lee Miller  explained to his colleague Joan  Lucy Liu : “If you  keep a discrete digital footprint like I do, you’re less vulnerable to the  harassment which is everyone’s stock in trade.” Here, Sherlock spotlights  that using social media can create a situation of vulnerability for users.  While Kowalski, Limber, and Agatston similarly identified that anonym- ity can make bullies out of people who would never bully in real life, this  equally works in reverse where the Internet can also be complicit in creat- ing new victims; something that Sherlock alluded to in Elementary and  something Menesini and Spiel outlined:  Internet and other new technologies may have increased the chances for  harassment for youth who might otherwise not be targeted. Probably for  a proportion of the cyber-victims the use of new forms of multimedia  technology has created a vulnerability that they may not have typically  experienced elsewhere.29  Chatroom illustrated this well. William, who got such pleasure from  “messing” with Emily and encouraging her to cyberbully, also set out to  “crucify”  Jim   Matthew  Beard .  William  achieved  this  by  encouraging  Jim—via the anonymous and self-revelatory properties of chat rooms—to  not only talk about his parents and upbringing but to get actively angry.  William  then  planted  seeds  in  Jim’s  mind  about  guns,  about  holding  guns,  and  about  dwelling  on  his  pain,  and  then  led  Jim  to  a  suicide- themed chat room. Jim, who had seemingly not previously experienced  bullying—nor,  for  that  matter,  suicidal  ideation—became  a  victim  of  William’s cyberattacks.  One interpretation of these portrayals is them being products of the  Zeitgeist. In the American Cyberbully, for example, specific mention is  made of Taylor’s father having left the family. For Samantha, at one point  she tried to find a parent to talk to about her day: her mother, exhausted,       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    99  had  fallen  asleep  on  the  couch;  her  father  was  busily  working  in  the  den. While the Internet provides the means for bullying to be executed,  narratives  similarly—and  subtly—imply  that  the  busyness  of  modern  life  is  a  contributor:  that  broken  homes  or  distracted  parents  are  fac- tors in both the creation of bullies and also their victims. In the British  Cyberbully, Casey was living in a single parent home; the same dynamic  existed in Girl Fight for Haley. In Disconnect, while the family unit was  intact, Ben’s father  Jason Bateman  was a largely absent workaholic. The  distracted workaholic father was also the experience for the cyberbully- ing victim, Dominik, in Sala samobójców  Suicide Room . While on one  hand these examples coincide with research highlighting that divorced  parents are a risk factor in bullying,30 such scenes also function as cau- tionary tales: Unsupervised Internet access can have tragic consequences,  a situation potentially more likely to transpire in a busy single parent  household.  Another psychological factor facilitating, if not encouraging, bullying   online is distance.  Arm’s-Length Attacks  In  the  American  Cyberbully,  after  Samantha’s  online  bullying  was  exposed, she attempted to explain her actions: “When you do it online,  you don’t even realise you’re doing it. You can’t see the other people and  you can do or say anything and it doesn’t seem to matter. It doesn’t feel  real.” Here, Samantha highlights some psychological qualities more spe- cific than mere anonymity: You can’t see the other people and thus, it doesn’t  feel quite real. An interesting finding from psychologists Robert Slonje,  Peter Smith, and Ann Frisén’s research is that cyberbullies feel less remorse  than other kinds of bullies.31 While this finding can be interpreted in  numerous ways—notably as related to the unreal properties of the Inter- net discussed already—in sync with Samantha’s comments, the inability  to actually see one’s victim is potentially a key component.  A theory pioneered by the psychologist Albert Bandura is moral dis- engagement, which describes the process by which an individual elects to  disengage or turn off their moral standards to participate in behavior that  is commonly thought of as bad.32 While research has linked physical bul- lying with moral disengagement,33 in recent years studies have also argued  that moral disengagement is linked with cyberaggression.34 The reason- ing is that because of the absence of direct contact—and the apparent  “invisibility” of the victim35—disengaging morally and unguiltily from    100   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  a situation is made easier. This is something that Kowalski, Limber, and  Agatston discussed, noting that because bullying “occurs via technology,  as  opposed  to  via  face-to-face  interactions,  perpetrators  cannot  see  the  emotional reactions of their victims.”36  In  the  American  Cyberbully,  it  was  quite  clear  that  Samantha  was  emotionally  unsettled  when  she  was  confronted  with  the  pain  of  her  friend Taylor, who she had been bullying online: When faced with her  friend’s real tears Samantha was clearly distressed. Equally, in the British  Cyberbully, when Casey was forced to watch a video made by one of her  cyberbullying victims, Jennifer, prior to her suicide, she was also visibly  distressed. During their actual acts of bullying, however, both Samantha  and Casey were able to type mean words and completely dissociate from  the pain they were causing. This idea is equally applicable for scenes where  characters conduct anonymous trolling. In Chapter 2, the “Internet Troll”  episode of the sitcom Maron  2013–  was discussed whereby Darryl  Erik  Charles Nielsen  was trolling the title character  Marc Maron  and criti- cizing his comedy. Marc tracked down Darryl and confronted him and  while Darryl didn’t seem particularly repentant, neither was he aggressive  towards Marc; being mean to someone in person, to their face, takes a  level of confidence and bravado that someone like Darryl is unlikely to  possess. This similarly applies to the online behavior of Noah  Josh Gad   in the comedy-drama Wish I Was Here  2014 : Noah’s first appearance  on screen involved him sending mean, anonymous Tweets to celebrities.  Noah, however, is a mild-mannered misfit—possibly on the autism spec- trum  Chapter 1 —of whom engaging in a physical confrontation with  anybody, let alone a celebrity, is impossible to imagine. Such characters  are aggressive because of the buffer of distance.  Another theory relevant to interpreting the ways by which the Internet  enables engagement in brutal behavior in cyberspace is psychologist Phil- lip  Zimbardo’s  work  on  deindividualization.  Deindividualization  posits  that if people can’t identify a victim, they are less likely to feel shame or  guilt.37 While Zimbardo’s work long predates the Internet, the relevance  of it to cyberbullying has been of great interest to scholars,38 and is highly  relevant to discussing this behavior on screen. In the British Cyberbully, for  example, Casey sees little consequence to the videos she makes mocking  girls who make haul videos:39 Casey interprets these girls not as individuals  but as stereotypes of “mean girls” who would look down on someone like  her in real life. In the “Make Love, Not Warcraft” episode of South Park   1997– , Jenkins, the griefer, was killing off scores of characters with no  regard for the impact that this was having on other players’ enjoyment of       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    101  the game. First, Jenkins was able to do this because he was just playing the  game, and even though such activity was not in the spirit of “play,” could  be rationalized. Second, Jenkins was not able to  see any of his victims.  While  Jenkins  was  not  a  well-developed  character—so  it  is  impossible  to determine whether he would have been guilt-ridden had he actually  known the identity of his victims—nonetheless, in cyberspace, not know- ing the identity of victims helps markedly in emotionally detaching and  being able to bully without things like humanity curtailing conduct.  One reason that cyberbullying is so often presented on screen as inex- tricably linked to youth is because of the social media focus: For young  people social media is not construed as a recreation option, but as some- thing compulsory.  Mandatory Social Networking  Psychologists  Petra  Gradinger  et  al.  spotlight  some  of  the  unique  aspects  of  cyberbullying  that  distinguish  it  from  physical  bullying:  “a  cyber-victim might be able to stop certain kinds of repeated harassment  in the cyber space easily  e.g., blocking a perpetrator on social network  sites or chat rooms, or changing his her identity in cyberspace. ”40 While  in theory this is certainly possible, in real life and on screen, this doesn’t  always transpire: something that the American Cyberbully illustrates well.  In an early scene, Taylor had just read the awful things that had been  written on her social media page and she was crying and the following  exchange transpired with her mom, Kris:  Kris:    I’ve  looked  around  this  website,  it’s  completely  inappropriate  for  someone your age. There are no boundaries. You need to shut down  your profile.  Taylor:  Come on! Kris:    Look at you! You’re in tears after one day, just shut it down. It’s not  worth it.  Taylor doesn’t shut her profile down and the bullying exacerbates to the  point where she makes a suicide attempt. Afterward, Kris visits Senator  Evans  John Maclaren  to petition him to draft anti-cyberbullying legis- lation. In her conversation Kris spotlighted how different the theory of  avoiding cyberbullying is from the reality for young people:  Senator:    I don’t want to try to legislate the Internet. I don’t go online myself  if I can help it. My staff does that for me.   102   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Kris:    But these kids are on the Internet all the time. And they’re vulner- able to these bullies who hide behind anonymous user names.  Senator:  No one’s making them go online now, are they? Kris:  Senator:  Well they do have delete buttons on computers. Kris:   Excuse me?   I thought that too until I almost lost my daughter. You can’t keep  these kids off the Internet. It’s their world.  While  the  Senator  is  positioned  in  this  exchange  as  old-fashioned  and out-of-touch, Kris spotlights that for young people, simply opting  out of social media often seems impossible. A good screen illustration  of  the  perceived  inescapability  of  social  media  is  evident  in  the  Brit- ish Cyberbully. For the duration of the film, Casey is at her computer  negotiating with an anonymous cyberbully who is threatening to leak  her private photos. It is not until the very last scene that it finally occurs  to her that she can actually log off; that she doesn’t have to be a part of  these exchanges. In Unfriended, something similar transpires whereby  a group of teens are kept at their computers by an anonymous cyber- bully. For Casey in Cyberbully and the teens in Unfriended, participating  in social media is construed as compulsory, regardless of the negative  consequences.  Menesini and Spiel explain that the majority of cyberbullying happens  in  adolescence  because  of  young  people’s  embrace  of  new  technology:  “This is explained not only by the capacity of adolescents to be able to  use new technologies, often better than adults, but also because at this age  the use of new technology provides additional opportunities for social- ization.”41 With the use of social media slanted toward young users it is  perhaps no surprise that most of those involved with cyberbullying in real  life and also on screen are young.  The Youth Bias  Of the many malevolent Internet characters examined in this book, the  cyberbully exists at the youngest end of the age spectrum. Just as some of  the screen’s most notable old school–style bullies are schoolchildren—for  example, Biff  Thomas F. Wilson  in Back to the Future  1985 , Nelson  from The Simpsons  1989– , Harley  Danny McNulty  in Boy Meets World   1993–2000 , Sid from Toy Story  1995 , Draco in the Harry Potter films,  and Reese  Justin Berfield  in Malcolm in the Middle  2000–2006 —the  majority of on-screen cyberbullies are similarly aged. Just as old school  physical bullying has a school focus, cyberbullying in the Internet age—as       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    103  illustrated by most of the examples discussed thus far in this chapter— also has a school focus.  An  obvious  explanation  for  the  screen’s  focus  on  young  people  centers  simply  on  representations  mirroring  reality:  As  psychologists  Cheryl  Dellasega  and  Charisse  Nixon  note  in  their  book  on  female  bullying, such behavior peaks in adolescence and then wanes.42 Other  factors,  however,  are  also  at  play.  In  Oppliger’s  work  she  notes  that  “the  recurring  bully  is  most  often  represented  in  television  situation  comedies  that  either  target  adolescent  audiences  or  are  animated.”43  While Oppliger was discussing television and specifically bullies that  were  recurring  characters—for  example,  Nelson  in  The  Simpsons—in  fact, her comments also have applicability to many other cyberbully- ing presentations: that they transpire most commonly in narratives tar- geted at young people.44 On one hand, such narratives can be explained  because bullying is disproportionately concerning at this time of life:  In my research on media portrayals of menstruation and masturbation,  for  example,  I  proposed  this  same  idea  as  an  explanation  why  both  topics  are  disproportionately  identifiable  in  narratives  centered  on,  and targeting, young people; such subjects are simply more interesting  during adolescence than at any other time.45 Another explanation cen- ters on the cautionary tale provided. Tara Ariano and Sarah Bunting in  their book Television without Pity cynically discuss lessons provided by  youth-targeted television:  A Very Special Episode is an episode that feels more like school than like  escapist television . . . If it’s got a lecturing tone, feels like a PSA [pub- lic service announcement], and presents an overly simplistic picture of a  complex issue, it’s probably a Very Special Episode . . . VSE topics often  include drug or alcohol abuse; bad touching; war, death, and grief; homo- sexuality . . . They customarily conclude with a Very Valuable Lesson.46  Cyberbullying falls into this same category: Its inclusion in a storyline  is about educating—or even potentially preaching—about a topic rather  than it being a subject matter that is intrinsically entertaining. Such pre- sentations offer dire warnings about the dangers of the Internet, of unsu- pervised access, and of social media.  Discussed earlier were a wide variety of narratives where cyberbullied  characters attempted suicide. Such attempts tap into a real-life connec- tion between bullying—including cyberbullying—and suicide: Research- ers have identified that any kind of bullying serves as a risk factor for    104   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  suicide.47 That said, on screen the reasons for the inclusion of a suicide  attempt  as  the  culmination  of  a  bullying  experience  might  have  more  to do with sensationalism than reality.48 The media coverage of several  highly  publicized  real-life  suicide  cases  have  framed  cyberbullying  as  complicit: News reports on the suicides of the American teenagers Ryan  Halligan in 2003, Megan Meier in 2006, Jessica Logan in 2008, Hope  Witsell in 2009, Tyler Clementi in 2010, and Amanda Todd in 2012, as  well as the Australian television celebrity Charlotte Dawson in 2014, each  positioned cyberbullying as having a key role. That cyberbullying was the  cause,  however,  is  not  a  universally  held  belief.  The  psychologist  Sheri  Bauman, for example, notes that there is a level of scare-mongering and  hyperbole at play here:  Although  reports  in  the  popular  media  may  give  the  impression  that  cyber-bullying  and  suicide  are  rampant  among  youth,  the  fact  is  that  cyber-bullying is less common than traditional bullying, and completed  suicides are rare events, although tragic when they occur.49  Most important, Bauman spotlights the difficulty in establishing cau- sality and the impossibility of determining to what extent any single factor  plays in a suicide.50 In the “Queen of Snark” episode of Harry’s Law, for  example, as part of Sela’s trial for the homicide of her classmate, Hannah’s  mother  Romy Rosemont  is questioned about the family’s Catholicism  and Hannah’s depression, in turn tabling other factors—aside from Sela’s  cyberbullying—as contributing to the suicide. In the British Cyberbully,  Jennifer’s  suicide  is  similarly  problematized:  The  trolling  of  her  videos  may have been a factor but equally so may have been the death of her  mother and her unhappy home life with her father. In The Affair, Marga- ret  Kathleen Chalfant  tried to downplay her granddaughter Whitney’s  involvement in Jody’s suicide attempt by similarly spotlighting other fac- tors, “It sounds like this Jody character is unstable.” Whitney’s mother,  Helen  Maura Tierney , offered a similar reasoning: “Look, that girl is  troubled . . . you don’t try to kill yourself over a few text messages.” Even  in Unfriended, while we are given scant information, the existence of fam- ily problems and possible abuse appeared to be factors in Laura’s suicide  beyond cyberbullying.  While the unsuccessful suicide attempts in Disconnect, Trust, The Affair,  the American Cyberbully, and Odd Girl Out could be construed as mir- roring reality in that the suicide was attempted but not successful, more  so, these scenes can be construed as examples of media sensationalism.       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    105  While such sensationalism has been discussed elsewhere in the context of  suicide,51 for the purposes of this discussion this situation is particularly  relevant because it highlights how, to justify the inclusion of a cyberbul- lying storyline, a presentation needs to be more dramatic than characters  simply typing at a keyboard, and thus suicide offers such drama: as psy- chologists Danny Wedding and Ryan Niemiec note in their work on film  and mental illness, “Suicide makes for high drama, and it is a common  theme in films.”52  Another aspect of the youth focus, and one linked to both reality and  to the capacity for such a storyline to serve as an entertainment product,  centers on some of the unique experiences of youth. Dellasega and Nixon  contend that such bullying is more likely to happen during adolescence  because of the high number of physical and mental changes happening  during that period.53 One change centers on control; research on adoles- cence, for example, often identifies the frustration that comes from teens  feeling that things are happening to them—physically and emotionally— without  their  control.54  On  screen  this  is  well  illustrated  in  Chatroom.  Footage  of  William’s  home  life—where  he  was,  in  reality,  a  depressed  teenager—were juxtaposed with images of him in chat rooms: In these  rooms he is tougher, stronger, better groomed, more confidant, and more  positive and exhibits a control—particularly in regard to the destiny of  others; he was able to watch the havoc he could wreak, and often did so  with a devilish smile. Life in cyberspace was much more appealing than  what William experienced offline. At one point Eva  Imogen Poots  asked  William why he was engaged in such bad online behavior such as leading  Jim to the suicide room. William replied, “He just reminds me of a boy I  used to know. Lonely nothing of a boy. I hate that memory.” Needless to  say, the boy William was referring to was himself: Online he could control  Jim almost like a kind of avatar and feel somehow less out of control of  his own life.  The Role of Gender  On screen, old school bullies tend to be male—boys are the ones por- trayed pushing other boys into lockers or pushing heads into toilets: As dis- cussed in Chapter 1, a very common screen scenario is male jocks bullying  male nerds. While the physicality of schoolyard bullying in real life is often  associated with boys, schoolgirls, of course, also engage in schoolyard terror,  often via taunting, ostracizing and rumor-spreading as already identified in  many of the scenes discussed thus far.55 In Chapter 2, I introduced the    106   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  idea that sexuality is often a key component in the online abuse of women;  equally it is a common theme in the bullying of girls and also, interestingly,  in bullying by them. In the comedy Mean Girls  2004 , Regina  Rachel  McAdams  circulated the rumor that classmate Janis  Lizzy Caplan  was “a  dyke” and in the comedy Easy A  2010 , Marianne  Amanda Bynes —the  head of the school’s celibacy club—spread the rumor that Olive  Emma  Stone  was no longer a virgin. In the black-comedy Welcome to the Doll- house  1995 , female classmates speculated on Dawn’s  Heather Matarazzo   sexuality within earshot. While the Internet wasn’t a theme in these exam- ples, it nevertheless serves as a perfect vehicle for the kinds of teasing, ostra- cizing, and rumor-mongering apparent; behavior that is most commonly  associated with girls. The research on the gender breakdown of bullying  is mixed: while Kowalski and Limber contend that more cyberbullying is  conducted by girls,56 the psychologist Qing Li conversely contended that  more boys are the perpetrators.57 Other research fails to identity any gen- der difference at all.58 While real-life statistics are contested, on screen both  boys and girls are shown to participate.  In her work on bullying on screen, Oppliger notes that “girl bullies are  rather  unusual  in  mass  media  presentations.  Producers  are  more  likely  to write girls as mean, perpetuating stereotypes of females.”59 Oppliger’s  discussion, however, centered largely on physical bullying and, therefore,  given dominant gender stereotypes, it stands to reason that displays of  female physical aggression are rare. Cyberbullying, however, largely elimi- nates the physical component in turn leveling the playing field in regard  to a character’s ability to participate and not be seen as traversing any gen- der rules; while teen girls aren’t assumed to be thuggish, they are certainly  stereotyped as bitchy. One significant trend in the way cyberbullying is  presented on screen is in the context of it being part of the  presumably   natural behavior of girls.  Girls Will Be Girls  In  her  book  Dealing  with  Bullies,  Cliques,  and  Social  Stress,  Jennifer  Landau makes an interesting point about perceptions related to the gen- der of schoolyard bullies:  There’s a lot of talk about mean girls in the press . . . All this talk might  make you think that relational aggression is a normal part of growing up  for girls. Have you heard the phrase “boys will be boys” to describe their  rough and tumble, physically aggressive behavior? Now it seems like “girls  will be girls” equals girls will be mean.60      T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    107  Education  theorist  Lyn  Mikel  Brown  similarly  discusses  this  idea,  spotlighting—and critiquing—“that prevailing assumption that girls will be  girls, that they will naturally betray, reject, and undermine one another.”61  Certainly these sentiments are articulated widely on screen. In the “Babes”  episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Detective Tutuola  Ice T   candidly remarked, “Nothing crueler than high school students.” In Sex- ting in Suburbia, Skylar’s mother Patricia  Judith Hoag , similarly rational- ized cyberbullying, claiming, “It’s high school, that’s what people do.” In  the British Cyberbully, Casey’s standard refrain is that everybody trolls each  other online. This idea is presented with a more gendered slant in Odd  Girl Out when the father  Michael Arata  of one of the female cyberbul- lies, Stacey  Leah Pipes , tells his son: “Son, listen, this is important. Girls  are brutal. They hurt each other’s feelings and tear each other to bits over  the smallest things. Guys, smack each other. And then go and get a beer.”  In the same film this idea was reiterated when the mother  Lisa Vidal  of  the bullying victim, Vanessa, goes to the school seeking help and is told:  “So we’re talking about verbal abuse? Teasing? Taunting? . . . This type of  non-physical conflict is common amongst girls at this age. Unfortunately  there’s nothing much we can do . . . We cannot regulate what girls say to  each other.” The normalcy of such bitchy behavior is also alluded to in a  scene from Mean Girls. Ms. Norbury  Tina Fey  addressed a classroom of  girls: “Everybody close your eyes. I want you to raise your hand if you have  ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back. Open your  eyes.” Everybody had their hand up. “Now, close your eyes again. And this  time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a  friend behind her back.” While the dad in Odd Girl Out speculated on this  idea, Mean Girls presented it as a truism: Girls are awful to one another.  The girls will be girls idea is often discussed in academic work. In their  survey of bullying literature, for example, Stan Davis and Julia Davis note,  “bullying among girls is more likely to be a part of an ongoing relation- ship than bullying among boys.”62 The authors quoted psychologist Nicki  Crick who explained:  Girls who have been victimized by relational bullying will say “This hurts,”  and the adults in their lives will dismiss their concerns, sort of a “Girls will  be girls” version of the old saying, “Boys will be boys.” In the end, girls  who are bullied end up not having allies.63  While theorists like Landau and Brown each critique the girls will be  girls idea, on screen this idea often plays out as a cultural truth. Feminist    108   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  theorist  Naomi  Wolf  notes  how  “TV  and  the  press  love  a  good  cat- fight,”64 and feminist media theorist Susan Douglas makes a similar point  spotlighting that the catfight is “a staple of American pop culture.”65 On  one level, narratives where women bully each other is simply part of the  mediascape where women are depicted as competitive and bitchy, often  for the affections of men.66 Certainly this theme is well illustrated when  cyberbullying is conducted against a love rival; something that transpired  in Sexting in Suburbia, the Canadian television drama Selling Innocence   2005 , in the television drama Betrayed at 17  2011 , and in the “Lost  and Found” episode of the crime-drama Stalker  2014–2015 .67 While  such narratives fit neatly into a Zeitgeist where girl fights are acceptable as  entertainment, it is worthwhile acknowledging the politics underpinning  this frame; something I have discussed previously:  The quickest and cheapest way to discredit a woman is by saying she’s bit- ter, that she’s jealous, that she’s clawin’ for a catfight. Women know this  malarkey. It’s how men dismiss us. It’s how we dismiss each other.68  In  gender  researcher  Rhonda  Hammer’s  work,  the  catfight  frame  is  examined as a media example of the backlash against feminism whereby  women’s concerns are painted as petty and personal:  This divide-and-conquer strategy tends to neutralize, trivialize, and reduce  the real multidimensional and urgent issues associated with the feminist  terrain that need to be addressed in a public forum.69  The catfight frame, akin to the girls will be girls idea, works to down- play, if not completely dismiss women’s aggression toward one another,  and all the while packages it as an entertainment product: something cer- tainly evident in the examples discussed thus far.  Another gendered way that cyberbullying is framed on screen is in the  context of a slut-shaming narrative whereby bullying has an explicit con- nection to the demonizing of female sexuality.  Slut-Shaming  In the Australian crime-drama The Killing Field  2014 , during the inves- tigation into teenager Becky’s  Taylor Ferguson  murder, one of her male  school friends, Bruno  James Fraser , called her a “slut.” His “proof” was a  video she had made of herself stripping, which he had on his iPad and which  had, apparently, been “doing the rounds” at school. In the comedy Sex Tape       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    109   2014 , in the aftermath of the accidental release of their sex tape Annie   Cameron Diaz  and Jay  Jason Segel  argued about the consequences:  Jake:  Annie:   You know what, Annie, I’m on there, too.  Who gives a shit? Nobody cares about you. Nobody wants to watch  you having sex. You said it yourself. Nobody cares about the guy! It’s  the woman that has to live with it forever.  In the British Cyberbully, a similar point is made when Casey’s anony- mous cyberbully threatened to leak sexy photos of her: The bully verbally  reminded her of what happens to girls when explicit photos of them are  released. The same warning is given by the sleazy photographer, Malcolm   JR Bourne , in Selling Innocence, after the teen model Mia  Sarah Lind   asked him to remove the salacious photos of her from his website:  You think you can make this girl go away because you suddenly decided  to be respectable? This girl has been copied, traded, bought, sold, cut and  pasted, faxed and emailed. She is out there in the ether. And when you  are seventy, when you have grandchildren, she’ll still be out there . . . She  will haunt you.  Bruno’s comments in The Killing Field—and something Annie, Casey’s  cyberbully, and Malcolm each referred to are attitudes and behaviors that  have come to be known as slut-shaming; a concept explained well by com- munications theorist Kate Zittlow Rogness:  Slut shaming is the act of criticizing someone for acting like who society  considers to be a slut. A slut is someone who is, or has the appearance of  being, sexually promiscuous. The notion of promiscuity is highly subjective  and contextual. One may define it liberally, having casual sexual encoun- ters with multiple partners, or more conservatively, as having intercourse  for reasons other than procreation . . . Slut shaming evolved out of norms  that govern appropriate, or so-called normal, gender performance.70  While slut-shaming can be detected throughout culture, it is behav- ior that is most easily witnessed online.71 In a range of Internet-themed  screen narratives, slut-shaming has a distinct presence.  In the pilot of the sitcom Parks and Recreation  2009–2015 , Mark   Paul Schneider  circulated via e-mail an upskirt photo of his colleague— and the show’s protagonist—Leslie  Amy Poehler . While fallout from  the  video  was  not  explored  in  the  episode,  the  idea  that  someone—a    110   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  man—would circulate such an image is an example of the kinds of slut- shaming that occurs in many examples whereby images of women are  considered not only as entertaining but a commodity to be distributed  to achieve certain ends ranging from arousal and harassment through to  character assassination. In Sexting in Suburbia, after Dina’s naked photo  was circulated, school vandalism described her as a whore and a Face- book page was set up titled “Dina van Cleve is a slut.” After Dina’s sui- cide, her gravestone was vandalized with the same abuse. In the “Babes”  episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, prior to her apparent sui- cide, pregnant Fidelia  Jessica Varley , was harassed, with trolls accusing,  “UR A dumb whore.” In the aforementioned “The Truth about Lying”  episode of Blue Bloods, some of the cyberharassment Amy had received  prior to her suicide involved messages posted on her social media includ- ing, “You’re a filthy whore” and “Everyone knows you’re a skank.” In the  “David & Ellie” episode of the British series Dates  2013 , it was revealed  that there were rumors on Facebook speculating that Ellie  Montanna  Thompson  had left school because she was pregnant. In the “Lost and  Found” episode of Stalker, high school student Jenny  Cole Bernstein ,  responded to an online poll by naming her coach, Coach Baker  Andrew  W. Walker , as the teacher she’d most like to have sex with. Her quote  ended up on her school’s “Tattler” gossip blog—accusations of her being  pregnant, along with fake sex tapes, went up onto the site and she was  shamed as a slut. Something similar happens in the “Like a Virgin” epi- sode of Veronica Mars  2004–2007  when, after the results of a suppos- edly private online purity test were exposed, the student body responded  by celebrating the male “studs” and condemning the female “sluts.” In The  Affair, part of the bullying of Jody involved use of a fake Twitter account  called @skankhojodymanko. In Selling Innocence, when Mia’s classmate  discovered that she had been making money posing for sexy photographs  online, printouts of her images were posted around the school and she  was bullied and called a “Web slut.” In Betrayed at 17, Lexi  Amanda  Bauer  had sex with Greg  Andy Fischer-Price  while he secretly filmed  it. Greg’s ex-girlfriend Carleigh  Katie Gill , who was still obsessed with  Greg, found the video on his phone and sent it out to his contacts with  the subject header “Lexi the Slut.” In the television drama Web of Desire   2009 , Finn’s  Claudette Mink  threat of leaking the “sex tape” of her  with married Beth  Dina Meyer  was a persuasive blackmail device. In  the British Cyberbully, as mentioned earlier, a Tweet was  seemingly  sent  from the ex of the teen protagonist, Casey, that read: “I guess its [sic] no  surprise Casey Jacobs is on antidepressants. I spent one night with her       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    111  and it fucking depressed me.” Slut-shaming was also a topic explicitly  spoken of in the same film.  In each of these examples, girls and women are bullied on the grounds  of sexual reputation. The underpinning is that a girl is entitled to less  respect the more sexual partners she is assumed to have. Such scenes, of  course, are perfectly illustrative of the well-established double-standard  whereby  women  are  judged,  and  condemned,  based  on  their  sexuality  while men are rewarded for the same behavior.  While not common, a kind of sexuality shaming of men also transpires.  Discussed earlier was Sala samobójców  Suicide Room  where cyberbully- ing  transpired  based  on  Dominik’s  assumed  homosexuality.  Something  similar  happened  in  the  “Exiles”  episode  of  Blue  Bloods.  Photos  of  the  homosexual Balatazar  Walid Amini  had been posted on Facebook: “If  I get sent home I’m a dead gay man,” he admitted, knowing his relatives  in  Syria  had  seen  the  photos.  In  the  “Web”  episode  of  Law  &  Order:  Special Victims Unit something similar occurred when a classmate discov- ered that Teddy  Connor Paolo  had been posing on a child porn site; as  occurred in Selling Innocence, printed images from the site were pasted  over the school to shame him. In Disconnect, a similar narrative played  out when a sexually compromising photo of Ben was distributed via social  media  leading  to  his  suicide  attempt.  In  these  examples,  however,  the  shaming is not centered on men being “sluts”, but in fact centered on the  demonizing of nonheterosexuality. In these male examples, deviations from  heterosexuality—and  from  hegemonic  masculinity  more  broadly—are  policed and punished. These scenes, however, can be likened to the slut- shaming that transpired in the female examples in one key way: In each  expressions of sexuality other than male heterosexuality were disciplined. While the examples discussed thus far center on female slut-shaming  as connecting to bullying, worth noting is such behavior transpiring as  connected to other kinds of online behavior engaged in by women. In  the Taiwanese romantic-drama Ci qing  Spider Lilies   2007 , for exam- ple,  one  of  the  employees  at  the  Cyber  Investigations  Bureau—a  unit  apparently intent on protecting victims of cybercrime—commented to  a colleague, “These young women can play people better than you. They  pretend. Pretend to be an innocent girl. They are all flirty and snobbish  inside. They cheat money out of men to buy famous brands . . . There’s  not a good one amongst them . . . These women need a man to teach them  a lesson.” Interestingly, the same kind of “explanation” for cybercrimes  against women transpired in Selling Innocence, when one of the netsafety  investigators, James  Fred Ewanuick , explained: “After a while you begin    112   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  to see a pattern. You begin to see the truth. So you can say that men are  the bad guys all you want, but who’s tempting them in the first place?  Who are they tangling with? See, it’s not the men who are evil, Mia, it’s  the girls.” In each of these examples bullying occurs not just on the basis  of gender but on sexuality; that women are being judged for their capac- ity to, apparently, tempt men who can’t have them. While the problems  with slut-shaming have received extensive attention,72 in fact, these scenes  don’t challenge such behavior, but in fact contribute to it by framing the  lead up to such behavior as a cautionary tale, in turn, positioning the  victim as somehow complicit in her attack.  While most of this chapter has been preoccupied with cyberbullying by  school-age children, it is also worth identifying scenes that involve adults.  Adult Cyberbullies  Nurse Ratched  Louise Fletcher  in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest   1975 ,  Tony  Perkins   Ben  Stiller   in  the  Disney  film  Heavy  Weights   1995 , and Sue Sylvester  Jane Lynch  in the television series Glee  2009– 2015  are good examples of adult bullies. While adults in these examples  didn’t cyberbully, as discussed throughout this book—and highlighted in  Chapter 2 in the context of neckbeards—adults are actually engaged in a  variety of nefarious online activities.  While uploaded-video-shaming transpires widely on screen, often, for  example,  in  the  context  of  the  exposure  of  war  crimes—“The  Drone  Queen” episode of Homeland  2011– , along with the third season of  The  Newsroom  and  the  biopics  about  Julian  Assange  such  as  Under- ground: The Julian Assange Story  2012  and The Fifth Estate  2013  for  instance—and  while  such  examples  could  be  considered  as  a  kind  of  bullying against a state, they aren’t quite the kind of personalized attacks  that are focused on in this section. Personal attacks by adults do however  occur, with strategic use of the Internet to be mean deployed in numer- ous examples.  Luther and Maron provide examples of adults engaged in cyberbully- ing via trolling. Discussed earlier was Web of Desire whereby Finn threat- ened to leak a sex tape involving her and Beth. While such an example is  indicative of blackmail, the fact that the threat involved online shaming  showcases that adults can both be bullied online and also use the Web  themselves for such purposes. The online leak sex tape extortion narra- tive was used in the “Dead Man’s Switch” episode of Elementary, which  centered  on  a  case  where  a  father,  Ken Whitman   Thomas  Jay  Ryan ,       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    113  was being blackmailed: If he declined to pay up, a video that had been  recorded on the night of his daughter, Eva’s  Portia Reiners , rape would  be uploaded. Extortion was also a theme in Sex Tape: After Annie and Jay’s  homemade sex tape was accidentally leaked, Howard  Harrison Holzer — the teen son of friends—threatened to upload the video unless he received  $25,000.73 While in these examples sex was a theme, in fact, adult cyber- bullying  takes  numerous  other  forms—and  is  further  discussed  in  the  context of revenge porn videos later in this chapter.  In a variety of examples adults find themselves the victims of cyberbul- lying, notably via embarrassing uploaded videos. In the television holiday  film The Mistle-Tones  2012 , Holly  Tia Mowry  threatened to upload a  video of her uptight boss, Nick  Jonathan Patrick Moore , participating  in karaoke. In the “Bully” episode of the sitcom New Girl  2011– , after  Jess  Zooey Deschanel  tried to stop one of her students being bullied,  she in fact became a cyberbullying victim herself when one of her plucky  pupils, Brianna  Joey King , uploaded a video of Jess doctored to look  like a bird singing. Something similar happened in the “My Hero” epi- sode of Stalker: After Dave  Michael Rady  broke up with his girlfriend,  she e-mailed everyone in his company telling him that he was a jerk. This  kind of revenge also occurred in the “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” episode  of the crime-drama The Mentalist  2008–2015  when, during an investi- gation, it was discovered that Kim  Kim Johnston Ulrich , a disgruntled  ex-wife of a murder victim, John, had uploaded an angry video prior to  his death where she claimed:  John Flynn told me he was divorcing me. John said he wanted to be alone,  that he didn’t want to be married anymore. Well, John, this is what I think  of your settlement agreement. Word is out on you, John. I am going to  tell everyone exactly what kind of a man you are because you are a pig!  You are a coward!  In the “High Road Is the Guy Road” episode of the sitcom Man Up   2011 , Will’s   Mather  Zickel   son,  Nathan   Jake  Johnson ,  was  being  bullied at school by Brandon  Harmon Jones . Will himself had in fact  been bullied by Brandon’s father, Dennis  Dan Cortese , when they were  children.  Dennis  continued  his  bullying  behavior  into  adulthood  and  by the end of the film had produced a mocking video of Will that he  uploaded. In the “Crappy Birthday to You” episode of the jPod, Ethan was  bullied when a karaoke video of him was posted to a video sharing site.  In the “Generation of Vipers” episode of Lewis, Miranda’s online dating    114   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  video was uploaded to a college humor website and she became a laughing  stock. In the “Manhattan Queens” episode of Blue Bloods, Deputy Chief  Sal Laduca  Joe Maruzzo  uploaded a video of a man speeding through  Manhattan streets, taunting the Police Commissioner  Tom Selleck  in  order to shame him. A similar, politically-motivated shaming transpired  in the “Chapter 6” episode of House of Cards when a gaffe Francis made  on CNN went viral via a parody video. The viral capacities of the politi- cal gaffe also transpired in numerous episodes of the sitcom Alpha House   2013– .  Mentioned earlier was the “Babes” episode of Law & Order: Special  Victims  Unit  where  a  pregnant  teenage  girl,  Fidelia,  appeared  to  have  committed suicide after being the victim of cyberbullying. While Detec- tive Tutuola remarked, “Nothing crueler than high school students,” as it  turned out, the cyberbullying was not conducted by a high school student  at all, but rather by Peggy, the mother of another pregnant teenager, who  believed  Fidelia  had  been  encouraging  her  friends—including  Peggy’s  daughter—to get pregnant:  Peggy:    Okay, fine, I wrote it, okay? But that little slut ruined this family. If  it wasn’t for her my daughter wouldn’t have gotten pregnant and my  son wouldn’t’ve made the mistake that he did.  Another  kind  of  on-screen  adult  cyberbullying—and  certainly  one  linking back to the earlier slut-shaming discussion—is revenge porn. As  film theorist Timothy Shary notes, “The point for revenge-porn sites . . .  is to make the vengeful humiliation of the woman as public as possible,”  and certainly this theme plays out in numerous examples on screen.74 Just  as slut-shaming is becoming a burgeoning topic of discussion in academic  literature, it is also beginning to have a presence in screen narratives.  Revenge Porn  revenge porn as follows:  In  legal  scholar  Carmen  Cusack’s  work  on  cybercrime,  she  defines   Revenge porn is pornography produced or distributed by intimate part- ners with the intent of humiliating or harassing victims . . . Sometimes  revenge porn is produced surreptitiously or while victims are intoxicated.  Some  victims  have  reportedly  been  forced  to  produce  revenge  porn  through threats and violence. Many victims consent to produce pornogra- phy with their partners, but they have not granted their partners consent       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    115  to distribute pornography. Often, consent to produce pornography will  be kept private. Once revenge porn is placed online, it may be viewed  thousands of times within a few days . . . Commercial and amateur web- sites capitalize on revenge porn.75  In the “Sweet Revenge” episode of Major Crimes, Detective Amy Sykes   Kearran Giovanni  provided her own definition: “Our victim Travis Hall  [John-Paul Lavoisier] runs a website that lets guys get back at their ex- girlfriends by posting naked pictures of them online. It’s called revenge  porn.” In the “Chapter 5” episode of House of Cards, in Zoe’s  Kate Mara   attempt to build trust with Francis, she allowed him to take naked pho- tos of her on the assumption that they later could be leaked to destroy  her reputation if she betrayed him. As it turned out, in the aftermath of  her murder, the photos were indeed released in an effort to muddy the  rationale for her death. In the aforementioned “Sweet Revenge” episode  of Major Crimes, one of the female victims of revenge porn committed  suicide following the release of the images and her subsequent job loss. In  the “Manhunt” episode of Stalker, after Paul’s  Preston Jones  girlfriend,  Cara  Cherilyn Wilson , broke up with him because she wanted to pur- sue lesbianism, he uploaded a video of them having sex to prove to his  friends that he hadn’t “turned” her: “Now they can see that I was laying  it down right,” he told an investigator. In a more explicit example, in the  “News Night with Will McAvoy” episode of The Newsroom, only a day  after Sloan  Olivia Munn  broke up with him, her ex-boyfriend leaked  naked pictures of her to a revenge porn website, leading Sloan to face ter- mination from her on-air role. In the television drama Reckless Behavior:  Caught on Tape  2007 , Emma  Odette Yustman  went on spring break,  was drugged, and was filmed being raped. The rape tape then got doc- tored and posted online on a Spring Break Babes netporn site. Emma lost  her job as a teacher and was shunned in her small town. Annie in Sex Tape  alluded to the cost of a released sex tape being higher for a woman than  a man and in the Major Crimes and The Newsroom episodes as well as in  Reckless Behavior: Caught on Tape, women faced job losses as a result of  their appearance in revenge porn. While such a situation could potentially  also negatively impact a man—and is a theme discussed in the context of  male exhibitionism in Chapter 6—the reality is that the market for sto- len and compromising images of women is higher and thus it remains a  gendered problem. When Paul in the “Manhunt” episode of Stalker spoke  of the leaked sex tape actually helping his credibility, in fact, this can be  construed as part of the rationale behind any leaking of a sex tape: In our    116   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  culture men often end up with an enhanced reputation while the woman’s  value is depleted. This is the stud slut paradox at play.  On  one  hand  an  interpretation  for  the  behavior  of  Jared  in  Luther,   Darryl in Maron, and Peggy in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit centers  on their inability to acknowledge the real-life consequences of their online  behavior. Another interpretation is that bullying is a way to present such  characters are immature. In research on adult bullies, repeated are ideas  that such bullies haven’t grown out of the behavior they may have once  engaged in as children.76 In such examples, the bullies are presented as  characters unable to resolve their conflicts in mature ways and instead  resort to schoolyard tactics.  Cyberbullying as a Recreation  The last theme in cyberbullying narratives discussed in this chapter is  recreation. Explored earlier was the notion of a sensationalized portrayal  of suicide by the media. A component of this is the much discussed idea  that bad news—that tragedy—can be entertaining. As related to the depic- tion of cyberbullying, this idea is at play on two levels: for audiences, such  narratives showcase that cyberbullying is something that is entertaining to  watch; that it has been included in a plot because it is deemed sufficiently  interesting for audiences. While this might, on a cursory level, seem like a  controversial assertion, in fact, it is not at all surprising: Just as audiences  like crime-dramas and thrillers, presentations of cyberbullying fit within  the framework of crime as entertainment. Oppliger in fact alluded to this  idea briefly, identifying that “in some cases, audiences might even enjoy  the bullying because it appears that a character partly deserved the bul- lying for standing out or being annoying.”77 The second level that this  works on is within narratives; that inside a cyberbullying storyline, toxic  online behavior is presented as an entertainment product. This idea has  much traction on screen. Discussed earlier were scenes where characters  spoke of their bullying as though it was a game; in Chatroom, for exam- ple, William spoke of “messing” with Emily and in Disconnect Frye spoke  about “just trying to mess with [Ben].” While in these examples, online  fun is centered on characters reaping enjoyment from terrorizing their  peers online, this idea takes numerous different forms online.  The aforementioned drama Girl Fight centered on the production— and  then  the  uploading—of  a  video  of  a  physical  attack  on  Haley  by  her female school friends. In fact there are a wide variety of examples  where a meta statement is made about the use of the Internet to consume       T H E   C Y B E R B U L LY    117  crime. In the “P911” episode of the crime-drama series Criminal Minds   2005– ,  footage  of  an  imprisoned  young  boy  was  uploaded;  he  was  being “auctioned” with a ticking clock. In the “Elephant’s Memory” epi- sode of the same series, a video is posted on the school’s social media site  of  Owen   Cody  Kasch   being  forced  to  masturbate  in  a  locker  room.  Something similar transpired in the “Meme Is Murder” episode of the  crime-drama Castle  2009– : The high schooler Adam Lane  Jared Kus- nitz  was showering, his clothes were stolen, and while naked and scream- ing, he was secretly recorded and the video was put up on MySpace. The  horror genre takes these ideas substantially further. FearDotCom  2002   centered on a website showing real-time torture clips captioned by the  classic voyeur question, “Do you like to watch?” Filmed and broadcast  torture is also a theme in the “Mikado” episode of the sci-fi series Mil- lennium  1996–1999  as well as in the thrillers The Card Player  2004 ,  Dot.Kill  2005 , and Untraceable  2008 . An extreme example transpired  in  the  Japanese  horror  film  Satsujin  Douga  Sit   Death Tube:  Broadcast  Murder Show   2010 , a film that opened with an unnamed male watch- ing the DeathTube.com channel: a site that apparently goes live for only  two weeks per year. The man falls asleep watching a clip from the site and  wakes up inside the channel: He is now a prisoner in one of the murder  rooms. The imprisoned man is able to, via the laptop in his cell, watch  other prisoners. In one poignant scene, he watches, in its entirety, the  murder of another prisoner. Despite the fact that this man faces this same  fate himself, he is unable to look away from the broadcast murder; he still  finds murder entertaining.  The  watching  of  these  scenes  presents  an  interesting  case  of  passive  or bystander cyberbullying: that by electing to watch videos of bullying   as discussed earlier , or fighting, or torture, a character is experiencing  some pleasure—or at least some entertainment—from the physical harm  of another. This arguably serves as a metaphor for much online behavior  whereby pleasure is reaped from problematic displays, in turn potentially  encouraging  its  production,  and  also  provides  insight  into  the  well- established idea of violence being a spectator sport. Such scenes, there- fore, provide social commentary about contemporary, and problematic,  use of the Internet.  This chapter has explored the depiction of cyberbullying in film and  television. Such a presentation is in sync with media depictions that pres- ent the Internet as a kind of frightening and lawless place where users fall  into one of two categories: victims or victimizers. Chapter 4 furthers these  ideas with an examination of another online pest: the hacker.    4  They prefer to describe  themselves as cyberactivists:   The Hacker  Unlike many of the Internet stereotypes discussed in this book, hackers— or, as Sherlock  Jonny Lee Miller  wryly identified in the “We Are Every- one” episode of Elementary  2012– , “they prefer to describe themselves as  cyberactivists”—are actually relatively common on screen. Mark Gregory  and David Glance in their work on computer security trace these screen  depictions back to the phone-tapping thriller The Conversation  1974 ,  identifying that “hacking and film have long gone hand in hand.”1 Com- puter scientist Damian Gordon dates hacker characters back even further  to the heist films Hot Millions  1968  and The Italian Job  1969 .2 Part  of the explanation for this long history centers simply on entertainment:  Whereas scenes of programmers tapping on keyboards or staring at screens  of code are invariably boring displays, hacking can elevate a technology- themed narrative into something comparatively exciting.  While hacking scenes can be a captivating display—and are certainly  more action-packed than many of the other Internet-themed storylines  discussed in this book—they are also among the most criticized: Hol- lywood’s  take  on  hacking  invariably  bares  little  semblance  to  real  life  and this incongruity has been spotlighted by numerous commentators.  Eric Limer addressed this in his Gizmodo article and presented a simple  explanation, “Good TV should be fun to watch. Movies should be fun    120   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  to watch. Real-life hacking? Not so fun to watch.”3 Michele Foley, on  PopSugar, expressed a similar view: “I always love a good computer hack- ing scene: They’re full of energy, adrenaline, and it’s funny to see just how  wrong the movies depict hacks.”4 While Limer and Foley acknowledge  that many hacking plots are farcical, they also recognize that such scenes  are designed to provide a positive viewing experience; as Limer concedes,  “it’s basically impossible to film accurate hacking and have it be visually  interesting in the way film demands.”5 Hacking scenes are unrealistically  exciting because this makes for an enhanced consumer experience. While  many hacking scenes are spectacularly stupid—Stanley  Hugh Jackman   in the crime-drama Swordfish  2001  hacking while a gun is held to his  head and while receiving fellatio is one such example; Stanley standing in  front of a bank of computer monitors drinking, smoking, dancing, and  typing is another—the sheer spectacle of such scenes is actually one of the  few means by which a hacking scene is justified in mainstream cinema;  something Limer identified:  There’s a whole host of problems, starting with how screens during real  hacking don’t necessarily have any motion, and static data display is bor- ing on the big screen for any amount of time longer than a second. The  matter is made worse by how most hacking software is function over form,  whereas interesting action scenes demand the exact opposite. Add that to  tiny text sizes that are unreadable at any reasonable filming distance, and  you’ve got a pretty good argument for replacing it all with some flashing  lights and colors.6  Other authors, however, are less forgiving. John Cheese, in his article  for  Cracked,  condemned  hacking  depictions  asserting  that  filmmakers,  “not only get everything wrong, but give us the most insulting bullshit  imaginable  on  details  it  would  have  taken  two  minutes  to  Google.”7  Cheese illustrated his argument with scathing descriptions of hacking in  films including Hackers  1995  and Masterminds  1997 . One scene he  mocked—from “The Bone Yard” episode of the television crime-drama  NCIS   2003– —is  actually  one  of  the  most  widely  maligned  hacking  scenes;8 a YouTube clip of it is amusingly titled “2 Idiots, 1 keyboard.”9  In  the  scene,  the  Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service  computer  whiz,  Abby  Pauley Perrette , is at her keyboard attempting to stop the NCIS  computer system being hacked. Abby types frantically and bemoans, “It’s  moving too fast!” Her colleague, another computer whiz, Timothy  Sean       T H E   H A C K E R    121  Murray , soon joins her at the keyboard: Both characters then type on the  same keyboard at the same time; a scene Cheese bitingly discussed:  As fast as they were hammering that keyboard, it would have had the same  exact effect if one of them had just started slamming their entire palm  across it and screaming like a frightened chimp.10  While commentators like Cheese focus their scorn on hacking depic- tions, such critiques are actually good illustrations of decades of criticism  of artistic representations of technology: Condemnation of hacking por- trayals is just a recent incarnation.11 Equally while a deluge of criticism  exists about such scenes, the 2015 sci-fi series Mr. Robot notably has been  praised as a modern and  comparatively  more realistic portrayal of hack- ing than previous attempts, potentially an indication that audiences have  become more savvy and demand more realistic portrayals.12  While this chapter focuses on themes in the presentation of hackers as  a screen archetype—and thus does not analyze methods beyond use of a  networked computer  such material is covered elsewhere 13—it is worth  noting that despite their many unrealistic elements, numerous theorists  have identified their enormous influence: Films like the classic hacker film  WarGames  1983  have extensively impacted on the Zeitgeist in spite—or  perhaps even because—of their inaccuracies. It has been argued, for exam- ple, that WarGames influenced the U.S. government’s computer security  policy  in  the  1980s.14  WarGames,  as  well  as  more  modern  takes,  have  also been credited with educating—or more commonly miseducating— the public about cybersecurity.15 This idea was actually joked about in  the comedy Office Space  1999  when Michael  David Herman  acknowl- edged that his hacking expertise came from the infamous “salami slicing”  hacking scene in Superman III  1983 .  While  news  media  coverage  of  hacking  has  been  widely  accused  of  being sensationalist,16 exaggerated,17 romanticized,18 and even excessively  laudatory,19 the very fact that it has  a  garnered so much attention, and   b  is now on the policy agenda, form part of the explanation for why it  has been so frequently dramatized on screen: It is topical and perceived  as excitingly threatening; increasingly so, as connectivity becomes more  common.  Before  examining  screen  attempts  at  definitions,  the  most  common  way the hacker is portrayed on screen—and a presentation that trumps  the nuances of hacking depictions—is the simple focus on criminality.   122   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The Hacker as Criminal Outsider  The most obvious hacker characteristic is their status as an outsider, a  theme in line with the typical screen portrayal of netgeeks  Chapter 1 ,   and  also  common  in  the  presentation  of  criminals.  In  the  “Friending  Emily” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  1999– , for exam- ple, detectives sought help from a hacker, Job  Ean Sheehy , who had  a  history  of  hacking  child  pornography  sites.  Job’s  outsider  status  was  demonstrated by the fact that he was serving a prison sentence for hack- ing into government websites. Hackers aiding law enforcement in fact, is  a theme identifiable in numerous examples where hacking is presented as  a valuable skill, but one invariably in the possession of underworld fig- ures. In the “Body of Evidence” episode of the British police-drama New  Tricks  2003– , investigators visited the jailed hacker Jake  Chris Ashby   seeking information on the techniques of another hacker. In an unnamed  season nine episode of the British drama Spooks  2002–2011 , the consul- tant cryptographer Danielle  Fiona Glascott , had served a jail sentence  prior to working with the police. In the crime-drama CSI: Cyber  2015– ,  Brody  Shad Moss  is employed with the FBI as a condition of his plea  bargain;  he  had  previously  been  on  the  run  as  an  outlaw  hacker.  The  same plea negotiation was how Penelope  Kirsten Vangness  in the crime- drama Criminal Minds  2005–  ended up working for the FBI, as revealed  in  “The  Black  Queen”  episode.  The  on-the-run  hacker  Gavin   Jimmi  Simpson  similarly ended up working for the FBI in the political-drama  House of Cards  2013– . This same plot was at the heart of the thriller  Blackhat   2015 :  it  opened  with  the  hacker  Nick   Chris  Hemsworth ,  negotiating a temporary prison release in order to help the government.  In  the  action  film  Live  Free  or  Die  Hard   2007 ,  two  hackers  actually  help law enforcement catch of group of cyberterrorists. A variation of this  transpired in the “Hammerheads” episode of the legal-drama The Prac- tice  1997–2004 , when the convicted cyberharasser Anthony  Silas Weir  Mitchell , is called as an expert witness on hacking during a court case.  In Swordfish, Stanley’s outsider status was established through him being  an ex-con hacker who was living in a trailer park. In Hackers, Dade  Jonny  Lee Miller  was an outsider because, as shown in the opening scene, as  early as 11 years old, he was caught hacking and was penalized with a  7-year ban on using computers and touch-tone telephones. In the biopic  Takedown  2000 —based on the real-life hacker Kevin Mitnick—Kevin   Skeet Ulrich  was another criminal outsider: Throughout the film he was  on the run from the FBI. In the Australian biopic Underground: The Julian       T H E   H A C K E R    123  Assange Story  2012 , the teen hacker title character  Alex Williams  and  his associates were on the run from the police; the same storyline played  out in the “We Are Everyone” episode of Elementary when the hacker Ezra  Kleinfelter  Christian Campbell —an Assange-type figure—was similarly  attempting to evade prosecution.  While  in  these  examples  the  characters  were  actual  outlaws,  not  all  on-screen hackers have had encounters with the law and thus while their  hacking crimes still make them criminals—and thus also outsiders—their  status as outsiders is often illustrated via other transgressions. Akin to the  netgeeks discussed in Chapter 1, the hacker’s computer knowledge sets  them apart from “normal” people: They have skills and preoccupations that  make them different; they speak differently for example, and have their  own language s .20 For some hackers, like Jesse  Ashley Zukerman  in the  Australian crime-drama series The Code  2014– ,21 Elliot  Rami Malek   in Mr. Robot, as well as the Assange character in the biopics Underground:  The Julian Assange Story and The Fifth Estate  2013 ,22 the difference cen- ters on Asperger’s Syndrome—a condition that both furthers the idea of  difference as well as potentially explains it  Chapter 1 .23 For other hack- ers transgressions center on gender norms, politics, finance, and sexuality.  In sync with the show-don’t-tell nature of the screen, unsurprisingly such  transgressions also frequently bleed into fashion choices—particularly for  female hackers—in turn adding a visual element to a character’s outsider  status, a subject addressed later in this chapter.  While the hacker is most commonly presented on screen as a criminal  outsider, in some examples, more nuanced attempts are made to define  the hacker and analyze motives beyond criminality.  Screen Definitions  Gordon traced the first screen use of the term hacking back to the sci-fi  film TRON  1982  in a scene when Kevin Flynn  Jeff Bridges  disclosed:  “I’ve been doing a little hacking.”24 While TRON didn’t actually provide  a definition, other screen examples have attempted to do so, or at the very  least, have strategically framed the topic and thus, more subtly, guided  audience  understanding.  The  children’s  television  series  Ghostwriter   1992–1995 , for example, devoted four episodes to hacking in the early  1990s. In the “Who Is Max Mouse—Part 1” episode, the school com- puter system had been hacked and the teacher, Mr. Aucoin  Greg Lee ,  was charged with explaining the breach to the class: “A hacker is someone  who tries to sneak into someone else’s computer system.” Mr. Aucoin’s    124   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  definition emphasized the stealth and criminal nature of the act, albeit  with  age-appropriate  language.  While  in  Ghostwriter  the  hacking  was  rather tame—altering grades and setting off fire alarms—film and televi- sion offer an enormous variety of motivations including the embezzling of  money  Superman III, Office Space, Swordfish, Supernatural [2005–] and  Firewall [2006] , stealth surveillance  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,  Untraceable [2008], The Dark Knight [2008], The Blacklist [2013–], Annie  [2014],  and  Ex  Machina  [2015] ,  disrupting  transportation   Cyberjack  [1995], 23 [1998], The Italian Job [2003], Flashpoint [2008–2012] and  Hawaii Five-O [2010–] , disrupting hospital care  Law & Order [1990– 2010] , disrupting emergency services  American Dad! [2005–], Under- ground , and in more fantastical examples, corrupting dreams as in The  Cyberstalking  1999  and Inception  2010 , accessing the last moments of  someone’s life as in Source Code  2011  and possibly even world destruc- tion as in WarGames. Be it for grades or greed, such hacking is regularly  termed black-hat hacking, something referenced in the titled of the afore- mentioned Blackhat and something defined by Gregory and Glance as  centered on exploiting “any weakness in a network or an organisation’s  systems for gain. This could mean collecting and selling intellectual prop- erty or personal information.”25  At the opposite end of the spectrum is so-called white-hat hacking and,  while white-hats use the same technology as their “black” counterparts,  their work is less focused on personal gain: “A so-called ‘white hat’ will  inform an organisation if a security weakness is found in that operation’s  systems . . . In one sense, they perform a defensive role: they are the good  guys of the hacking world.”26 In the horror film Smiley  2012 , for exam- ple, the hacker Zane  Andrew James Allen  claimed to be a “security pro- fessional . . . I am one of a hundred or five hundred or a thousand people  in the whole world who can find out anything about anyone. Medical  records, how much money, chocolate or vanilla, top or bottom.” Given  the nature of his work, Zane actually seems less concerned with safeguard- ing security, however, and more so about exploitation. While it wasn’t his  actual motive, Mark Zuckerberg  Jesse Eisenberg  in the biopic The Social  Network  2010  in fact tried a “security” defense for his hacking of the  Harvard University network for his early Facebook work when he argued,  “I  believe  I’ve  pointed  out  some  pretty  gaping  holes  in  your  system.”  A better example of white-hat hacking was offered by the hacker Karl   August Diehl  in the German biopic 23: “Hackers find and exploit holes  in system security . . . We mess around with it and say, ‘This is broken.  Fix it.’ . . . we do no harm.” Karl’s definition eschewed the criminality of       T H E   H A C K E R    125  the activity evident in the examples discussed earlier and aligns hacking  with a kind of troubleshooting and, certainly for the first half of the film,  it was indeed the kind of work he was doing. In the “Kidnapping 2.0”  episode of CSI: Cyber, Daniel  Charley Koontz  was introduced as “the  best white-hat hacker in the world. You hack it, he will come.” Angela   Sandra Bullock  in The Net  1995  and Hope  Nikki Deloach  in The Net  2.0  2006  were both paid to undertake white-hat hacking. In the thriller  Sneakers  1992 , the same kind of “good” hacking work was described:  Bank receptionist  Denise Dowse :   Martin  Robert Redford :    So people hire you to break into their  places to make sure that nobody can  break into their places? It’s a living.  Sitting  somewhere  between  black-hat  and  white-hat  hacking  is  cyberactivism—often  termed  hacktivism;  an  activity  spotlighted  in  the  Elementary episode discussed earlier and illustrated well in an exchange in  Takedown between Kevin and his waitress Karen  Amanda Peet :  Karen:  Reading about cyberterrorists? Kevin:  First amendment freedom fighters. Karen:    I think this is like the contras and the Sandinistas—it’s all a perspec- tive thing.  While the politics of hacking is addressed later in this chapter, for this sec- tion it is worth noting that Kevin’s concept of hacking in Takedown alludes to  a gray-hat variety, a practice linked neither primarily to theft nor security, but  notably centered on contentious political goals like information freedom:  “Grey hats” are more difficult to define. They can fall into categories like  “hacktivism”  hacking for a cause  or “suicide hacking”  civil disobedi- ence; expecting to get caught .27  [G]rey-hat hacking is used to describe a malicious attack that is orches- trated against an ethically dubious organisation or individual. For exam- ple,  if  a  hacker  perceives  that  a  company  is  not  treating  its  employees  fairly, they may feel the company deserves to have its system infiltrated.28  Takedown, for example, opened with the dialogue—seemingly taken  from a news report: “There is a hacker ethic out there that says that all  information should be free. Sort of a hacker Communism if you will.” In    126   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  “The Body of Evidence” episode of New Tricks, the hacktivist Catherine   Sarah Smart  explained her work: “Yes we’re at war. We’re fighting for  our civil liberties, for our freedom. For fairness against a corrupt, self- regarding, patriarchal establishment.” Such themes play out in Mr. Robot,  notably in the work of the Anonymous-like group Fsociety, and were also  articulated  in  Hackers,  when  an  extract  from  the  Hacker’s  Manifesto— penned in 1986 by the real-life hacker Loyd Blankenship  known by the  handle The Mentor —was read aloud:  This  is  our  world  now.  The  world  of  the  electron  and  the  switch;  the  beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious  bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it’s  for our own good, yet we are the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime  is that of curiosity. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  At the end of the hacker-drama Antitrust  2001 , the Skullbox Team  hackers provided a mission statement reflecting similar social objectives:  “Human  knowledge  belongs  to  the  world.”  In  Takedown  Kevin  even  hinted at the notion that he might be a gray-hat during an angry outburst:  I could be so rich right now. Right now I could be on that computer, this  minute, and I could take money from any bank anywhere in the country  and I could put it into any account that I want to. And I don’t. I don’t.  While Kevin didn’t actually do anything particularly political in Take- down,  the  idea  of  hackers  resisting  personal  profit  in  pursuit  of  loftier  goals is widely identifiable. In the pilot of Mr. Robot, for example, Elliot,  reported a café proprietor, Ron  Samrat Chakrabarti , to the FBI after  hacking  into  his  system  and  discovering  he  had  been  hosting  large  amounts of child pornography; “I don’t give a shit about money,” Elliot  says in response to Ron’s efforts to pay for his silence. Elliot, who describes  himself as a “vigilante hacker,” was not interested in financially profiting  from his hacking but rather using it to incrementally improve society.  Information freedom is the real-life motive for the hacker Julian Assange  and therefore it is no surprise that it is equally portrayed as a driver in the  biopics about him such as Underground and The Fifth Estate. A fictionalized  gray-hat portrayal was evident in the aforementioned “The Black Queen”  episode of Criminal Minds. The episode opened by revealing how Penelope  first came to work for the FBI: She had been caught hacking into a cosmet- ics company. During her FBI questioning, Penelope attempted to justify  her actions to her investigating agent, Aaron Hotchner  Thomas Gibson ,       T H E   H A C K E R    127  by claiming, “They test on animals.” Hotchner explained that the reason he  was offering her a no-prosecution deal centered on her gray-hat credentials:  “In hacker circles you’re known as the Black Queen. And you are rigorously  moral. All of your online attacks reflect a fierce desire to protect those who  you think are being hurt.” Similar politics drive other screen hackers in  “The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak” episode of the superhero series Arrow   2012– . Felicity  Emily Bett Rickards  was revealed to have had a history  of “civil disobedience via the World Wide Web”; as she explained, “I cre- ated this . . . this super-virus that could give us access to any infected server.  We could expose government fraud, start virtual sit-ins and digitally deface  criminals.” In the “Chapter 18” episode of House of Cards, the hacker Gavin  explained his gray-hat work to the journalist Lucas  Sebastian Arcelus :  Most  of  my  friends  are  locked  up  and  rotting  away  ’cause  they  poked  the bear one too many times. Why? They wanted to expose government  surveillance, the PRISM program, embezzlement, abuse, fucking torture,  lies. You’re a journalist? Who gives a shit? We’re fucking soldiers. It’s per- sonal for me now.  While Job in the aforementioned “Friending Emily” episode of Law &  Order: Special Victims Unit wasn’t a particularly well-developed character,  his hacks into child porn sites—akin to Elliot’s hacks into Ron’s server in  Mr. Robot—also hinted to gray-hat objectives. The regularity of gray-hat  portrayals on screen is likely explained by the heightened awareness of  groups like Anonymous as well as the scandals surrounding WikiLeaks  and Assange and thus are productions of the Zeitgeist; the grayness of the  presentations highlight that such characters are invariably polarizing thus  injecting necessary screen tension, thus making for more interesting view- ing and simultaneously exploiting real-life social debates.  A variant on the gray-hat theme is the cyberterrorist, fusing the cyber- criminal with the contemporary bogeyman of the terrorist. While in “The  Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak” episode of Arrow—transpiring in season  three—Felicity  was  exposed  as  a  former  hacktivist,  back  in  the  season  one episode “You Choose, You Lose,” she was charged with tracking the  supervillain Deadshot  Michael Rowe . In one scene, while on Deadshot’s  digital trail, Felicity hacked into a government database and remarked,  “Kind of makes me a cyberterrorist, which is bad because I really don’t see  myself fitting in well at Guantanamo Bay.” This comment is noteworthy  because in season one the character apparently saw a distinction between  hacktivism and cyberterrorism.   128   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  White-hats, black-hats, gray-hats, and cyberterrorists each use exactly  the same hacking tools to achieve their aims and thus are each equally  criminals. However, through their hat-color framing—and particularly if  they get explicitly branded as cyberterrorists—a statement is being made  about the validity of motives; as Karen remarked in Takedown: “[I]t’s all  a  perspective  thing.”  In  the  “All  about  Steve”  episode  of  the  animated  series American Dad!, Steve identified that “a cyberterrorist hacked into  the dam’s computers and shut it down.” While a comic example, nonethe- less the hacker was framed not merely as a computer criminal but earned  the very politically loaded labeling of cyberterrorist. In the “Ivan  No. 88 ”  episode  of  The  Blacklist  the  same  frame  was  offered  when  Red   James  Spader  sarcastically remarked, “So the Federal Government has armed a  cyberterrorist with a digital equivalent of a nuclear warfare. Another fabu- lous example of your tax dollars at work.” In Live Free or Die Hard a simi- lar frame is identifiable when “cyberterrorists” attempted to shut down  the U.S. financial system. In these examples, no weight is given to credible  political motives: The act is simply portrayed as tech-savvy terrorism.  The wide variety of hacking definitions on screen highlight that the  activity  is  akin  to  how  Hollywood  tackles  most  subjects;  no  standard- ized  storyline  exists  and  thus  there  is  no  typical  screen  hacker,  either,  although—as  discussed  throughout  this  chapter—themes  do  indeed  emerge.  Identified throughout this book is the presence of cyberphobia in film  and television depictions of the Internet. With this in mind, it is certainly  no surprise that portrayals of hacking are often underpinned by fears of  computers and Internet technology. While pop culture has long depicted  computers and connectivity as scary, hackers add another element, per- sonalizing  fears  and  serving  as  the  “console  cowboys”29  of  cyberspace  who can pillage identity, raid bank accounts, and even jeopardize human  safety. As the hacker Theodore “Rat” Finch  DJ Qualls  boasts in the sci-fi  film The Core  2003 : “I can steal your money, your secrets, your sexual  fantasies, your whole life. Any country, any place, any time I want”; a  claim similar in content to the one quoted earlier from Zane in Smiley.  As with many of the presentations discussed in this book, those centered  on  hacking  reflect  debates  and  fears  already  apparent  in  the  Zeitgeist:  extensive publicity of hacking—publicity that communications theorist  Paul Taylor considers sensationalized30—be it news stories of credit card  fraud, WikiLeaks or the work of Anonymous, help to shape hacking in  the popular imaginary and, as relevant for this chapter, prime audiences  for fictionalized presentations. Cyberphobia, unsurprisingly, forms part of       T H E   H A C K E R    129  the explanation for why hackers are often depicted—as cultural theorist  Ken Gelder identified in his book Subcultures—as criminalized “folk dev- ils.”31 Their routinely demonized portrayal in the media has been widely  identified. Taylor,  for  example,  identified  that  hackers  tend  to  be  stig- matized  and  marginalized  in  the  media.32  Media  theorist  Sarah  Casey  Benyahia spotlighted these trends in her work on Stieg Larsson’s fictional  character Lisbeth Salander from the Swedish films Män som hatar kvinnor   The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo   2009 , Flickan som lekte med elden  The  Girl Who Played with Fire   2009 , Luftslottet som sprängdes  The Girl Who  Kicked the Hornets’ Nest   2009 , the Swedish television series Millennium   2010 , and the American film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  2011 :  In popular culture, particularly crime and science-fiction genres in film  and television, the hacker has often been synonymous with the criminal:  the equivalent of a thief but breaking and entering in the virtual rather  than the real world.33  Sociologist Tim Jordan equally contended that “hackers have become  a readily available villain”34 and pointed to films including the thriller  Enemy of the State  1998  and Live Free or Die Hard as illustration. Given  that   outside  of  the  subculture   hacking  is  generally  conceived  of  as  a  crime, it is no surprise that the criminalized portrayals discussed at the  beginning of this chapter are effortlessly identified: American film has a  very long history of packaging crime as an entertainment product35 and  thus, representations of cybercriminals are just a modern incarnation.  While villainized portrayals of hackers are indeed readily identifiable,  as noted, there is no single frame for the hacker on screen. While Gelder  spotlighted the “folk devil” theme, he also examined early portrayals that  cast hackers in a “benign and even utopian role: a friendlier sort of pirate . . .   an image helped along by film and television representations.”36 Just as  the criminalized trend in hacker portrayals has been noted, so too has  the hero. In their analysis of Hackers, The Net, and the television series  VR.5  1995 , communications theorists Susan Owen, Leah Vande Berg,  and Sarah Stein identified that “their narratives depicted the lead hackers  as heroes.”37 Communications scholar Stephanie Schulte made a similar  point in her discussion of WarGames, contending that the film promoted  a “hackers are heroes” message.38 Cultural theorist Jasmina Kallay identi- fied that Hackers, twelve years on from WarGames, had “picked up the  mantle of the hacker hero.”39 Cultural theorist Aaron Tucker identified  the unique position that the hacker has on screen as a criminal on the one    130   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  hand but hero on the other: “The positively portrayed hacker is more an  antihero, a do-gooder that needs to bend or break some rules in order to  achieve a large, nobler goal.”40 Tucker’s point highlights another frame  for the hero hacker on screen: as a kind of noble rule-breaker. This narra- tive, of course, is widely detected quite separately from Internet-themed  narratives. The action-drama Nick of Time  1995 , for example, centered  on a law-abiding man  Johnny Depp  whose daughter was kidnapped: In  exchange for her release, he was instructed to kill a politician. The televi- sion drama  Hostages  2013–2014  offered a similar narrative: A family  was taken hostage; to secure their freedom the law-abiding mother  Toni  Collette  was ordered to kill the president. An early computer-hacking  themed example of this storyline transpired in the British crime-drama  Bellman  and  True   1987   when  a  recently  fired  computer  expert  was  forced to hack a computer to save his kidnapped son. Swordfish provided  a similar narrative whereby Stanley, a retired hacker, agreed to one last  hack to fund a custody battle. Tucker contends that this kind of hacker is  able to both break the law and remain a hero because such characters are  portrayed as comparatively moral; that their hacking is  likely  perceived  by the audience as happening for a greater good and that the hackers are  more moral than their adversaries:  Hackers  are  strongly  moralistic  characters  that  can  be  trusted  to  make  the best decisions, potentially for all of humanity; their construction as  “outsider” figures with little to no investment in “corrupt” infrastructures   corporate, governmental  allow them to make “pure” selfless decisions.41  For Stanley in Swordfish, even though—as discussed—he was a con- victed hacker, he is certainly portrayed as comparatively more moral than  the men forcing him to hack. In Underground, even though he still arrests  him, Detective Ken Roberts  Anthony LaPaglia  seemed somewhat con- vinced by Julian’s explanation that his intentions to expose war crimes  were noble. Hackers and Antitrust both serve as good examples of hacking  for a greater good. In Hackers, the hackers hacked to save the world from  an  evil  genius’s  computer  virus.  In  Antitrust,  “good”  hackers  similarly  hacked to expose the truth about the evil software corporation NURV   Never Underestimate Radical Vision . In each example, while the “good”  hackers are still, obviously, breaking the law, their work is presented as less  of a crime than the threats posed by their cyberadversaries.  Neither explicitly criminal nor hero, another type of hacker on screen   is the sidekick; an archetype Benyahia discussed:      T H E   H A C K E R    131  The  more  familiar  presentation  of  the  hacker  in  film  has  been  that  of  the hacker as sidekick and helper, relied on by the protagonist to provide  expertise  that  they  don’t  possess.  This  supporting  function  also  decon- taminates the hero by keeping them distanced from direct contact with  cyberspace.42  Benyahia illustrated her contention via reference to characters like Den- nis  Nedry   Wayne  Knight   in  the  adventure  film  Jurassic  Park   1993 ,  Boris  Grishenko   Alan  Cumming   in  the  James  Bond  film  Goldeneye   1995 , and Rand  Cyril Raffaelli  in Live Free or Die Hard. While Benya- hia’s  discussion  centered  on  male  hackers  as  sidekicks,  cultural  theorist  Tara Parmiter examined the presentation of female hackers as sidekicks,  discussing Felicity in Arrow, Willow  Alyson Hannigan  in Buffy the Vam- pire Slayer  1997–2003 , and Chloe  Allison Mack  in Smallville  2001– 2011 : Characters who hack to aid the show’s protagonist.43 This sidekick  idea aligns well with screen presentations of hacking as more exciting than  reality: by relegating a hacker to sidekick or helper, the boring keystroke  work—while essential to the plot—utilizes less screen time than the more  physical and seemingly interesting work of the hero. Equally, for nerdy  characters  like  Dennis  in  Jurassic  Park  or  the  female  sidekicks  of  male  heroes—like Felicity in Arrow and Chloe in Smallville—their computing  leaves the hero distanced from direct contact with cyberspace and thus also  from  the  emasculating  qualities  of  it   Chapter  2 .44  Such  examples,  of  course, exist as notable departures from the screen stereotype of women  not being proficient at computing: In these examples women clearly had a  much better understanding of computing than the heroes they hacked for.  The Who of Hacking  While there is no homogenous presentation of the hacker on screen,  several themes in their portrayals are detectable, notably that they tend to  be male, young ish , and power hungry.  Men  In the hacking-themed films mentioned thus far in this chapter  along  with those discussed in the remainder , most hackers on screen are male.  On one hand this reflects an educated guess about reality45: Most hackers  in real life are assumed as male; as Owen, Vande Berg, and Stein contend,  in “real life women hackers are so rare as to be almost non-existent.”46  While the idea of hacking as something men do is a common portrayal,    132   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  a more interesting aspect to this is hacking as masculine: that it isn’t only  conducted by men but that the practice actually shares attributes com- monly  associated  with  maleness. Technology  theorist  Alison  Adam,  for  example, identified hacking as “well known to be largely a masculine phe- nomenon”47 and that it is a distinctly “masculine activity.”48 Taylor simi- larly wrote of it as a “masculine pastime.”49 Cultural theorist Derek Burrill  made the same point noting that “the history of hacking, cracking, and  phreaking has created . . . a masculine subject that confounds traditional  notions of masculinity and power.”50  On one hand, the lack of female hackers could be attributable to the  same set of reasons that deter women more broadly from getting involved  in computer science. Taylor, for example, proposed three factors to explain  the low numbers of female hackers:  1.  Social factors—e.g., the sexual stereotype of young children, when boys  are  given  technical  playthings  whilst  girls  are  given  cuddly  toys  and  plastic tea-sets.  2.  The masculine environment—computer science is dominated by men  and  therefore  this  creates  a  general  “locker  room”  climate  in  which  women feel threatened or uncomfortable.  3.  Gender in language—the male bias in the language used in computer   science reinforces points 1 and 2.51  While Taylor’s factors at least partly explain gender disparities in hack- ing, these are also explanations applicable to computing in the generic.  Hacking, however, has an even sharper gender disparity than other aspects  of computer culture52 and thus requires a more nuanced analysis. Technol- ogy journalist Steven Levy discussed this point in his book Hackers, not- ing, “Even the substantial cultural bias against women getting into serious  computing does not explain the utter lack of female hackers.”53 One of  the hackers who Levy interviewed commented on this, noting, “Cultural  things are strong, but not that strong.” A suggestion here is that hacking  is  not  just  male  dominated,  but  actually  male;  that  there  is  something  about it that “naturally” exploits male interests and aptitudes. Adam, for  example, identified that despite the egalitarian ethos often espoused by  hackers, the activity is actually characterized by a “frontier masculinity”  and a “Wild West brand of masculinity.”54 Jordan presented a similar idea:  An un-thought masculinity runs through cracking, ranging from a sep- arate  spheres  notion  that  hacking  reflects  the  natural  world  in  which       T H E   H A C K E R    133  women are interested in birthing and building whereas men are interested  in exploring and conquering, to a misogynistic streak which pursues and  persecutes women.55  Other commentators have also noted factors such as the socially isolat- ing nature of hacking as being more suited to men than women.56 The  concept  of  frontier  masculinity—emerging  from  the  work  of  sociologist  R. W. Connell and characterized by notions of the wilderness, individu- alism,  ingenuity,  and  strength57—combined  with  notions  of  the  “Wild  West,” works to frame hacking as a very specific kind of masculine activ- ity. Masculinity defined by individualism and notions of the frontier are  illustrated in a range of screen examples. In The Fifth Estate, Anke  Ali- cia Vikander —the girlfriend of the hacker Daniel  Daniel Brühl —was  tired of being neglected by him in favor of his hacking. In one scene, after   Daniel arrived home late for dinner, Anke asked him, “Do you even remem- ber the last time we had sex?” Their argument was soon interrupted by  Daniel’s hacker colleague, Julian  Benedict Cumberbatch , which led Anke  to abruptly leave the apartment. Daniel was upset but Julian explained  to him that hacking and private lives are incompatible: “I have a son in  Melbourne, you know. He turns nineteen next week. Haven’t seen him  in a year. It takes two things to change the world. You’d be surprised how  many people have good ideas, but commitment, true commitment, that’s  the hard one. It requires sacrifice.” The same themes are even more pro- nounced in Underground. In one scene it is very late at night and Julian was  at his computer and his teenage girlfriend Electra  Laura Wheelwright — the mother of their new baby—watched him from the doorway:  Julian:   Electra:  Julian:  Electra:    These numbers, they’re coordinates. See, Eskan, Saudi Arabia, and  there’s another and that is Indilik in Turkey. It’s the middle of the night. So? They’re building military bases.  How about Thornbury, Melbourne? Got the coordinates to that?  That’s where your child and his mother live. Fuck, Julian.  Whereas Julian is perceived as neglecting his responsibilities as a father  in pursuit of the unknown, Electra is presented as, quite literally, inter- ested in birthing and building; she, like Anke in The Fifth Estate, works  to spotlight not only the male nature of hacking but the specific kind of  masculinity it embodies.  In Takedown, Karen commented to Kevin: “I’m just not sure what, you  know, hackers breaking into the DMV or whatever, has to do with the    134   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  first amendment.” Karen is presented as a typical female who doesn’t see  the point of climbing a mountain just because it is there or hacking into  the Department of Motor Vehicles simply for the challenge; male hackers  in film and television, however, are routinely presented as driven by the  idea of being the first. In Underground, the hackers have a list of targets  that they challenge themselves to hack: They aren’t stealing or destroying,  they are just motivated by the challenge of access and of being the first. In  the “Virus” episode of Law & Order, an FBI agent identified that hackers  typically “break into a system just to show that it can be done, kind of like  a space age king of the mountain.” Another suggested that “it was a game  with these hackers, like climbing K2: because it’s there.” In Taylor’s study  he alludes to some “hardware” differences when comparing the interests  of men and women—be they socially constructed or biological—in turn  explaining why men hack and women generally don’t: “How come you  don’t see women working for hours on puzzles like the Rubik’s cube? How  come you don’t see women sitting in front of a Nintendo game for days.”58  The Fifth Estate and Underground illustrate well the idea that women have  different priorities than men: They prioritize intimacy and relationships,  for example, whereas men are interested in being pioneers.  While for the purposes of this chapter the gender breakdown of hackers  and the explanations for such a situation are not particularly relevant, cer- tainly on screen the notion of hacking being a male activity is advanced,  and, as addressed later in this section, more specifically, it is understood as  being shaped by the male interest in power.  Discussed  earlier  were  Adam  and  Jordan’s  comments  about  hacking  reflecting a certain kind of frontier and un-thought masculinity. In screen  narratives there is often more than just exploration, there is conquering,  power. In his seminal text Masculinities, Connell discussed the centricity  of power to definitions of masculinity:  Gay theory and feminist theory share a perception of mainstream mas- culinity as being  in the advanced capitalist countries at least  fundamen- tally linked to power, organized for domination, and resistant to change  because of power relations. In some formulations, masculinity is virtually  equated with the exercise of power in its most naked forms.59  In Taylor and Jordan’s work on hacking they similarly identified that  the  masculinity  enacted  through  it  is  “regressive”  and  marked  by  “an  exaggerated  concern  to  define  itself  through  competition,  mastery  and  domination.  It  is  over  both  machines  and  other  humans  that  hackers       T H E   H A C K E R    135  seek domination but it is always through technologies that domination is  established.”60 The authors noted that such domination is exerted through  “the demonstration of their skills seeking a reason, any reason, to launch  an assault.”61 On screen hacking as a demonstration of a very specific kind  of masculinity—manifested in an assertion of dominance and power—is  easily detected.  Power  In  the  biopic  Pirates  of  Silicon Valley   1999 ,  shortly  after  discover- ing that he could hack his way into free long-distance calling, Steve Jobs   Noah Wylie  pronounced:  I’ve figured it out, man. I know what it’s all about. You know what it’s  about? It’s about power . . . It’s like those weird countries, man, where the  army guys overthrow the president. The first thing that they take over are  the ways people communicate: radio, TV, newspapers . . . Information is  power.  In  the  “Canary”  episode  of  NCIS,  when  the  world’s  second  most- wanted cyberterrorist, Ajay Khan  Vik Sahay , was apprehended, one of  the investigators, Anthony  Michael Weatherly , said to Khan, “I don’t  get you. You seem like a normal guy. Why do you risk your life hacking  for a terrorist? It’s not like you’re radical or religious. It’s not the 72 vir- gins. Why do you do what you do?” To which Ajay responded, “There are  two reasons that are far more base. A steady pay check. Power. The feel- ing that you’ve . . . conquered something. Like Caesar.” These two scenes  explicitly verbalize the idea of power being a lure for male hackers on  screen. Although in Pirates of Silicon Valley and NCIS the idea is spoken  aloud, in most examples the competition, conquering, and domination  motives are depicted more subtly.  In the “Virus” episode of Law & Order, hacking was presented as being  motivated by a kind of “king of the mountain” mentality and centered on  the appeal of conquering. This same idea is alluded to in numerous other  scenes. In the thriller NetForce  1999 , Toni  Joanna Going  mentioned,  “the only notoriety these anonymous hackers get is bragging rights.” In the  “Virus” episode of Law & Order a demonstration of hacker bragging was  alluded to when a police IT analyst identified that “hackers like to sign  their work,” something detectable in messages hidden within code. This  same “signature” idea was referenced in the pilot of Mr. Robot—as Elliot  remarked, “They must have left a mark or something. Every hacker loves    136   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  attention”—as well as in the “Friending Emily” episode of Law & Order:  Special Victims Unit, “The Black Queen” episode of Criminal Minds and  also in the “Body of Evidence” episode of New Tricks.  An extension of signing one’s work is hacking functioning as an exten- sion of ego. As discussed in Chapter 1, netgeeks often speak in a language  that works to convey their difference from those around them. Hackers  are sometimes presented as speaking similarly, not merely as proof that  they are different or weird but more specifically to convey that they are  superior.  In  Luftslottet  som  sprängdes   The  Girl Who  Kicked  the  Hornets’  Nest , for example, the hacker Plague  Tomas Köhler  made the comment,  “Nothing’s impossible for me, Wasp,” in reference to his hacking ability.  In Swordfish, Stanley made the same boast: “Nothing’s impossible.” In the  heist film The Score  2001 , the hacker Steven  Jamie Harold  proudly  remarked to his employer, “Dude, give me a Kaypro 64 and a live dial  tone and I can do anything.” In a scene from The Core, when Dr. Zimsky   Stanley Tucci  questioned the hacker, Rat’s, abilities, Rat responded: “We  [hackers] multitask like you breathe. I couldn’t think as slow as you if I  tried.” Bobby  Devin Ratray  in the sci-fi film Surrogates  2009  alludes to  a similar egotism in his comments about hacking the surrogates: “Touch  of a button I can tap into anyone’s feed. It’s like being inside God’s head.”  God was also mentioned in Hackers in a conversation between the hack- ers Phreak  Renoly Santiago , Joey  Jesse Bradford , and Cereal  Matthew  Lillard  about passwords:  Phreak:  What are the three most common used passwords? Joey:  Cereal:   Love, secret, and sex. But not in that order necessarily, right?  Don’t  forget  “God.”  System  operators  love  to  use  God.  It’s  that  whole male ego thing.  Even the schoolgirl hacker, Erica  Julia Stiles , exhibited some of this  hacker arrogance in the “Who Is Mad Max—Part 1” episode of Ghost- writer when she asked a classmate, “Can you jam with the console cow- boys in cyberspace? . . . I didn’t think so.”  In  each  of  these  examples,  through  their  dialogue  hackers  present  themselves as uniquely masterful. Another way such themes are apparent  is via the male battle scene: something that once would have been carried  out in war or on the sporting oval but in a computer-themed narrative  plays out online. In an early scene from Underground, a teenage Julian  speaks on the phone with his similarly aged friend, Prime Suspect  Callan  McAuliffe , initiating such a battle:      T H E   H A C K E R    137  Julian:  Prime Suspect:  Julian:   Prime Suspect:  Julian:   I bet I could hack that bank. It’s a race then.  If  I  win  I  want  your  signed  first  edition  of  Asimov’s  Foundation. If I win I want your [hacker] bible. Okay, you’re on.  A  similar  “old  fashioned  hack-off”  transpired  in  the  “Chuck  versus  the Hack Off” episode of the action-comedy series Chuck  2007–2012   when the title character  Zachary Levi  battled against Freddie  Freddie  Wong .  In  these  scenes,  masculinity  is  exhibited  through  a  who-can- hack-the-fastest contest.62 Ego is also portrayed via a kind of peacock- ing. In Underground, for example, Julian hacks into the electricity grid to  blackout a suburb to impress his girlfriend Electra. Hacking-to-impress  similarly transpired in the “Ivan  No. 88 ” episode of The Blacklist: The  teenager Harrison  Will Denton  engaged in a series of hacks to show-off  to his classmate Abby  Quin Shephard . This theme is also detected in the  “Eyes In” episode of the Canadian police-drama Flashpoint: Stuart  Kris  Lemche  was a tutor in love with his pupil Rebecca  Meaghan Rath . He  hacked into her computer to spy on her, collated information about her  boyfriend, and then used the ill-gotten surveillance data to try and get  her boyfriend in trouble with the police. This theme was also a compo- nent of the dynamic between Connor  Jack Falahee  and Oliver  Conrad  Ricamora  in the first season of How to Get Away with Murder  2014– :  Oliver was hacking as a favor for Connor as part of their unorthodox  courtship.  Power becomes a theme in hacking narratives when it is an attempt to  reassert masculinity that has been somehow diminished. In Chapter 2,  I discussed the notion of computers working to emasculate male char- acters on screen. Equally, in Chapters 2 and 3, I noted that neckbeards  and cyberbullies may participate in such acts to assert themselves—their  gender—in a medium that utilizes their particular strengths. Such themes  also  have  relevance  to  hacker  portrayals.  In  Live  Free  or  Die  Hard,  for  example,  Thomas’s   Timothy  Olyphant   cyberterrorism  was  motivated  by  his  emasculation  during  his  employment  with  the  CIA  where  his  work was disregarded and ultimately dismissed. In the same film these  themes also underpin the hacking work of Frederick “Warlock” Kaludis   Kevin Smith  who hacked from the basement of his overbearing mother’s  home:  Hacking  was  how  he  reasserted  control  and  esteem  in  a  world  where he had little. The same ideas were apparent in The Score: Steven     138   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  also hacked from his own overbearing mother’s basement; hacking was  the realm in which he could be masterful. The Score, in fact, offered an  additional emasculated character in Sapperstein  Richard Waugh , a man  who sold the protagonist-thieves a series of computer codes. When Jack   Edward Norton  handed Sapperstein the bag of cash during the transac- tion in the park, Jack instructed him not to count the cash in public:  Jack:  Sapperstein:  Hey, man, don’t give me orders. I get orders all day, okay?  No, don’t take that out, don’t take that out.  Like Peter  Ron Livingston  and his hacking team in Office Space, Sap- perstein was betraying a company who had emasculated him. In Office  Space,  the  men  who  hacked  into  their  employer’s  computer  system  to  embezzle money had been treated poorly by management throughout the  narrative: Hacking was their way to seek revenge and regain their self- esteem. A variant on this idea transpired in Takedown. In one scene the  hacker Kevin phoned the cybersecurity consultant, Tsutomu Shimomura   Russell Wong , who quickly dismissed him; Shimomura said, “If you’re  going to try to con someone the least you can do is get your story straight,  is that so hard? I mean, how lame are you?” and then hung up. Kevin was so  infuriated that he began bashing into the payphone. “He said I was lame!”  Kevin lamented, before seeking revenge and hacking Shimomura’s com- puter. A similar revenge hack occurred in the “Virus” episode of Law &   Order: Johnny  Stivi Paskoski  took revenge against the malpractice of his  father’s doctor by hacking into the clinic’s computer system and releasing  a virus: The medical and legal system had made Johnny feel powerless and  hacking was his attempt at revenge and power reclamation. These scenes  each illustrate the “regressive” masculinity ideas that theorists like Taylor  and Jordan discussed whereby men reassert masculinity through a display  of skills and an exertion of power.  One explanation for the depiction of hackers as power hungry men  likely centers on reality: A theme repeated in the literature is that hacking  facilitates the expression of a certain kind of masculinity. There are, how- ever, other possible explanations. Discussed throughout this chapter is the  idea that hacking is invariably boring to watch. By presenting the hackers  as egotists and power mongers, the character becomes more interesting  than a mere netgeek and is framed as a worthy protagonist or antagonist.  While not an archetype discussed at length in this book, computer com- pany bosses are also invariably presented as egotists and power mongers,  elevating their screen-worthiness from a netgeek CEO to some kind of       T H E   H A C K E R    139  megalomaniac, an idea apparent in a variety of screen examples including  Antitrust, Ex Machina, August  2008 , Steve Jobs  2015 , and the “Genera- tion of Vipers” episode of the British series Lewis  2007– .  Just as masculinity and power are common characteristics associated   with hacker presentations in film and television, so too is youth.  Youth  WarGames centered on a teenager, David  Matthew Broderick , whose  gameplay led to hacks which brought the world to the brink of nuclear  war. In Schulte’s discussion of the Internet in pop culture, she identified  that WarGames helped to establish the stereotype of the young computer  hacker:  In the early 1980s popular culture and news media increasingly repre- sented home computer users, video game players, hackers, and computer  network users as being the same, producing the cultural trope of the “teen- aged user.” This user was a teenaged video-gamer and a member of a new,  computer-literate generation; in this trope, hacking itself was imagined as  a kind of video game and therefore innocent, not malicious.63  Although  the  hacking  in  WarGames  led  to  some  dramatic  and  unforeseen circumstances, in fact, much screen hacking is of the lower- level  college-prank  variety,  whereby  hacking  appears  to  be,  as  Schulte  alluded, an extension of computer gaming. In the “Cyber Threat” episode  of  NCIS:  Los  Angeles   2009– ,  the  idea  of  hacking  as  “play”  was  actu- ally verbalized by the schoolboy hacker, Shawn  Nathan Gamble , who  tried  to  downplay  his  lawbreaking:  “I  was  just  hacking  around.”  As  in  WarGames, grade changing—something, of course, disproportionately of  interest to young people—transpires in numerous examples as perhaps the  most common kind of screen hack. Taking inspiration from WarGames,  Adam  Sean Giambrone  in the “Shall We Play a Game?” episode of the  1980s-themed sitcom The Goldbergs  2013–  attempted to hack into his  school’s grades database. In the “Canary” episode of NCIS, Timothy men- tioned that the recently apprehended cyberterrorist, Ajay, had previously  “hacked  the  school  databases  freshman  year.”  Grade  hacking  was  also  part of the storylines in the “Who Is Max Mouse?” episodes of Ghost- writer, the “Woolly Bullies” episode of 21 Jump Street  1987–1991 , the  “Destiny Rides Again” episode of Beverly Hills, 90210  1990–2000 , the  “Homer Goes to College” episode of  The  Simpsons  1989– , the afore- mentioned “Cyber Threat” episode of NCIS: Los Angeles, the “Like Father    140   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Like Son” episode of the British drama Waterloo Road  2006– , the “Sense- less Prom Death” episode of the Canadian series jPod  2008 , the “Code- name: Grades” episode of the British sitcom Spy  2011–2012 , and the  drama Middle Men  2009 . In the comedy Ferris Bueller’s Day Off  1986 ,   Ferris  Matthew Broderick  hacked into the school computer to delete  his absences from his record. In the “Akanahe” episode of Hawaii Five-O,  Ian  Nick Jonas  had hacked into his university’s system to access final  exam papers; the same thing happened in the “Virus” episode of Law &   Order.  In  Pirates  of  Silicon  Valley,  Bill  Gates   Anthony  Michael  Hall   described how he had “rigged” the computers so he would be put in the  same class with all the “best girls.” In the “Lines of Excellence” episode  of mystery-drama Murder, She Wrote  1984–1996 , the college student,  Michael  David Ciminello , had hacked into the school’s database to get  admittance to the protagonist, Jessica’s  Angela Lansbury , writing class.  In the thriller The Boy Next Door  2015 , the obsessed high school student,  Noah  Ryan Guzman , hacked into the teacher, Claire’s  Jennifer Lopez ,  e-mail account to send a request to get transferred into her class. In the  biopic  The  Social  Network   2010 ,  Mark  Zuckerberg   Jesse  Eisenberg   hacked into the university computer system to obtain photos for his new  “FaceMash” website  a precursor to Facebook . An attempt to hack into  a library system to erase a fine transpired in the Australian film Love and  Other Catastrophes  1997 . Erasing student debt was also a theme in “The  Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak” episode of Arrow. In the “Like a Virgin”  episode of Veronica Mars  2004–2007 , Cindy “Mac” Mackenzie  Tina  Majorino  hacked the results of her fellow students’ online purity test.  On the most obvious level, young hacker portrayals reflect reality: as  criminologist Michael Bachmann identified most hackers are teenagers.64  While  cybersecurity  specialists  Tom  Parker,  Marcus  Sachs,  Eric  Shaw,  and Ed Stroz, in fact, problematize hacker age—noting that actually dis- covering the age of those involved in illegal activity is always difficult— certainly most hackers likely got their start as teenagers.65 This latter idea  is well illustrated in Underground: While we know Assange grows up to  be one of the world’s best-known adult hackers, Underground centered on  the hacking of his youth.  Aside from Janice’s  Danielle McGovern  hacking in Ghostwriter and  Mac’s hacking in Veronica Mars, each of the examples discussed in this  section involved men hacking  in line with ideas discussed earlier  and,  most relevantly, was presented as the behavior of young people. First, tech- nology has a long history of being adopted most quickly by the young66  and, thus, it stands to reason that the screen will reflect this. Equally, in       T H E   H A C K E R    141  narratives that aim to target a youth audience, it is, of course, no surprise  to  see  youth  protagonists.  Another  explanation  centers  on  rule  break- ing. The caricature of the youthful troublemaker, scallywag, and scamp is  both a gendered and a youth portrayal: While, of course, there are female  examples, the naughty schoolboy is the more common caricature. While  such troublemaking can take a variety of forms, practical jokes and pranks  are common outlets. Linguists Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker in their  discussion of youth, gender, and pranking identified that “the social world  of boys is one of posturing and counterposturing”67 and that “practical  jokes, challenges, put-downs, insults, and other forms of verbal aggression  are a . . . feature of men’s speech.”68 Similarly, such behavior is discussed  in psychologists Eva Magnusson and Jeanne Marecek’s work as being part  of the socializing of young men.69 While Janice in Ghostwriter and Mac  in Veronica Mars do hack, neither fulfill the prankster archetype: Janice, in  fact, is mousy and sullen and Mac’s character had scarcely been developed  when she first hacked in Veronica Mars. The boys on the other hand, more  readily fit the stereotype: It is more commonly expected of their gender to  be troublemakers and for some characters—Ferris in Ferris Bueller’s Day  Off being the classic example—hacking is just an extension of their other  naughty behavior.  Another explanation for the youth bias centers on the most famous  early  portrayals  of  networked  computer  hacking—WarGames  and  Hackers—which have shaped the hacker in the popular imaginary; while  Schulte alluded to this in her work, political scientist Debora Halbert, for  example, specifically spotlighted the mythology of the teenage bedroom  hacker created by WarGames.70 While WarGames and Hackers presented  this trope, the teenaged—or college-aged student—bedroom hacker was  also identifiable in Underground as well as many of the hacking narratives  discussed thus far in this chapter—e.g., 23, Antitrust, Pirates of Silicon  Valley, Beverly Hills 90210, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Hawaii Five-O, The  Boy Next Door, The Social Network, Law & Order, The Blacklist, and Love  and Other Catastrophes—where boys honed their hacking skills in their  bedrooms.  Just as WarGames has helped shape the popular image of the hacker— as well as arguably inspiring real-life copycats71—undoubtedly the film  equally influenced filmmakers, thus at least partly explaining the youth  skew. Another explanation for the youth bias was articulated by computer  programmer Paul Graham in his book Hackers and Painters and centered  on sociology and the amount of idle time that teenagers have in the “com- puter age”:   142   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial  times they were all apprentices of one sort or another, whether in shops or  on farms or even on warships. They weren’t left to create their own societ- ies. They were junior members of adult societies . . . Now adults have no  immediate use for teenagers.72  Following Graham’s argument, hacking becomes just another manifes- tation of the postindustrial phenomenon of “youth” as a distinct period  in life from which a variety of subcultures have their origins, fuelled by  idle time.  Discussed throughout this chapter are the counterculture characteristics  of hackers: Teenagers, known for their often antiauthoritarian attitudes,  are a classic example of an age group that has the time and motivation  to defy authority: Hacking is a perfect way to portray youthful defiance  using modern technology. As an FBI analyst commented in the “Virus”  episode of Law & Order, hackers are “misfit teenagers for the most part.”  While this was a comment typical for a 1993 television episode whereby  networked computing was still considered a niche activity, equally, the  idea of hackers—like many of the Internet archetypes—being social out- casts remains consistent on screen, even decades on.  Despite the fact that hackers are often assumed to be young white boys  hacking from their messy bedrooms—and while this archetype certainly  has a widespread presence on screen as discussed—it should be noted that  the age of hackers in real life is, as Parker, Sachs, Shaw, and Stroz note,  often debated. Technology theorists Bernadette Schell, John Dodge, and  Steve Moutsatsos, for example, argue that 27 is the average hacker age.73  In  Gordon’s  study,  he  similarly  identified  that  only  35  percent  of  the  hackers in the hacking-themed films he analyzed were under 25 while the  majority—62 percent—were actually between 25 and 50.74 While Gor- don makes an interesting point, it is also worth identifying a major short- coming of his findings. Gordon determined age by sourcing how old the  actor at the time of the film or television show’s production. Mentioned  earlier was the “Destiny Rides Again” episode of Beverly Hills, 90210. The  main character in the hacking storyline, Steve, was in his senior year of  high school, therefore making him in his late teens. That episode, how- ever, first screened in November 1992; the actor playing Steve, Ian Zier- ing, was 28 years old at the time. The character therefore was still a teen  hacker  even  if  portrayed  by  an  older  actor  thus  getting  categorized  by  Gordon as falling into the 25–50 age cohort.  This is, of course, in line  with older actors—particularly in youth-centered media—often playing  teen characters .75      T H E   H A C K E R    143  While  there  is  indeed  a  male  bias  in  hacker  portrayals  on  screen,  a  surprising number of female portrayals exist, a situation that needs closer  examination.  Ladies of the Hack  In a scene from the sci-fi film The Matrix  1999 , the follow exchange  transpires between Neo  Keanu Reeves  and Trinity  Carrie-Anne Moss :  Trinity:  My name’s Trinity. Neo:  The Trinity? Who cracked the IRS d-base? Trinity:  That was a long time ago. Neo:  Trinity:  What? Neo:  Trinity:  Most guys do.  I just thought . . . you were a guy.  Jesus . . .  In this scene, while the male stereotype is acknowledged, Trinity—like  a surprisingly large number of female hackers on screen—breaks it too.  While men hack far more commonly in film and television than women   Gordon contends that women only make up 10 percent of the hack- ers on screen ,76 it is worth noting that the screen, in fact, offers many  more female hackers than might be expected given their low numbers off  screen. Kate  Angelina Jolie  in Hackers was identified by Gordon as the  very first such portrayal;77 others give this honor to female hackers in the  television series Whiz Kids  1983–1984  and Terry  Whoopi Goldberg   in Jumpin’ Jack Flash  1986 .78 Kate in Hackers, nevertheless, likely exists  as the first Web–era example on screen. Thus far I have mentioned teen  female hackers in Ghostwriter, Jurassic Park, Veronica Mars, and Hackers,  as well as adult ones in Criminal Minds and Arrow, along with Angela in  The Net, Hope in The Net 2.0, Trinity in The Matrix, Lisbeth in the Dragon  Tattoo films, Willow in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Chloe in Smallville.  To this list we can add Lee  Vanessa Williams  in the drama Eraser  1996 ,  Barbara  Dina Meyer  in the superhero series Birds of Prey  2002–2003 ,  Nikita  Maggie Q  in the action series Nikita  2010–2013 , Chloe  Mary  Lynn Rajskub  in the drama series 24  2001–2010 , Charlie  Felicia Day   in Supernatural, and Mai Linh  Maggie Q  in Live Free or Die Hard. While  much can be said about these characters—notably that invariably such  women are figures of multiple transgressions other than their criminality   addressed later in this chapter —nonetheless, they are also illustrate that  portrayals of female hackers are relatively easy to find. This fact is inter- esting because, as discussed earlier, the paucity of real-life female hackers    144   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  is well documented and thus the screen presents a situation that appears  not to reflect the actual gendered reality of hacking. While this may be  unsurprising since, as noted, hacking representations generally bear little  semblance  to  real  life  anyway,  the  idea  of  so  many  female  hackers  on  screen nevertheless seems peculiar. Gordon spotlighted that there were far  more female hackers portrayed on television compared to in film. One  explanation he suggested: “I’m presuming that’s because men tend to do  the action bits on television.”79 While Gordon’s comment was specifically  related to disparities between film and television, in fact, it also provides  a hint to an explanation for the disproportionate number of female hack- ers on screen more generally. Noted earlier was research conducted by  Benyahia and Parmiter about hackers, notably female hackers, often being  portrayed as sidekicks. This idea, in conjunction with the extensively dis- cussed idea of women on screen being used as decoration,80 highlights  that  such  representations  may  be  less  progressive  than  they  may  first  appear: The female characters are, in fact, still being relegated to backseat,  sidekick, and helper roles albeit with modern, tech-oriented duties. That  said, apparent in some narratives such as The Net, the Net 2.0, and the  Dragon Tattoo films, the female hacker actually is the protagonist, so the  sidekick analysis certainly isn’t universally applicable. Another explana- tion, in line with some of the ideas expressed in Chapter 2, is female hack- ers on screen functioning as a feminizing influence. Certainly in ensemble  films like Hackers, Sneakers and Live Free or Die Hard—where the casts  were  almost  entirely  male—the  presence  of  a  sexy  female  adds  an  ele- ment of sexual tension that would not have been apparent if the cast was  exclusively male. This idea was actually verbalized in an episode of the sit- com Silicon Valley  2014– , a series centered on a group of male program- mers. In the “Third Party Insourcing” episode, Tara  Milana Vayntrub ,  the girlfriend of one of the programmers, Gilfoyle  Martin Starr , visited  her boyfriend’s all-male residence. Another programmer, Dinesh  Kumail  Nanjiani , commented, “It’s weird having a girl in the house, it’s a very  strange energy.” Female hackers in such narratives often provide a femi- nizing influence on the men but also provide female visual content for an  audience who is well known to prefer looking at women.81  As discussed earlier in this chapter in the context of crime, and hinted  at in this section, the figure of the female hacker on screen is invariably  one of transgression. The next section explores this idea in greater detail  examining hackers as transgressing social, political, financial, sexual, and  even dietary norms.      T H E   H A C K E R    145  The Socially Transgressive Hacker  In this section the idea of hackers living differently is examined. While  later sections explore diet, clothing, and sex, this section focuses specifi- cally on deviant households.  Gender and Transgression  In  Owen, Vande  Berg,  and  Stein’s  discussion  of  female  hackers,  the  authors  explored  the  idea  of  double  transgression:  “One  of  the  most  intriguing aspects of portrayals of women as hackers is that they consti- tute double transgressions: The hacker itself is a transgressive role, and  compounding the transgression is the female as hacker.”82 To illustrate the  how of these double transgressions, the authors contrasted female hackers  with male hackers, identifying that:  male computer designers and hackers may affirm their maleness by their  technological obsessions. For women the opposite is true: their very iden- tity as conventionally defined women is challenged by their focused inter- est, knowledge and skill with computers.83  Discussed earlier in the context of The Fifth Estate and Underground  were scenes where girlfriends were annoyed at the obsessive commitment  of  their  boyfriends  to  hacking.  Those  female  characters  each  possessed  stereotypical feminine qualities such as a concern with domesticity and  prioritization of relationships. While the female hacker on screen is, by  nature,  transgressive  due  to  her  criminality,  such  characters—perhaps  explicable because they are somewhat rare characters anyhow and thus  are inherently “unique”—are also transgressive because they contravene  a variety of other gender norms by electing to hack. In literary scholar  Austin Booth’s discussion of cyberfiction, for example, she discussed the  presence of female hackers in literature, identifying that such characters  invariably “exist on the margins of respectability.”84 The idea of transgres- sion and marginality is similarly identifiable in hacker representations on  screen. In The Net, for example, Angela lives alone, telecommuting, and  conducting  all  of  her  social  interactions  online.  She  eats  by  herself,  in  front  of  her  computer,  and  declines  social  invitations.  In  The  Net  2.0,  Hope elects to travel alone to Turkey for hacking work rather than staying  in the United States with her boyfriend despite his plea. In the pilot of  VR.5 an exchange between Sidney  Lori Singer  and her colleague Scott    146   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S   Adam Baldwin  highlights that she, too, is a female flying untypically  solo:  So how long did you end up staying here last night? Just a couple of hours.  Scott:  Sidney:  Scott:  Don’t you feel kind of lonely up here? Sidney:  No, not really. Scott:    Yeah, that’s right. No boyfriend or husband to go home to. All alone  in the big city.  Sidney:  Yep, pretty much.  When Sidney returned home after work, similar to Angela in The Net,  her social contact was digital: When she walked in the door, Sidney was  literally greeted by her computer; she then logged on to play a virtual real- ity game. In the Dragon Tattoo films, Lisbeth also lives unconventionally.  While her bisexuality is addressed later in the chapter, Lisbeth is with- out a formal partner or an ordinary home life. In these examples, female  characters live like male hackers: They are complying with the stereotype  that suggests that hacking requires sacrifice and is all consuming—that  to commit to hacking a person needs to become machinelike  Chapter 1   and to devote oneself to the “rational” world of technology rather than  the “vagaries” of humanity.  It is, of course, worth suggesting that those  uninterested in domesticity might pursue something like hacking because  it better suits their temperament.   Lifestyle and Transgression  The  idea  of  a  hacker—more  specifically  a  hacktivist—as  a  figure  of  transgression is hardly surprising: The act of hacking is, of course, legally  and politically subversive. While the idea of hackers forming their own  counterculture85 and subcultures86 has been well-documented, on screen  this  is  often  conveyed  through  characters  physically  living  nontypi- cally: The all alone in the big city female characters discussed earlier are  examples of this. While a solo male hacker is a fairly standard depiction  akin  to  many  of  the  netgeek   Chapter  1   and  neckbeard   Chapter  2   characters, they often live in ways even more unique. In Mr. Robot for  example, it is revealed in the pilot that Elliot is a daily user of morphine.  In Underground, even before going on the run as a hacker, Julian grew  up uncharacteristically: His family were shown to have spent his early  years on the run from his mother’s cult-leader ex-partner, a past that was  also alluded to in The Fifth Estate. More generally, Julian’s family lived a       T H E   H A C K E R    147  counterculture lifestyle, bucking against anything perceived as “normal.”  In Underground, in his late teens Julian and girlfriend Electra resided in  a communal squatters’ residence and then relocated to a squat on their  own; in The Fifth Estate an adult Julian was also portrayed as living a  nomadic lifestyle and, at one point, stayed in a squatters’ residence in  Berlin.  In  the  “Akanahe”  episode  of  Hawaii  Five-O,  Ian  was  a  hacker  who was revealed to have also grown up uncharacteristically; as Detective  Kelly  Daniel Dae Kim  explained, “This kid has been living on his own  since he was eighteen years old. His parents are both deceased.” Whereas  outlaws and outsiders often live unconventional lifestyles, arguably this  is something particularly relevant to the hacker: The nature of modern  hacking means that the activity is now able to be conducted anywhere  and, notably, while on the move, if not also—as discussed earlier—while  on the run.  A variant on the lifestyle-transgressive hacker are those who are depicted  as comparatively poor er . This topic was in fact discussed in Timothy  Shary’s work on geeks and nerds in pop culture where he identified a class  undercurrent to such portrayals:  Nerds  tend  to  come  from  poorer  class  backgrounds  than  their  other  school counterparts . . . The reasoning behind this characteristic is not  clear, although some explanation may lie in nerds’ assumed lack of fashion  sense, which can result from impoverished familial conditions.87  A hacker’s status as an outsider can thus be bolstered by his or her eco- nomic status. While this class idea is relevant to the depiction of Julian  in both Underground and The Fifth Estate, it is also relevant for Mac in  Veronica Mars. Mac was introduced to the series in the “Like a Virgin”  episode where she explicitly mentioned her lack of resources—“think I  have  ten  dollars  to  spare? You’ve  seen  my  car,  right?”—a  situation  she  is shown to attempt to improve by selling the hacked purity test results  to her classmates. This situation is interesting because while hackers like  Julian in Underground and The Fifth Estate or Kevin in Takedown each  articulated their disinclination to personally profit from their hacking— in turn condemning themselves to a lower class—this was not apparently  a concern for Mac, perhaps because her circumstances were considered  more dire, particularly so in the hostile world of high school.  While hackers are transgressive because they are commonly conceived  as criminals, on screen they often harbor other kinds of lifestyle irregulari- ties too. One obvious transgression centers on politics.   148   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The Politically Transgressive Hacker  Most literature on hacking identifies that by their very nature, hack- ers  are  politically  transgressive.  For  black-hat  hackers,  such  characters  are antiauthoritarian simply because their hacking-for-profit necessitates  lawbreaking. For white-hat and gray-hat characters, counterculture, anti- establishment, and information freedom values are also made clear. Cer- tainly for Charlie in Supernatural, she makes her leanings transparent in  “The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo” episode: “Historically,  I’ve had this problem with authority,” she explains. For gray-hat and hack- tivist characters, while still criminals, they are driven not by profit but  by politics: by exposing corruption or criminality. In Antitrust, a theme  throughout the film is the idea of freeware and hacker opposition to mul- tinational software companies’ profit and control  the NURV company  in the film, for example, has been likened to Microsoft .88 In “The Secret  Origin of Felicity Smoak” episode of the superhero series Arrow, Felicity’s  hacktivist boyfriend Nolan  Gerard Funk  hacked in order to delete stu- dent debt. In “The Black Queen” episode of Criminal Minds, Penelope’s  hacktivist past was shown when she was caught hacking into a cosmetics  company that tested on animals. In 23, hacking  at least initially  cen- tered on the democratization of information: the protagonist, Karl, at one  point rationalized, “U.S. satellites can predict famine for up to 6 months.  People die without access to that information.” In Underground, and even  more so in The Fifth Estate, the idea of hacking to expose political secrets  was explored: in The Fifth Estate, Julian spoke of hacktivism leading to  “a whole new form of social justice,” and identified his ethos as, “When  new information comes to light, it can bring about great change.” Such  hacking—notably centered on the exposure of war crimes—was similarly  a central theme in the third season of the drama The Newsroom  2012– 2014 . While hacking to embezzle funds for personal profit is a black-hat  portrayal, hacking to redirect funds for social change is more akin to the  work of gray-hats. In “The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo”  episode of Supernatural, for example, Charlie hacked to make subversive  political donations: In one scene she redirected funds from a conservative  political party to an animal rights organization. The same thing happened  in Sneakers: In one hack the Republican Party “donated” money to the  Black Panthers and the Negro College Fund. In each of these examples,  hacking is a demonstration of antiestablishment politics and a form of  political activism. While such hacking may not be primarily for personal  profit, it is worth noting that politics isn’t always completely separate from       T H E   H A C K E R    149  other motivations like power and ego. In The Fifth Estate, for example,  while quite clearly harboring a social conscience, Julian was nevertheless  presented as incredibly egotistical; a theme evident in other hacking por- trayals. In the “You Want to End This Once and for All?” episode of the  legal-drama series Damages  2007–2012 , for example, the Assange-like  character, Channing McClaren  Ryan Phillippe , is described by lawyer  Patty  Glenn Close : “He’s arrogant and he’s dangerous.” While in the  examples discussed thus far, the political motives of the hacktivists were  quite clear, it is necessary to note that this isn’t always the case.  One way for the hacktivist to be portrayed as more complex is through  the presentation of their objectives as muddled. In the “Body of Evidence”  episode of New Tricks, Xander  Andy Rush —one of the police depart- ment’s IT experts—alluded to this idea in his explanation of the work of  hackers: “There’s no hierarchy, there’s no stated aims . . . [what they have in  common is] an interest in cracking computer security and a loosely shared  set of social ideals.” Xander’s definition reflects the anarchist aims of hack- ing but also spotlights the idea of “loosely shared” ideals. While just how  “loosely” the ideals are shared in real life might be difficult to ascertain, on  screen, friction around aims actually becomes a way to add much-needed  tension to a hacking narrative. At a tame level this issue was debated in the  “Who Is Max Mouse?” episodes of Ghostwriter when the investigating stu- dents’ had the capability to hack into the school’s grades database but had  to debate whether doing so would be ethical. Similar debates transpired  in Underground: while a young Assange had the ethos that “we only look,”  his hacker colleagues seemingly felt different. The idea of loose objectives  were also a theme in “We Are Everyone” episode of Elementary. The epi- sode centered on Sherlock and Watson’s  Lucy Liu  search for Ezra Klein,  another Assange-like figure. At one point Watson visited the “Kleinfel- tarianism: One Man’s Reflections on a Broken World” website that hosted  Ezra’s manifesto, one that Watson described to Sherlock: “Turns out most  of Ezra’s thoughts on a ‘broken world’ have to do with how he can’t get a  date with his neighbor. That, and a bunch of Ayn Rand quotes.”89 In 23,  Karl’s motives, while initially progressive, became jumbled as he earned  more money and started using drugs. Another way these muddled ideals  are illustrated is via a phreaker subplot  “phreaking” describing hacks that  allow long-distance phone calls without enormous bills . In the “Virus”  episode of Law & Order, the hacker Kenny  Harold Perrineau , for exam- ple, noted that “hackers hate paying phone bills.” While potentially able to  be construed as simply an extension of antiestablishmentarianism and free  communication  objectives—phreaking  can  also  be  interpreted  as  being    150   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  about self-profit. Hacking to avoid paying for phone calls, needless to say,  transpires  in  a  range  of  hacking  themed  narratives  including  The  Core,  Underground, Pirates of Silicon Valley, and Hackers.  While some hacktivists may indeed have hackneyed motives, objectives  may also be depicted this way to demean hacktivists and downplay their  politics: Showing political or criminal adversaries as confused, lacking dis- cipline, or compromised is a standard way that opponents get discredited,  a theme common in presentations of vegetarians.90  One screen portrayal that combines lifestyle and politics is the dietarily   transgressive hacker.  The Dietarily Transgressive Hacker  In Chapter 2, I discussed the strong link between computer users— netgeeks,  neckbeards,  and  hackers—and  junk  food.  While  junk  food  consumption and obesity exist at one end of the dietarily transgressive  spectrum, vegetarianism is positioned at the other end.  In Veronica Mars, Mac the teen hacker, was not only of a lower class  than her peers, but further compounding her transgression she was a veg- etarian: In the “Silence of the Lamb” episode, for example, her mother   Courtney  Gebhart   described  her  as  a  “freakball  vegan.”  In  Criminal  Minds, Penelope is the team’s computer whiz who, while engaged in high- level computer work for the FBI, also, as noted, had a past as a hacker.  While dressing differently from those around her  Chapter 1 , Penelope is  also vegetarian, something she explicitly stated in the “Bully” episode. In  Jurassic Park, Lex  Ariana Richards  is a prepubescent computer whiz with  advanced hacking skills who used them to hack into the park’s security  system to prevent the dinosaurs from escaping. At one point, Lex stated,  “I happen to be a vegetarian.” Although his hacking wasn’t played up in  the biopic Jobs  2013 , Jobs hacked in real life91 and was also a vegetarian;  in Pirates of Silicon Valley Jobs’s fruitarian diet was noted explicitly.  In  my  book  American Taboo:  The  Forbidden Words,  Unspoken  Rules,  Secret Morality of Popular Culture I analyzed the depiction of vegetarians  and vegans in pop culture, including Mac in Veronica Mars:  That vegetarians are apart from mainstream culture is something mirrored  on screen, with most film and television examples portraying vegetarians  as  somehow  different.  The  standard  othering  and  stereotyping—if  not  outright demonizing—of vegetarian characters highlight that not only is  eschewing meat considered unusual, but that it also raises a variety of social  and political issues related to gender, patriotism, health, and intellect.92      T H E   H A C K E R    151  In my discussion I noted that there is great crossover between sexual- ity  and  vegetarianism. Vegetarian  men  on  screen  are  often  assumed  to  be homosexual, and there is a common coupling of vegetarianism and  lesbianism: Part of the explanation lies in the fact that both practices are  often construed as subversive and counterculture. Hacking is a subversive  activity and it is sometimes coupled with counterculture pursuits like veg- etarianism, as well as other acts of transgression like sex.  The Sexually Transgressive Hacker  The  connection  between  hacking,  sexuality,  and  the  counterculture  was alluded to in the mid-1990s in Eric Raymond’s The New Hacker’s  Dictionary:  Hackerdom  easily  tolerates  a  much  wider  range  of  sexual  and  lifestyle  variation than the mainstream culture. It includes a relatively large gay  and  bisexual  contingent.  Hackers  are  somewhat  more  likely  to  live  in  polygynous or polyandrous relationships, practice open marriage, or live  in communes or group houses. In this, as in general appearance, hacker- dom semi-consciously maintains “counterculture” values.93  The links between hacking and alternative sexualities were similarly at  the core of technology journalist Annalee Newitz’s chapter titled “Peace,  Love, Linux”:  At  first  glance,  the  idea  that  free  love  and  free  software  would  come  together as smoothly as so many orgiasts might seem odd, but this com- bination  of  sexual  and  techno-liberation  has  its  roots  in  historical  and  present-day radical movements. Even today, free software hackers aren’t  all that uncommon in the “sex” community, a group that includes people  in open relationships, queers, S M or kinky fetish fans, and anyone else  whose sexual proclivities fall outside the mainstream.94  When people engage in a fringe criminal activity such as hacking, it is  hardly surprising that they also pursue other acts of nonconformity. While  unorthodox household configuration and diet have been discussed thus far,  as Raymond and Newitz highlight, nonvanilla sex can be another way for  a hacker to transgress. In the “The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons  Tattoo” episode of Supernatural, for example, Charlie was introduced as a  hacker who was also a lesbian. In the television series Teen Wolf  2011– ,  Danny  Keahu Kahuanui  is a man with a criminal record for hacking and  who also happens to be homosexual. In  How  to  Get  Away  with  Murder,    152   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  the hacker Oliver is homosexual. In the action series Banshee  2013– , Job   Hoon  Lee   is  a  computer  hacker  who  cross-dresses  and  whose  sexuality  remains ambiguous throughout the series. Lisbeth in the Dragon Tattoo films  was bisexual. While Charlie, Danny, Oliver, and Job haven’t been subjected  to extensive analysis, all aspects of the Lisbeth Salander character have been  widely scrutinized due to the popularity of the books and films and, unsur- prisingly, her sexuality has received extensive attention. Media theorist Maria  San Filippo, for example, discussed Lisbeth in her book on bisexuality:  The matter-of-factness with which Lisbeth’s bisexuality has been received— by  readers,  viewers,  critics,  cultural  commentators,  and  others—strikes  me as, in a word, thrilling. Yet Lisbeth is acceptable to her fans precisely  because she is exceptional—exotic, unrepressed, fearless. Lisbeth has been  embraced by the mainstream, but she herself is not mainstream; her bisex- uality is tolerated and even celebrated precisely because she is so “other.”95  The fusion between bisexuality and hacking was also alluded to by the  inclusion of the real-life bisexual hacker Adrian Lamo in the documentary  We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks  2013  as well as the portrayal of  Lamo in Sky Gilbert’s play Hackerlove  2014 .  For the characters discussed thus far, sexuality is another way for them  to be distinguished from “normal” characters: They are criminally devi- ant, dietarily deviant, sexually deviant, and, as discussed in the next sec- tion, often even look aesthetically different to those around them.  While Lisbeth’s status as a hacker might explain her sexual deviance,  psychologists Robert Young and Lynne McDonald-Smith propose that  this in fact is attributable to her status as a Goth, noting: “a trait repeat- edly  associated  with  Goths,  and  much  exploited  by  the  producers  of  low-budget horror flicks, is their supposed sexual promiscuity and trans- gressive or unconventional  in other words, Kinky  sexuality.”96 Whether  or not the Goth subculture explains Lisbeth’s sexuality, it is certainly a  distinct theme in hacker portrayals. While transgression can be conveyed  through characteristics such as class, diet, and sex, in the visual medium  of  film  and  television  it  is  also  commonly  presented  through  dress:  A  character’s costuming is key in demonstrating transgression.  The Hacker Aesthetic  In research on gender and national costume, the notion of women as  bearers of culture is examined: Historians Helen Sheumaker and Shirley       T H E   H A C K E R    153  Teresa Wajda, for example, note, “Scholars have recognized the role gen- der plays in expressing ethnic, racial, religious or class identities. Women  are the bearers of ethnic identities through conventions of dress.”97 This  idea is relevant to a discussion of the aesthetics of hacking because while  male hackers outnumber female ones on screen, invariably male hack- ers look very ordinary whereas their female counterparts often appear to  be making a distinct statement through their attire: Akin to women in  national costume, the female hacker on screen is more likely to somehow  look like a hacker. A good illustration of this transpires in the television  series NCIS. Both Abby and Timothy are government employees who  conduct research work that sometimes involves hacking. While Timothy  looks like any clean-cut, suit-and-tie wearing office worker, Abby adopts  a Goth-look: dyed jet-black hair, pale skin, red lips, studded collar, and  black  attire.  Abby  makes  an  aesthetic  statement  that  visually  outs  her  as being linked—socially and professionally—to a subculture, Timothy  doesn’t.  In  many  examples,  female  hackers  look  different  from  those  around  them;  in  this  section  hacker  dress  is  examined  as  a  device  for  characters to make statements about counterculture values as well as the  future.  One of the key characteristics of the hacker is that they are acting out- side  of  society:  that—like  the  netgeeks  discussed  in  Chapter  1—their  computer knowledge sets them apart from “normal” people, but more  so, that the covert nature of their activities sets them apart from the law- ful.  On  screen  the  hacker’s  separation  from  society  is  often  conveyed  through clothing. While there certainly isn’t a homogenous look for hack- ers on screen, there are nonetheless themes in female hacker dress worth  examining.  Cybergoth  Before  examining  the  portmanteau  of  cybergoth,  it  is  worth  step- ping  back  and  examining  the  notion  of  bricolage  in  fashion,  some- thing theorist Malcolm Barnard described in his work on fashion and  postmodernism:  bricolage involves the continual recombination of elements . . . Bricolage,  like retro, implies the creation of new meaning from the materials and  styles taken from the past . . . The use of materials and styles from the past  to create new items of fashion and clothing is straightforwardly the world  of the bricoleur.98   154   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  In the seminal cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, mentioned earlier, brico- lage is easily identifiable; something discussed by film theorist Mark Bould:  Neuromancer’s  Molly  is  clearly  cobbled  together  out  of  Wolverine  and  Cyclops from Marvel’s Comics’ X-Men as well as many of the strong and  sexy women with a taste for S&M fetishism found in popular culture,  including SF characters in Fritz Leiber’s “Coming Attraction”  1950 , The  Avengers   1961–9 ,  Eleanor  Arnason’s  “The Warlord  of  Saturn’s  Moon”   1974 , and Joanna Russ’s The Female Man  1975 .99  The cyberpunk film Blade Runner  1982  is an early illustration of this  bricolage whereby a vision of the future is presented as one that borrows  from, and reappropriates, aspects of the past: something illustrated well  by the nods made to 1940s fashion interspliced with techno-garb. While  the idea of a cobbled together aesthetic is identifiable in a variety of screen  examples—for example, both Lisbeth in the Dragon Tattoo films and Trin- ity in The Matrix fuse Goth and BDSM attire—their look is both indica- tive of bricolage and actually part of a look, and subculture, all of its own. While cyberpunk is a term used frequently to describe pop culture—for  example, it is often considered as a distinct genre in film, literature, and  music—in the context of fashion, the term is probably best thought of as an  influence; as cultural theorist Décio Torres Cruz contends, “Cyberpunk has  also influenced music, architecture, urban planning, cyberdelic countercul- ture, fashion and dance.”100 Cybergoth appears a better word to describe the  aesthetic that is apparent in a wide variety of hacker-themed films:  Imagine traveling to the distant future, a time when robots and humans  coexist  and  perhaps  even  extraterrestrials  have  made  an  appearance  or  two on Earth. Once there, you travel into some backstreet club and real- ize that goths have survived the ages and, what’s more, they’ve become  half-robot undead creatures, who still like electronic music! This is sort  of what cybergoth is like . . . The basic cybergoth look combines typical  undead goth attire with futuristic elements, like PVC armbands outfitted  with circuit boards or steel plates, as if the wearer is part machine. Other  popular accessories include industrial goggles, faux military gear, helmets,  and heavy work boots . . . Many cybergoths have been inspired by the  “steampunk” genre of fiction, which envisions worlds in which steam and  coal technology still dominate and are used to fuel fantastic machines . . .  The genre combines romanticized historical fiction . . . with more typical  science fiction themes, such as robots, futuristic military technology, and  space travel.101      T H E   H A C K E R    155  While the cybergoth theme may be construed as just another nod to  transgression, there may also be other explanations for the recurrence of  this theme on screen. In technology journalist Mathias Thurman’s 2001  discussion of the Def Con Internet security convention, he spotlighted  that a high number of participants had a “Goth wardrobe.”102 Camille  Bacon-Smith in her book Science Fiction Culture similarly discussed the  high-level Goth presence at sci-fi conventions and offered Neuromancer as  an explanation: “Gibson’s cyberpunk universe reflects the dark outlook of  goths, and features hackers in leather.”103  Cybergoth is a kind of bricolage in that it takes influence from a variety  of themes—cyberpunk, steampunk, gothic culture, BDSM—and com- bines it to present a vision of the future.  The Future  An obvious cinematic clue that a narrative is set in the future is that  characters  look  different  and  appear  “futuristic”:  Clothing  is  somehow  space age and appears markedly dissimilar to contemporary garb. In the  aforementioned “Who Is Max Mouse—Part 1” episode of Ghostwriter,  the prepubescent character Erica outlined why she should be the one to  cover the computer-hacking story in the school’s newspaper:  Erica:    Do you know anything about hackers? Can you jam with the console  cowboys in cyberspace? . . . Ever read Neuromancer? . . . Ever expe- rienced the new wave? Next wave? Dream wave? Or cyberpunk? I  didn’t think so.  Erica references Neuromancer, a book that, as already noted, is routinely  mentioned in discussions of cyberpunk  as well as referenced explicitly in  The Fifth Estate , a genre that helps to explain the fashion apparent in  many Internet-themed narratives, even if the genre theoretically predates  the World Wide Web:  Cyberpunk narratives focus explicitly on the destabilising impact of new  technology on traditional social and cultural spaces: in doing so they pro- vide a peculiarly appropriate response to the complex conditions of post- modernity, particularly the collapse of the traditional cultural and critical  hierarchies,  and  the  erosion  of  the  distinction  between  experience  and  knowledge which has provoked the decentring and fragmentation of the  subject.104   156   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The central themes of cyberpunk narratives—that technology is chang- ing  social  and  cultural  relations—are  routinely  represented  through  fashion.  Looking Different  At the subtle end of the hacker spectrum is the presentation of Mac  in Veronica Mars. Before the show’s title protagonist  Kirsten Bell  actu- ally met Mac in the “Like a Virgin” episode, Veronica was advised by the  computer teacher  Carl Bresk  on how she could locate her: “Look for the  blue hair.” Mac’s blue hair and veganism helped to subtly illustrate that  she is different from those around her and that her social and political  values are somewhat at odds with her peers. While Mac’s class and diet  help frame her as transgressive, aesthetic attributes also help. Like Mac in  Veronica Mars, another character on the comparatively tamer end of the  hacker-look spectrum is Kate in the sci-fi drama Hackers. Like Mac, the  most obvious thing about Kate is that she looks at least a little unusual:  Her hair is styled in an elfin cut, and, as explored later in this section, her  clothing is not dissimilar to her male hacker colleagues; whereas her male  colleagues look ordinary, Kate in the same attire looks distinctly androgy- nous. Kate’s look is not wild or outlandish, but for an attractive female to  downplay her femininity, a statement is being made.  Mentioned earlier was Abby in NCIS. In the “Truth or Consequences”  episode,  Abby’s  colleague,  Anthony  was  under  the  influence  of  truth  serum when he described Abby as “a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron  smothered in contradictions in terms. Sleeps in a coffin. Really, the happi- est goth you’ll ever meet.” On one hand, Abby, in many ways is all about  maintaining the status quo: She works in law enforcement and her inves- tigations center on aiding in the prosecution of criminals. The paradox,  however, is that aesthetically Abby dresses in a style more commonly asso- ciated with society’s outsiders, with Goths—or at least cybergoths—even if  she actually sees herself as more scientist than member of a subculture.105  Whereas Abby in NCIS might look the part of a Goth but, paradoxically,  also  work  for  the  government,  other  characters  present  the  Goth-look  as seemingly specifically related to their renegade activities. In Criminal  Minds, for example, while working with the FBI Penelope adopts a rela- tively conservative—if colorful—almost hipster aesthetic  Chapter 1 . In  “The Black Queen” episode, however, her past as a hacker was revealed,  showing Penelope in cybergoth attire: Black fingernails, tight corset, pale  skin, dark lips: When Penelope worked outside the law she dressed the       T H E   H A C K E R    157  part.  In  “The  Secret  Origin  of  Felicity  Smoak”  episode  of  Arrow,  like  Penelope, Felicity’s hacker past involved a cybergoth look. Lisbeth is the  Girl with the Dragon Tattoo films takes this idea a few steps further. In  psychologist Robin Rosenberg’s discussion of the character, she contends,  “[Lisbeth’s] Goth attire initially leads us  and the other characters that  encounter her in the trilogy  to assume that she is a slacker, a trouble- maker,  and  a  rebel.”106  Despite  the  fact  that  Lisbeth  does  good  works  in  the  films,  it  would  be  erroneous  to  assume  that  initial  assumptions  predicated on her attire were incorrect: Certainly for the purposes of this  chapter, while not a slacker, as a hacker Lisbeth certainly does classify as a  troublemaker—she embezzles, for example, a large sum of money—and  her clothing is used to demonstrate her criminal outsiderness. In the afore- mentioned episode of Spooks, the cryptographer and former hacker, Dani- elle, is tattooed and dressed in cybergoth attire. When she is met at the  pick-up point by her British security escort, Lucas  Richard Armitage , he  looks at her quizzically to which she responds, “They showed you that old  yearbook photo of me, didn’t they? They think people won’t take me seri- ously if they know the true horror.” While in 24 Chloe dressed in fairly  typical office attire, her aesthetic changed markedly in 24: Live Another  Day  2014 , something detected by the film critic Michael Hogan: “Since  we last saw her, Chloe had clearly read Stieg Larsson’s Millennium trilogy  because she’d turned into a tattooed emo-Goth working for an Assange- style ‘hacktivist.’”107 The character of Neo in The Matrix is similarly both  a hacker and character whose aesthetic has repeatedly been described as  gothic.108  Neo, in fact, provides a good segue from discussions on cybergoth to  another  aesthetic  trend  in  screen  hacker  displays  hinted  at  by  Kate  in  Hackers: androgyny. While the link between cybergoth and androgyny  hasn’t been extensively discussed, certainly a link has been made between  androgyny and Goth culture more generally. In communication scholar  Joshua Gunn’s work, for example, he notes that “many goths frequently  celebrate their acceptance and promotion of androgyny as resistance goth  practice.”109  Something,  however,  that  Gunn  notes,  along  with  other  theorists, is that androgyny has influenced male Goths more than female:  Although androgynous styles do help to highlight the constructions of  gender, in the goth scene androgynous practice is informally policed in a  manner than continuously reinscribes what Carole Pateman  1988, 2  has  termed a masculine sex-right, “the right of men to enjoy sexual access to  women.”110   158   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Cultural theorist Dunja Brill makes a similar point:  Male androgyny as an ideal is valued highly in the goth scene; by contrast,  its ideal female style amounts to an excessively feminine look, a hyperfem- ininity diametrically opposed to female androgyny. Consequently, what  the  rhetoric  of  the  goth  scene  calls  “androgyny”  can  more  precisely  be  described as a cult of femininity for both sexes.111  Despite  Gunn  and  Brill’s  criticisms,  on-screen  female  hackers  fre- quently downplay their femininity: It would, for example, be incorrect  to argue that Lisbeth in the Dragon Tattoo films or Kate in Hackers were  hyperfeminine;  on  the  contrary,  their  aesthetic  deliberately  downplays  anything girlish. Penelope’s past in a corset does, however, comply with  this observation.  Androgyny  In their discussion on media representations of female hackers, Owen,  Vande Berg, and Stein discussed the revolutionary promises made in the  early days of the Internet:  The prevailing rhetoric of social commentators and advertisers alike was  the liberating potential of cyberspace’s elimination of the visible markers— sex, race, disability, age—intrinsic to the maintenance of social structures.  The possibility of freedom from gender bias arose, imagining femininity  defined not in opposition to technology, but engaged with it.112  The idea was that the Internet could revolutionize social interactions  and enable the traditionally marginalized—women, nonwhites, the dis- abled,  etc.—to  free  themselves  from  their  corporeal  limitations  and  to  play  with  identity  without  restriction. Translating  such  an  idea  into  a  screen narrative is, of course, difficult: One way such a story is told on  screen is through fashion. Owen, Vande Berg, and Stein identify gender  as one of those visible markers that help maintain social structures and  thus, it is perhaps no surprise that gender is one of the attributes that a  female hacker might attempt to rid herself of. Certainly for characters  who live their life primarily online, the notion of gender play might, in  fact, even be second nature  Chapter 5 .  Examples at the subtle end of this spectrum are identifiable in The Net,  and the television series VR.5 and Ghostwriter. In The Net, Angela is intro- duced wearing a flannelette shirt over baggy pants, an aesthetic that Owen,       T H E   H A C K E R    159  Vande Berg, and Stein describe as grunge. Grunge, interestingly, is also the  favored style of Sidney in VR.5 and Erica in Ghostwriter. In the pilot of  VR.5, the hacker Sidney is introduced as working for a telecommunica- tions company and wearing a flannelette shirt. Similarly, Erica’s allegiances  to  the  hacker  ethos  are  made  clear  in  the  “Who  Is  Max  Mouse?”  epi- sodes and seemingly are ideals that have impacted on her aesthetic: The  character wears a nose ring, beanie, and loose-fitting army surplus pants.  While in these two examples—both being from the 1990s—an obvious  reading is that they are simply reflecting the grunge fashion of the time;  worth noting, grunge also has political underpinnings arguably in align- ment with the hacker ethos. Discussed in Chapter 1 was the idea of the  reappropriation of nerd and geek aesthetics as being centered on a kind of  antifashion and anticonsumerism; grunge—often considered as a grimy  antifashion—has  similar  underpinnings.  While  grunge  has  been  exten- sively criticized by academics as not being particularly political—notably  in comparison to other cultural movements likes punk113—nonetheless  politics did play a part. Political scientist Thomas Shevory, for example— who described grunge as a kind of “bleached resistance” in comparison to  punk—acknowledged that there were some political motivations, nota- bly generational conflict, independent recording, style, and gender con- cerns.114 The idea of grunge’s interest in gender politics has relevance for  not only the interpretation of the aesthetics of Erica in Ghostwriter, Angela  in The Net, and Sidney in VR.5, but also the broader idea of androgyny  as evident in hacker presentations. Mimi Schippers in her discussion of  grunge noted that the trend “was billed by the mainstream media as a  renaissance and celebration of masculine adolescence.”115 Whether or not  in practice celebrating masculinity was a goal, certainly a cursory exami- nation  of  the  grunge-look  of  characters  like  Erica,  Angela,  and  Sidney  does illustrate the idea of the look being a move away from femininity.  Of course, just as Schippers criticized narrow understandings of grunge— noting,  “characterizing  the  music  as  masculine  because  it  sounds  hard  and  aggressive  simply  reproduce  the  old  gender  bifurcation  of  musical  sound”116—and equally, a character’s move away from the aesthetics tradi- tionally associated with their gender does not automatically mean a move  to the other gender, but rather can be a move away from binary notions of  gender altogether. Androgynous representations help highlight this idea:  that rather than being about women wanting to be like men, androgyny is  more about moving away from stereotypical notions of femininity.  Descriptions of Lisbeth in the Dragon Tattoo films, for example, often  refer to her supposed androgyny: Film theorist Alexandra Heller-Nicholas    160   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  describes  Lisbeth’s  aesthetic  as  an  “androgynous,  Death-rock  infused  look,”117  psychoanalyst  Martina  Burdet  Dombald  notes  that  “Lisbeth  offers a profile which tends to the androgynous,”118 and gender theorist  Kim Surkan describes her as “decidedly genderqueer.”119 The psychologist  Misty Hook similarly spotlights:  Androgynous people have a foot in both gender role categories, but gen- der outlaws exist mostly in one category when they should be in the other.  As such, they don’t just take a lot more brainwork to classify, but also  point out the fallacies involved in rigid gender roles and as a result end up  infuriating traditional society. Lisbeth Salander is one such gender outlaw,  and her status as one is a large part of why her trilogy is so mesmerizing.120  Criminologists Maggie O’Neill and Lizzie Seal actually reference Lis- beth’s  androgyny  and  then  usefully  link  it  back  to  her  hacking:  “Her  androgyny is signalled not only by her physical description, but also by  her talents and passions. Under the pseudonym ‘Wasp,’ she is one of Swe- den’s preeminent computer hackers.”121 Here, hacking is highlighted as a  predominantly male activity but because of the capacities of the Internet,  skills trump gender.  Androgyny is also repeatedly referenced in discussions of the charac- ters in The Matrix: Film theorist Lisa Purse, for example, notes, “As an  androgynous pairing, Neo and Trinity’s bodies symbolise an erosion of  conventional gendered distinctions in a way that is directly relevant to  their relative status as superheroes.”122 Film theorist Lisa Funnell simi- larly notes that “the bodies of Trinity and Neo [Keanu Reeves] appear  androgynous,”123  and  cultural  theorists  Susanne  Kord  and  Elisabeth  Krimmer make the same point: “Trinity is not only androgynous, but  looks like the hero. Of similar height and build and adorned with similar  gender-neutral clothing, Neo and Trinity resemble each other to a strik- ing degree.”124 Carrie-Anne Moss, who played Trinity in The Matrix, is  similarly described as having “androgynous appeal.”125  For Kate in Hackers, androgyny was similarly part of her construction:  As Owen, Vande Berg, and Stein note, she is “indiscernible from the rest  of her all-male hacker gang,”126 and within the narrative she is so defined  by her androgynous look that at one point she and her hacker colleague  Dade  Jonny Lee Miller  engage in a bet whereby the winner would wear  a dress on a date: The idea is apparently equally egregious to both.  While   some  political,  psychological,  and  narrative-specific reasons why a hacker character might be presented as   I  have  proposed       T H E   H A C K E R    161  androgynous, it is, of course, necessary to also identify some possible— and  less  convoluted—explanations.  Film  theorist  Rikke  Schubart  pro- posed that one explanation for the androgyny in films like The Matrix is  simply fashion: “In the nineties androgyny and anorexia became trendy  and culminated in the character Trinity in The Matrix  1999  and in the  actress Calista Flockhart from the television series Ally McBeal running  from 1997 to 2002.”127 Accordingly, rather than Kate from Hackers nec- essarily being androgynous because she is a hacker, one explanation might  be simply that she is a product of her 1995 Zeitgeist.  Another explanation for hacker fashion centers on the conventions of  filmmaking. As noted throughout this book, scenes with characters sit- ting at monitors and typing at keyboards are rarely an exciting display.  As Limer argued in his Gizmodo article: “Forgive Hollywood if they try  to spice things up with pretty flashing lights and frenzied typing. After  all, it’s basically impossible to film accurate hacking and have it be visu- ally interesting in the way film demands.”128 Along similar lines, Gor- don spotlights: “When science is represented in the movies the objective  is often to display spectacle and illusion, and not necessarily verisimili- tude.”129 Filmmakers are actively seeking ways to make science and tech- nology presentations more interesting, and fashion is one way to do this.  In reference to the film Hackers, for example, a real-life hacker was quoted  in Paul Taylor’s book on computer security claiming:  When we got the press photos we couldn’t believe that Hollywood would  actually think that hackers look like that. We have never seen any hacker  on rollerblades. In fact, we have never seen a hacker break a sweat.130  This comment illustrates well a concept that another hacker participant   in Taylor’s work makes clear:  A Hollywood thriller film about hackers—is very much part and parcel  of the Hollywood thriller film tradition. Hollywood is not in the business  of journalism or social analysis; Hollywood is in the mass entertainment  business.131  Such ideas highlight that while some real-life hackers might look like  Lisbeth or Trinity, the high likelihood is that these characters—and nota- bly their costuming—aren’t about reflecting reality, but rather, are devices  used to tell a story; notably one that has the potential to be boring with- out the insertion of theatrical elements such as eye-catching costumes.   162   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Fetishism  Referenced  earlier  was  the  idea  of  sadomasochism  being  part  of  the  bricolage look of cybergoth. This idea, in fact, has gotten much attention,  something Raven Digitalis explained in his book on Goth:  Another aspect of dark culture that often gets intertwined with the greater  Goth scene is the fetish and BDSM community . . . Though the two are  separate subcultures, many fetishists are drawn to Goth culture, finding it  to be the only greater community that has the ability to integrate fetishis- tic tendencies both stylistically and philosophically.132  Along with being present in the Goth and cybergoth aesthetic, fetish  aspects are also identified in the sci-fi scene more broadly, and thus, also in  film and television examples. Philosopher Lewis Call, for example, exten- sively explored the presence of kink—notably bondage, discipline, and  sadomasochism—in science fiction; something he sees as demonstrated in  narratives including The Matrix and television series like Buffy the Vampire  Slayer:  By the mid-1980s, as we know, it was becoming increasingly possible for  mainstream  American  culture  to  incorporate  the  imagery,  iconography  and  ideas  of  BDSM.  Cyberpunk  thus  has  little  difficulty  constructing  worlds in which kink just seemed to be a natural part of the culture land- scape. As the sex wars raged  with BDSM at ground zero , cyberpunk  presented a fluid, postmodern kink which could easily assume a female  dominant configuration.133  While cyberpunk may have seen the rise of female sci-fi heroes, a cen- tral aspect of their aesthetic construction was sartorial references to kink  culture.  In VR.5, while she is playing on her computer Sidney is dressed in her  standard flannelette shirt. In the virtual reality world, however, her avatar  is dressed in provocative attire: Her first time there, Sidney is dressed in a  black latex bra top and skintight pants, her midriff bare. In the “Dr. Str- angechild” episode, her avatar appears in a skintight purple catsuit. In film  theorist Alexandra Heller-Nicholas’s discussion of Lisbeth in the Dragon  Tattoo films she spotlights, “With her fishnet and PVC, she is literally  fetishized in the film through her fetish wear.”134 Cultural theorist Pamela  Church Gibson makes a similar point in her discussion of Trinity in The  Matrix: “Yes, Trinity does wear some stunning PVC outfits—but her cat- suits do not lead the eye down to the pointed boots and stiletto heels       T H E   H A C K E R    163  of the conventional dominatrix or of Catwoman; she wears functional,  flat-heeled  biker  boots,  and  is  seen  frequently  astride  a  Ducati  motor- bike.”135 While fashion provides an explanation for fetish attire, so too do  ideas of transgression and role play. Linking back to the earlier discussion  about  sexually  liberal  hackers,  it  is  perhaps  no  surprise  that  themes  of  sexual boundary-crossing are also evident in dress. Similarly, as noted ear- lier, the Internet promised the capacity to revolutionize society. One way  this is accomplished is through characters donning new identities online.  While this is quite literal for Sidney in VR.5—who restricts her wearing of  fetish attire to the virtual reality world—for other characters who live life  online, transgressive attire is the uniform of the subversive.  Discussed earlier in the context of the female hacker as sidekick, one  explanation provided for the fetishized hacker has to do with eye candy:  that  she  is  an  attractive  distraction.  Other  explanations  are,  however,  worth  exploring.  The  idea  of  the  hacker  as  a  figure  of  transgression— enacted through lifestyle, sexuality, and appearance—means that being  interested in things that deviate from the norm is unsurprising: thus, the  practices or even just the aesthetic of kinky sex136 become part of this  deviation.  Cute and Geeky  While the hacker aesthetics discussed thus far center on female hack- ers who look distinct and certainly different from those around them, it is  also worth mentioning another kind of female hacker on screen and one  described by Parmiter in her chapter on the television series Smallville as  “cute and geeky”137: Her examples include Chloe from Smallville, Mac  from Veronica Mars, and Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. While Par- miter’s piece largely concerns her lament that “these young women with  such advanced intellectual powers are continually relegated to a support  staff position to the hero,”138 the idea of there being a “cute and geeky”  theme, something not explored in detail by Parmiter, is worth examining. Noted earlier was that female hackers transgress both legal and gender  boundaries. While Chloe, Mac, and Willow each do this too, they do so  without the overtly transgressive look: They each look like normal—even  geeky—young women. Penelope in Criminal Minds can also be added to  this list: In her past as a renegade hacker she donned cybergoth attire,  but in her FBI life she adopted a more girlish geek look. Worth noting,  another aspect of this “cute and geeky” look is the idea that it is femi- nine. While there are many explanations for feminized portrayals in any    164   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  context, the idea that a transgressive figure like a hacker might dress in  conservative attire is perhaps unsurprising: she might be politically ren- egade but at least she looks “normal.”  Hackers  incorporate  a  variety  of  ideas  identifiable  across  Internet- themed  film  and  television  narratives,  notably  tapping  into  issues  of  gender,  youth,  sexuality,  and  exploiting  unique  themes  such  as  trans- gression.  In  Chapter  5,  portrayals  of  another  Internet  criminal—the  cyberpredator—are explored.   5  You can meet creepazoids from  all over the world without leaving  the comfort of your own home:  The Cyberpredator  The idea of the Internet as a fearful place is perfectly illustrated by the  screen’s cyberpredator. Be they stalkers, pedophiles, or romantic scam art- ists, cyberspace is all too frequently depicted on screen as a kind of hunt- ing ground used by cybervillains to prey upon unsuspecting Web users.  In many of the narratives discussed in this chapter, the techno- and cyber- phobias that underpin the stereotypes analyzed throughout this volume  are channeled into a bogeyman: an often speculative figure who serves as  a warning about the dangers of online interactions. In other examples,  however, bogeyman fears are realized in the form of an actual predator  who goes online to inflict real financial, psychological, or sexual harm.  More  than  just  the  generic  idea  of  cyberspace  as  a  kind  of  hunting  grounds,  Internet  bogeymen—real  or  imagined—commonly  enter  screen narratives specifically through online communications. The online  arrangement of a meeting to sell a train set, for example, was how a cyber- predator lured a victim to his death in the thriller Untraceable  2008 .  The fraudulent offer of a job was similarly how a killer found victims in  the “Too Good to Be True” episode of the crime-drama Rizzoli & Isles   2010– . In the biopic The Craigslist Killer  2011 , victims were sourced  using the titular online classifieds site. A much more common scenario,    166   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  however,  is  the  sourcing  of  prey  through  online  dating:  As  Detective  Fitzgerald  Eric Close  remarked in “The Friendly Skies” episode of the  crime-drama Without a Trace  2002–2009 : “I tell you, a scary world this  Internet dating.” The Internet has revolutionized many aspects of human  interactions  but  connecting  people  for  the  purposes  of  love,  sex,  and  romance is one facet of online activity with a high profile, high participa- tion rate, and a notable presence in film and television.  In  an  early  scene  from  the  horror  film  Smiley   2012 ,  a  young  girl,  Mary   Darrien  Skylar ,  was  using  a  chat  roulette  site.  Her  babysitter,  Stacy  Nikki Limo , cautioned, “You shouldn’t put yourself out there like  that.” Stacy’s interpretation of Mary’s participation as putting oneself out  there highlights a theme underpinning many screen portrayals of online  dating where characters seemingly place themselves in positions of real, or  merely assumed, vulnerability: that online communications create, by their  very nature, a situation of risk. Just as characters—invariably women— are framed as jeopardizing their safety by putting themselves out there, the  screen also presents other characters—generally men—who exploit this  dynamic. The Internet, therefore, creates a perfect storm of ready victims,  canny predators, and the triple-A factors of the Internet—affordability,  accessibility, and anonymity1—working together to facilitate danger.  While the perfect storm is undoubtedly a factor as to why the cyber- predator is a frequent narrative inclusion, it should be noted that a char- acter who anonymously preys on the lonely is not actually an Internet  invention. Dan Slater in his book Love in the Time of Algorithms traced  use of newspaper classifieds in the quest for love back to Britain in the  1600s,2 highlighting that online dating is less about an entirely new way  of meeting people and more so about new technology providing alternate  ways to do it. Similarly, just as people have been meeting via newspapers  for hundreds of years, equally predators have been using the anonymous  channels of classifieds for just as long; a point made by true-crime author  William Webb:  Killers that connect with victims via the want ads are nothing new. The  notorious  lonely  hearts  killers  of  the  1940s,  Raymond  Fernandez  and  Martha Beck, met each other and found victims through a “lonely hearts”  magazine. Harvey Louis Caringnan, a Minnesota serial killer, is known  as the “want ad killer” because he used newspaper ads to lure women to  their deaths. An even more infamous lonely hearts killer was Henri Desire  Landru, who met at least 11 women through want ads in French maga- zines during World War I and murdered them.3      T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    167  Just as real-life lonely hearts predators hunted in a pre-Web world, such  figures  have  a  long  history  of  fictionalization  on  screen:  Lonely  hearts  killers are identifiable in the U.S. films Shadow of a Doubt  1943 , Lured   1947 , Monsieur Verdoux  1947 , The Honeymoon Killers  1969 , Sea of  Love  1989 , and Lonely Hearts  2006 ; in the French films Pièges  Personal  Column   1939  and Landru  Bluebeard   1963 ; in the Mexican film Pro- fundo Carmesí  Deep Crimson   1996 ; and in the Belgian film Alleluia   2014 . With so many people putting themselves out there, more opportu- nities for love exist but equally so do more opportunities for exploitation:  As Detective Monk  Richard Belzer  wryly observed in the “Chat Room”  episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  1999– , “I love the infor- mation superhighway. You can meet creepazoids from all over the world  without leaving the comfort of your own home.”  This chapter begins with the common frame of the Internet as a geo- graphic place separate from real life. Following this is an examination of  the  bogeyman  Internet  predator  premised  on  the  idea  that  those  who  use the technology are dangerous, mysterious, and worth fearing. While  vague verbalized fears are common in narratives, so too are presentations  of actual cyberpredators and thus such characters are also discussed.  The Internet Badlands  In the romantic-comedy Can’t Hardly Wait  1998 , an exchange trans- pired between two teenage nerds, Geoff  Joel Michaely  and Murphy  Jay  Paulson :  Geoff:   Murphy:   Geoff:  Murphy:    Isn’t this the weekend that you’re supposed to meet your girlfriend  from the Internet?  Yeah, but she has some photo shoot in Fiji . . . for a catalog or  something. Oh, man. That sucks.  Yeah.  I  guess  that’s  just  the  price  you  pay  for  dating  Christie  Turlington.  In this exchange, the idea of a person being from the Internet is articu- lated, an idea, in fact, widely detected on screen. In the “Hammerhead  Sharks” episode of the legal-drama The Practice  1997–2004 , the sister   Dreya Weber  of a murder victim claimed of her sister, “Well, I can’t  believe she would go off and meet up with some stranger from the Inter- net.” In a scene from the biopic The Social Network  2010 , Sean  Justin  Timberlake  loftily pronounced, “We lived on farms and then we lived in    168   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  cities and now we’re going to live on the Internet.” In the opening scene of  the thriller NetForce  1999 , a “cybercop,” Steve Day  Kris Kristofferson ,  sought a warrant from a judge: “He’s in there,” Steve said, referring to the  Internet. The same ideas were apparent in the gay-themed comedy Eating  Out 3: All You Can Eat  2009 : When Zack  Chris Salvatore  introduced  Ryan  Michael E. R. Walker , he announced: “This is Ryan from the Inter- net.” In the “Amen” episode of the drama The Newsroom  2012–2014 ,  MacKenzie  Emily Mortimer  alleged that her colleague Neal  Dev Patel ,  “live[s] on the Internet.” In the “Four to Tango” episode of Dawson’s Creek   1998–2003 , a teacher  Gloria Crist  quipped, “You know, I dated a guy  from the Internet once. Hideous.” In each of these scenes the Internet is  framed in a distinct way: that somebody could be from there, on there, in  there and that there is a capacity for people to somehow live there. While  such comments can simply be interpreted as shorthand for implying that  a relationship was initiated online or that a crime was carried out online,  the phrase also hints to the Internet sometimes being construed of as a  place, and not merely just any place but one where different rules apply  and where people are often more duplicitous. While I contend that the  comments in Can’t Hardly Wait, The Practice, The Social Network, Net- Force, Eating Out 3: All You Can Eat, The Newsroom, and Dawson’s Creek  each frame the Internet as a place in a geographic sense, this isn’t a new  idea: the term cyberspace already hints to the Internet being understood as  a nonphysical somewhere; something identified by digital ethics researcher  Annette Markham:  Many users and researchers conceptualize the Internet as a place as well as  a tool. From this perspective, the Internet describes not only the network  that structures interactions but also the cultural spaces in which meaning- ful human interactions occur.4  While the Internet is often conceived of as a distinct kind of place—for  example, as a marketplace, a workplace, or a meeting place—most rel- evant for this chapter is the notion of it being a general kind of badlands:  that bad people come from the Internet, a place where awful things hap- pen. As Ava  Gail O’Grady  derisively remarked in the “Online Dating”  episode of the sitcom Hot Properties  2005 , “The whole thing sounds so  dirty. It’s like saying you met someone under a pier.”  Since the beginning of the World Wide Web, discussions have repeated  the idea of the Internet as a kind of “Wild West.” While on one hand,  this  metaphor  is  about  notions  of  a  new  electronic  “frontier”  and  the       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    169  exciting possibilities created by the technology, discussions have also used  this metaphor as a shorthand description for lawlessness. In his essay on  cyberspace dating back to 1990, for example, John Perry Barlow painted  a dystopian picture that has held resonance for decades since: “the actual  natives [of cyberspace] are solitary and independent, sometimes to the  point of sociopathy. It is of course a perfect breeding ground for outlaws  and new ideas about liberty.”5 Seven years later, cultural theorists John  Arquilla and David Ronfeldt went so far as to identify a range of parallels  between the Internet and the actual Wild West:     In the Wild West almost anything could occur. There was no one to enforce  overall law and order, only isolated packets of local law. The same is true  in cyberspace.     There were both “good guys” and “outlaws” in the Wild West, often very  difficult to tell apart. “Friends” were the only ones a person could trust,  even though he or she would frequently have to deal with “strangers.” This  is also true in cyberspace.     Outside of the occasional local enclaves of law and order, everyone in the  Wild West was primarily dependent for security on their own resources  and those of their trusted friends. This is also true in cyberspace.6  While notions of the Wild West are themes in many of the Internet  archetypes discussed in this volume, for the purposes of this chapter they  have specific relevance to describing the place from where cyberpredators  come from: that it not just any place, or merely another place, but com- monly it is portrayed as a specific kind of badlands that breeds nefarious  characters. Just as these badlands breed cyberpredators, the Internet is also  framed as the place where victims are found: when, for example, a female  Internet dater puts herself out there, she is letting her guard down in a place  of lawlessness and where exploitation and harm appear likely.  In a scene from NetForce, Steve lamented that “sometimes I think the  growth of technology has outstripped our sense of morality.” This idea  drives the work of the titular netforce team who operate under the assump- tion that the Internet needs to be policed. While on one hand the film— produced in 1999—is very much a product of its time and thus, reflects  both the era’s rise in mainstreamed Internet use as well as the many new  challenges created for law enforcement, such themes are also detectable  in modern narratives  the series CSI: Cyber [2015–], for example, pres- ents a more modern taken on the same idea . Nearly two decades on and  the Internet posing specific challenges for law enforcement continues in    170   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  contemporary examples. A central way this is done is via representations  of seedier and lawless pockets of the Internet. Depictions of the Deep Web  and the Dark Web illustrate this well; something explained by Russell Kay  in an article for Computerworld:  The deep Web, also called the invisible Web, refers to the mass of informa- tion that can be accessed via the World Wide Web but can’t be indexed by  traditional search engines—often because it’s locked up in databases and  served up as dynamic pages in response to specific queries or searches.7  In  the  “Chapter  15”  episode  of  the  political-drama  House  of  Cards   2013– ,  the  journalist  Greer   Jonathan  Marballi   offered  a  similar  definition:  Ninety-six percent of the Internet isn’t accessible through standard search  engines. Most of it’s useless. But it’s where you go to find anything and  everything: child porn, bitcoin laundering, mail-order narcotics, hackers  for hire.  While terms like the deep Web and dark Web often describe locked up  data, most relevant to this discussion is their application to the controver- sial content that Greer alludes to. Jane Devine and Francine Egger-Sider  in their book Going Beyond Google Again, for example, discuss these dark  and often hidden online places, identifying, “It is no surprise that there is  a dark underbelly to the World Wide Web that supports pornography, the  drug trade, sexual predators, and other illicit activities.”8 On screen, clan- destine activity conducted in secret online places is identifiable in numer- ous contemporary narratives and in fact gets mentioned in the opening  monologue of each episode of CSI: Cyber:  My name is Avery Ryan [Patricia Arquette]. I was a victim of cyber crime.  Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance  online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my  computer. Then I was hacked, and as a result, one of my patients was mur- dered. My investigation into her death led me to the FBI, where I joined a  team of cyber experts to wage a war against a new breed of criminal hiding  on the deep Web infiltrating our daily lives in ways we never imagined.  Faceless, nameless lurking inside our devices, just a keystroke away.  Presentations  of,  as  well  as  direct  references  to,  secret  online  places  are widely identifiable. In the British drama  Chatroom  2010  and the       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    171  American  drama  Elephant   2003 ,  for  example,  teenage  males  bought  guns online. While these examples illustrate the Internet simply as a mar- ketplace,  they  also  highlight  the  illegal  trade  that  readily  transpires  in  these badlands. Other examples offer more explicit allusions to the Web’s  “darkest corners.”9 In the “Cry Havoc” episode of the drama series State  of Affairs  2014– , a terrorist cell was tracked via their “dark Web activ- ity.” In the “Intimidation Game” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims  Unit, the “dark net” is referred to as the way misogynistic video threats  were uploaded. In the “Kitty” episode of CSI  2000–2015 —which was  the  crossover  episode  between  CSI  and  CSI:  Cyber—the  investigator,  Avery, both referred to the “deep Web” and offered a definition: “where  everything illegal is for sale.” “The Deep Web” episode of the legal-drama  The Good Wife  2009–  specifically focused on the real-life deep website,  The Silk Road, a site criminologist Anthony Walk described as “Amazon. com for Crooks, Creeps, and Crackheads”:  The modern Silk Road was a website where people anywhere in the world  could access all sorts of illegal goods and services, such as drugs, child por- nography, unlicensed weapons, forged passports and other official docu- ments, counterfeit cash, and even genuine hitmen. This emporium of vice  displayed  bricks  of  cocaine  and  counterfeit  passports  on  its  website  as  attractive as Amazon displays its products.10  In The Good Wife episode the same Amazon.com metaphor was used  by the Assistant State’s Attorney, Finn Polmar  Matthew Goode , when he  explained, “What Amazon is to book clubbers, Silk Road is to criminals.”  Silk Road is also mentioned in the “The Bogeyman” episode of the police- drama Blue Bloods  2010– , when it is named as a place to buy heroin. In  the “We Are Everyone” episode of the detective series Elementary  2012–   a similar definition was offered for “Jamaica Quay”—a Silk Road–type  site—which was described by Sherlock  Jonny Lee Miller  as “a gather- ing  place  for  identity  thieves,  intellectual  property  pirates,  other  cyber  highwaymen.”  In these examples, the deep Web is named explicitly, in others the idea  is  presented  more  cryptically.  The  “P911”  episode  of  the  crime-drama  Criminal Minds  2005–  was centered on an online pedophilia ring which  auctioned kidnapped children via the Internet’s underbelly. In “The Hunt”  episode of the same series, the dark Web was used to sell kidnapped vic- tims to serial killers. The “Kidnapping 2.0” episode of CSI: Cyber focused  on online baby auctions. In the aforementioned “Chat Room” episode of    172   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Keith  Mark Matkevich  ran a child  porn website and took requests from site visitors, again on the dark Web.  The same thing transpired in the “Web” episode of the same series: Teddy   Connor Paolo  operated a child porn website taking special orders. The  television  drama  Selling  Innocence   2005   presented  a  variant  on  this  theme: the teenager Mia  Sarah Lind  was approached in a mall by a man,  Malcolm  JR Bourne , claiming to be a model scout. Malcolm told Mia  that the photos he took would be accessed via advertising executives, as it  turned out, he was operating an underage dark Web porn site where users  requested content with an ever-increasing level of explicitness.11 A similar  storyline transpired in the drama Men, Women & Children  2014 : Donna   Judy Greer  had set up a website to showcase her teenage daughter Han- nah’s  Olivia Crocicchia  various showbiz talents. Like Malcolm, Donna  had  included  a  pay-for-view  section  where  users  could  request  specific  types of photos in varying levels of salaciousness.  Walk’s Silk Road description mentioned the procurement of hitmen  and such an idea alludes to another manifestation of dark Web ideas on  screen. In the drama Downloading Nancy  2008 , the suicidal title charac- ter  Mario Bello  used the Internet to find a man to kill her. In the Irish  drama  Love  Eternal   2013 ,  Ian   Robert  de  Hoog   befriended  suicidal  people in chat rooms with the intention of helping them commit suicide.  In the Australian horror film Feed  2005 , the Internet facilitated pairing  a cannibal with a man who wanted to be eaten.  Mentioned earlier was Markham’s distinction between the Internet as  a place as well as a tool. Worth spotlighting is a convergence of these ideas  creating heightened vulnerability for users: that sometimes the Internet is  both a place as well as a tool used by malevolent forces.  Inherent Vulnerabilities  As discussed throughout this volume, the Internet has a number of  distinct features that make it a unique “place” but also one with distinct  dangers. These two ideas fuse in a variety of examples where characters  treat the Internet as a kind of live nefarious entity playing out in their  computer. A common way this idea is conveyed on screen is characters  attempting to  crudely  contain problems within cyberspace by simply  turning  off  their  computer.  In  the  romantic-comedy  You’ve  Got  Mail   1998 , for example, when Joe NY152  Tom Hanks  first suggested via  e-mail to Shopgirl Kathleen  Meg Ryan  that they meet in person, Kath- leen quickly closed the lid of her laptop; apparently by doing so, her  relationship with NY152—one which she already felt was bordering on       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    173  infidelity—could be contained within the Internet. In the last scene of  the British drama Cyberbully  2015 , the teen protagonist Casey  Maisie  Williams , asked her cyberbully: “What are you when I stop talking to  you?” Casey asked this question as she closed the lid of her laptop, in turn  trapping relations—and, seemingly, even potentially the psychological  ramifications—within cyberspace. In the “A League of their Own” epi- sode of the sitcom Ugly Betty  2006–2010 , when—while on an online  dating side—Christina  Ashley Jensen  “bumped into” her husband, she  too quickly shut her the laptop as though doing so could shut down the  uncomfortable encounter. In the thriller Copycat  1995 , Helen  Sigour- ney Weaver —who had been living a reclusive lifestyle after nearly fall- ing victim to a serial killer—received a photo via e-mail of one of the  killer’s new victims. In response, Helen frantically unplugged her com- puter. The detective, MJ  Holly Hunter , asked her what she was doing  and Helen responded, “It’s an open window. He can crawl in anytime  he likes.” In the British miniseries Killer Net  1998 , after his playing of  an online stalking game led to a real-life murder, Scott  Tam Williams   hurled his computer out the window: apparently destroying the source  of all his problems. Something similar played out in the Christian-drama  Fireproof  2008 : Caleb  Kirk Cameron  dealt with the temptation of  netporn by attacking his computer with a baseball bat. In each of these  examples, characters physically attempted to manage a threatening digi- tal world by treating online interactions as something that can be com- partmentalized and contained within cyberspace and not impact of the  rest of life.  Although some attempts are made on screen to somehow physically  contain a problem within cyberspace, in others there is a spoken recogni- tion that doing so is impossible. Helen in Copycat noted that predators  can use the Internet to “crawl in anytime,” and this is certainly a theme  in numerous examples where the threats posed by the Internet hinge on  the impossibility of containment. In the aforementioned “P911” episode  of Criminal Minds, the profiler Katie Cole  Mary Page Keller  discussed  cyberpedophiles and remarked, “All the security in the world can’t stop  them coming through our doors.” This same idea was apparent in the  “Chat Room” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, in a con- versation between Detective Elliot Stabler  Christopher Meloni  and his  wife, Kathy  Isabel Gillies :  Kathy:  Elliot:   It scares me.  Honey, it scares me too. But I can’t just walk into a room a restrain  the guy.   174   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Kathy:  Why not? Elliot:    I  mean,  these  predators. You  tell  me  where  they  are.  I  can’t  hear  them, I can’t see them. Kathy:  But they’re out there. Elliot:  Honey, they’re in here. [gestures to the computer]  Later  in  the  episode  Elliot  commented  to  his  daughter,  “You  know  how I lock up all the doors and windows? Now they’re coming in through  there,” again gesturing to the computer. In The Craigslist Killer, Detective  Bennett  William Baldwin  made a similar remark, “Used to be able to see  who the bad guys were, right? Now it’s all text and emails and websites.  Creeps are hiding in our houses and we don’t even know who they are.” In  the “Fire Code” episode of CSI: Cyber, a virus is actually written to enable  printers to set themselves alight: an extreme example of the nonphysical  channels of the Internet being used to launch a real-life physical attack:  This theme, incidentally, is more commonly witnessed in supernatural- themed narratives where cyberspace is portrayed as a kind of in-between  place where ghosts and other paranormal entitles can access victims  as  transpired in the Japanese film Kairo  Pulse   2001 , along with the Amer- ican remakes Pulse  2006 , Pulse 2: Afterlife  2008 , and Pulse 3  2008  as  well as in the British horror-comedy Tormented  2009  and the American  drama Unfriended  2014  . Such narratives showcase an exaggerated new  world of cybercrime and most notably highlight the challenges posed for  law enforcement.  A variation on the idea of the physical computer as a threat is appar- ent when characters are put in jeopardy after being given one of these  “dangerous” machines. In Chapter 3, for example, I discussed the Ameri- can dramas Cyberbully  2011  and Trust  2010  where teenage girls were  given laptops as birthday presents: in Cyberbully soon after Taylor  Emily  Osment   received  her  gift  she  became  the  victim  of  cyberbullying;  in  Trust, soon after Annie’s  Liana Liberato  birthday she became a victim of  rape and then cyberbullying. In the “Web” episode of Law & Order: Spe- cial Victims Unit, the IT expert, Ruben  Joel de la Fuente , revealed that  he had given a computer to his nephew; his nephew was then raped by  an online pedophile who he had met up with in real life. These examples  each present the Internet as a tool by which cyberpredators can access  victims: that well-adjusted young people have their lives ruined by a gift  bringing horror into their lives.  Such narratives can be likened to those  discussed in Chapter 3, in which children’s cyberbullying is subtly used  on screen as a way to demonize absent parents.  Another element of these       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    175  three examples is the allusion to what “security” means in the Internet  age: While in Trust we see parents Will  Clive Owen  and Lynn  Cath- erine Keener  setting their home alarm, and while Elliot in “Chat Room”  and Ruben in “Web” work in traditional, “bricks and mortar”–style law  enforcement, in each of these narratives standard methods of keeping safe  are rendered futile: the Internet not only breeds a unique kind of preda- tor but it offers a unique way to access victims, thus rendering locks and  alarms irrelevant.12  Just  as  the  Internet  as  a  kind  of Wild West  is  a  common  frame  on  screen,  an  even  stronger  one—and  one  specifically  relevant  for  the  cyberpredator—is the idea that those figures hailing from the badlands  are bogeymen: an imagined fear of what might lurk out there rather than  an accurate reflection of online experiences.  The Cyberpredator as Bogeyman  While the term bogeyman commonly conjures thoughts of a nightmar- ish figure that frightens children, this imaginary creature can just as read- ily  terrify  adults.  The  bogeyman  personifies  fears  of  the  unknown  and  serves  as  an  embodiment  of  transgression  and  punishment,  something  identified by communications theorist Kendall Phillips in his work on  horror in cinema:  In a way, every tale of horror is a tale of the bogeyman. Folklorists trace  the  origin  of  this  mythical  figure  of  fear  as  far  back  as  human  history  is recorded . . . While the form of the bogeyman varies across cultures  and historical periods, the essential quality of the bogeyman is his  or, at  times, her  relationship to cultural boundaries. The bogeyman exists at  the boundary point between cultural notions of right and wrong, and his  position at the boundary entails a number of important cultural implica- tions . . . These kinds of monstrous figures have long served as warrants  for the systems of morality—if you cross the boundaries of morality, these  figures await you.13  As applied to a discussion of the Internet, the bogeyman provides a  means to think about techno- and cyberphobias; fears that exist in real  life and which are common inclusions in screen narratives and seemingly  linked to rapid technology change.  During the earliest days of the World Wide Web the technology was  scarcely  understood  and  thus  the  Internet  itself  was  conceived  as  an  unknown quantity and as a generalized kind of bogeyman. Akin to the    176   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  popularity  of  the  Wild  West  metaphor,  news  reports  from  the  1990s  often used the bogeyman metaphor in discussions of the new “informa- tion superhighway”: a Guardian article from 1995, for example, proposed  that “[t]he new bogeyman roams free on the latest frontier, the Internet,  which does not respect national borders.”14 The same metaphor was used  in articles from this period on specific fears such as the Internet bogeymen  of netporn,15 online gambling,16 privacy invasion17 and hacking.18 On  screen the idea of the Internet as a bogeyman is identifiable in numerous  films produced in the 1990s. The thriller The Net  1995 , for example,  centered on the computer programmer, Angela’s  Sandra Bullock , efforts  to untangle herself from a cyberconspiracy involving hacking and iden- tity  theft.  In  his  discussion of  the  film,  cultural  theorist  Aaron Tucker  identified: “Even the title The Net recalls monster films such as The Blob  [1958] . . . and The Fly [1958] . . . with creatures and transformations  that produced grotesque and inexplicable consequences.”19 Here, Tucker  highlights  how  early  narratives  portrayed  the  Internet  not  merely  as  a  dangerous place but more so as a kind of autonomous thing—if not an  autonomous creature—with, presumably, nefarious intent.20 Other films  from this period framed the new technology in similar, frightening ways.  The sci-fi thriller Virtuosity  1995 , for example, imagined a dystopian  future where personality attributes—notably those of serial killers—could  be uploaded into cyberspace and then get downloaded into a single, real- life entity that could, and as happened in the narrative did, terrorize in the  real world. In NetForce, something similar transpired: Steve uploaded his  consciousness onto the Internet in case of his death so that his employees  could continue to utilize him as a virtual reality resource if necessary   a  theme used decades later in the sci-fi film Transcendence [2014] .21 Vir- tual reality was similarly a theme of the sci-fi film  The Matrix  1999 ,  which depicted a world where real life was replaced by a virtual existence  and for many individuals their entire experience of life was a simulation  experienced from pods, their consciousness having been hardwired into  the virtual “Matrix” power plant. Virtual reality was also a theme in the  television sci-fi film The Cyberstalking  1999  where the software began  to adapt and write its own code and where a physical manifestation of  a bogeyman character in the form of a black-clad figure stalked women  while in cyberspace.22 In popular Internet mythology, this figure takes  the form of Slenderman, an Internet bogeyman linked to a number of  real-life crimes23 and who was referenced in the “Thinman” episode of  the sci-fi series Supernatural  2005–  and featured in webseries including  Marble Hornets  2009-2014  and Jacob: The Series  2015 .      T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    177  While these examples can be interpreted as showcasing anxieties about,  and a lack of understanding of, new technology, more so they are pre- mised on fears about the unknown potentials of the Internet. Film and  television have a very long history of fictionalizing—and in turn, poten- tially  cultivating24—a  wide  variety  of  fears  centered  on  new  technolo- gies, something that film theorist Daniel Dinello documented in his book  Technophobia!:  From  the  destructive  robot-witch  of  Metropolis   1926   to  the  parasitic  squid-machines of The Matrix Revolutions  2003 , the technologized crea- tures of science fiction often seek to destroy or enslave humanity. Science  fiction shows the transformation into the posthuman as the horrific harbin- ger of the long twilight and decline of the human species. In its obsession  with mad scientists, rampaging robots, killer clones, cutthroat cyborgs,  human-hating androids, satanic supercomputers, flesh-eating viruses, and  genetically  mutated  monsters,  science  fiction  expresses  a  technophobic  fear of losing our human identity, our freedom, our emotions, our val- ues, and our lives to machines. Like a virus, technology autonomously  insinuates itself into human life and, to ensure its survival and dominance,  malignantly manipulates the minds and behavior of humans.25  The use of the Internet, therefore, can simply be construed as a modern  take on a very well established screen motif. While The Net, Virtuosity,  The Matrix, and The Cyberstalking are representative of 1990s films that  exploit technophobia, more recent films continue these themes, coincid- ing with the development of newer, more capable—and thus potentially  even scarier—technologies. In the gay-themed romantic-comedy eCupid   2011 , for example, Marshall  Houston Rhines  was watching late-night  TV when he saw a commercial for the dating app eCupid. The app turned  out to be substantially more all-encompassing than an ordinary commu- nication tool: The app randomly sent dates to Marshall’s home to play  out sexual fantasies, organized parties on his behalf, and even hijacked  his, and his estranged partner’s, phones in an attempt to reunite them.  Similar themes were apparent in the speculative-future film Her  2013 ,  which  focused  on  a  world  where  humans  have  their  needs  met  by  an  intuitive operating system that they are in constant communication with  and  that  adapts  with  user  input.  Both  eCupid  and  Her  ask  important  questions about the extent to which we want such technology in our lives.  In Her, specifically, users develop real feelings for their operating systems:  Amy  Amy Adams  claims to have fallen in love with her system and in  one  scene  the  protagonist,  Theodore   Joaquin  Phoenix ,  actually  has  a    178   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  kind of sex with his. Her poses questions about what technology is doing  to human identity and how it is redefining relationships. Transcendence  similarly posed questions about what it means to be alive and, like Her,  problematized the notion of “real” communication and, most relevant for  this chapter, examines what happens when a computer advances to the  point of devising its own agenda. Borrowing themes from both Virtuosity  and NetForce, Transcendence focused on a dying scientist  Johnny Depp   who uploaded his consciousness with the intention of being able to work  and communicate after his corporeal death.  While  the  examples  discussed  thus  far  each  centered  on  human  involvement  in  the  harnessing  of  Internet  technology  to  problematic  ends, Virtuosity, The Cyberstalking, Her, and Transcendence also hinted at  the idea of technology adapting and developing itself: that humans may  have written the software, but that such software can learn, adjust, and  advance; that scientists can unwittingly create monsters. These ideas, of  course, have their thematic origins in Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel Fran- kenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus, a story that has inspired innumer- able screen narratives where science experiments lead to unforeseen and  horrific  outcomes:  as  Dinello  contended,  “[Frankenstein]  delivered  a  powerful  anti-science  diatribe  that  still  reverberates  as  a  quintessential  parable  of  the  dangers  unleashed  by  technological  creation  and  irre- sponsible scientists.”26 Even modern films seemingly far removed from  Frankenstein—for example, You’ve Got Mail—articulate a fear of tech- nology getting “out of control”. You’ve Got Mail opened with newspaper  columnist Frank Navasky’s  Greg Kinnear  diatribe about the Internet:  “It’s the end of Western civilization as we know it . . . You think this  machine’s your friend, but it’s not.” Frankenstein is actually referenced  in The Cyberstalking explicitly by Taylor  Daniel Caltagirone  who has  fears about the virtual reality software: “That’s the Frankenstein part, Jack.  According to this program, the connection taps into your subconscious.  It would materialize thoughts nobody knew were there.” The same idea is  referenced in the artificial intelligence–themed Ex Machina  2015  when  the computer programmer, Nathan  Oscar Isaac , makes verbal reference  to “Prometheus.”  While Frankenstein themes are identifiable widely in technology out of  control narratives, an extension of this theme is apparent in narratives  where  technology  is  presented  as  the  ultimate  bogeyman  itself,  devel- oping  a  life  and  agenda  of  its  own  completely  separate  from  human  involvement. While in films like Virtuosity, The Cyberstalking and Tran- scendence, the development of the technology was part of the storyline       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    179  and  thus  audiences  saw  Frankenstein-type  programmers  create  the  technology before it morphed into something uncontrollable, in Kairo   Pulse  and the American remakes Pulse, Pulse 2: Afterlife, and Pulse 3,  the Internet itself as a malevolent force with its own agenda. These films  speculate about a future where the Internet spontaneously mutates into  something unexpected without any human intervention at all: In these  narratives the Internet coerced characters to spontaneously commit sui- cide, a theme also apparent in Unfriended. The sci-fi film One Point O   2004  presented a variation of this theme where the Internet somehow  made people do harmful things—for example, consume foods to which  were allergic.27  Fears of the Internet aren’t natural nor something people are born with  and therefore are concerns cultivated by numerous social sources. While  arguably literature like Frankenstein and its derivatives have contributed to  this—as legal theorist Walter Effross noted, cyberpunk-themed narratives  have “helped to foster public awareness of  and possibly to perpetuate ste- reotypes of  real and potential on-line bogeymen”28—scholars have also  identified the role of governments in exploiting the Internet-as-bogeyman  idea for political gain. This was a point made in 1996 by Steven Miller in  his book Civilizing Cyberspace:  In an effort to mobilize public support for clamping down on the relative  anarchy of cyberspace, a series of bogeymen have been created and publi- cized as imminent dangers to national security and social health.29  Communications  scholars  Eric  Zimmer  and  Christopher  Hunter   argued the same line  and used the same metaphor  in 2002:  Concerns  about  the  new  media,  driven  by  older  media,  help  foster  an  alarmist state in which legislators define their roles in light of protecting  citizens from the bogeyman of the Internet through legislative control of  access to or dissemination of Internet content.30  As Western democracies continue to debate Internet censorship, ever- more theorists have argued the same contention.31 As identified thus far,  the bogeyman is connected to a discussion of cyberpredators in numerous  ways:  a  it is a metaphor identifiable in real-life technology reporting,  b   it potentially underpins policymaking regarding new technology,  c  it is  a way to interpret narratives about the Internet, and  d  the bogeyman  is an ever-present character in film and television. By its very nature, the  bogeyman is imaginary, and thus, within narratives the cyberbogeyman    180   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  exists as an imagined threat. A typical take on this imagined cyberpreda- tor transpired in the “Juliet Takes a Luvvah” episode of the comedy-crime  series Psych  2006–2014  in a scene where Shawn  James Roday  walked  in on his colleague Gus  Dulé Hill  taking selfies:  Shawn:  Uh, what are you doing? Gus:   Shawn:   Gus:   Shawn:    Look, it’s not what it looks like. I’m just taking additional photos  for my soulmateconnect.com online dating profile.  Phew. I thought there was something truly embarrassing going on  in here.  Look, I need to be in love, Shawn. Everyone I’ve gone after over the  last year has either been a killer or dating a killer.  Oh,  well,  by  all  means,  let’s  scour  the  Internet,  the  place  where  everyone  knows  it’s  just  decent,  normal,  sane  people  looking  for  true love.  Shawn’s  sarcastic  comments  are  indicative  of  commonly  deployed  humorous speculation that if a person chooses to date online they will  encounter people who are anything but decent, normal, or sane; a theme  widely apparent in film and television.  The Online Dating Bogeyman  In the opening of the comedy EuroTrip  2004 , Scotty  Scott Mech- lowicz  was e-mailing his German pen pal, Mike. Watching on, Scotty’s  friend, Cooper  Jacob Pitts , outlined the perils of meeting people online:  You met a “cool guy” on the “Internet” okay. This is how these sexual  predators work. Next thing you know he’s going to want to “arrange a  meeting” where he will gas you and stuff you in the back of his van and  make a wind chime out of your genitals.  Cooper’s  fears  in  EuroTrip  were  in  fact  completely  unfounded— “Mike” turned out to be the gorgeous “Mika”  Jessica Boehrs  and thus  Hollywood’s opposite of a bogeyman—but they nonetheless highlight the  most common way that cyberpredators are portrayed in Internet-themed  narratives: as a vague, if hyperbolic, fear of encountering someone psycho.  Such fears are widely identifiable. In the romance Meet Prince Charm- ing  2002 , Samantha  Tia Carrere  typed a message to her secret online  admirer, Jack  David Charvet , confessing, “I’m a little nervous. What if  you’re a psycho killer?” In the drama On_Line  2002 , Moira  Isabel Gil- lies  told her friend, Ed  Eric Millegan , about her upcoming online date;       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    181  Ed, concernedly, asked her, “What if he turns out to be a complete psy- cho or something?” In an unnamed episode of the gay-themed Scottish  series Lip Service  2010–2012 , Tess  Fiona Button  was uninterested in  Frankie’s  Ruta Gedmintas  suggestion of online dating: “No, absolutely  not, I’m not that desperate; it’s for skanks and psychos.” The “Two Bod- ies in the Lab” episode of the crime-drama series Bones  2005–  opened  with the protagonist, Temperance  Emily Deschanel , communicating on  a  site  called  SensiblePartners.com.  Her  colleague,  Agent  Booth   David  Boreanaz , asked her, “So what if your computer date’s psycho?” Fears  of the weirdo is another common way cyberbogeymen fears are verbal- ized. In the “Three Men and a Boubier” episode of the sitcom Super Fun  Night  2013–2014 , Kimmie  Rebel Wilson  suggested that she and her  roommates sign up for online dating to which Helen-Alice  Liza Lapira ,  responded, “Internet dating? I don’t know, Kimmie. There are too many  weirdos online.” In the Catfish  2010  documentary, a waitress provided  Nev, the protagonist, her thoughts on online dating, “I know my friend,  she actually just met a guy the other day off the Internet and he was a  total weirdo.” In the “I’m Moving On” episode of the drama Hart of Dixie   2011–2015 , after Zoe  Rachel Bilson  decided to start dating online, her  friend, Wade  Wilson Bethel , cautioned her, “Gotta be careful. Lots of  freaks and weirdos online.” In the “I Robot . . . You, Jane” episode of the  supernatural series Buffy the Vampire Slayer  1997–2003 , Willow  Aly- son Hannigan  met a man, “Malcolm,” online and Buffy  Sarah Michelle   Gellar , and their mutual friend Xander  Nicholas Brendon , discussed  their concerns, again referencing the weirdo possibility:  Xander:    No, it’s just this Malcolm guy. What’s his deal? I mean, tell me  you’re not slightly wigged.  Buffy:  Okay, slightly. I mean, just not knowing what he’s really like. Xander:    Or who he really is. I mean, sure he says he’s a high school student,  but I can say I’m a high school student. You are.  Okay, but I could also say that I’m an elderly Dutch woman. Get  me? I mean, who’s to say I’m not if I’m in the elderly Dutch chat  room.  I get your point. I get your point. Oh, this guy could be anybody.  He could be weird, or crazy, or old, or he could be a circus freak.  He’s probably a circus freak.  Yeah, I mean, we read about it all the time. You know, people meet  on the net, they talk, they get together, have dinner, a show, hor- rible axe murder.  Buffy:  Xander:   Buffy:   Xander:    182   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Outside of psychos and weirdos, cyberbogeyman fears are identified in  a variety of other ways. In the Australian comedy Da Kath and Kim Code   2005 , unlucky-in-love Sharon  Magda Szubanski  began Internet dat- ing and her friend Kath  Jane Turner  remarked worriedly, “Gee, Internet  dating.  I  hope  Sharon’s  careful.  There’s  a  lot  of  loonies  out  there.”  In  the romantic-comedy Because I Said So  2007 , Daphne  Diane Keaton   used the Internet to search for a partner for her daughter, Milly  Mandy  Moore . Daphne’s online ad attempted to exclude those bogeymen she  assumed populated cyberspace: “Let me preface this ad by saying if you’re  a nut job, pervert, or fruit cake, move on.” The pervert idea was simi- larly identified in the “Online Dating” episode of Hot Properties, when  Ava referred to online dating as a “wonderfully efficient way for perverts  around the world to check you out.” Perverts were again identifiable in  Stacy’s advice to young Mary in Smiley about not using the “Hide and Go  Chat” site because “it’s for people who do gross things to other people.”  In  the  British  comedy-drama  Dogging:  A  Love  Story   2009 ,  in  a  chat  room, Laura  Kate Heppell  asked Dan  Luke Treadaway  what he was  thinking and he responded, “I was thinking, are you an old pervert?”  The natural extension of fears of weirdos, psychos, and perverts is, as  Xander in Buffy the Vampire Slayer referenced, the idea that online dat- ers might be criminals. In the comedy Ten Inch Hero  2007 , Jen  Clea  DuVall   was  falling  in  love  with  her  online  correspondent  “Fuzzy22.”  Fearing disaster, her colleague, Piper  Elisabeth Harnois  cautioned, “So  basically he could be Charles Manson with a laptop?” In the “A League  of Their Own” episode of Ugly Betty, in the aftermath of Betty’s  America  Ferrera  break-up with Henry  Christopher Gorham , she discussed her  predicament with colleague Christina, in turn revealing her own cyber- bogeyman fears:  Christina:   Betty:    Okay, executive decision—I’m gonna put your profile on Bach- elocity.com.  Internet  Dating?  There  are  freaks  online.  Why  don’t  you  just  chop me into pieces yourself, and we can cut out the middleman?  In the British biopic One Chance  2013 , Paul  James Corden  was on  his first date with his Internet girlfriend, Julz  Alexandra Roach , when  Julz got a telephone call: “Oh, it’s just my mum,” she explained to Paul,  “making sure that I’m still alive and you haven’t murdered me.” In the  “In the Mix, on the Books, and in the Freezer” episode of the sitcom  Manhattan Love Story  2014 , Dana  Analeigh Tipton  is worried about       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    183  her upcoming Tinder date: “Hoping he’s not a serial killer,” she mused. In  “The Fall” episode of the comedy-drama series Grace and Frankie  2015– ,   Grace  Jane Fonda  stated her objection to online dating: “I choose not  to be murdered by a stranger that I met online.” In You’ve Got Mail the  same fears were evident in a scene when Kathleen was speculating with  her employees Christina  Heather Burns  and George  Steve Zahn  about  why her online date hadn’t shown up to the café as planned. Kathleen and  Christina  pondered  an  elaborate  accident  scenario  when  George  inter- jected with a copy of a newspaper emblazoned with the headline “Cops  Nab Rooftop Killer”:  Kathleen:  What are you saying? George:  Christina:   It could be. He was arrested two blocks from the café.  Is  there  a  picture?  [They  flip  through  the  newspaper]  So  that  explains it. He was in jail.  But he got only one call and he had to use it to call his lawyer.  George:  Christina:  And there was a phone— George:  Christina:  You are so lucky. George:   You could be dead.  Later in the film the same bogeyman fears were articulated when Joe— Kathleen’s Internet beau, although unbeknownst to her at that time— jokingly speculated that her online correspondent NY152 was probably  “Mr. 152 felony indictments.” In the “Do You Wanna Dance?” episode of  Ally McBeal  1997–2002 , the title character  Calista Flockhart  had only  just embarked on online dating when her roommate, Renee  Lisa Nicole  Carson ,  similarly  cautioned,  “You  realise  this  guy’s  probably  got  two  heads and a criminal record.” In the television thriller The Girl He Met  Online  2014 , while scanning through profile photos, Gillian  Yvonne  Zima  gave a running commentary, “Momma’s boy, no thank you, uggh,  you’re like a hundred years old, red neck trailer trash, too young . . . serial  killer.”32  While  in  these  examples  assumptions  about  bogeymen  were  verbal- ized,  in  a  variety  of  other  scenes  suspicions  are  conveyed  more  subtly:  for example, when a seemingly appealing candidate is somehow assumed  to be predatory based exclusively on their participation in online dating:  that doing so is a character indictment and red-flag. An example of this  occurred in the aforementioned “Two Bodies in the Lab” episode of Bones  when Temperance’s  online  date,  David   Coby  Ryan  McLaughlin ,  was    184   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  called in for questioning following an explosion; a telling exchange trans- pired between him and Agent Booth:  Booth:    You’re  an  investment  banker,  good-looking  guy,  but  yet  you  find  your women online.  David:  Excuse me? Booth:  Don’t you find any women at work? David:    [Gesturing  to Temperance]  She  was  online  too  and  she’s  a  great- looking doctor.  The same suspicions were articulated in Because I Said So when Daphne  finally  met  Jason   Tom  Everett  Scott ,  a  man  she  deemed  suitable  to  date Milly: “Do you mind my asking why a man like you hasn’t found  a woman already?” Daphne asked. In the horror film Maniac  2012 , on  her first date with her online match, Frank  Elijah Wood , Lucie  Megan  Duffy  asked him, “Why don’t you have a girlfriend?” In the drama In  Search of a Midnight Kiss  2007 , when Vivian  Sara Simmonds  was on a  first date with Stevie  Bruce Jay —a man she had met online—she com- mented, “So you seem like a really nice guy. Why are you posting ads on  CraigsList? I mean, don’t you think that’s a little pathetic?” In the Belgian  sci-fi film Thomas est amoureux  Thomas in Love   2000 , the agoraphobic  title character  Benoît Verhaert  met a woman via a dating site and asked  her, “You seem rather cute. Your face at least. What is your problem?”  In  the  thriller  Hard  Candy   2005 ,  during  their  first  real-life  meeting,  Hayley  Ellen Page  remarked to Jeff  Patrick Wilson , “You just don’t  look like the kind of guy who has to meet girls over the Internet.” In  the “No Ordinary Mobster” episode of the superhero series No Ordinary  Family  2010–2011 , teenager JJ  Jimmy Bennett , discovered that his  tutor, Katie  Autumn Reeser , was dating online and expressed puzzle- ment: “That doesn’t make any sense,” said JJ, “I mean, why are you meet- ing guys online? You’re, like, amazing.” The same bemusement played out  in a conversation between Rowena  Halle Berry  and her boss Harrison   Bruce Willis  in the thriller Perfect Stranger  2007 :    Actually, I’m thinking about joining Match.com.  Rowena:  Harrison:  No you’re not. Are you kidding me? Rowena:  Harrison:  You’re gorgeous.    Lots of people date online.  In  each  example,  suspicion  was  verbalized:  The  date  apparently  seemed “too good” to be online dating—the mating terrain, apparently,       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    185  reserved for society’s rejects—and therefore was worthy of suspicion. This  very  idea,  in  fact,  was  mentioned  in  the  romantic-comedy  A  Cinder- ella Story  2004 . Before the teens Sam  Hilary Duff  and Austin  Chad  Michael Murray  had met in person, Sam expressed hesitation to her  friend, Carter  Dan Byrd : “This guy’s too good to be true . . . What if I  meet him and I’m not what he expects? Maybe this whole relationship’s  just better for cyberspace.” Similar suspicions—and phrasing—was used  in the “Girls, Girls, Girls” episode of Supernatural, when it was revealed  that Dean  Jensen Ackles  had been using the CrushBook dating app.  “It’s too good to be true,” Sam  Jared Padalecki  said of one of Dean’s  beautiful  matches.  Worth  noting,  the  too  good  to  be  true  cautionary  note is, in fact, widespread in online dating literature,33 and therefore  it is, unsurprising that such ideas are common on screen, reflecting an  assumed cultural truth.  Another example of the assumed bad intentions of Internet users is  identifiable in scenes where online activity is presumed—in the context of  an investigation storyline—to have a role in crime. In the aforementioned  Without a Trace episode, for example, the murder at the center of the narra- tive was assumed to be linked to the victim’s online dating. The explosion  in the “Two Bodies in the Lab” episode of Bones was quickly connected  to the man Temperance had met online. The same theme of online dating  as complicit in crime was apparent in the “Generation of Vipers” episode  of the British crime series Lewis  2007– , when online dating was quickly  assumed to have something to do with a professor’s murder. The “New  Evidence” and “Hammerhead Sharks” episodes of The Practice centered  on the case of a woman who was murdered and who had been exchanging  erotic e-mails with Dennis  Ted Marcoux , who was thus immediately  suspected of murder. The title and most of the plot of the thriller Murder  Dot Com  2008  explicitly implied that a website had something to do  with the murder at the center of the narrative. In the “Paranoia” episode  of Law & Order  1990–2010 , when a girl was found stabbed to death;  detectives  immediately  began  pursuing  “some  kinkoid  in  cyberspace”  who had participated in explicit online discussions. A similar narrative  transpired in the “Babes” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  when a pregnant teenage girl, Fidelia  Jessica Varley , appeared to have  committed suicide after being cyberbullied. The exact same speculation  played out in the “Knuckle Up” episode of Cold Case  2003–2010 , where  an online video of a fight was assumed as evidence of cyberbullying. In  each of these examples, the crimes, in fact, turned out to have nothing  to  do  with  the  Internet  at  all.  Each  example  however,  highlighted  the    186   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  assumption that the Internet is evil—exploiting the techno- and cyber- phobias existing in real life—even if, within the narrative, the Internet  served only as a red herring.  The  first  obvious  interpretation  for  the  themes  discussed  thus  far  is  the trend in popular culture for characters associated with the Internet— particularly those involved with online dating—as being somehow outliers  or aberrant: As psychologists Monica Whitty and Adrian Carr identified,  “the media would have us believe that cyberspace is full of an assortment  of  freaks  and  geeks.”34 While  the  idea  of  Internet  users  as  different  or  deviant is most easily detectable in the earliest Web-themed narratives,  such themes also exist in modern narratives, paradoxically so, of course,  given that most people now regularly use the Internet and online dating  is common. A cycle, therefore, is apparent: that film and television depict  cyberbogeymen and those presentations become part of cultural mythol- ogy that, in turn, helps to justify evermore negative screen examples, even  if such a dynamic bears little semblance to the real world of Internet use. Another underpinning of the screen’s cyberbogeyman is—as alluded  to by Phillips in his work on horror in cinema—its entrenched existence  in cultural mythology: that film and television reflect the anxieties of our  culture. A survey, for example, conducted by the Pew Research Center,  found that 66 percent of Internet users thought that online dating was  dangerous and, of those who had actually tried it, 43 percent claimed they  believed it was risky.35 In sexual health researchers Danielle Couch, Pra- nee Liamputtong, and Marian Pitts’ study on online dating, the authors  quoted  several  participants  who  articulated  their  own  cyberbogeymen  fears: “Estelle,” for example, noted, “i think your also hopeing that the  person isn’t like some serial killer” [sic], while “Tommy” claimed, “you  never know if you’re going to meet an axe murderer.” “Clarissa” in the  same study said, “I think dating sites are extremely dangerous. They are  Psychopaths playgrounds.” 36 The sociologist John Bridges quoted “Joyce”  in his book The Illusion of Intimacy. Joyce had once been a former Match. com user and described her experiences: “They just feed on women and  men who are hurting and all they do is provide a tool for perverts.”37  While popular media, as discussed, is one contributor to real-life cyber- bogeyman fears, another are self-help books designed to prepare people— presumably women—for the modern dating landscape. In Mel Robbins’s  self-help book Stop Saying You’re Fine: Discover a More Powerful You, for  example, she discussed “Kathleen” who had “tried the online dating thing,  but the few men she ‘winked’ at never winked back, and she lived in fear  that anyone she might meet for coffee would turn out to be a psycho.”38       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    187  In the self-help book The Joy of Text: Mating, Dating, and Techno-Relating,  Kristina  Grish  similarly  normalized  the  psycho  idea  and  also  provided  some legitimacy for it by linking it to the technology rather than just wild  imaginings: “For those who fear psycho stalkers  which is, like, everyone ,  techno-relating has both intensified live stalking and created a new type of  cyber stalker.”39 Kerry Daynes and Jessica Fellowes in their self-help book  The Devil You Know made a similar point:  With the steep growth of online dating in recent years, the need to be  vigilant about exactly who you’re planning to share a bottle of wine with  is greater than ever. A psychopath can hide his true self behind a computer  screen with ease.40  On one hand, the fears of the bogeyman are part of the long his- tory of fears of “bad men” and, more specifically, fears of suitors met  through anonymous channels. While the bogeyman fears are evident  in Internet-age dating advice, the very same fears of meeting a cyber- psycho,  a  loony,  or  a  murderer  have  long  been  articulated  in  advice  completely separate from it. In a 1992 Orlando Sentinel article on blind  dating, for example, the fears of the unknown were articulated at a time  before online dating:  Because we’re meeting on neutral turf, lunch dates allow us to maintain  our privacy. We may not want someone to know where we live until we  can be reasonably sure the person is not a psycho. Those who use the per- sonal ads would be wise to meet blind dates over lunch.41  Unlike personal ads and blind dating, of course, online dating is an enor- mous industry whereby participation has now become mainstream—so much  so, in fact, that as Bridges noted, this method has replaced many others and  is often conceived of as “the only game in town.”42 In turn, with more people  involved, more people are feeling apprehensive about meeting a psycho—in  turn normalizing this fear—and, as Grish alluded there is, simply, a greater  likelihood of more psychos in a larger dating pool. While in the pre-Internet  dating age, the idea of meeting a psycho or a pervert through anonymous chan- nels was still a concern, the Internet—both in reality and through its popular  media depiction—is the catalyst for epidemic fears of what if. Worth noting,  news media has a role in conjuring these fears too, whereby, as discussed in this  book’s introduction, a victim or perpetrator’s online life is often spotlighted  in crime coverage, the assumption being that unlike other common human  experiences, use of the Internet is perceived as a risk factor in crime.   188   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  A key factor that fueled blind date fears in the past, and that under- pins online dating fears today, is anonymity. As discussed in Chapter 3,  the idea of not having to look at another person means that some of the  deterrents to, and ways of detecting, deceit are absent in turn creating  very specific challenges  and paranoias .  The Anonymous Online Dating Bogeyman  In A Cinderella Story, during one of Sam and Austin’s first in-person   meetings they had the following exchange:  Austin:  You do actually go to North Valley high school, right? Sam:  Austin:  Well, I’m just checking, you never know with the Internet.  Of course.  The you never know with the Internet idea was similarly alluded to in  the “Body of Evidence” episode of the British crime-drama New Tricks   2003– , when the police department’s IT expert, Xander  Andy Rush ,  explained how difficult it is to gauge identity online: “This is the Inter- net. The cloak of anonymity. Nobody knows who anybody is.” Austin  and Xander both reference anonymity; while anonymity is not unique to  the Internet,43 the technology makes being anonymity easier, if not even  normalizes it: as Tiffani  Rebekah Kochan  commented in Eating Out 3:  All You Can Eat, “Don’t you know anything about the Internet? You’re  supposed to make a fake profile.”  On screen, the bogeyman possibilities grounded in anonymous encoun- ters  are  readily  identifiable.  In  the  comedy-drama  Burn  after  Reading   2008 , Linda  Frances McDormand  discussed her online dating expe- riences with her colleague Ted  Richard Jenkins . Two of Ted’s caution- ary remarks included, “Linda, what do you really know about this guy?”  and—in line with the psycho and pervert fears alluded to earlier—“You  know, he could be one of these guys who cruises the Internet.” A similar  comment was made in the “Pilgrimage” episode of the comedy-drama  series  Nurse  Jackie   2009– :  Dr.  Cooper   Peter  Facinelli   had  started  online dating and his colleague, Dr. Roman  Betty Gilpin , cautioned,  “Do you have any idea what kind of women troll those sites?”  On  one  hand,  anonymity  can  simply  be  construed  as  a  fact  of  the  Internet:  Unless  one  actively  chooses  to  divulge  identity  or  to  provide  accurate photos, the physical separation of individuals means that they  are, by default, communicating anonymously. On the surface anonymity  isn’t necessarily good or bad, and certainly on screen the concealment of       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    189  identity boasts positive and negative attributes. In terms of positives, as  Dr. Hobson  Clare Holman  commented in the “Generation of Vipers”  episode of Lewis, “Online you can reveal yourself relatively painlessly.”  Similar positive spins are apparent in other screen examples. At the begin- ning of You’ve Got Mail, for example, Joe’s e-mail to Kathleen contained  the  lines,  “I  would  send  you  a  bouquet  of  newly-sharpened  pencils  if  I knew your name and address. On the other hand, this not knowing  has its charms.” Kathleen similarly requested “no specifics” in her cor- respondence  with  Joe,  also  seemingly  finding  appeal  in  the  not  know- ing. In an early scene in the “Two Bodies in the Lab” episode of Bones,  when Temperance’s online match, David, suggested an offline meeting,  she appeared reluctant: “I’m enjoying the anonymity,” she admitted. In  “The Practice around the Corner” episode of the British series Doc Martin   2004– , Al  Joe Absolom  discussed with his father, Bert  Ian McNeice ,  his online dating adventures and similarly noted, “It’s anonymous so it  keeps it interesting.” In each example, safety and mystery are identified as  positive features of identity concealment. Another aspect to this appeal is  that by concealing one’s physical self, daters are compelled to get to know  each other based on personality and intellectual factors. The benefits of  this were verbalized in the “Who Is Max Mouse—Part 1” episode of the  children’s  series  Ghostwriter   1992–1995 :  Student  Erica   Julia  Stiles ,  for example, lauded the technology claiming, “It’s a world where you are  judged by what you say and think, not by what you look like. A world  where curiosity and imagination equals power.” Jeff in Hard Candy made  a similar remark: “I think it’s better to meet people online first sometimes.  You get to know what they’re like inside.” Certainly for Ellenor  Camryn  Manheim  in the first season of The Practice, her hesitancy in meeting her  online date was grounded in fears of being judged on her weight. In the  same series, in “The Obstacle Course” episode, Douglas  Arturo Gil  had  concealed his status as a dwarf online because he feared judgment.  More commonly, anonymity is framed on screen as something prob- lematic:  If  identity  can  be  concealed  online,  so  too  can  duplicitous  intent.  The Duplicitous Online Dating Bogeyman  In the “Body of Evidence” episode of New Tricks, Xander explained   deception online:  Who people are in real life and who they are online can be two very dif- ferent things . . . The beautiful blonde 25-year-old whose husband’s away    190   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  and wants good times with no strings attached, is probably a group of  eighteen-year-old  lads,  back  from  the  pub,  having  a  big  laugh  at  your  expense . . . Or a gay man . . . Or a group of gay men, on the beer, tempt- ing you to show your stuff on webcam . . . Who [the murder victim]  Martin was here may not be who he was there [on the Internet].  Here, Xander alludes to an idea widely verbalized on screen about  not merely the possibility of being lied to online but lies being told  about very specific things, for example, gender; something at the heart  of many cyberbogeyman fears. Discussed earlier was the Buffy the Vam- pire  Slayer  scene  where  Xander  mentioned  that  the  Internet  would  allow him to claim to be an elderly Dutch woman. In an early online  chat scene from A Cinderella Story, Austin wrote to Sam, “You’re not  a guy right? If you are, I’ll kick your butt.” In the comedy-drama Me  and You and Everyone We Know  2005 , two young boys were in a chat  room  and  the  older  one,  Peter   Miles  Thompson ,  speculated  about  the woman they were chatting with: “Everyone just makes stuff up on  these things. It’s probably a man pretending to be a woman.” Gender  deception was similarly alluded to in “The One with Barry and Mindy’s  Wedding” episode of the sitcom Friends  1994–2004  when Chandler   Matthew  Perry   discussed  his  new  online  romance  with  his  friend  Phoebe  Lisa Kudrow :  Phoebe:   Chandler:  Phoebe:    You know, I think it’s so great that you are totally into this person  and yet, for all you know, she could be ninety years old or have  two heads or . . . It could be a guy. It’s not a guy, alright? I know her. It could be a big giant guy.  In  the  comedy  Sex  Drive   2008 ,  Ian   Josh  Zuckerman   and  his  brother Rex  James Marsden  were driving and Ian divulged his burgeon- ing romance and Rex, like Phoebe, highlighted the possibility of gender  deception:  Ian:   There is a girl I’ve been, kind of— Rex:  Alright, I’m listening. Where’d you meet her? Ian:   On the . . . online. Rex:    [Abruptly stops the car] For fuck’s sake, Ian! Don’t you watch Dateline?  [1992–] She’s probably a guy. Some fat old dude who wants to ram you  in the tail pipe.      T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    191  In Disconnect  2012 , gender deception fears emerged while the jour- nalist  Nina   Andrea  Riseborough   was  arranging  to  meet  Kyle   Max  Thieriot , an 18-year-old source for her story on cybercrime:  Nina:  Listen Kyle, there’s something I didn’t tell you about myself. Kyle:   What are you, a dude?  In the “How I Met Everyone Else” episode of the sitcom How I Met  Your  Mother   2005–2014 ,  Barney   Neil  Patrick  Harris   cautioned  his  friend Ted  Josh Radnor  about the perils of online dating, again articu- lating a gender deception concern: “The only hot girls that troll the Inter- net for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.” The same idea was articulated  in the documentary Lil Bub & Friendz  2013 . One of the interviewees,  Grant Mayland—termed “Minneapolis 1 cat video fan”—reflected on  his late 1990s experiences in chat rooms:  It was 1998 when my mom got me AOL, I started going into chat rooms.  And things just kind of grew from there. I went into a lot of the really  dirty lesbian chatrooms . . . I mean everyone was you know, probably  either a 15 or 45 year old guy. I think at the time I was secretly aware but  I fantasized that it wasn’t.44  Each of these scenes are premised on the simple fear of the deceptive- capacities of new technology: that people will exploit technology to mis- represent things as basic as gender; that the Internet makes this effortless.  While actual deceit about gender is addressed later in this chapter, the  mere fear of it references several interesting issues. First, the preoccupa- tion with gender reflects not merely the apparent importance of binary  understandings of it but also connects to a well-established history of  anxieties  about  gender  deception:  The  historian  Elizabeth  Reis  traced  concerns about gender deception back to the 1500s.45 Shakespeare’s play  The Twelfth Night is an early fictionalized portrayal of this theme from  1602. Another explanation for the intensity of such fears relates to the  ubiquitousness of real-life discussions about the topic. In communica- tions scholar Jeffrey Hancock’s work on digital deception, he identified  that “gender deception is perhaps the most commonly discussed example  of  category  deception  online.”46  While  actual  gender  deception  does  transpire  discussed later in this chapter  the simple fear of it has long  dominated  the  discourse.  Such  fears,  of  course,  center  largely  on  vul- nerability: that putting yourself out there comes with the possibility that    192   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  vulnerability could be exploited. In the 1980s, a case documented by the  writer Lindsy Van Gelder centered on “Joan,” an online identity created  by  Alex,  a  male  psychiatrist,  who  chatted  on  CompuServe,  an  hourly  rate Internet service used until the mid-1990s.47 While the case is an  early example of computer-aided gender deception, most interesting are  the reactions of the “victims”; something psychologist Patricia Wallace  examined:  Some were angry at any gender deception, while others, less concerned  about online gender-swapping, were outraged by the thought that Alex  was using the online “Joan” persona to front for him so he could hear inti- mate self-disclosure from women and also, experience lesbianism vicari- ously. Most, but not all, agreed that Alex violated some trust or other.48  Another aspect to this fear centers on homosexual panic: as apparent in  Me and You and Everyone We Know, Friends, Sex Drive, Disconnect, How  I Met Your Mother, and Lil Bub & Friendz, men feared being approached  online by another man: that they could somehow be tricked, perhaps,  into having affections for another man. The sociologist Michael Kimmel  identifies the serious fear of men’s humiliation when it comes to sexual  matters;49 undoubtedly the idea that their online love interest could be a  man fuels rampant technophobia.  Another category of assumed deception centers on appearance: People  will  lie  about  how  they  look  simply  because  they  can.  In  Meet  Prince  Charming, for example, at one point Samantha asks Jack, “What if you’re  yucky?” In You’ve Got Mail, just prior to Joe first seeing Kathleen in per- son, Joe’s colleague, Kevin  Dave Chappelle , warned him, “She could be  a real dog.” Later in the film—when Kathleen hadn’t yet realized that Joe  was NY152—Joe teasingly speculated about the appearance of NY152:  “Maybe  he’s  fat,  he’s  fat,  he’s  a  fatty.”  In  the  aforementioned  “Juliet  Takes  a  Luvvah”  episode  of  Psych,  Shawn  warned  Gus,  “Everyone  lies  on these things. Of course, she looks all pretty online. When you show  up at the restaurant, guess who’s waiting for you at the bar? The New  Delhi version of Colonel Sanders, with a wig.” In the Canadian televi- sion romance Perfect Romance  2004 —very similar to the plot of Because  I Said So—Tess  Kathleen Quinlan  went online to find her daughter,  Jenny  Lori Heuring , a partner. The man Tess selected had not supplied  a photo; something that Jenny found egregious: “Mom! He could be fat,  hideous, sporting a comb-over.” In the “Surprise” episode of the sitcom  Mike and Molly  2010– , Samuel  Nyambi Nyambi  discussed his online       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    193  dating experiences with his friends Mike  Billy Gardell  and Carl  Reno  Wilson  and again appearance deceit is referenced:  Samuel:   Mike:    This is the woman I’ve been telling you about. She is also from  Africa.  That picture ain’t Africa, that’s Lincoln Park. I recognize the hot  dog vendor. Gary. Or Jerry. She is a beautiful woman if that is indeed her real picture.  Carl:  Samuel:  What are you talking about? Carl:    People lie all the time on these dating sites. I once tried hooking up  with this hot Filipino chick. Ended up being a short Guatemalan  man named Roberto.  In each scene an assumption of duplicity centered on appearance: As with  gender, a person can lie about something as basic as how they look simply  because physical revelation can be avoided, or at least delayed, online.  While fears of appearance deception get normalized on screen through  them being widely spoken of, the same point is made via surprise expressed  when a date actually looks like their photo. In the “Two Bodies in the  Lab”  episode  of  Bones,  for  example,  when Temperance  finally  met  her  online date, David, he commented, “Your picture doesn’t do you justice  by the way,” to which she responded, “Thank you. Yours either.” In the  “Jenny & Nick” episode of the British series Dates  2013 , Nick  Neil  Maskell   complimented  Jenny   Sheridan  Smith ,  “Your  picture  doesn’t  do you justice . . . Different in the flesh. Prettier.” In The Girl He Met  Online, when Gillian first met Andy  Shawn Roberts  in person, Andy  commented,  “You’re  even  more  beautiful  in  person,”  to  which  Gillian  replied,  “Thank  you.  I  guess  you  never  know  with  someone  you  meet  online.” The same thing transpired in the “Valentine’s Day in Quahog”  episode of the animated series Family Guy  1999– : When Meg first met  Toby in person she remarked, “Wow, you look just like your picture,”  and Toby similarly responded, “You’re much prettier in person.”50 In the  comedy The Virginity Hit  2010 , when the teenager Matt  Matt Bennett   first met Becca  Savannah Welch  in person, he commented, “You look  even prettier than the pictures that you sent. You look prettier in real- life.” In the romantic-comedy Must Love Dogs  2005 , Jake  John Cusack   similarly was, predictably, very surprised when he met Sarah  Diane Lane   in person:  Jake:    Why did you write voluptuous? No . . . I did not mean to be rude at all.  It’s just that voluptuous, you know, that tends to go the other way . . .    194   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  It’s just one of those words they use in personal ads like Rubenesque  or weight proportionate to height. Right? . . . If a girl says athletic she  usually means flat-chested.  In a scene from Untraceable, Jennifer  Diane Lane  and her colleague  Griffin  Colin Hanks  had a conversation about his online dating adven- tures and the same appearance incredulity was expressed:  Griffin:    I’m almost positive that my first date last night is eligible for the  hall of fame. She was amazing, she looked exactly like her photo.  Jennifer:  You’ll never see her again. Griffin:  How do you know? Jennifer:  Because you look nothing like yours.  In Maniac, on her first date with Frank, Lucie admitted that he was  not what she had expected; her imaginings involved “long black hair and  greasy skin full of acne.”  While,  as  discussed  later  in  this  chapter,  lies  about  appearance— akin to lies about gender—do actually transpire both in real life and  on  screen,  for  this  section  I  focus  exclusively  on  the  cyberbogeyman  assumptions. On the most basic level these scenes each highlight appre- hensions about the veracity of claims made online. Equally such scenes  showcase  just  how  appearance-centric  our  culture  is;  that  of  all  the  things that could possibly go wrong on a date, an unattractive date is  apparently considered one of the worst. While, as outlined above, fic- tionalized depictions of such fears are easily detected, the same assump- tions are also identifiable in published works. In a 1996 article about  online dating from The Independent, for example, Christa Worthington  discussed “Kerry”:  IRL  in real life , Kerry  not her real name  roller-blades into the Bowery  Bar, a cool downtown restaurant in New York, to tell me her story. She is  not fat. She is not ugly. She is attractive—a stage performer who moves  in arty circles. She left her husband of five years for Jim, whom she met  online.51  The fact that Worthington felt it necessary to identify that Kerry was  not fat nor ugly appears to be a reference to widespread perceptions of  the  typical  online  dater:  Going  online  to  meet  people  is  a  last  resort  for  the  unfuckable.  Other  published  works  similarly  help  to  normal- ize assumptions about online daters and in turn normalize ideas about       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    195  appearance deception. Diane Mapes’s book How to Date in a Post-Dating  World provides a typical illustration of such assumptions:  Lying is a huge concern for almost everyone who goes online, although our  fears over what people lie about usually depend on who we are. Accord- ing to Judy McGuire, who writes the syndicated column “Dategirl,” it’s  simple. “Women worry that the guys they meet on the Internet are going  to be serial killers. Men only worry that the women are going to be fat.”52  While Mapes spotlights ideas that relate well to the scenes already dis- cussed in this section where characters fear serial killers and fatness53— more broadly, she highlights the people lie idea; a truism repeated in many  personal  development  books  about  online  dating54  and  an  idea  often  framed as both a warning and a what-not-to-do online. Equally, while  instances of deceit are documented in academic literature—addressed later  in this chapter—so too is the simple fear of it. Psychologists Jessica Donn  and Richard Sherman identified widespread apprehensions among online  daters  about  honesty  regarding  appearance.55  Communications  schol- ars Jennifer Gibbs, Nicole Ellison, and Rebecca Heino similarly found  that  most  online  daters  assume  that  extensive  misrepresentation  about  appearance occurs online.56 Couch, Liamputtong, and Pitts noted also  that most participants in their study were concerned about deceit online:  “These concerns tended to focus on inaccurate photos or the provision of  incorrect details about relationship status.”57 While media portrayals help  to normalize such fears, it is worth noting that such depictions can also be  construed as mirroring widespread real-life beliefs.  Thus  far  I  have  explored  cyberbogeyman  fears  where  verbalized  assumptions of deceit transpire rather than actual acts of it. In the follow- ing sections, many of the fears harbored actually manifest in real acts of  deception in film and television narratives.  White-Lie Deception  In the Argentinian film Medianeras  Sidewalls   2011 , Martín  Javier  Drolas  was on a date with a woman he had met online. Despite telling  her that he doesn’t speak French, the woman continued to do so. The  audience hears Martín’s mental musings about the date:  These dates are like McDonalds combos. They look larger and more deli- cious in the photographs. Every time I go on a date, I suffer from the same  deception as with a Big Mac.   196   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Martín alludes to a kind of deception that is common in online dat- ing narratives: low level deception whereby something more—or at least  something better—is promised than what arrives.  In this section, casual white-lie deception manifests in things such as  name and appearance. While these lies are generally told to secure a first  date rather than to cause financial, psychological, or physical harm, these  examples nevertheless provide some stepping stones to the more serious  kinds of online deceptions transpiring on screen, as well as contributing  to the normalizing of cyberbogeyman suspicions off screen.  This  section  begins  with  a  discussion  of  accidental  deceit  whereby  deception  transpires  without  malicious  intentions:  In  You’ve  Got  Mail,  for example, Kathleen and Joe were able to keep their identities hidden  for as long as they did simply because they were using the “Shopgirl” and  “NY152” screen names. Such pseudonyms conceal identity and in turn  often lead to accidental deception; something that frequently transpires  in narratives where an online meeting transpires between two people who  are already known to each other offline.  The Online Dating Devil You Know  Disguise and mistaken identity have long been themes in popular cul- ture. Literature scholar Joel Black noted, for example, “From Plautus to  Shakespeare to Dickens to Hitchcock, the device of mistaken identity has  served as a  usually comic  means of stimulating characters’ desires and  titillating audiences.”58 In literature scholar Wolfgang Clemen’s work on  Shakespeare, he discussed the mistaken identity plot device, spotlighting  how in plays such as Twelfth Night and Two Gentleman from Verona “dis- guise is used to bring about complications, comic surprises, unexpected  disclosures and confrontations.”59 In popular media, this same motif is  easily  detected  in  Internet-themed  narratives.  You’ve  Got  Mail  is  men- tioned several times in this chapter and is an example discussed by film  theorist Geoff King in his discussion of the mistaken identity motif:  You’ve Got Mail, like Bringing Up Baby [1938], is structured around the  contrasting characteristics of the two principals and issues of mistaken  unrevealed identity . . . The comedy is located primarily in the situation  created  by  the  multi-layered  and  conflicting  nature  of  the  relationship  established through these unequal distributions of knowledge.60  You’ve Got Mail begins with two putatively anonymous strangers cor- responding  via  e-mail.  Early  in,  Kathleen’s  colleague,  Christina,  joked       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    197  about  the  possibility  for  mistaken unrevealed  identity  when  she  sug- gested,  “God,  he  could  be  the  next  person  to  walk  into  the  store.  He  could be . . . George.” Later, of course, Christina’s joke actually hints to  the central plot: Despite their burgeoning online romance, Shopgirl and  NY152 are known to each other offline as real-life business rivals. In Must  Love Dogs, both Sarah and her father, Bill  Christopher Plummer  signed  up for online dating at the same time; Sarah’s first date turned out to  be with her father. The same mistaken revealed dynamics were apparent  in the “Emo-tion Caption” episode of the Canadian series jPod  2008 :  When Cowboy  Benjamin Ayres  arranged to meet up with the woman  he had met online it turned out to be his sister, Jennifer  Dena Ashbaugh .  In the “The One with Barry and Mindy’s Wedding” episode of Friends,  Chandler’s online romance turned out to be with his offline ex-girlfriend,  Janice  Maggie Wheeler : The two had been corresponding without any  knowledge whatsoever of who the other was. In the “Sexual Perversity in  Cleveland” episode of the sitcom The Drew Carey Show  1995–2004 , the  protagonist  Drew Carey  had a raunchy encounter in a sex chat room.  Afterwards, Drew discovered that the chat was with his workplace nem- esis colleague, Mimi  Kathy Kinney . Another example centered on a sex  chat room, transpired in the “Daddy Dearest  Sonny Boy ” episode of  Queer as Folk  2000–2005 . Emmett  Peter Paige  had just admitted to  his friend Ted  Scott Lowell  his reluctance to meet his “cyber boyfriend”  in person due to the fact that he’d lied about his appearance in his pro- file. His fraudulent description—“big, smooth, 6'2", 190 pounds, four  percent body fat, uncut”—led Ted to realize, “Jesus, I think I did it with  you  last  week.”  In  the  “California  Girls”  episode  of  the  family-drama  Make It or Break It  2009–2012 , on Chloe’s  Susan Ward  first in-person  date she discovered that the man she had been communicating with was  Steve  Anthony Starke , the father of one of her daughter’s gymnastics  colleagues. In the television holiday film A Christmas Song  2012 , nem- esis  colleagues  Diana   Natasha  Henstridge   and  Ken   Gabriel  Hogan   were matched online on two separate occasions. In the “Girl Trouble”  episode  of  the  crime-drama  Nash  Bridges   1996–2001 ,  Joe   Cheech  Marin  assumed he had embarked on a romance with a woman over the  Internet; the “woman” turned out to be Pepe  Patrick Fischler  his office  manager. In “The Practice around the Corner” episode of Doc Martin,  the first online dating match that Al met in person was his housemate  Morwenna  Jessica Ransom . A variation on this same idea transpired in  the gay-themed romantic-comedy Is It Just Me?  2010 : Blaine  Nicholas   Downs —who  was  looking  online  for  “more  than  what’s  behind  a    198   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  zipper”—eventually  connected  with  Xander   David  Loren .  The  two  developed a good relationship through phone and online contact. Blaine  then realized that he had first connected with Xander via a chat site by  mistakenly using his housemate, Cameron’s  Adam Huss  account. When  Xander met Cameron in person, he assumed that he was the man he had  fallen for rather than Blaine: Comic drama thus ensued. The same idea  played out in another gay-themed romantic-comedy Breaking the Cycle   2002 : Jason  Carlos da Silva  and Chad  Ryan White  were housemates  who had been, unbeknownst to each other, chatting together online.   On one level these scenes are just modern takes on the mistaken identity  plot device that authors have been using for hundreds of years: You’ve Got  Mail, for example, was a remake of another romantic-comedy predating  online dating: The Shop Around the Corner  1940 , a film that, inciden- tally,  was  based  on  the  even  older  play  Illatszertár   Parfumerie   written  by Miklós László in 1937. Arguably, in fact, the Internet is the perfect  vehicle for this narrative in a world where masquerade balls are scarce but  usernames and avatars are ubiquitous. More specifically, however, these  Internet-aided  mistaken  identity  plots  point  to  numerous  themes  that,  while not restricted to the Internet, are certainly amplified by it. One such  factor is hastened intimacy: The Internet speeds up rapport, in turn char- acters become intimate quickly  perhaps before actually knowing many  important personal details . This idea was identified as early as 1995, when  psychologists  Martin  Lea  and  Russell  Spears  identified  that  “the  visual  anonymity of the communicators and the lack of copresence—indeed the  physical  isolation—of  the  communicators  add  to  the  interaction  possi- bilities, and for some this is the ‘magic’ of on-line relationships.”61 More  recently, philosopher Aaron Ben-Ze’ev made a similar point:  It is not surprising that people often fall in love with their therapist, law- yer, or priest. Online relations are similar in this regard: people can freely  express their emotions and become emotionally close without being vul- nerable. Accordingly, it is also easier to fall in love on the Net.62  Bridges also explored this same phenomenon, pointing to a lowering  of one’s guard online: “It is sometimes true, according to this pattern as  recognized by my interviewees, that emails and conversations can assume  a familiarity in tone in the initial stages.”63 The psychologists Al Cooper  and Eric Griffin-Shelley made a similar point:  Computers speed things up. With regard to sexuality, this shift in speed  evokes intense emotional reactions. For instance, flirtation and innuendo,       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    199  long the staples of leisurely seduction, can rapidly escalate into frank sex- ual discussions and proposals on the Internet.64  While it seems on the surface, a little idiotic that in Must Love Dogs  two characters knew so little about each other prior to their first date that  they could miss the fact that they were related, or in Doc Martin that the  two were roommates, in both cases the characters told small deceits—in  Must Love Dogs Bill lied about his age and in Doc Martin both characters  lied about their profession—and with this, combined with the backdrop  of both anonymity and hastened intimacy, such outcomes become more  plausible.  Another  aspect  to  this—and  an  additional  driving  factor  of  hastened intimacy—is the fact that each of the characters in these mis- taken identity narratives were online with the specific intention of making  a connection. Slater discussed some of the unique properties of online  romance and made a simple point about the why of hastened intimacy:  “If she’s on a dating site there’s a good chance she’s eager to connect.”65 In  each of the scenes discussed in this section, the simple motive of wanting  to connect can make for a rapid, as well as intimate, match online and that  the yen for connection—and the speed by which it transpires—means  that much of the work of seduction and rapport-building is mitigated  simply by eagerness. This idea was actually spoken aloud by Kathleen in  You’ve Got Mail in an e-mail to Joe:  I like to start my notes to you as if we’re already in the middle of a conver- sation. I pretend that we’re the oldest and dearest friends—as opposed to  what we actually are, people who don’t know each other’s names and met  in a chat room where we both claimed we’d never been before.  Kathleen’s desire for rapport of the oldest and dearest friends kind likely  explains the speed by which she and Joe connected but also why she was  seemingly blind to his true identity.  The  idea  of  wanting  an  online  connection—and  thus  allowing  it  to  color and manipulate online interactions—might be an explanation for  why many of the connections discussed in this section didn’t actually last  offline. While online the yen to connect may be a sufficient motive for  romance, in real life other factors such as chemistry and physical attrac- tion matter more  not to mention the deal breaker of shared genetics . An  extension of this idea is that anonymity can be a specific fuel that rapidly  dissipates once identity is revealed. Discussed earlier were comments made  in You’ve Got Mail, the “Two Bodies in the Lab” episode of Bones, and the  “The Practice around the Corner” episode of Doc Martin where characters    200   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  admitted to enjoying anonymity. This idea relates well to a central appeal  of  online  communications:  The  technology  allows  a  person  to  rehearse  new identities. In a scene from the thriller Net Games  2003 , Ray  Sam  Ball  touted the benefits of a sex chat site: “You’ve got bored housewives,  college co-eds, divorcees, widows . . . You get to have cybersex with abso- lutely  no  commitment. You  don’t  like  one  chick,  you  click  on  another  one. You don’t like that chick, click. You don’t like her, click. Click, click.  Whatever. You don’t like ‘em all, just one click, you log off, you never hear  from any of them again.” While this scene showcases the disposability of  relationships forged online, it also illustrates that each new and  initially   anonymous  interaction  provides  the  capacity  for  identity  reinvention.  Ben-Ze’ev discussed this idea where he noted, “Cyberspace is similar to  fictional space in the sense that in both cases the flight into virtual reality  is not so much a denial of reality as a form of exploring and playing with  it.”66 Monica Whitty and Adam Joinson pose a similar question in regard  to the appropriateness of dubbing such behavior as deceit: “Lies or a dif- ferent  presentation  of  self?”67  In  Men, Women  &  Children  the  teenager  Brandy  Kaitlyn Dever  divulged using the Internet for these exact iden- tity-rehearsal purposes: “I have a secret, a Tumblr account, and it’s like the  only place I can go to where I can just be myself.” The documentary Tal- hotblond  2009 , centered on a middle-aged man, Thomas Montgomery,  who posed online as a young marine. In the documentary, the psychologist  Rex Beaber analyzed: “‘MarineSniper’ is somebody inside of Montgomery  who has not come out and who is desperately struggling to do so.” In the  “Mikado” episode of the Millennium  1996–1999 , identity play was also  discussed in a conversation between protagonist Frank  Lance Henriksen ,  his colleague Peter  Terry O’Quinn , and the IT specialist Brian  Allan  Zinyk  as related to the online activity of a murder victim:  Frank:  Her pseudonym online was Queen Libido. Peter:    These [e-mails] are quite explicit. Doesn’t sync with a librarian from  the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.  Some people feel liberated from their normal self when they adopt  an Internet persona. In the anonymity of cyberspace people are free  to experiment. Online I’ve changed my name, my appearance, sexual  orientation. Even gender.  Brian:   Peter:  That’s more personal information than I need, Brian.  The same point was made in the horror film Strangeland  1998  when  Angela  Amy Smart  outlined some of the appeal of the Internet: “I don’t  have to be me. I mean, sometimes I pretend I’m some goody two-shoes prom       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    201  queen  and  then  I  can  change  my  online  name  and  become  hellraising  b-girl.” In Catfish, Angela—rather than being the glamourpuss Nev had  been  led  to  believe  he  would  be  meeting—turned  out  to  be  a  frumpy  housewife. Angela deployed her online identity to, seemingly, escape her  life of caring for two intellectually disabled boys: “A lot of the personalities  that came out were just fragments of myself. Fragments of things I used to  be, wanted to be, never could be,” she explained.  While different selves can be a way of playing with identity, it can also  be a means of broadening one’s appeal in the online dating market. In  Must Love Dogs, for example, Dolly  Stockard Channing  explained her  dating strategy to Sarah:  Dolly:  You’re on this, aren’t you? Sarah:  PerfectMatch.com. Dolly:  What? Just one site? Sarah:  Yeah. Dolly:    Honey, you got to put more bets on the table. I’m on at least ten. You  get to try out different personalities. Like here, I say, I’m into opera,  antiques, poetry in the original Greek. In this one I like to skydive,  ride motorcyles and enjoy rodeo . . . It’s an ad. It’s like those cars that  say they get thirty miles to the gallon . . . You just want someone to  take you out for a test drive.  In the “Soulmates” episode of the sitcom Parks and Recreation  2009– 2015 , like Dolly, Tom  Aziz Ansari  had established multiple online dat- ing profiles: “I made 26 profiles, each designed to attract a different type  of girl. Tom A. Haverford, sporty and sexy. Tom B. Haverford, smooth  and soulful.” While Must Love Dogs and Parks and Recreation both present  this idea as humorous, this is actually construed as much more problem- atic in the “On the Line” episode of Elementary when Sherlock defines a  catfish: “Someone who uses social media to create false identities. Most  typically for the purpose of pursuing online romance.” Certainly as the  title of the documentary Catfish alluded, Angela deployed such a tactic  to win over Nev; the same thing transpired in the aforementioned docu- mentary Talhotblond along with the television biopic Talhotblond  2012 . While online identity play is easily detected in film and television, it  is also apparent in published works about the Internet. In her memoir,  Carol Parker referenced these ideas in her reflections on her own Internet  dating experiences: “Online I could be who I want to be: young, beautiful,  tough, witty, the all-round party girl, almost like stepping back in time to  my single days.”68 One of the participants in Couch, Liamputtong, and    202   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Pitts’ study took this idea a step further: “Cameron, a 23-year-old man,  detailed how he held two different online dating profiles on one website  to intentionally attractive different types of women, and that one of these  profiles contained deceitful information.”69  Playing with identity in ways that the real world inhibits can explain  why matches that seem to work online often don’t translate well offline.  This  difficulty  is  identifiable  in  On_Line  when  John   Josh  Hamilton   and Jordan  Vanessa Ferlito  had excellent cybersex but had no chemis- try upon a real-life meeting; their online personas and rapport didn’t gel  offline. Similarly, in the “Sex, Lies and Monkeys” episode of The Practice,  Ellenor’s online chemistry with George  Michael Monks  was nonexistent  in real life.  Something that many of the characters discussed in this section, as well  as  Parker  and  Campbell  allude  to,  is  the  appeal  of  getting  to  be  “new”  online. Several of the screen examples discussed in this section for example,  include characters drawn to each other online in ways that offline either  hadn’t happened at all, or at least hadn’t happened recently  as was the case  for Chandler and Janice in Friends . One explanation could be, as outlined  above, that  a  the characters simply wanted to connect with someone— anyone—and thus let that desire disguise any red flags, and  b  the Internet  helps characters lower their guard and thus get to know each other quickly.  Another explanation is a theme that is identifiable in screen examples as  well as in academic literature: that a kind of honesty emerges online and  a truer self is brought out in the absence of the difficulties and pressures  of real-life interactions and exposed identities. Revelations that may take  much longer to happen in a face-to-face exchange—if they even happen at  all—transpire much more easily online. Equally, emotions that might be  difficult to verbally articulate are revealed via text during online courtship.  Ben-Ze’ev made this point specifically in the context of gender differences,  noting that online, “women can be more sexually expressive than they are  in offline relationships and men may be more emotionally sensitive.”70 This  idea hints to a kind of truer truth emerging online in ways that, for a mul- titude of reasons, may not occur in the real world. This certainly plays out  in You’ve Got Mail. In real life Joe is often abrupt and regularly says the  first thing that comes to mind, even if he later feels remorse. Equally, in  real life Kathleen often gets tongue-tied. While the two have many fraught  real-life interactions, online Joe as NY152 is more thoughtful and Kath- leen as Shopgirl has more time to think through her responses, something  undoubtedly fueling the ease of their online interactions. The same dynam- ics play out in A Cinderella Story: Offline Austin is a stereotypical jock but       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    203  online he shows his sensitive side through the poetry he sends to Sam. The  online interactions between Chandler and Janice on Friends are another  good example of this. Since college the characters had been on-again, off- again lovers. Chandler, throughout the series, was presented as sarcastic and  emotionally reserved: In “The One Where Chandler Can’t Cry” episode, for  example, his best friend Joey  Matt LeBlanc  decried, “You’re dead inside!”  While  we  don’t  know  the  nature  of  Chandler’s  online  interactions  with  Janice in “The One with Barry and Mindy’s Wedding” episode, perhaps  Chandler was able to reveal a different side to himself; a more sensitive,  thoughtful self. Similarly, while in real life Chandler and Janice’s relation- ship was often troubled because of her clinginess, it is quite probable that  online these qualities were sufficiently muted to allow the two to experi- ence attraction. Similarly, in Perfect Romance, despite his physical attraction  to Jenny, for Peter, the true connection was what he had built with Tess  online. In You’ve Got Mail and Perfect Romance couples connected online,  and, despite offline stumbling blocks, they were true matches because their  online  interactions  were  apparently  more  genuine  and  more  a  gauge  of  compatibility; they somehow got to know each other’s souls.  Explored earlier were screen examples where characters suspected that  an online date would lie about their appearance. While appearance decep- tion is often just a bogeyman fear, film and television do offer examples of  actual appearance deceit.  Appearance Deception  In  the  “Gone  Girl”  episode  of  the  Australian  crime-drama  Winter   2015– , Mel  Rachel Gordon  lamented to her sister about her failed  online date: “Date from hell. This guy is nothing like his photo. I mean  there  should  be  some  kind  of  law:  Your  photo  has  to  at  least  vaguely  resemble who you are now not ten years ago.” In a scene from Breaking  the Cycle, Jason and Chad were jogging and discussing Jason’s attempts at  online romance when Jason disclosed his own experience with appearance  deception:  Jason:  His screen name was like Dark Lust or something. Chad:  Screen name? Jason:    Yeah, a screen name . . . Let me explain this to you. A screen name is  a name you make up when you go into chat rooms. But you got to  be careful because it doesn’t always describe the person you’re talking  to. I remember this one guy Young Jock Boy, right? Anyway, I get to  his house, he’s like sixty-two and four hundred pounds.   204   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  In Winter and Breaking the Cycle the deception was discussed, in a vari- ety of others, it is actually shown. In the “The Barbarian Sublimation” epi- sode of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory  2007– , Penny  Kaley Cuoco  had  become addicted to online gaming. As a ham-fisted intervention strategy,  her neighbour Sheldon  Jim Parsons  posted an online dating profile for her  in an attempt to distract her away from the game. Unbeknownst to Penny,  her first date, Tom  Mark Hames , arrived to find her in the middle of a  gaming binge, looking thoroughly disheveled. “I’m sorry dude,” Tom says  to Sheldon, “she didn’t look anything like her picture,” to which Sheldon’s  roommate Leonard  Johnny Galecki  sympathizes, “They never do.” The  “Attack of the Killer Kung-Fu Wolf Bitch” episode of the animated series  The Boondocks  2005–  opened with Riley narrating, “For most of my gran- dad’s romantic life, the Internet hadn’t been invented yet. So he was still  discovering the dangers of online dating.” Grandad is then shown opening  his front door to a variety of different dates: Each date is shown next to the  photo used in their dating profile and the contrast is marked—a transsexual,  an ugly woman, and an old woman each turn up, in sharp contrast to the  glamorous women depicted in the photos. The comedy Bringing Down the  House  2003  opened with a legal-themed chat room exchange between Peter   Steve Martin  and Charlene  Queen Latifah . Charlene described herself as  “31, with long, flowing locks and an athletic body” and Peter described  himself as “a little older, 6'2", my hair is light, boyishly light.” In reality,  Charlene was a large black woman and Peter a gray-haired older man. In  the “Crossfire” episode of Nash Bridges, Inspector Michelle Chan  Kelly Hu   was working undercover and had organized online dates to catch a preda- tor. The following exchange transpired between her and one of her dates, a  short, balding, and bespectacled man named Kenneth  Bill Rafferty :  Kenneth:  Are you disappointed? You look disappointed. Michelle:  Your profile said you were tall and muscular. Kenneth:   I took a little dramatic license.  In “The Obstacle Course” episode of Ally McBeal, a court case centered  on Rebecca’s  Ann Cusack  feelings of deception after Douglas, the man  she met online turned out to be a dwarf. Five years later, the Ally McBeal  creator, David E. Kelley, used the same storyline in the “New Kids on the  Block” episode of the series Boston Legal  2004–2008  when Denny  Wil- liam Shatner  was matched online with Bethany  Meredith Eaton : It was  only when the two met in person that Denny discovered that Bethany was  a midget. This same scenario transpired in the “Eeny Teeny Maya Moe”       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    205  episode of The Simpsons  1989– ; Moe was matched with Maya and on  their first meeting discovered that she was a midget. In the comedy Inter- net Dating  2008 , the first woman that Mickey  Katt Williams  arranged  to hook up with turned out to not only be a fat woman  Lauren Christine  Miller , but a fat woman who opened the door eating a tub of ice cream. While in these examples characters were deceived about appearance— helping to subtly substantiate fears of the cyberbogeyman—worth noting  are  some  examples  where  the  narrative’s  protagonist  is  actually  the  liar.  In the “Witchcraft” episode of the sitcom Brotherly Love  1995–1997 ,  for  example,  fat,  bearded,  and  middle-aged  Lloyd   Michael  McShane   had met a woman, Lotus  Megan Cavanaugh , online, and discussed his  burgeoning romance with his young and hunky colleague Joe  Joey Law- rence , in turn divulging his own appearance deception:  Lloyd:  She wants to meet me. Joe:  Lloyd:   You haven’t met?  No, she just e-mailed me that she’s coming into town for the comic  book convention and she’s rather insistent on dropping by. So what’s wrong with that?  Joe:  Lloyd:  Well, ah, I might not be exactly what she expects. Joe:  What do you mean? Lloyd:    Well, she might be expecting someone a bit younger. With a com- pact build and a leather motorcycle jacket.  Joe:  Why would she expect that, Lloyd? Lloyd:  Oh because I sent her your picture.  The same situation transpired in a sketch from the “Cyber Girl” epi- sode of the Canadian comedy series The Red Green Show  1991–2006 ,  when nerdy Harold  Patrick McKenna  used a photo of his uncle, Red   Steve Smith , to woo a woman online.  First, such deception is explained simply by the widespread assump- tion of it: that if everyone else is lying it would be foolish not to. In the  romantic-comedy The Perfect Man  2005 , for example, teen Holly  Hil- ary Duff  and her friend Amy  Vanessa Lengies  tried to arrange an online  date for Holly’s mom  Heather Locklear ; as Amy says, “Everyone lies in  cyberspace.” This mentality is similarly articulated in Breaking the Cycle,  when  Sammy   Stephen  Halliday   was  encouraging  Chad  to  try  online  dating and was helping him draft a profile:  Sammy:  Age, nineteen. Chad:  Oh, I’m not nineteen.   206   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Sammy:    Honey, everybody lies about their age. Everyone makes themselves  a little bit younger, okay?  Deceit  was  similarly  normalized  in  the  “May  the  Best  Friend  Win”  episode  of  the  sitcom  Baby  Daddy   2012– .  After  her  son,  Ben   Jean- Luc Bilodeau , and his friend, Riley  Chelsea Kane , discovered Bonnie’s   Melissa Peterman  dating profile—and, notably, that she had lied about  her age—Bonnie justified her deceit to Riley:  Bonnie:    You  listen  up  Little  Miss  You-Ain’t-Going-to-Look-Like-That- Forever, yeah, you heard me—enjoy those while they’re up high.  This is how online dating works, okay. Everybody lies. It’s like the  weight on your driver’s license. It’s more of a suggestion.  Normalized  deception  was  also  apparent  in  the  “The  Online  Date”  episode of the comedy-drama series Jane by Design  2012 . Jane’s  Erica  Dasher  mother, Kate  Teri Hatcher , decided to create an online dat- ing profile for Jane’s boss, Grey  Andie MacDowell , on a website called  Classy-Cupid.com:  Jane:    Kate:    [reading aloud the profile her mother had prepared] “Easy going and  affectionate, enjoys long walks on the beach”—Grey’s none of these  things!  Well, in the world of online dating illusion is everything. Trust me.  She’ll thank me later.  While appearance deceit serves as a plot device—most commonly a  vehicle for comedy—it also reflects off-screen notions inextricably linked  to online dating. The everyone else is lying idea, for example, is certainly  substantiated by research: The psychologist Robert Epstein cited a survey  of online daters whereby only 1 percent of the participants had listed their  appearance as “less than average,” in turn, conveying the impression that  online dating is a world where “all the women are strong, all the men are  good-looking.”71 While such deception, of course, is about securing a first  date—or, to quote Dolly from Must Love Dogs, to be taken “out for a test  drive”—it is also a testament to strongly held values centered on appear- ance not just in our contemporary culture but in humans. In psychologists  Stefan Stieger, Tina Eichinger, and Britta Honeder’s work on online dat- ing and deception, they present an evolutionary argument for such deceit:  Sexual selection theory maintains that evolution is driven by strategies that  provide  mating  advantages,  such  as  outrivaling  intrasexual  competitors       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    207  and, thus, increasing one’s chance of being selected as a mate by a member  of the opposite sex.72  Even without the evolutionary angle, there are simple online dating  truths that motivate deception. First, as might be assumed, research iden- tifies  that  appearance  is  more  important  for  online  daters  than  factors  like education.73 This “truth,” in fact, was mentioned in the pilot of the  sitcom A to Z  2014– , when Andrew  Ben Feldman —who worked for  the Wallflower online dating company—explained the dating landscape  to his love interest, Zelda  Cristin Milioti :  Andrew:    There’s  a  lot  of  things  you  don’t  know  about  the  online  dating  world.  Zelda:  Oh my god, is that so? Please enlighten me. Andrew:    Well for instance, when a guy chooses a girl on the site, guess how  important it is that she have a college degree? I’m going to go with of no importance.  Zelda:  Andrew:  Ding ding ding. You got it!  While  good  looks  are,  of  course,  subjective,  certain  appearance-types  fare better than others online: Psychologists Rosanna Guadagno, Bradley   Okdie,  and  Sara  Kruse  identified,  for  example,  that  “short  men  and  overweight women were the least likely to get emails through the dating  site.”74  Given  these  circumstances,  the  authors  surmise  that  “men  and  women who are searching for a mate are aware of what potential mates  consider  attractive  and  the  evidence  indicates  that  they  will  alter  their  profiles to reflect these characteristics.”75 Such deception, therefore, is pri- marily a marketing strategy designed to secure that test drive.  Another explanation for deception on screen is that it mirrors what  transpires in the real-life world of online dating. Couch, Liamputtong,  and Pitts quoted a number of online daters who documented their own  experiences with appearance deceit: “Claire,” for example, noted, “Peo- ple lie about their age, have different pictures up or pictures that where  taken  years  ago.”76  Such  findings  coincide  with  sociologist  Benjamin  Cornwell  and  David  Lundgren’s  work  that  found  that  28  percent  of  online daters in their study has misrepresented their physical character- istics  weight, hair color, and state of health  and 23 percent had misrep- resented their age.77 With online dating becoming increasingly normal,  with more people participating and with more competition, arguably  appearance deception is something a lot of people relate to and thus has  a strong presence on screen because it resonates with the audience.   208   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The More Serious Deceptions  While lies about appearance may irk participants—even if those partic- ipants likely tell such lies themselves—both the screen and real life present  some far more serious online deceptions. While some are simply about  self-marketing, in others deception centers on intentional harm.  Gender Deception  Mentioned earlier was the “Surprise” episode of Mike and Molly where Carl  told a story of thinking he was meeting a “hot Filipino chick” who he had  met online but ending up with “a short Guatemalan man named Roberto.”  In numerous screen examples gender deception is indeed more than a mere  bogeyman fear. In the “Girl Trouble” episode of Nash Bridges discussed ear- lier, Joe thought he was corresponding with a woman but it turned out to be  his male office manager, Pepe. As noted in the “Mikado” episode of Millen- nium, Brian admitted to changing his name, appearance, sexual orientation,  and “even gender” online. In the “Erica & Callum” episode of Dates, Callum   Greg McHugh  divulged to his date Erica  Gemma Chan , “I’ve been on a  lot of dates with a lot of girls . . . Well, two including this one and the other  “so-called girl” turned out to be a . . . that doesn’t matter.” In the teen-comedy  Geography Club  2013 , teenager Ike  Alex Newell  tells a story of meeting a  boy online only to discover it was a girl once he had his hand down her pants.  Gender deception played a central role in the “Joey and the Holding Hands”  episode of the sitcom Joey  2004–2006 . The episode opened with a standard  bogeyman-themed conversation between the title character  Matt LeBlanc   and his nephew Michael  Paulo Costanzo :  Michael:  Check it out. I just met the hottest girl on the Internet. Joey:  Michael:  Joey:   Oh yeah, how do you know she’s hot? ’Cause she described herself to me.  Michael, it’s the Internet. People lie. As I found when I got this  authentic stormtrooper helmet for five grand.  You can be as cynical as you want, Joey, this is how my generation  meets people, okay? She says she’s a lovely young woman, I happen  to believe her.  Sorry. I’m sure you’ll be very happy with [peers at the user name]  SexySteve87.  Michael:   Joey:   Michael:  So what, Stevie Nicks is a woman. Steve can be a girl’s name.  Upon arrival at the house, Michael’s online date appears to be a beauti- ful blonde woman: Joey’s suspicions seem to be unfounded. Michael then       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    209  leaves with Steve only to return home alone shortly thereafter and con- cedes to his uncle, “Yeah, it’s a dude.” In the “Serpent’s Tooth” episode of  the British sitcom My Family  2000–2011 , Nick’s  Kris Marshall  experi- ence with gender deception was a topic of conversation between with his  mother, Susan  Zoë Wanamaker  and father Ben  Robert Lindsay :  Susan:  You’re not chatting up girls on the Internet again? Ben:    What  do  you  mean  again?  What,  you’ve  done  this  kind  of  thing  before?  Yeah, and it worked really well. Tahlia, her name was. This 19-year- old  cellist  from  Prague.  We  had  a  really  deep  and  rewarding  e-relationship going.  Until Tahlia turned out to be a 48-year-old gasfitter called Stuart  from Sunderland.  Nick:   Susan:   Nick:  Alright, so it was a man. It meant a lot to me while it lasted.  Later  in  the  same  episode,  in  order  to  secure  a  date  with  a  les- bian  model,  Nick  pretended  to  be  a  woman  online.  Something  simi- lar transpired in the “Past Tense” episode of the sitcom Suddenly Susan    1996–2000 , when Todd  David Strickland  posed as a lesbian in a gay  chat room and formed a relationship with a woman who shared his inter- ests. When the two met for an offline encounter it was discovered that the  “lesbian” was actually another man  Shawn Hoffman  who, like Todd,  had lied about his gender. Fake lesbianism in fact, was also alluded to in  Lil Bub & Friendz when Grant identified his suspicion that all the women  in the lesbian chat room were actually men.78 While actual gender decep- tion transpired, in Mike and Molly, Joey, Suddenly Susan, and My Family in  each example it was presented as humorous. First, as noted, gender decep- tion  and  mistaken  identity  have  long  been  important  tropes  in  comic  theater, and thus its presence in modern sitcoms hardly seems surprising.  The fact that victims in these narratives are men also highlights the more  problematic idea of male victims as amusing rather than serious; a trend  in popular—and news—media coverage of female to male violence. The  journalist Philip Cook, for example, identified in his research on domes- tic violence perpetuated by women that “sometimes when a man is the  victim, there is even an attempt to treat the story humorously.”79 Whereas  men being deceived online is often comic if not comeuppance for shal- lowness, women’s deception is interpreted as more problematic.  A  variant  on  gender  deception—at  least  in  regard  to  sexuality  expectations—transpired in the “Jenny & Nick” episode of Dates when,  at a restaurant on their first date, Nick left Jenny at the table to go and    210   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  have sex with a male waiter in a toilet. In the aforementioned “Erica &  Callum” episode of the same series, Erica went on a date with Callum   Greg McHugh  despite the fact that she was a lesbian.  Academics note that gender deception is relatively widespread online; a  normalness that Brian referred to in Millennium. In their review of several  Internet-deception  studies,  Stieger,  Eichinger,  and  Honeder  identified  that  “the  most  prominent  form  of  online  deception  is  gender  switch- ing.”80 The authors spotlighted one study that showed that 18 percent of  male and 11 percent of female chat room users lied about their sex.81 One  explanation for this could be that while such deception is possible online,  the ruse would be exposed if a real-life meeting were to take place and  hence such meetings happen infrequently.  Age Deception  Even  more  common  than  on-screen  gender  deception  are  exaggera- tions told about age. In Breaking the Cycle, Jason spoke of meeting a man  online who claimed to be a “young jock” but was actually 62 years old. In  the “I Robot . . . You, Jane” episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Xander  mentioned the possibility of posing online as an elderly Dutch woman.  In Must Love Dogs, when Sarah arrived at the café to meet her date only to  find her father, the two had the following exchange:  Sarah:   Bill:    A young fifty, Dad? You’re seventy one! And when was the last time  your rode a bike? Meandering or any other way.  Well think of it as poetry, darling. It’s who I am in the bottom of my  soul.  In the “Furt” episode of Glee  2009–2015 , middle-aged Sue Sylvester   Jane Lynch  posted an online dating profile stating her age as 27. In the  comedy I Love You, Man  2009 , the early-30s protagonist Peter  Paul  Rudd  used a website, FriendFinder.com, to find platonic male friends.  He was matched with a man named Mel whose photo made him appear  similar in age to Peter. When they met, his match was elderly: “The pic- ture is from a couple of years back,” Mel  Murray Gershenz  explained. In  an unnamed series 2 episode of the British series Starlings  2012–2013 ,  Grandpa  Alan Williams  tried online dating. While Grandpa was elderly  himself, the woman he was matched with appeared to be in a vegetative  state. In the “Zero Dark Forties” episode of the sitcom The Exes  2011– ,  Holly’s  Kristen Johnston  friends Phil  Donald Faison , Haskell  Wayne  Knight , and Stuart  David Alan Basche  uploaded a profile of her on       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    211  a  dating  website  and  were  prescreening  her  dates.  One  man  they  met  had claimed in his profile to be a former Olympic water polo player. A  very old man turned up; he had been in the Helsinki games. While in  most  examples  characters  downplay  their  age,  at  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum—for example in the “Do You Wanna Dance?” episode of Ally  McBeal—Ally’s online beau turned out to be a teenager who had claimed  to be older. The same thing happened with one of Dolly’s dates in Must  Love Dogs. Similarly, in the “David & Ellie” episode of Dates, Ellie  Mon- tanna Thompson  had claimed to be 25 when, in reality, she was 19. In  “The Fifth Wheel” episode of the sitcom The Nanny  1993–1999 , C.C.   Lauren Lane  met a man online who turned out to be her business part- ner’s 15-year-old-son Brighton  Benjamin Salisbury .  While age deception transpired in each of these examples, it was, seem- ingly, simply for the same reasons that people lie about their appearance:  to secure a first date. Akin to appearance and gender deception, deceit  about  age  online  is  also  common  in  real  life.  In  one  survey  of  young  adult online daters, two-thirds reported that people they had met online  had lied about their age.82 While the lies that transpired in the screen  examples  discussed  thus  far  could  each  be  considered  an  extension  of  appearance-based deceit, more serious age-based deception does indeed  transpire. At the comic end of the spectrum is the “Cartman Joins NAM- BLA” episode of South Park  1997– , which framed the Internet as a com- mon  way  that  adult  men  target  young  boys.  Most  examples,  however,  present this idea with substantially more seriousness. The 2009 documen- tary and 2012 television biopic Talhotblond both centered on Thomas, a  47-year-old  man  posing  online  as  18-year-old  “Tommy”  in  correspon- dence with the 18-year-old “Jessi.” While “Tommy” was a constructed  identity, so too in fact was Jessi: She was actually Mary Shieler who was  posing using her daughter’s likeness online. The same thing played out  in the aforementioned documentary Catfish about Nev, who developed  an online friendship with young “Abby” and an online romance with her  sister “Megan.” It turned out that the Megan and Abby identities had  both been fabricated by Angela, a middle-aged, overweight housewife. An  early screen fiction example of age deception transpired in the television  drama Every Mother’s Worst Fear  1998 . After teenage Martha  Jordan  Ladd  was dumped by her boyfriend, she entered a chat room and typed,  “I need a friend.” Seconds later she formed an online relationship with  “Drew”  Vincent Gale . While Drew initially implied that he was similar  in age to Martha, over the course of their correspondence, he admitted  to being 34. Drew kidnapped Martha on behalf of a trafficker, Scanman    212   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S   Ted McGinley . In the “Mother and Child Reunion: Part 1” episode of  Degrassi: The Next Generation  2001– , teen Emma  Miriam McDonald   met  “Jordan,”  a  supposed  fellow  high  school  student,  in  a  chat  room.  Her friend, JT  Ryan Cooley  warned her, “I bet he lives in Scarborough  and works at a video store . . . I bet he’s forty and drools.” JT’s bogeyman  suspicions were in fact confirmed when Emma met her correspondent  in the “Mother and Child Reunion: Part 2” episode: he turned out to  be a middle-aged man  Jeff Gruich . The same thing happened in “The  Kindness of Strangers” episode of the crime-drama The District  2000– 2004 :  12-year-old  Amy   Destiny  Edmond   thought  she  was  meeting  “Icarus,” a 15-year-old-boy. Icarus, however, turned out to be a predatory  adult  John Sloan . In the thriller Trust  2010 , Annie  Liana Liberato   discovered  that  the  fellow  teen  that  she  had  been  discussing  volleyball  with online—“Charlie”—was a middle-aged man named Graham  Chris  Henry Coffey . In the Christian-drama Finding Faith  2013 , a predator  posed as a peer and befriended Faith  Stephanie Bettcher  via a social net- working site. Later Faith was kidnapped by the predator. The horror film  Strangeland  1998 , opened with two 15-year-old girls, Genevieve  Linda  Cardelllini  and Tiana  Amal Rhoe , using a teen chat site. They chatted  with Capt. Howdy  Dee Snider  who pretended to be similarly aged and  invited them to a party: Tiana was murdered first; found with her lips sewn  together. She had been tortured and died from a heart attack. The horror  film  Megan  Is  Missing   2011   followed  a  similar  storyline:   13-year-old  Megan   Rachel  Quinn   met  a  boy,  Josh   Dean  Waite ,  online.  “Josh”  claimed to be a student at a nearby school. The two arranged to meet, and  Josh kidnapped, tortured, and murdered her. Megan’s best friend Amy   Amber Perkins —who had been aware that Megan was going to meet an  online friend—started communicating online with Josh in an attempt to  find Megan. Eventually Josh found Amy and kidnapped her. He tortured  Amy by showing her Megan’s dead body. In the “Age of Innocence” epi- sode of Blue Bloods, the teenager, Betsy  Stevie Steel , was found dead out- side a hotel. Betsy had met a boy online via the SocialGizmo social media  site. The boy turned out to have been a profile created by middle-aged  Howard  Austin Lysy . Chatroom provides another spin on this idea. Chat  room dialogue is acted out for dramatic effect; in one scene a middle-aged  man, Tony  Gerald Home , entered the “Chelsea Teens” chat room where  teen William  Aaron Taylor-Johnson  was waiting:  Tony:  William:  Well, are you a teenage girl?  Is this for teenage girls?      T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    213  Yeah, I’m Tina.  Tony:  William:  Tina the teenage girl. Tony:  William:  Yeah. And at the moment I’m touching myself. Tony:  William:   Yeah. Are you a teenage girl?  Really? Are you good at it?  Usually I’m a lot better when I’m not hacking into Tony Layton’s  home computer and putting his name on a sex offender’s register.  Pedo!  In this scene, William baited a cyberpredator, something that transpires  in numerous other examples where age gets lied about. In the “P911”  episode of Criminal Minds, the FBI created a fake profile of 12-year-old  “Suzie” in order to trap a cyberpredator. In an early scene in Finding Faith,  police entrapped a man who thought he was meeting a 12-year-old girl.  In Strangeland, police used a fake profile to try to find Capt. Howdy. The  police did the same to catch an online pedophile in the “Web” episode  of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. In the “Killer Chat” episode of the  crime-drama Numb3rs  2005–2010 , the father of a girl who had com- mitted suicide after being abused by an online predator was part of the  Parents Stop Predators group who baited pedophiles in chat rooms. Men- tioned earlier in the context of Sex Drive was Dateline: Chris Hansen’s “To  Catch a Predator” series was built around entrapping pedophiles via fake  youth profiles.  Each of these examples reflect worst-case-scenario: Pedophiles might  go online to prey upon children. On one level the technology provides  just another means by which adults can access children—the Internet is  simply another place, a badlands, where such exploitation transpires. Of  course, whereas many young people have a “stranger danger” awareness in  the context of real life and thus would give creepy adults a wide berth, as  evident in the examples discussed in this section, adults actively lied about  their identity offline, built relationships with—and earned the trust of— young people in turn creating a situation where the child felt safe enough  to meet offline and, in turn, harm ensued.  While the Internet simply provides a new means to execute the kind  of “grooming” that has long transpired offline, anonymity is one of the  special features of the Internet that facilitate such interactions. This latter  point hints to the narrative theme of the Internet in fact aiding pedophiles  getting access to children, something well documented in research on the  Internet and sex crimes,83 and discussed earlier in the context of child  porn.   214   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Just as appearance and age are lied about online, the screen also offers  numerous other examples of deceit: a notable one being about the iden- tity of the person beyond age, gender, and appearance.  Identity Deception  In  the  aforementioned  “I’m  Moving  On”  episode  of  Hart  of  Dixie,  Zoe’s first date turned out to be one of her patients  and the lead singer  of a local band , Meatball  Matt Lowe : “You’re the tennis-playing banker  from Mobile who went to Vanderbilt? You made it all up!” In Can’t Hardly  Wait, Murphy was seemingly under the erroneous impression that he was  online dating the model Christie Turlington. In the “C Is for Curiouser &   Curiouser”  episode  of  the  sitcom  A  to  Z,  Stephie’s   Lenora  Crichlow   online date turned out to be her ex, Stu  Henry Zebrowski : “I catfished  you here to prove I’m not a deceptive idiot,” he illogically explained. In  the “Date with an Antelope” episode of the cartoon Johnny Bravo  1997– 2004 , the title character had arranged a date with Carol; Carol turned  out to be an antelope. In these examples identity is incompletely or inac- curately divulged, albeit without significant consequence. In other exam- ples, however, such lies have much more serious consequences.  In the “I, Robot . . . You, Jane” episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer,  Willow’s online beau turned out to be a cyberdemon. In the “Digging the  Dirt” episode of the supernatural series The Gates  2010 , Devon  Chandra  West  neglected to divulge to her online suitor that she’s a witch: She stole  his eyes for a spell on their first date. In the “Girls, Girls, Girls” episode  of Supernatural, the woman Dean met through CrushBook attempted to  steal his soul. In the “Valentine’s Day in Quahog” episode of Family Guy,  Meg’s online date, Toby, stole her kidney. In the “2Shy” episode of the  sci-fi series The X-Files  1993–2002 —taking cues from the lonely hearts  narratives  discussed  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter—the  “fat  sucking  vampire” Virgil   Timothy  Carhart   corresponded  with  shy,  overweight  women online, courting them with poetry: In person, he suffocated them  and sucked the fat from their bodies. In the British biopic UWantMe- 2KillHim?  2013 , John  Toby Regbo  posed as a wide number of char- acters online, including “Rachel” who he used to seduce his friend Mark   Jamie Blackley , as well as Janet, an MI5 agent. In Killer Net, Scott met  “Charlie”  Kathy Brolly  in a chat room. Charlie turned out to be a liar  and a thief and embroiled Scott in a murder. Theft was also a theme in the  “Jenny & Nick” episode of Dates: Nick’s online date, Jenny, was a klep- tomaniac who stole his wallet. In the “Jenny & Christian” episode, Jenny       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    215  stole Christian’s  Andrew Scott  wedding ring. Theft was also briefly refer- enced in the “A Muddy Road” episode of the crime-drama Fargo  2014–   when Patty  Anna Sundberg  mentioned having been on an online date  with a man who ended up stealing all her panties. In the Canadian drama  The Boy She Met Online  2010 , teenage Cami  Tracy Spiridakos  met a  boy Jake  Jon Cor  online, who, unbeknownst to her, was a prisoner: “She  thinks I go to Penn State not the State Penn!” he laughed. As in Killer  Net, Cami’s relationship with Jake culminated in theft, murder, and also  drugs. In The Virginity Hit, Becca had posted a video offering to help with  Matt’s virginity-loss quest claiming she was very sexual and a descendant  of Cleopatra. Becca turned out to be a grad student who was doing a  project on how men are like animals and illicitly filmed him perform- ing oral sex acts on a rubber doll. In the drama Red State  2011 , Jarod   Kyle Gallner  and friends found a woman through a website—“It’s like  Craigslist for people who want to get fucked”—and arranged to have a  foursome. When Jarod woke, he found himself in a cage in the back of  a Westboro-esque church—Five Points Trinity Church—ran by the infa- mous Pastor Abin Cooper  Michael Parks : The boys were being punished  for their sins. In the Taiwanese drama Girl$  2010 , chat rooms were used  to organize “paid dates”: One of the men who arranged a paid date was a  serial killer. This same theme was at the heart of The Craigslist Killer.  Noted  earlier  was  Couch,  Liamputtong,  and  Pitts’  research  where  “incorrect details about relationship status” was identified as a common  form of online deceit; something that certainly transpires online where  online dating is presented as a way to orchestrate infidelity, and something  the 2015 real-life Ashley Madison scandal put the spotlight on.84 In Burn  after Reading, the first man that Linda met  and had sex with  was married.  The Swedish drama Miss Kicki  2009  opened with the title character  Per- nilla August  speaking on a webcam to Mr. Chang  Eric Tsang  in Taiwan.  He ended their chat with an invitation that should Miss Kicki ever be in  Taiwan that he would look forward to seeing her. Abruptly, Miss Kicki  travelled to Taiwan, with her son Victor  Ludwig Palmell , and tracked  Mr. Chang down. He was married with children and his only defense— before turning her away—was that she hadn’t told him that she had a son.  In the “Jenny & Christian” episode of Dates, the morning after Jenny and  Christian had sex, his wife, Helen  Amanda Hale , arrived home. In the  gay-themed thriller Truth  2013 , two men—Caleb  Sean Paul Lockhart   and Jeremy  Rob Moretti —met via a hook-up app. Caleb neglected to  divulge that he had a mental disorder; Jeremy similarly failed to disclose  that he was married. Caleb turned out to be a psycho and torturer. While    216   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  infidelity was Caleb’s justification for attacking Jeremy, Caleb also alludes  to another screen archetype, the cyberpsycho. Undisclosed mental illness,  for example, was a central theme in  The  Girl  He  Met  Online, whereby  Gillian neglected to divulge to her online suitors that she was bipolar. In  the television thriller Web of Desire  2009 , Finn  Claudette Mink  was a  woman who had befriended, individually, a married couple, Beth  Dina  Meyer  and Jake  Adrian Hough . Finn had recently been released from a  mental institution and wasn’t the paramedic she claimed. In Net Games,  Adam   C.  Thomas  Howell   had  cybersex  with  Angel   Lala  Sloatman ;  when he missed their first scheduled phone conversation, Angel became  enraged ringing and hanging up and crying unstoppably when she finally  got through to him. When Adam attempted to sever ties, he ended up  conceding that she was a “fucking psycho.” In the “Attack of the Killer  Kung-Fu Wolf  Bitch”  episode  of  The  Boondocks,  Grandpa  got  involved  with a mentally unstable woman named Luna: She turned out to be an  insane kung-fu master who attacked him and one of his grandsons.  Another  kind  of  identity  deception–based  torture  played  out  in  the  drama The Dying Gaul  2005 . The film centered on a screenwriter, Rob- ert  Peter Sarsgaard , who was mourning the death of his lover Malcolm   Bill Camp  and who has an affair with the married Jeffrey  Campbell  Scott , the producer of his screenplay. Jeffrey’s wife, Elaine  Patricia Clark- son , discovers the affair and, using a gay chat room, pretended to be the  deceased Malcolm contacting Robert from the grave. Such online imper- sonation also transpired in an episode of the British crime-drama Luther   2010–2013  where a man impersonated a murdered schoolgirl to torture  her parents.  While  Internet-aided  identity  theft  is  a  theme  in  many  narratives— particularly those centered around finances85—it also plays out on screen  when, for a variety of reasons, individuals like Elaine in The Dying Gaul  impersonate others online. This issue is addressed further in Chapter 3   where cyberbullies participated in identity deception as occurred in the  American Cyberbully as well as Disconnect and The Affair  2014– . Out- side of bullying narratives, such impersonation is used for different rea- sons. At the comic end of the spectrum is the “Keaton” episode of the  sitcom New Girl  2011– . Jess  Zooey Deschanel  e-mails her housemate  Schmidt  Max Greenfield  pretending to be the actor Michael Keaton,  a  figure  who  had  been  inspiring  in  Schmidt’s  past.  Another  humorous  example transpired in the “Fashion of the Christ” episode of the crime- drama Weeds  2005–2012  when Andy  Justin Kirk —pretending to be  his nephew Silas  Hunter Parrish —used Instant Messenger to engage in       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    217  an explicit chat with Silas’s teenage girlfriend. A more serious version of  this theme occurred in the “Fanatic” episode of the crime-drama Stalker   2014–2015  when Nancy  Molly Hagan  was exposed as having been  the  one  to  have  replied  to  all  the  e-mails  her  son  had  sent  to  a  celeb- rity  by pretending to be the celebrity herself . In the Australian film The  Killing Field  2014 , the school principal, Brian  Darren Gilshenan , had  assumed a different identity online to exchange erotic e-mails with his stu- dent Becky  Taylor Ferguson . In the thriller the Perfect Stranger, Rowena  was engaged in chat room conversations with a man she assumed was her  boss, Harrison Hill  Bruce Willis , but was in fact her colleague Miles   Giovanni Ribisi , who was obsessed with her and had assumed Harrison’s  identity. In Men, Women & Children, Patricia  Jennifer Garner  pretended  to be her daughter, Brandy, online to terminate Brandy’s relationship with  Tim   Ansel  Elgort . While  a  variety  of  motives  underpin  the  deceit  in  these narratives—in The Killing Fields, Brian was motivated by ego and  sexual impulses for example, and in Men, Women & Children Patricia was  motivated by control—each example illustrates the clandestine capabili- ties of online communications and reiterates the popular theme of it being  an  insecure  and  untrustworthy  medium: To  quote  the  judge   Holland  Taylor  in the “Do You Wanna Dance?” episode of Ally McBeal, “meeting  up in person with someone you only know through email, that’s insane.” While pedophilia may be the Internet fear that most strongly domi- nates  discussions,86  another  cyberpredator  who  has  received  extensive  screen attention is the cyberstalker.  The Internet to Stalk  From  conducting  background  research  on  dates  through  to  orches- trated campaigns of harassment and intimidation, the varieties of online  cyberstalkings depicted on screen are examined in this section.  Research  In  the  “Kidnapping  2.0”  episode  of  CSI:  Cyber,  a  baby  monitor  is  hacked to keep tabs on an infant to determine the best time to kidnap it.  This is an extreme example of the Internet used for “research”: Far more  commonly it is deployed in the context of dating whereby it serves as a  tool to run background searches on lone matches.  In books on Internet dating, conducting an online check on a poten- tial date is standard advice.87 It is therefore no surprise that on screen the  Internet is often used this way. In the pilot of A to Z, for example, Andrew    218   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  and Zelda initially got to know each by perusing each other’s social media  postings; Andrew then recruited his colleagues to delve more deeply into  Zelda’s electronic footprint.88 In the “C Is for Curiouser & Curiouser”  episode of the same series, Stephie used Lulu, the ex-boyfriend review site,  to seek information on her matches; as she justified, “Who meets without  getting someone’s information first?” In the “Feed the Need” episode of  jPod,  Ethan   David  Kopp   and  John   Torrance  Coombs   undertook  a  “Google enhanced full cavity search” on their colleague Kaitlin’s  Emi- lie  Ullerup   ex-boyfriend   Kyle  Cassie .  In  the  pilot  of  the  sci-fi  series   Mr. Robot  2015– , the hacker protagonist Elliot  Rami Malek  under- took an online background search on his therapist’s new boyfriend. In  the  romantic-comedy  A  Case  of You   2013 ,  Sam   Justin  Long   devel- oped a crush on a barista, Birdie  Evan Rachel Wood . He located her  on  Facebook  and,  following  the  advice  of  his  roommate  Eliott   Keir  O’Donnell —who claimed, “That’s the beauty of getting to see her Face- book profile. So much information on there. I mean, you could become  the man of her dreams if you wanted”—Sam begins to webstalk her. He  learns as much about her as possible and, in turn, takes guitar and cook- ing lessons to become Birdie’s perfect man. The very same strategy was  used as a plot device over a decade earlier in the “Civil War” episode of  Ally McBeal when, during a court case, Paula  Maria Pitillo , explained  how she felt she had been manipulated into sex:  Everything we connected on he learned from my chat room online. I’m  in a circle group, women. And he, evidently, was in it, pretending to be  a woman. So all the stuff about souls connecting first, I’d said that in the  chat room. He used it.  Given, as discussed earlier in this chapter, the Internet—and notably  people “from” the Internet—are so commonly portrayed as duplicitous,  it is no surprise that in light of well-established fears about the extent to  which things can go wrong, undertaking a background check is viewed  as due diligence. Interestingly, in each example, however, the background  checks  are  presented  as  a  bit  invasive—if  not  creepy—highlighting  an  interesting paradox: Online activity that is near universal off screen is still  presented as varyingly weird within narratives.  Taking these ideas a step further is using the Internet to keep tabs.  Keeping Tabs  In the pilot of the sitcom  Hot in Cleveland  2010–2015 , Joy  Jane  Leeves   remarked,  “This  is  why  the  Internet  was  invented;  for  men  to       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    219  find pictures of naked celebrities and women to cyber-stalk the men they  trust.” While  Joy’s  remark  was  intended  as  humorous,  she  nonetheless  alludes to the idea of the Internet being used to “keep tabs” on others.  GPS signals from phones are tracked, for instance, in a wide variety of  crime  narratives. While  in  such  examples  the  “stalking”  is  simply  part  of an investigation, in numerous examples non–law enforcement charac- ters use the same technology. In Men, Women & Children, Patricia used a  tracking website to monitor Brandy’s movements. In the “Mia & David”  episode of Dates, Jessica  Esther Hall  similarly used the software to keep  track of her son Frankie  Xavier Atkins . In the comedy Paul Blart: Mall  Cop  2009 , Pahud  Adhir Kalyan  kept tabs on his ex-girlfriend by track- ing  her  phone.  In  the  “Sex,  Lies  and  Politics”  episode  of  Ally  McBeal,  Lojack technology was used by a man to keep tabs on his partner by track- ing the movements of her wheelchair.  In Men, Women & Children and Dates, the tracking software was used  under the guise of trying to keep children safe and thus, while it can be  construed as indicative perhaps of helicopter parenting89—if not as overt  attempts at control—the intentions weren’t malicious. In Paul Blart: Mall  Cop, while Pahud’s surveillance ended up saving the day—enabling law  enforcement to find the hostages—his behavior, nonetheless is not only  creepy but demonstrative of the capacity for such technology to create  and or maintain an intimacy that no longer exists in real life.  In the “The Panty Piñata Polarization” episode of the sitcom of The  Big Bang Theory, during a conversation between friends Leonard  Johnny  Galecki  and Howard  Simon Helberg , Leonard criticized Howard for  using the Internet to track reality television stars:  Leonard:  For the record, what you guys are doing is really creepy. Howard:    You know what, if it’s “creepy” to use the Internet, military sat- ellites and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young  models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly then fine, I’m  creepy.  Location apps with more sinister consequences were mentioned in the  sitcom Betas and were a focal point of the “Oh Shenandoah” episode of  The Newsroom. In both narratives the fine line between facilitating social- izing and facilitating stalking was highlighted.  In the “Chinese Walls” episode of the British crime-drama The Inspector  Lynley Mysteries  2001–2007 , during his questioning over the murder of  the webcam performer Emily  Isabella Calthorpe , site subscriber Tanner   Wayne Foskett  explained his real life stalking of her, “I wanted to get    220   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  closer. I wanted to know her as a person. And yeah, I know how sad and  deluded that sounds.” The idea of the Internet being used by characters to  feel closer is detected in numerous cyberstalking-themed narratives.  As in Paul Blart: Mall Cop, a comic presentation of ex-stalking trans- pired in the “Un-Tag My Heart” episode of Selfie when Eliza mentioned  the usefulness of social media in this regard: “Once the option of stalking  your exes is presented, you can’t not do it. It’s like crack.” While Eliza’s  comment is presented in the context of a sitcom, the idea of the temp- tation to engage in this behavior simply because the technology makes  it possible—if not encourages it—is outlined by Lieutenant Beth Davis   Maggie Q  in the pilot of Stalker:  Stalking can be the result of a relationship gone wrong or delusional fixa- tions that are pushed to extremes. Anyone can be a stalker. Ex-boyfriend,  spouse, stranger. Anyone can be a victim, and it’s on the rise. Facebook,  Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tinder, whatever app is hot today. We have  too much access to one another. Social media is the number one reason  stalking cases have tripled in the last decade. That’s where I come in.  Pahud’s  use  of  GPS  software  to  keep  track  of  his  ex-partner  is  one  example of the screen consequences of “too much access to one another”;  others are easily detected. In On_Line, for example, John discussed his  favorite webcam site, Angelcam, in his video blog:  There she is. And the fascinating thing is that you can see her there. She’s  getting undressed. So you know she’s online too. Right now. You know  how to find her but you don’t really know where she is. She’s just out  there somewhere and that’s pretty much all you know. You can slip into  her room at night, watch her sleeping. You can stay and watch her wake  up in the morning. You piece together some things, you’ve imagined the  rest. But would you really want to meet her or would that ruin everything?  As it turns out, Angel  Liz Owens —the star of the site—was John’s  ex-girlfriend: John was using the site as a means to keep connected to  her given that she was no longer physically in his life; something John  explains at the end of the film when he decides to stop logging on after  Angel gets a new boyfriend: “As long as you were alone I could bounce  that love off your image like a mirror and somehow feel it coming back to  me. But now I can’t even pretend anymore.” Using the Internet—notably  social media—to maintain a kind of connection in the aftermath of a  break-up is apparent in a variety of examples. Following Marnie’s  Allison       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    221  Williams  break up with Charlie  Christopher Abbott  in the “Weirdos  Need Girlfriends Too” episode of the comedy-drama Girls  2012– , she  uses Facebook to peruse photos of him. Henry does the same thing in the  “Un-Tag My Heart” episode of Selfie, when an initiation into Facebook  sees him obsessively following the activities of his ex-girlfriends. In the  “Lost and Found” episode of Stalker, Ian  Sterling Beaumon  maintains  his crush on Jenny  Cole Bernstein  by accessing the Tumblr page he has  created full of photos of her. Something similar transpired in the British  Cyberbully, when someone Casey had been communicating with—under  the presumption that it was a friend—revealed that he had been monitor- ing all her online activity and considered himself “a fan.” In the first sea- son of the crime-drama series The Fall  2013– , as Paul’s  Jamie Dornan   interest in his teen babysitter Katie  Aisling Franciosi  increased, so too  did his watching her online singing videos: The videos were his way to  have the kind of access to her that would be problematic in real life.  In Hot in Cleveland, Joy alluded to the use of the Internet to stalk celeb- rities which is another means by which tabs are kept on—and a sense of  intimacy is created with—people, in this case famous people. This theme,  in fact, was at the heart of the “Cyber-Lebrity” episode of CSI: Miami   2002–2012 : The high school student Candice  Jessy Schram  became  an instant Internet celebrity when a photo of her at a swimming carnival  went viral. Now, whenever out in public, Candice was a prime focus for  amateur paparazzi. Ken  Vince Vieluf , who made money from selling  photos of Candice, in fact, used the word stalking to describe the phe- nomena: “There’s a million people worldwide stalking her!” he claimed.  In the “Cutting Loose” episode of Major Crimes  2012–  something  similar transpired: Murder victim Zelda  Lisa K. Wyatt —dubbed a “psy- cho super fan”—had kept a fan page for a favorite actor. In the aforemen- tioned “Oh Shenandoah” episode of The Newsroom an app was discussed  which was designed to enable fans to stalk their favorite celebrities. “The  Blackout, Part 1: Tragedy Porn” episode of The Newsroom took this idea  further when the whistleblower, Solomon Hancock  Stephen Henderson ,  discussed how the National Security Agency software was used in practice:  “You’ve got guys listening in on ex-wives, dropping in on calls from sol- diers overseas, checking out what movie stars are up to.” While celebrity  fandom, of course, existed prior to the Internet, just as feelings of inter- activity get fueled by participation in social media, the Internet provides  additional tools for engaging with celebrities beyond their status updates. Another extension of the Internet providing access to a celebrity—and  more specifically to their intimate private life—is leaked and distributed    222   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  sexual imagery. While sexually explicit video scandals existed prior to the  World Wide Web—the 1988 sex tape scandal involving the actor Rob  Lowe illustrates this well90—the Internet creates a way to effortlessly dis- tribute such materials, seemingly catering to an insatiable audience; some- thing the 2014 leaked celebrity photo scandal that came to be known as  The Fappening—a portmanteau of happening and fap  the latter being a  reference to masturbation 91—illustrated well.  An extension of the Internet being used to keep tabs is it being used to   explicitly spy.  Spying  In the “Attack of the Killer App” episode of the animated series Futur-  ama  1999– , a brief exchange between Fry and Bender transpired:  Philip J. Fry:   Bender:    Since  when  is  the  Internet  about  robbing  people  of  their  privacy?  August 6, 1991.  Here, Bender referenced the date that Tim Berners-Lee announced the  World Wide Web project. The idea that the Internet killed privacy can be  explained by numerous factors: In this section, the way it has facilitated  individuals spying on each other is explored.  In the “Webcam” episode of the children’s series Zoey 101  2005–2008 ,  Logan  Matthew Underwood  gifted his female boarding school peers a  giant teddy bear. Unbeknownst to the girls, the bear actually had a built- in webcam and was broadcasting to the boys everything they did and said.  This example exists at the tame, prank-style end of the spectrum; other  scenes take these ideas in a more creepy direction. This idea was humor- ously alluded to in the “Oh Honey” episode of How I Met Your Mother  when, Honey  Katy Perry —a character presented as highly gullible— revealed, “My apartment building is so safe. My landlord even installed  a  security  camera  in  my  shower.”  The  sinister  undercurrent  highlights  the manner in which Internet technology can be used to invade privacy.  In the television drama  The  Husband  She  Met  Online  2013 , a minor  character—who  solicits  dates  for  the  protagonist,  Craig   Jason  Gray- Stanford —has several women he refers to as “slaves” who he regularly  secretly watches via hacked webcams. In the “Home Invasions” episode of  The Practice, unbeknownst to Lucy  Marla Sokoloff , she became the star  of a live webcam show after her building superintendent surreptitiously  installed  cameras  throughout  her  apartment.  In  the  aforementioned       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    223  “Chinese  Walls”  episode  of  The  Inspector  Lynley  Mysteries,  the  webcam  star, Emily, is murdered. It is revealed that one of the tech support guys  for the webcam site, Darren  Joe Armstrong , had installed cameras in  her home to spy on her. Something similar occurred in the “Eyes In” epi- sode of the Canadian police-drama Flashpoint  2008–2012 : Stuart  Kris  Lemche  was a tutor in love with his pupil Rebecca  Meaghan Rath  and  hacked into her webcam to spy on her. The same thing happened in the  British film Cyberbully when Casey’s webcam was hacked to enable her  cyberbully to spy on her. In Untraceable, the serial killer installed a camera  opposite the home of the investigator, Jennifer  Diane Lane , to spy on  her  as well as to frighten her . Discussed at the beginning of this chapter  was the idea of the bogeyman of privacy invasion. In fact, privacy invasion  is a much discussed topic in work on the Internet. While much of this  work centers on data and identity security, such work also identifies the  threats posed by technology like webcams.  In a variety of examples, secretly recorded footage is used for blackmail.  While this can happen humorously—for example in the holiday film The  Mistle-Tones  2012 , the leaking of a karaoke video online was part of an  extortion  attempt—in  most  examples  the  subject  is  treated  more  seri- ously. In Web of Desire, Beth meets Finn in a medical professionals forum.  The  two  spend  a  night  together,  a  night  Finn  videotapes. When  Beth  wants to end things, Finn threatens to leak the “sex tape” on YouTube.  A similar blackmail scenario transpires in the thriller Net Games: When  Adam tries to sever his online relationship with Angel she blackmails him  by threatening to leak photos she had taken of him masturbating at his  computer   seemingly  obtained  via  hacked  webcam .  Blackmail  is  also  a theme in the British Cyberbully: A hacker threatens Casey that unless  she continues communications with him, he will release the sexy photos  he had seized from her computer. Such blackmail transpires throughout  Unfriended, whereby similar threats are issued to keep the teen characters  at their computers. In the “Dead Man’s Switch” episode of Elementary, a  blackmailer threatened to release a video of a rape. In the “Tom Dooley”  episode of Ally McBeal, a threat is made to sell a sex-tape on Ebay. While  these examples illustrate the Internet used for extortion, in Web of Desire,  Cyberbully, and  Elementary, such examples also reference the ideas dis- cussed in Chapter 3 about the reputational damage of such material that  disproportionately impacts on women.  While showcasing the capabilities of technology, these examples also  highlight a kind of domestic terrorism where characters are threatened  and controlled via their online activity.   224   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  When keeping tabs and spying on a love interest from afar isn’t enough,  the Internet also facilitates pursuit—and harassment—as part of a kind  of perverse courtship.  Pursuit and Harassment  In a scene from the comedy Dinner for Schmucks  2010 , the annoying  visitor Barry  Steve Carell  was replying to the homeowner Tim’s  Paul  Rudd  instant messages, notably ones from Darla  Lucy Punch  who he  ended up inviting to Tim’s home:  Tim:  What are you doing? What are you doing? Barry:  Computer— Tim:  Oh my God! You gave her my address? Barry:  She’s very concerned about you. Tim:    Barry, this woman is a nightmare. She’s been stalking me for three  years! I slept with her one night, biggest mistake of my life.  While in this scene the idea of a female stalker is presented humorously   again,  framing  male  victimization  as  comic ,  several  examples  present  the same thing more seriously. In the Japanese crime-drama Akunin  Vil- lain   2010 , Yoshino  Hikari Mitsushima  meets a man, Masuo  Masaki  Okada , at a bar and pesters him with e-mails trying to lure him into a  relationship. Similar ideas are apparent in the thriller Swimfan  2002 — borrowing  themes  from  female-sexuality-as-dangerous  narratives  like  Fatal  Attraction   1987   and  Disclosure   1994 —Madison   Erika  Chris- tensen  punishes Ben  Jesse Bradford  for spurning her by stalking him in  real life and online: In one scene he opens his inbox and finds eighty-one  new e-mails from her including topless photos. Cyberharassment, in fact,  transpires in Disclosure, too, via an early incarnation of a virtual reality  scene where Tom  Michael Douglas  trials a test version of some archival  retrieval software and, while in the virtual reality system, he encounters  his colleague and sexual harasser, Meredith  Demi Moore , who is using  the same software to erase files. Similar online harassment transpires in the  “Phobia” episode of Stalker: Kristin  Rachael Carpani  had signed up with  the NoRulesDating.com hook-up site and in the aftermath of numerous  encounters offline had received harassing e-mails. A threesome Kristin had  participated in led to her receiving hate messages from a man who had  felt “left out of the action”; after she bailed from a BDSM encounter she  similarly received harassing messages. Each of these scenes are in sync with  motives underpinning offline stalking whereby a relationship disintegrates       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    225  and one party seeks to maintain connection because contact—even bad  contact—is  considered  valuable.  Such  ideas  were  taken  further  in  the  Gamergate-themed “Intimidation Game” of Law & Order: Special Victims  Unit: A female programmer, Raina  Mouzam Makkar , was threatened  online: “If Raina Punjabi dares to go through with a launch tomorrow  we’ll make sure that her raped and mutilated corpse is on the front page  of every feminist blog by next week.” The threats manifested in a real-life  attack: Raina was kidnapped and assaulted.  In other examples, cyberharassment is part of an intimidation strategy.  In the “Hammerhead Sharks” episode of The Practice, Anthony  Silas Weir  Mitchell  was a troll who sent death threats to random women online.  Just as the serial killer in Copycat sent Helen a photo of his next victim and  just as the serial killer in Untraceable intimidated Jennifer’s family with a  webcam, in a variety of narratives online activity can be part of a strategy  to create a sense of threat or unease. In the “Letting It Go” episode of  Major  Crimes,  for  example,  Jackie   Alexis  Carra ,  had  received  e-mails  from her rapist suggesting they reconnect. Another victim, Laura  Nikki  Deloach , received friend requests from her rapist via Facebook. While  the rapist may truly have believed he hadn’t “raped” these women, a more  likely explanation is that continued contact was a way to keep connecting  with, if not torturing them.92  In other examples the harassment centers on attempts to instigate a new  relationship. One of the fans of Mia’s webcam site in Selling Innocence,  “Gabriel,”  began  harassing  her,  constantly  trying  to  arrange  an  offline  meeting with her. The e-mails started off repeatedly and insistently, and  progressed to, “You dirty SLUT. You EVIL tease. Careful, WHORE, or  I  might  have  to  teach  you  a  lesson.  In  PERSON.  Lock. Your.  Doors.”  Interestingly, the same slut-shaming transpired in the aforementioned Tal- hotblond biopic: After things soured with his online girlfriend, Thomas   Garret Dillahunt  harassed her online calling her a whore. The television  drama Cyberstalker  2012 , centered on Aiden  Mischa Barton , who as  a teenager had been e-mailed endlessly by a stranger who progressed to  phoning her at home. “She’s never even met you!” yelled Michelle  Chan- tal Quesnelle , Aiden’s mother, at a message the man left on her answering  machine. Thirteen years later the stalker returned and used the Internet to  keep tabs on an adult Aiden. The “Anonymous” episode of Law & Order:  UK   2009–   centered  on  an  attacked  nurse,  Stephanie   Michelle  Bon- nard . Stephanie received a barrage of e-mails that referenced very personal  information; they had been sent by a man who had been, evidently, hack- ing into her e-mail and then using the information gleaned to harass her.   226   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  A different kind of stalking transpires in Killer Net where Scott plays  the titular online game whereby the first level involves an online stalking   that also ends up in real-life stalking . Something similar occurs in the  horror film Stay Alive  2006 , where an online game actually kills its play- ers. In Tormented, the student Darren  Calvin Dean  commit suicide and  his ghost harasses his enemies via the Internet  text messages, websites,  etc. , something that also happened in Unfriended.  The Internet to Scam  Discussed earlier was the mention of the stormtrooper helmet purchased  in Joey where the title character divulged being scammed. In numerous  examples  characters  are  preyed  upon  online  in  similar  ways.  A  popular  Internet scam mentioned repeatedly on screen is the Nigerian money scam.  In a scene from Medianeras  Sidewalls , for example, Martín laments his  empty inbox: “Is there anything more discouraging in the 21st century as  an empty inbox?” He then identifies that a friend had written to him from  Oman: “He happens to be visiting Yemen and needs my help withdraw- ing 9.5 million dollars from a local bank. He hasn’t written for a while. It’s  an imprudent, one-sided friendship.” In the aforementioned “Oh Honey”  episode of How I Met Your Mother, Honey referenced the same scam, mus- ing, “Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Secu- rity Number, but the guy’s a Nigerian prince!” In the “Mano-a-Mansfield”  episode of the sitcom Ground Floor  2013–2015 , Harvard  Rory Scovel   uses a hook-up app and meets a woman: “She’s beautiful,” he tells his col- leagues. “We have a lot of common interests . . . She’s a Nigerian princess.  Right  now  her  money  is  tied  up  in  this  kind  of  weird  legal  situation.”  The same scam was mentioned in the “Michael’s Birthday” episode of the  sitcom The Office  2005–2013 , when Michael  Steve Carell  remarked,  “When the son of the deposed King of Nigeria emails you directly asking  for help, you help.” In the “Crappy Birthday to You” episode of jPod the  scam is also mentioned when Carol  Sherry Miller  tried to avoid a meet- ing by claiming, “A man in Nigeria emailed me, he needs help with a bank- ing task.” With Nigerian money scams being such a cliché offline—and  now, in a world where the Internet has been mainstreamed for over two  decades—such examples are predictably used to poke fun at Luddites who  could fall for such ridiculousness.  Scams,  of  course,  take  numerous  other  forms  on  screen.  In  the  “Fire  Proof” episode of The Practice, Skip  Matt Czuchry  operates a chain let- ter scam via e-mail. In Net Games, when Adam first logs onto a cybersex  chat room the first woman he meets runs a financial check on him with,       T H E   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R    227  presumably, intentions of embezzlement. This idea was taken a step fur- ther in the aforementioned “2Shy” episode of X-Files: Virgil had opened his  online dating account using a credit card that he had stolen from one of his  victims. In the “I’m Moving On” episode of Hart of Dixie, Wade had booked  a contractor online who ended up robbing him. “I’m inclined to think his  website  was  not  authentic,” Wade  admitted  in  the  aftermath. While  not  quite as gullible as Honey in How I Met Your Mother, Sharon’s online dating  adventures in Da Kath and Kim Code came to a halt when she fell victim  to a dating scam; her love interest never arrived at the airport. In the televi- sion drama The Bride He Bought Online  2015 , John  Travis Hammer  was  scammed by three teenage girls who had set up a fake profile on a mail-order  bride site. The same idea was a subplot of the romantic-drama You and I   2011 : Ian  Charlie Creed-Miles  was a man posing online as “Olga” as part  of a mail-order bride scam; he posed as a woman to seduce men into provid- ing “her” money for a visa. A similar scam was at the center of the British  drama Birthday Girl  2001 : John  Ben Chaplin  met “Nadia” via an online  mail-order bride site. She arrived from Russia, her cousins soon followed,  and they attempted to extort money from John: It turned out that Nadia  and her “cousins” had executed this scam numerous times around the world.  Discussed earlier was the appearance and age deception in Bringing Down  the House. While by the end of the film and Peter and Charlene remained  friends, not only did both characters initially lie to each other, but Charlene’s  lies were used to much more problematic ends: She used them not only to  secure a meeting with Peter, but, once in his home, to blackmail him—by  standing on the lawn and shouting about their mixed race baby that he was  neglecting—in turn forcing him to let her stay in his home.  A different type of scam transpired in the drama Mojave Phone Booth   2006 , centered on the conversations happening in a mysterious phone  booth in the middle of the desert. Alex  Christine Elise  used the phone  to  tell  Greta   Shani  Wallis —the  woman  who  happened  to  be  on  the  other end of the call—about how her very depressed partner, Glory  Joy  Gohring , had sought solace online:  Alex:    She actually appears to have motivated herself to understand it. She  met somebody. In a chat room. Offered up some sort of solution.  Greta:  That’s good, right? Alex:  A UFO chat room. Greta:  Oh. Alex:    And then they got into some verbal diarrhea about alien parasites.  How they latch onto people. This supposedly causes depression and  lethargy.   228   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The man Glory met in the chat room turned out to be Michael  David  DeLuise  who insisted that his depression “cure” had to be administered  personally. Apparently without clothes. These examples each tap into— and substantiate—the widespread fears of the Internet as a place where  scamming is likely due to users’ inherent vulnerabilities.  This chapter explored the broad concept of the cyberpredator on screen.  As identified, far more common than an actual cyberpredator on screen  is the specter of one: the fear of what might be lurking out there in cyber- space. Chapter 6 expands on some of the ideas discussed in this chapter,  focusing on the cyberperv, a character defined by sexual objectives.   6  Billions of dollars have gone into  inventing the Internet and filling  it with pictures of naked women  so we don’t have to peep through  windows: The Cyberperv  In the “Babies & Bathwater” episode of the medical-drama series House   2004–2012 , Dr. Chase  Jesse Spencer  questioned his boss—title char- acter  Hugh Laurie —about why he wasn’t working at his desk. Stoically,  Dr. House replied, “Because there is a computer in my office. If I log on,  romance will ensue. My wrist might fall off.” In the “Exam Time” epi- sode of the British series The Inbetweeners  2008–2010 , teen Neil  Blake  Harrison  observed: “I don’t think I’ve ever been on the Internet and not  ended up having a wank.” In the comedy Clerks II  2006 , one of the  protagonists, Randal  Jeff Anderson , commented, “What’s the point in  having an Internet connection if you’re not using it to look up weird,  fucked-up pictures of dirty sex you’ll never have yourself?” In the “My  Brother, Where Art Thou?” episode of the sitcom Scrubs  2001–2010 ,  Dr. Cox  John C. McGinley  quipped, “I’m fairly sure if they took porn  off the Internet, there’d only be one website left, and it’d be called ‘Bring  Back the Porn!’” Each of these jibes is underpinned by a common screen— as well as real life—assumption about the Internet: It exists primarily to  distribute porn.   230   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  While scenes of characters both perusing and even self-stimulating to  netporn are relatively common,1 the focus of this chapter is on the spec- trum of ways that the Internet helps to cater to sexual perversions. While  porn is an obvious starting point for this discussion, the Internet is also  portrayed  as  providing  characters  with  many  other  ways  to  experience  their sexuality, from aiding sexual minorities in connecting, through to  helping fetishists organize vicarious outlets for their niche tastes.  The word pervert has a long history of use as a diagnosis, a slur, and a  way to marginalize, pathologize, and even criminalize those with an analy- sis of sexual interests deviating from the norm. To be classified as a pervert  is, commonly, to be inextricably linked to the darker, dirtier, and more  commonly repressed aspects of sexuality. In this chapter—and following  my use of pervert in previous writing2—I use the word in a casual rather  than in a diagnostic way to describe sexual interests that deviate from the  mainstream; to borrow psychoanalyst Joyce McDougall’s simple defini- tion, “a pervert is someone who does not make love like everyone else.”3  Rather than focusing on subjective notions of ethics, morality, good taste,  or decency—which too often plague discussions of sexualities4—pervert  in this discussion simply describes people interested in sex that is not sta- tistically mainstream; an idea at the heart of philosopher Alan Goldman’s  definition:  Perversion does not represent a deviation from the reproductive function   or kissing would be perverted , from a loving relationship  or most sexual  desire and many heterosexual acts would be perverted  . . . It is a deviation  from a norm, but the norm in question is merely statistical.5  This  chapter  begins  with  screen  portrayals  of  netporn  use  and  then  explores  the  Internet’s  capacity  to  facilitate  perversions  including  exhi- bitionism, confession, voyeurism, infidelity, and, finally, homosexuality.  Pornography and Pornification  In the “Body of Evidence” episode of the British crime series New Tricks   2003– , the detective, Gerry  Dennis Waterman , commented, “In our  day, we had to brave the top shelf and disapproving newsagents. But now,  you can get an eyeful of anything and you don’t have to leave the house.  And it’s free.” Here, Gerry spotlights a changed media landscape and, as  specifically relevant to this chapter, the ubiquitousness of a once taboo  media. In a world where porn is so pervasive, to consider consumption of  it as perverse needs explanation. Equally, in a world where access to porn       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    231  is made so easy, to consider consumption as deviant highlights a para- dox of high usage but continued controversy. While porn consumption is  high and for some cohorts even near-universal, and while extensive main- streaming of explicit material has transpired, to go so far as to contend  that the taboo has been completely absolved or, more specifically, that its  masturbatory use is now free from stigma is hyperbole. This situation,  however, is a good insight into the difficulty in discussing a “Hollywood”  take on a subject matter like netporn because the full gamut of views are  identifiable in film and television depictions, from the scathing condem- nations in Christian-dramas through to the more liberal presentations in  more consciously cutting-edge media.  The inclusion of porn as a theme in screen narratives has both a central  role in contributing to its mainstreaming but also in its framing as devi- ant. First, the increased presence of porn is commonly termed pornifica- tion,  something  defined  well  by  media  theorist  Feona  Attwood  in  the  Mainstreaming Sex anthology:  Porn stars are entering the world of mainstream celebrity, writing best- selling books, acting as sex advisors in lifestyle magazines and becoming  the  stars  of  lads  mags.  Porn  has  turned  chic  and  become  an  object  of  fascination  in  art,  film,  television  and  the  press.  Porn  style  is  also  now  commonplace especially in music video and advertising, and a scantily  clad, surgically enhanced “porn look” is evident, not only in the media,  but on the streets.6  A central aspect of pornification, as Attwood contends, is porn becom- ing  an  object  of  fascination  in  media.  While  this  is  something  evident  in  films  with  narratives  centered  on  porn  production—for  example,  Hardcore  1979 , La ley del deseo  Law of Desire   1987 , The People vs.  Larry Flynt  1996 , Boogie Nights  1997 , Demonlover  2002 , Wonder- land  2003 , Zack and Miri Make a Porno  2008 , Finding Bliss  2009 ,  Middle  Men   2009 ,  About  Cherry   2012 ,  and  Lovelace   2013 —such  mainstreaming is also apparent in screen fiction where porn is casually  consumed and where the material is neither challenged nor demonized.  In the action film Nowhere to Run  1993 , for example, the protagonist,  Sam  Jean-Claude Van Damme , was casually reading a porn magazine;  in  the  “Kamikaze  Bingo”  episode  of  the  sitcom  Curb Your  Enthusiasm   1999– , Nat  Shelley Berman  was recreationally watching a porn video.  In the “Chapter 23” episode of the political-drama House of Cards  2013– ,  Francis   Kevin  Spacey   watched  netporn  on  his  laptop.  None  of  these  characters were masturbating, porn was simply consumed like any other    232   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  media; sexually explicit material in such examples is presented as normal,  and goes unreprimanded.  While  in  a  world  of  mainstreamed  porn  a  character  simply  looking  at explicit material may not be immediately flagged as perverted, such  examples provide a good illustration of pornification whereby consump- tion  is  presented  as   somewhat   less  perverted:  If  porn  and  masturba- tion can be separated, then the “sleazy” connotations of such material  gets mitigated. Of course, many scenes do combine consumption with  masturbation.  In  my  book  Masturbation  in  Pop  Culture:  Screen,  Society,  Self,  I  dis- cussed a variety of scenes from film and television where characters not  only access but self-stimulate to netporn. Such scenes transpire across a  variety of genres, for example in episodes of South Park  1997– , Fam- ily  Guy   1999– ,  Two  and  a  Half  Men   2003– ,  Queer  as  Folk   2000– 2005 ,  Californication   2007–2014 ,  Skins   2007–2013 ,  Being  Erica   2009–2011 , The League  2009– , and The Big C  2010–2013 , as well  as  in  films  including  Little  Children   2006 ,  2:37   2006 ,  Afterschool   2008 , Control Alt Delete  2008 , Girl$  2010 , Shame  2011 , Ameri- can Reunion  2012 , Don Jon  2013 , Thanks for Sharing  2013 , Men,  Women & Children  2014 , and Wish I Was Here  2014 . On one hand,  these examples—akin to the aforementioned scenes from Nowhere to Run,  Curb Your Enthusiasm, and House of Cards—can be construed as simply  contributing  to  mainstreaming:  Through  the  simple,  and  repetitious,  portrayal of porn consumption, the stigma around such explicit material  absolves. The situation is, however, more complicated. In each of these  examples, rather than netporn simply being browsed, it gets masturbated  to.  Masturbation—particularly  male  masturbation—has  a  long  history  of being demonized on and off screen as something gross,7 so while such  representations  can  be  interpreted  as  contributing  to  mainstreaming,  masturbation with all its baggage as disgusting and perverted also means  such scenes are open to interpretation as being subtle condemnations: By  linking porn to a still taboo practice  one which also often connotes des- peration and depravity on screen ,8 it gets demonized. Some narratives,  of course, more specifically frame netporn-aided masturbation as perverse  via the storyline surrounding the consumption.  Getting Sprung, Getting Reprimanded  In Masturbation in Pop Culture I discussed the common screen narra- tive of characters getting caught masturbating. Invariably these narratives  play out the same way: The masturbator and the person catching them are       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    233  embarrassed; the masturbator is also framed as at least somewhat deviant  for  a  masturbating and  b  putting themselves in a position of being  caught. While a character getting sprung is one comparatively subtle way  to frame netporn as deviant, another is when the characters get explicitly  called out for their behavior. In the drama Don Jon for example, when  Barbara  Scarlett Johansson  caught her boyfriend, Jon  Joseph Gordon- Levitt , watching netporn, she was quick to brand the material as “sick”  and his consumption of it as “fucking disgusting.” Jon’s continued use of it  led to the dissolution of their relationship. In the drama Disconnect  2012 ,  when Cindy  Paula Patton  and her husband Derek  Alexander Skarsgård   were privately investigating the man—Stephen  Michael Nyqvist —who  they  believed  had  committed  identity  theft  on  them,  the  two  combed  through Stephen’s bank statements to identify patterns of behavior:  Derek:    Look at this, look at this. Pay-for-view charge. Adult entertainment.  $59. In one month?  Cindy:  Derek:  Yeah in one month. I knew he was a creep.  Stephen’s consumption of netporn apparently cemented his status as  a “creep.” Similar themes are apparent in the comedy Celebrity Sex Tape   2012 . The narrative centered on a group of teen boys who get dragooned  into making porn after accruing a debt. The film follows the lead up to  Ross  Jack Cullison  losing his virginity on-screen as part of a pay-for- view special. Ross, in fact, ends up refusing to participate, addressing the  camera to explain his decision: “I’ll have you know, there’s only one girl I  want to lose my virginity to. My ex-girlfriend Kim [Julie Barzman]. And  she wouldn’t be watching this because she’s not that kind of girl, unlike  all you little perverts. She’s pure. And I love that about her.” Like Cindy  and Derek in Disconnect, Ross determines that porn consumption is a  character  indictment.  A  more  serious  example  of  netporn  as  a  marker  of deviancy transpired in the British miniseries The Escape Artist  2013 .  A central reason that Liam Foyle  Toby Kebbell  was suspected of com- mitting a vicious murder was his penchant for extreme porn. The link  between porn consumption and suspicion was also a theme in the “Chat  Room” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  1999–  when the  father of a rape victim was briefly under scrutiny; a search of his computer  had revealed images of nude women with big cats. Equally, in the “After- math: Part 1” episode of the British police-drama DCI Banks  2010– , a  man who had kept women locked up against their will was also revealed    234   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  to be in possession of “extreme” netporn: His media tastes made his crimi- nal behavior seem predictable.  While these examples each present the porn criminality link as seri- ous,  a  comic  example  exploiting  similar  ideas  transpired  in  the  drama  Middle Men: Some terrorists were found to have a particular interest in  military-themed girls-with-guns material; terrorists are bad and thus their  consumption of kinky porn only compounds their evil.  Just as netporn can be spoken of as deviant, another way it is framed as   such is via its portrayal as addictive.  Perversion and Addiction  While the Internet in general has, since its inception, been theorized as  addictive,9 the idea of netporn as particularly so has notable relevance to a  discussion of perversion. Psychoanalyst Louise Kaplan, for example, con- tended that “the pervert has no choice. His sexual performance is obliga- tory, compulsive, fixated and rigid.”10 While Kaplan’s definition is in line  with the pathologizing and diagnostic definitions I eschew in this chapter,  her identification of the role of compulsion relates well to one way that  the netporn user is framed as perverted on screen: Compulsive use is the  real problem.  In the “All Better Now” episode of the series Queer as Folk, Ted  Scott  Lowell  was fired for browsing porn sites at work. The same thing hap- pened in the “The Great Ashby” episode of Californication when Char- lie’s  Evan Handler  workplace netporn use  and associated masturbation   was exposed. While in Queer as Folk Ted was scarcely repentant—in fact,  he  redirected  his  porn  interests  into  establishing  the  JerkAtWork.net  website—for Charlie in Californication he eventually conceded that his  use had in fact become compulsive. In fact, in the “Boys and Girls” epi- sode, after Charlie had failed to seduce his son’s babysitter, Lizzie  Camilla  Luddington , he admitted, “I have been watching so much porn on the  Internet lately that I’ve been seeking so much sexual gratification that it’s  like I don’t even know how to relate to real women anymore.” Charlie  did not explicitly admit to having an addiction but he certainly hinted  to some of the deleterious consequences commonly associated, notably  damaged interpersonal relationships and fraught gender relations. Some- thing similar transpired in Don Jon. Not only did Jon repeatedly go to  church  to  confess  his  porn-masturbation  sins—thus  tabling  them  as  a  problem—but, as noted, his relationship with netporn actually sabotaged  his relationship with Barbara. “Addiction” is not spoken of in Don Jon,  but the narrative certainly questions the extent to which Jon’s compulsive       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    235  use impacts negatively on his life. Netporn addiction is treated in the same  vague  but  still  problematic  way  in  the  drama  Shame.  The  protagonist,  Brandon   Michael  Fassbender ,  is  presented  as  having  a  problem  with  netporn: He consumes it compulsively  including at work  and is implied  to have an inability to form relationships with women. A cause-and-effect  thesis is not explicitly presented but nonetheless it exists as a reasonable  conclusion that an audience might draw.11 Given the absence of diagno- sis, these examples could be interpreted as relatively nuanced and com- paratively less heavy-handed treatments of addiction, alternatively, could  be likened to those narratives discussed in Chapter 1 whereby characters  with, for example, obvious Asperger’s traits are left undiagnosed so that  filmmakers do not have to stay true to any single psychological condition.  While in Don Jon, Shame, and Californication diagnosis is eschewed, other  narratives focus more specifically on netporn-addiction as a social prob- lem. For teenager Justin  Jeremy Supter  in the television drama Cyber  Seduction: His Secret Life  2005 , his use of netporn led to social isolation,  a failure to continue swimming at a competitive level, and ultimately to  an addiction diagnosis. In the Christian-drama The Saber  2007 , Cam- eron’s  Zac Klammer  addiction—which gets explicitly verbalized in the  narrative—leads to his expulsion from the military academy and the ter- mination of his relationship with his girlfriend. Addiction is again named  in Thanks for Sharing, a narrative centered on characters who have outed  themselves as sex addicts and for whom netporn is an outlet and—in the  case for Adam  Mark Ruffalo  and Neil  Josh Gad —is actually the source  of their relapse.  While there is, as discussed in reference to the Kaplan literature, an  academic basis for linking addiction to perversion via the use of netporn,  it is also worth considering other explanations for this framing. First, such  a presentation can be construed as yet another manifestation of techno-  and cyberphobia. In film theorist Daniel Dinello’s work on technophobia  he  identifies  that  narratives  often  “paint  the  spread  of  technology  as  a  malevolent,  uncontrollable  virus”12  and  that  in  such  narratives  “cyber- space addiction dominates humans to the exclusion of human connec- tion.”13 The demonizing of technology predicated on fears of addiction is  also apparent in other discussions14 and it is thus unsurprising that porn  is presented as having a role in this. An extension of this—and in line with  techno- and cyberphobia-based fears of moral decay15—netporn addic- tion is presented as a dramatic downside of Internet connectivity.  Another  explanation  for  the  addiction  narrative  is,  simply,  the  long- standing trend of incorporating contemporary social issues into film and    236   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  television: Sex and porn addiction have been considered as social prob- lems for well over a decade16 and thus make for salient subjects for the  screen. Film theorist Amanda Ann Klein dates the social issue film back  to the 1930s with narratives focusing, commonly, on contemporary prob- lems like drug and alcohol use and homelessness.17 Klein, like a number  of scholars, considers such films as both representing a distinct genre and  one that is now considered largely historic  having peaked in the 1940s .18  While the genre is certainly less popular today, the idea of social concerns  being fictionalized—even if perhaps presented in a less explicitly moralistic  way than occurred originally—is fairly common. The historian Philip Jen- kins, for example, discussed this in the context of contemporary made-for- television movies: “These films are often tailored to currently fashionable  concerns, and the gap between a specific incident or outrage and the release  of the television movie responding to it can only be a few months.”19 The  television drama Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life is a particularly good illus- tration of this. Unlike the allusions made to addiction in Don Jon or Shame,  netporn addiction was presented from the outset as a social problem and,  in turn, spoken of explicitly as grounds for moral panic. In one scene a  guidance  teacher  explained  to  Justin’s  parents,  “Look,  he’s  not  the  only  student with this type of problem. Since all this new technology makes the  Internet so incredibly accessible, pornography addiction has become more  common.” In another scene the social havoc of netporn is further demon- strated when Beth  Briony Glassco , a friend of Justin’s mom, explained  the  reasons  for  her  divorce,  divulging,  “My  marriage  was  destroyed  by  his addiction to Internet porn.” The film works to personalize, and make  entertaining, a problem that is being presented as an epidemic.  An extension of netporn addiction being part of a social ills presenta- tion, is that such depictions are primarily about demonization: Framing  netporn use as leading to negative social consequences is a way to present  the user as deviant and the medium as complicit in moral corruption.  While in Queer as Folk and Californication the negative consequence was  job loss, and in Don Jon and The Saber it was relationship loss, The Saber  took “cost” substantially further when Cameron’s addiction led him to  persuade his girlfriend to accompany him to a strip club; she fled the club  and  was  beaten   and  possibly  raped :  Her  predicament  was  presented  as  explicitly  linked  to  his  perversion.20  Such  an  extreme  consequence  of netporn consumption might be predictable for a Christian film but  also links the narrative to social issues films around alcohol consump- tion  and  pregnancy  where  characters  get  severely  punished  for  their  transgressions.21      T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    237  The Escape Artist, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, DCI Banks, and  Middle Men examples discussed earlier highlight that on screen, the spe- cific type of porn consumed often works to present the netporn consumer  as distinctly deviant.  Perversion and Doubly Deviant Content  In the drama Middle Men, in one of Jack’s  Luke Wilson  monologues  about  netporn,  he  stated,  “Whatever  you  want  to  see  is  there  in  your  home or office, twenty hour hours a day, and it’s ready when you are,  discretely, privately, and in whatever flavor you choose.” Here Jack specifi- cally mentions flavor, and certainly in popular media it is common for the  flavor of netporn consumed to dictate the degree to which a character is  framed as perverted.  In numerous scenes in Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life teen characters  watched netporn. It was only, however, when Justin consumed kinkier  material that his friends—those very same ones who had been consuming  netporn themselves—began to call him out for his consumption; “Get  that crap off my computer! . . . That stuff’s way too twisted. Dude, you’re  getting  scuzzy.”  These  friends  accused  Justin  of  liking  the  real  “freaky  stuff”  and  soon  dubbed  him  “kinky  the  clown.”  In  the  opening  scene  of the drama Afterschool, teenager Robert  Ezra Miller  masturbated to  porn involving strangulation: From that very first scene the character was  framed as strange, as perverted; a theme that continues across the course  of the narrative. As these examples illustrate, the consumption of certain  kinds of porn is rendered as worse than others and works to frame con- sumers as distinctly perverted. While in Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life  and Afterschool the consumption of fetish and violent porn is framed as a  serious problem, the same message of the perverted-netporn consumer is  also subtly identifiable in less serious examples. In the “Screams of Silence:  The Story of Brenda Q” episode of the animated series Family Guy, Quag- mire  masturbated  to  clown  porn.  Quagmire  is  framed  throughout  the  series as deviant,22 his use of kinky porn is one way his deviancy is further  proven; clown porn makes him creepier than more typical material would.  A similar presentation transpires in the crime series Dexter  2006–2013   whereby  Vince  Masuka   C.  S.  Lee ,  a  character  consistently  presented  as perverted,23 is shown to have an interest in transgender porn: In the  “Dex, Lies, and Videotape” episode, for example, he remarks, “So I hear  a rumor you’re tracking all our internet activity. So is it true? ’Cause I can  explain all that she-male stuff.”24 Vince is rendered extra deviant because  his tastes are outlier.   238   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  As discussed throughout this chapter, nonvanilla or nonmainstream sex  is considered perverse, it is, therefore, unsurprising, that representations  of such sex are construed as equally problematic. While masturbation to  netporn is one way that perverse interests get catered to via the Internet,  netporn is also presented in narratives as a catalyst for sexual fantasy, if not  sexual act; something that links screen presentations to the prescriptive  porn-harm arguments proposed in academic work.  Netporn and Perverse Inspiration  In her newspaper article on porn and marriage, writer Sarah Hampson   concluded with the following remarks:  Pornography is not bad, but whenever I have watched it, I feel like one of  those rats in a science lab. Sure, the sex corner of my brain can be made to  light up. Give me stimulation, I get stimulated. Duh. It’s like asking me to  respond to an advertisement for Manolo Blahniks. Do I feel desire? Sure.  But it’s so uncreative. Someone is telling me what to think.25  Here, Hampson alludes to a prescriptive role for porn: It can dictate  what  consumers  should  find  stimulating. While  Hampson’s  comments  were articulated in a newspaper opinion piece, the same ideas are also  apparent in academic literature26 and, unsurprisingly, also on screen. In  The Saber, for example, when Cameron first logs on to the Internet in  search of porn, a female holographic figure appears by his side and coos,  “I noticed you among the young men, so I came out to meet you.” While  this figure can be interpreted as a very literal presentation of the forebod- ing Internet badlands bogeyman  Chapter 5 , the hologram in fact, exists  as a visual representation of temptation, more specifically Internet tempta- tion. The idea of the Internet as a source of permanent enticement con- tinues throughout The Saber: Cameron’s use of netporn comes to define  what turns him on offline leading him to cajole his virgin girlfriend to  the strip show in an attempt to sway her to break her virginity pledge.  Similar themes are identifiable in Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life. As Jus- tin’s netporn addiction develops, he begins to be distracted by the phy- siques of his female peers at the pool; prior to his life of porn, women in  swimsuits did not phase him but after his introduction to porn, he was  seemingly unable to resist sexualizing them. Such themes were also appar- ent in Thanks for Sharing. The film opens with sex addict Adam walking  through Manhattan. Adam is constantly distracted by sexualized images  of women in outdoor advertisements as well by attractive women walking       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    239  on the street; porn has, apparently, helped dictate his sources of stimula- tion. Zach Boren also briefly alluded to this issue in his review of Shame,  interpreting Brandon’s relationship with porn as partly responsible for the  fact that “his every interaction is sexualized.”27  In The Saber, Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life, Thanks for Sharing, and  Shame netporn is presented—in varying degrees—as shaping the sexual  appetites of consumers, a theory extensively discussed in feminist media  analyses28 and, more specifically, in certain branches of antiporn research  where  porn  is  considered  as  negatively  impacting  on  men’s  abilities  to  relate to women, on their relationship satisfaction, and even on their sex- ual functioning.29 In her critique of such antiporn research, the historian  Dagmar Herzog identified how “the mainstream media have absorbed so  many of these formulations that a new kind of cultural common sense has  evolved about the purported emotional harm done by porn.”30 Certainly  on screen such a cultural common sense is readily identifiable. While the  examples discussed thus far hint to the harms that have been popular- ized by antiporn research, in other examples they get explicitly verbalized.  A  good  example  of  this  transpires  in  Men, Women  &  Children,  a  film  described  by  critics  variously  as  a  “trite  fresco,”31  “[a]  clumsy,  clammy  critique of modern web culture,”32 and an “anti-Internet screed.”33 In the  opening scene, the family patriarch Don  Adam Sandler  is seated at a  computer about to undertake a search for netporn. The film’s narrator   Emma Thompson  critiques his quest: “Don gave a brief thought to mas- turbating using only his imagination, but the sheer quality and variety  of the Internet had left his brain an inferior substitute.” The film’s porn- harm thesis extends to the narrator’s analysis of Don’s son, Chris’s  Travis  Tope  online activity also:  Chris Truby began surfing pornography at the age of ten with a simple  search of the word “boobs.” This somewhat innocent query led to a series  of clicks and within an hour of his first search Chris was watching a short  video entitled “Titty Fucking Cum Queen.” He might have thought this  video to be unusual had it not already been viewed by three million oth- ers. By age fifteen, Chris found it difficult to achieve an erection without  viewing a level of deviance that fell well outside societal norms.  Men, Women & Children’s treatment of netporn—widely criticized as  heavy-handed34 and sermonizing35—appears strongly influenced by anti- porn rhetoric and presents harm uncritically, as a kind of cultural truth and  as a “canny” insight into the Zeitgeist. The marital difficulties experienced  by Don and notably the erectile difficulties experienced by Chris—and    240   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  explicitly blamed on netporn in the film—are themes identifiable in other  narratives  where  the  same  antiporn  line  is  promoted.  In  the  Canadian  romantic-comedy Love, Sex and Eating the Bones  2003 , Michael  Hill  Harper   is  a  netporn  addict  and  when  he  and  Jasmine   Marlyne  Bar- rett  were about to have sex for the first time, he was unable to perform:  Michael’s masturbatory life had rendered intercourse almost impossible.  The same thing transpired in Shame: while Brandon had no trouble mas- turbating to netporn or having sex with prostitutes, when he attempted  sex  with  a  colleague   Nicole  Beharie —who  he  had  developed  feelings  for—he was unable to get erect.  Herzog  referenced  Pamela  Paul’s  porn-critique  Pornified:  Narratives  like Men, Women & Children, Love, Sex and Eating the Bones, Shame, and  also Californication certainly appear to have been substantially influenced  by porn-harm arguments presented by Paul:  Take a regular guy with no previous sexual problems. He’ll be fine with  his partner early in the relationship, as he is falling in love, but then finds  himself  experiencing  some  performance  trouble:  difficulty  maintaining  erections and control . . . So he begins masturbating to pornography or  ups the amount he’s already been viewing. It’s easy . . . There’s no one to  satisfy. And that’s a huge relief. He feels more virile, more sexually potent.  He can get used to this—and he does. Now, when and if he turns to be  with a partner, sex is even more difficult than it was before . . . His sexual  dysfunction worsens.36  While the narratives I’ve discussed each implicate porn as a factor in  relationship  disharmony,  worth  spotlighting  is  an  outlier  example  that  presents a man’s use of porn as actually something quite separate from,  and not detrimental to, his relationship. In the “Under My Thumb” epi- sode of the Canadian series Being Erica, the title character  Erin Karpluk   accidentally walked in on her boyfriend Ethan  Tyron Leitso  masturbat- ing to netporn. Erica tried hard to work out how best to broach the topic  with Ethan, finally, she put on a Russian accent and attempted to seduce  him using porn tropes:  Erica:  Ethan:   I just thought it would be fun and that it would help you. I don’t need help to want you.  For Ethan, netporn existed quite separately from his sex life with Erica.  In Masturbation in Pop Culture I discussed the rare screen portrayal of  masturbation  as  kind  of  alternate  sexual  activity:  “that  it  is  not  about       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    241  a lack of something or a substitute for someone, nor is it about acting  in opposition to heterosexuality, homosexuality or necessarily even about  disrupting social norms, but that it is simply another kind of sexuality.”37  This scene from Being Erica can be interpreted as evidence of an alter- nate way of thinking about netporn consumption: For Ethan porn doesn’t  dictate his sexual interests—in fact he doesn’t even want to act out porn  scenes with his girlfriend—netporn is simply another outlet for sexual  expression and one that exists separately from his relationship.  Another  manner  in  which  netporn  provides  an  outlet  for  sexual  expression—but one that also serves to frame the consumer as deviant— is via its use as a substitution and where masturbation comes to replace  sexual activities considered more normal.  Netporn and Substitution  In my book Part-Time Perverts: Sex, Pop Culture and Kink Management,   I discussed the idea of substitution as it relates to perverse sex:  My approach to perversion is that whatever the nature of the perverse  thought or fantasy, its manifestation does not always involve an actualiza- tion of the perversion as imagined. Instead, I contend that often other  activity  substitutes.  My  use  of  substitution  describes  doing  one  thing  instead of something else.38 [I]n  some  circumstances  an  individual  will  fantasize  about  a  certain  perversion—perhaps  incest  or  pedophilia  or  bestiality—and  then  will  actually act on the fantasy. For others, their fantasy will manifest in sub- stitution and another activity will sate the original fantasy.39  In Internet-themed screen narratives netporn often functions to sub- stitute  for  certain  sex  acts:  A  character  will  watch  a  representation  of  an act in lieu of physical participation; that perhaps a kind of engage- ment transpires whereby a fantasy is sated by simply imagining oneself  participating. On one level, netporn consumption might just function  as a substitute for intercourse that is unavailable. In Masturbation and  Pop Culture, for example, I examined how a character’s—particularly a  male character’s—masturbation is often used on screen as a substitute  for  a  sex-partner.40  In  the  “Twanging  Your  Magic  Clanger”  episode  of  the  sitcom  Two  and  a  Half  Men   2003– ,  the  second  time  Charlie   Charlie  Sheen   caught  his  brother,  Alan   John  Cryer ,  masturbat- ing to netporn he said, “Hey, I get it, you’re bored, you’re lonely, you  can’t afford a hooker.” Alan agreed with Charlie’s summation: Netporn    242   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  apparently served Alan as a direct substitute for intercourse. While Alan  likely would have had intercourse with a woman had one been available,  in other examples the choice to use netporn in fact is more deliberate.  Jon  in  Don  Jon,  for  example,  expressed  a  preference  for  netporn,  even  when intercourse was available. In one of his monologues on the appeal  of porn, he spoke explicitly about his preference; Jon’s monologue was  interspliced with footage of him having sex and images of netporn:  Real pussy’s all good. But I’m sorry. It’s not as good as porn. Tits? Great.  Ass? Great. Blowjob? Sure, it’s fucking fantastic in person . . . if she’ll do  it. But in real life, if you wanna get head, you gotta give head . . . I know,  some guys love eating pussy, but the thing about those guys is, they’re  fucking crazy. Don’t get me wrong, I like a good pussy-eating clip. But,  from down here, there’s nothing good about this. And if she does finally  decide to do you the big favor . . . she’s in a fucking hurry. Now, when it  comes to the actual fucking . . . First of all, condoms are terrible. They just  are. But you gotta wear one, ’cause, unlike porn, real pussy can kill you.  Second of all, missionary is the worst position in all of fucking. The tits lie  flat, you can’t see her ass, you can’t touch her ass, ’cause she’s lying on her  back. They won’t let you do it from behind, ’cause they wanna look at you.  And basically it’s on me to do all the work. Moneyshot? No. There is no  real-life moneyshot. Real girls won’t do that shit. You just gotta cum into  the fucking condom. So, you tell me, which looks better? This? Or this?  While this scene—akin to the Two and a Half Men example—references  substitution, for Jon, more than just substitution, netporn was actually a  preference.  In  Masturbation  in  Pop  Culture  I  discussed  how  a  character  being  shown  to  prefer  masturbation  over  sex  is  often  a  device  used  to  frame a character as deviant; something I explored in reference to the teen  comedy American Pie  1999 :  Jim’s dad  Eugene Levy  was reassuring his son  Jason Biggs  that mastur- bation was completely normal. At one point, however, Jim’s dad hesitated  and said, “You do want a partner, don’t you son?” According to his reason- ing, masturbation is only okay if it is transitional and not the constantly  chosen or preferred sexual conduct: choosing or preferring it raises mal- adjustment concerns.41  In Masturbation in Pop Culture I also discussed how, when a charac- ter  choses  to  masturbate  instead  of  having  sex  with  their  partner,  “the  preference for masturbation [is] framed as evidence of a problem—as a  symptom—as opposed to a sensible choice.”42 Preference and substitution,       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    243  in fact, have specific relevance in academic discussions of perversion. In  psychiatrist  Mervin  Glasser’s  work  on  deviance,  for  example,  he  con- tended that “when the sexual deviance is a persistent, constantly preferred  form of sexual behavior which reflects a global structure involving the  individual’s whole personality, I consider it appropriate to use the term  ‘perversion,’ despite its pejorative overtones.”43 The psychiatrist Thomas  Hora articulates a similar position, identifying that “masturbation as a  substitution  for  intercourse  with  a  beloved  person  when  the  opportu- nity for intercourse is not available is unhealthy and inauthentic.”44 For  a character like Jon in Don Jon, while his preoccupation with porn didn’t  physically impact on his sexual functioning—he could still maintain erec- tions with Barbara—he nevertheless was presented as perverted because  he verbalizes a preference for porn; a preference for self-touch over inter- course. The same sentiments are articulated—and formed the basis for a  character indictment—in the comedy Your Friends and Neighbors  1998   when, like Jon, Barry  Aaron Eckhart  explicitly proclaimed, “I’m telling  you, nobody makes me come the way I do” and “Nobody gives me more  pleasure than I give myself . . . I’m my best lay.” The same theme is also  apparent in the “User Friendly” episode of the sitcom Married with Chil- dren  1987–1997 . After Bud  David Faustino  volunteered for a cybersex  experiment, he too developed a preference for it, explaining to his sister,  “Look, Kelly, I don’t need [love interest] Amber, I have her. Dr. Kessler  introduced me to cybersex and I can create Amber anytime I want . . . She  does what I want, whenever I want it.” In both Don Jon and Married with  Children, male characters were framed as specifically perverted because  they preferred their own hand over women.  The  idea  of  substitution  also  transpires  in  portrayals  of  netporn  use  where such material substitutes for sex acts that might be illegal or, per- haps, physically or emotionally dangerous. In the “Little Boats” episode of  the comedy series Weeds  2005–2012 , for example, Nancy  Mary-Louise  Parker  reprimanded her son, Shane  Alexander Gould , for masturbating  over a photo of her: “It’s a little quirky to masturbate to pictures of your  mother, to have this sexual kind of relationship or connection or hook-up  or stand in for your mother,” she tells him. Here, Nancy explicitly alludes  to  substitution:  Shane’s  masturbation  stood  in  for  an  actual  incestuous  interaction with her. In the context of netporn, while, as discussed at the  beginning of this chapter, it can provide a vicarious substitute for certain  sex acts, the use of child porn is one kind of substitution that has received  extensive  academic  attention  whereby  pedophiles  substitute  images  for  actual sexual congress with a child in order to moderate perverse desires.45   244   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  A different aspect to porn consumption—and one that manifests on  screen with the use of the Internet—is voyeurism, a perversion catered to  by netporn as well as other online offerings.  Netporn and Voyeurism  Communications scholar Ronald Jackson defines voyeurism as follows:  Voyeurism describes in general the behavior of a voyeur or a voyeuse, sug- gesting a secret spectator who experiences satisfaction in the sexual activity  of others. To look at or observe other persons—secretly or openly—can be  a way to generate one’s own identity by reflection, by contrast or stimu- lated by the wish for visual participation.46  Such behavior is identified in numerous discussions on perversion47  and it is, of course, a perversion essential to a discussion of the Internet  given that it is an interactive and notably visual medium. In the previous  section, I discussed netporn. Dubbing consumption of netporn as voy- euristic is a complicated assertion. Critics, for example, have contended  that  an  essential  component  of  voyeurism  is,  as  psychoanalyst  Sergio  Benvenuto contends, observing “the sexual act of a person who does not  desire to be observed.”48 According to such reasoning, therefore, netporn  consumption  would  be  inappropriately  classified  as  such;  as  commu- nications theorist Susanna Paasonen explains, “[a]s something implied  and invited, this voyeurism, is, in fact, no longer voyeurism as such.”49  In line, however, with Jackson’s idea of looking or observing secretly or  openly, I would contend that in viewing netporn a kind of voyeurism is  actually at play. In Part-Time Perverts I proposed a taxonomy for under- standing involvement in perversion. One of the participation categories  I identified centered on sexual fantasies that are experienced vicariously  “through media products and where physical participation is restricted  to cerebral and masturbatory pursuits.”50 While film and television pro- vide a means for audiences to experience perversion in an arm’s-length  manner,51 and within narratives voyeurism can be an explicit theme,52  netporn also caters explicitly to the voyeuristic pleasure of simply look- ing  at—and  deriving  pleasure  from—watching  sex  in  the  generic.  In  line with theorists who adopt a broad definition of voyeurism beyond  just unwanted observation,53 I contend that netporn is a kind of voyeur- ism  albeit passive . Certain kinds of netporn, however, lend themselves  more specifically to this descriptor, for example, porn that has a theme  of unwanted observation be it real or fabricated. In philosopher Darci       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    245  Doll’s work on celebrity sex tapes, she discussed the appeal of unwanted  observation material:  Several of the reasons people give for watching porn in general give insight  into why there is a social interest in celebrity sex tapes. One such reason is  that there is an erotic appeal to voyeurism. People have expressed that the  sheer act of viewing others engaged in sexual acts is arousing. In this vein,  celebrity sex tapes fulfil a sexual desire to see others in sexual scenarios.54  While the scopophilic pleasure in any kind of sexual display can be  interpreted as a kind of voyeurism, the term has specific appeal in the con- text  of  watching  illicitly  recorded  material: Watching  unwanted  obser- vation  material—potentially  involving  people  we  know—adds  a  very  specific element of erotic and voyeuristic appeal. In the romantic-comedy  Love and Other Drugs  2010 , for example, Josh  Josh Gad  masturbated  to a sex tape that his brother Jamie  Jake Gyllenhaal  and lover Maggie   Anne Hathaway  had made: Josh shouldn’t have had access to the tape  and  thus  the  material  proffered  particular  voyeuristic  appeal. While  in  Love  and  Other  Drugs the recording was on VHS, an Internet-themed  example of the same themes transpired in the comedy Sex Tape  2014 . The  narrative centered on a married couple, Annie  Cameron Diaz  and Jay   Jason Segel , who had recorded themselves having sex on their iPad and  afterward accidentally synced the footage onto the iPads of their friends  and colleagues. Later the video was leaked to the YouPorn website. While  the accidental distribution caused the couple great consternation, it also  allowed a voyeuristic opportunity for Annie and Jay’s friends Tess  Ellie  Kemper  and Robby  Rob Corddry , who were so aroused after viewing  it that they had sex soon after. In Sex Tape the voyeurism was presented in  a relatively humorous way; something that isn’t typical for screen narra- tives involving intimate recordings. In narratives including the television  drama Sexting in Suburbia  2012  and the Australian drama The Killing  Field  2014 , female characters had taken erotic imagery of themselves  that got leaked and, in turn, became voyeuristically observed, consumed  and framed as a gross invasion of privacy. Something similar transpired  in the “Shoot to Thrill” episode of the Canadian drama series Degrassi:  The Next Generation  2001– : Alli  Melinda Shankar  took some sexy self- ies and sent them to her boyfriend Johnny  Scott Paterson  who, after  the two had a fight, showed them to his friends. In the television drama  Betrayed at 17  2011  sexual footage was secretly recorded and then dis- tributed online; the same thing transpired in the horror film Black Christ- mas   2006 ,  the  “Truth  or  Consequences”  episode  of  the  drama  series    246   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Lie to Me  2009–2011  and the pilot of the crime-drama series Stalker   2014–2015 .  Each  of  these  examples  are  a  step  beyond  voyeurism  as  experienced simply via netporn consumption: These narratives showcased  voyeuristic consumption of footage of sex between people who did not  want to be observed. While the distribution of such material can be con- strued as cyberbullying and slut-shaming  Chapter 4 , the consumption  of it is in line with voyeurism. Such material illustrates the market for  secretly recorded material; something that the popular upskirt porn mar- ket illustrates,55 and something the “Sweet Revenge” episode of the crime- drama Major Crimes  2012–  fictionalized. The taking of upskirt photos,  incidentally, is at the heart of the Hong Kong film Kon Shou xing xin ren  lei  Naked Poison   2000  and the Japanese film Ai no mukidashi  Love  Exposure   2008  and is also a minor theme in the action film Bad Boys II    2003 . While  such  illicit  footage  is  normally  taken  of  women,  worth  noting, a brief mention is made of male victims in the thriller Untraceable   2008 : a homosexual male character is fired after installing cameras in  the men’s bathroom.  While netporn and uploaded sex tapes are obvious illustrations of char- acters participating in voyeurism, film and television showcase a variety of  other examples where the perversion is facilitated by other online sources.  Internet-Aided Voyeurism  In  the  “The  Lunar  Excitation”  episode  of  the  sitcom  The  Big  Bang  Theory  2007– , Howard  Simon Helberg  remarked, “Billions of dollars  have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked  women so we don’t have to peep through windows.” In this comic exam- ple, the idea of the Internet providing a new way to experience voyeurism  is alluded to. While, as noted, porn is an obvious way to do this, webcams  provide another.  Webcams and Digital Peeping  While the concept of the Internet aiding in surveillance and cyberstalk- ing efforts was discussed in Chapter 5, for the purposes of this chapter, the  idea of simply using the technology to participate in voyeurism transpires  in numerous scenes where sexually motivated characters go online to spy,  most typically on women. One manifestation of this already discussed in  this book is the idea of lovestruck security guards using cameras to spy on  the women they love from afar, something transpiring in the comedy Paul  Blart:  Mall  Cop   2009 ,  the  Singaporean  romantic-drama  Be  with  Me       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    247   2005 , and the Uruguayan drama Gigante  Giant   2009 . Each of these  examples focus less on the capabilities of the technology, however, and  more so on men looking at women through monitors as a way to visu- ally depict separation and longing rather than objectification  although  the latter is still a viable reading . While in Paul Blart: Mall Cop, Be with  Me, and Gigante men used monitors to love from a distance, in other  examples, webcams provide a more explicitly voyeuristic experience.  Akin to the secretly recorded sexual material within the narratives of Betrayed  at 17, Lie to Me, Stalker and Black Christmas, something similar transpired in  the “Chinese Walls” episode of the British series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries   2001–2007 . While at the heart of the narrative is the murder of a webcam  performer, Emily  Isabella Calthorpe , a subplot revealed that the website’s  socially awkward IT expert, Darren  Joe Armstrong , had secretly installed  cameras in her home to surreptitiously spy on her for his own pleasure. As  discussed in Chapter 5, the same thing transpired in the “Eyes In” episode of  the Canadian police-drama Flashpoint  2008–2012  and the “Home Inva- sions” episode of the legal-drama The Practice  1997–2004 . While in The  Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Flashpoint the narratives were about lovestruck  men spying on women, in other examples such ideas are also connected to  commerce and, in turn, highlight the broad appeal of voyeurism even if, as in  some examples, the illicit peep is fabricated for commercial reasons.  The  comedy-drama  I-See-You.Com   2006 ,  centered  on  an  entrepre- neurial teen, Colby  Mathew Botuchis , who secretly installed webcams  around his home and sold the footage online as a kind of reality show. In  one scene, Colby’s father, Harvey  Beau Bridges , explained what his step- son had done to an investigator, Greg  Hector Elizondo , and voyeurism  was explicitly discussed:  Greg:   Harvey:    So let me get this straight now. Your voyeur stepson, plants a cam- era in his sister’s room then broadcasts it over the Internet so that  strangers and perverts can watch her undress?  Well yeah. Listen, we were way ahead of the curve. Survivor [2000–],   The Simple Life [2003–2007], Joe Millionaire [2003] . . . All these  shows  prove  that  manufactured  reality  sells.  But  you  deliver  the  real deal, you throw some skin in. Hey, there’s a lot of regular guys  like you and me that’ll pay cash to see that sort of trainwreck. Not  just freaks. See, I think it’s the stark reality, the fact that she did not  know anyone was watching. See, that’s what made it so enticing.  I’ll tell you what made it so enticing. The stark nakedness of your  daughter. Harvey:  That too.  Greg:    248   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  While in I-See-You.Com the webcam performers were initially unaware  of their exposure, in numerous other examples, webcam sites are created as  a way to sell the illusion of illicitly recorded material. Illusion in this context  is addressed by Paasonen: “Viewers are aware of the performative nature of  ‘hidden camera’ shots but decide to play along by orienting themselves in  a particular way.”56 The appeal, for example, of these “secret” looks is iden- tified in the “Voyeur’s Web” episode of NCIS  2003–  when the lab tech  Abby  Pauley Perrette  noted, “There’s a big market for desperate house- wives performing behind closed doors. Some of these ladies got rich doing  it.” As Paasonen and Abby in NCIS allude, regardless of the authenticity of  hidden camera footage, appeal lies in the illusion of authenticity.  Webcams being used to create voyeurism-themed material is identifi- able in several examples. In the “Voyeur’s Web” episode of NCIS, Jamie   Brittney Powell  is married to a deployed soldier and operates an erotic  webcam  site  for  extra  money.  In  the  thriller  Look  @  Me   2006 , Tina   Elina Madison  similarly performs at home for a subscriber-based site.  In the aforementioned “Chinese Walls” episode of The Inspector Lynley  Mysteries, Emily works as a performer for an explicit camgirls site. Female  webcam performers are also at the center of the Taiwanese film Ci qing   Spider Lilies   2007  and the television drama Selling Innocence  2005 .  While these narratives focus on the manufacturing of voyeuristic mate- rial  and thus, as discussed later in this chapter, can be connected to the  perversion of exhibitionism , other examples present the voyeurism more  explicitly by focusing on men’s consumption of it. In the British miniseries  Killer Net  1998 , along with the aforementioned Little Children, Shame,  Control Alt Delete as well as the drama On_Line  2002 , male characters  watch female characters perform via webcams, consuming the material as  they would any other kind of porn. In her work on Internet spectatorship,  feminist  scholar  Michele White  discussed  the  gendered  nature  of  such  consumption, noting how “Internet settings often reproduce stereotyped  ideas about bodies and support gendered ways of looking.”57 Certainly on  screen the dynamic does comply with the gendered standard: Men watch  women  perform  on  webcam,  in  line  with  how  commonly  men  watch  women perform in netporn, as well as in other media.58  While numerous scholars have criticized webcam sites as another form  of voyeurism  and thus creating the same apparent harms that exist with  porn ,59 White contends that power, in fact, is distributed differently in  webcam sites compared to netporn:  The refusal of women [webcam] operators to furnish specific images on  demand  makes  webcams  different  from  “pornographic”  sites  that  sell       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    249  shows and other depictions of nude and partially clad bodies. Women  webcam operators maintain control of their representations and develop a  form of power by the ways that they become visible.60  While  I  think  that  power  is  slightly  more  complicated  than  White  implies,  certainly  within  narratives  the  idea  of  the  performer  holding   some  power is alluded to. In the aforementioned Ci qing, for example,  this idea was verbalized by the webcam performer, Jade  Rainie Yang , in  an exchange with one of her customers:  Customer:  Aren’t you afraid of meeting some bad guys online? Jade:    I won’t. I’m in my own home, it’s impossible to meet bad guys.  And the Internet is virtual and false. If I like, then I go online, if  I don’t like, then I get off.  While the power White discusses may have been alluded to in Ci qing,  in fact, in most narratives empowerment is often consciously problema- tized.  In  the  “Chinese Walls”  episode  of  The  Inspector  Lynley  Mysteries,  the webcam performer Emily ends up murdered. In Look @ Me Tina is  kidnapped by one of her subscribers. In Selling Innocence, during an inves- tigation, it was discovered that one of the female murder victims, Angel   Alexz Johnson , had been a camgirl. The webcam appearances of Mia   Sarah Lind , the protagonist of Selling Innocence, also led to her being  cyberstalked by an obsessive fan. These examples present the Internet, but  more specifically the privacy invading technology of webcams, as some- thing to fear as opposed to a source for agency.  Another interpretation for these narratives is akin to the screen’s his- tory of depicting sex workers: The nature of the job puts women in jeop- ardy while simultaneously punishing them for deviating from gender and  sexuality norms.61  While thus far I have discussed sex-themed voyeurism aided by web- cams, it is also important to briefly explore another kind of voyeurism  catered to by webcams: violence. In Masturbation in Pop Culture, I dis- cussed several screen narratives—for example, Matador  1986 , Schramm   1994 , Millennium  1996–1999 , The Cell  1999 , Salinui chueok  Mem- ories  of  Murder    2003 ,  and  The  Fall   2013– —where  characters  mas- turbated to violence, either crime scenes, violent photographs, or violent  video recordings:  These scenes each provide examples of masturbation being used to con- note madness; more so than mere madness, however, these characters were  each presented as, in varying degrees, sick. If there is a “normal” kind of    250   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  masturbation, presumably it involves heterosexual sexual fantasy and per- haps heterosexual porn. In these scenes, acts of violence are found arous- ing, in turn presenting a character as depraved and providing a clear clue  to the audience that something is wrong.62  The Internet—and often specifically webcams—have a role on screen  in providing characters an outlet to violent images that are consumed  akin to netporn within a narrative: as a sexually stimulating entertain- ment product. While characters invariably don’t actually masturbate to  such material on screen, the idea that extreme violence is presented as  an  entertainment  product  highlights  that  there  is,  at  the  very  least,  a  kind of perverse violence-voyeurism at play that the Internet caters to.  The “Crash” episode of the crime-drama CSI: Cyber  2015–  centered on  “gore porn”: The use of porn in this label implies that gore is sometimes  consumed  in  ways  similar  to  sex.63  In  this  episode,  footage  of  vehicle  accidents is distributed online to people who find such footage arousing.  In the British film Chatroom  2010 , William  Aaron Taylor-Johnson   watched a video of a Japanese girl committing suicide. An early example  of this theme transpired in the “Mikado” episode Millennium, when a  serial killer broadcast live footage of him torturing and murdering vic- tims in a “death room”. Similar violence-themed voyeurism was at the  heart of the horror film FearDotCom  2002 , which centered on a website  that asked the classic voyeur question, “Do you like to watch?” It then  leads the viewers within the narrative—but also the audience of the film  itself—to live images of torture. The villain mastermind behind the site,  Alistair  Stephen Rea , actually drew a link between the live violent mate- rial and all the many human experiences catered to—and documented  by—the Internet: “The Internet offers birth, sex, commerce, seduction,  proselytizing, politics, posturing, death is a logical component, an inti- mate experience made more so by knowing the victim.” In Untraceable,  a website broadcasts live torture. Discussing his site, the operator Owen   Joseph Cross , explained to one of his victims: “You know if nobody  was watching right now you’d just be sitting in water. The whole world  wants to watch you die and they don’t even know it.” Similar broadcast  torture-murders were at the heart of the thrillers The Card Player  2004 ,  Dot.Kill  2005  and the Japanese horror film Satsujin Douga Sit  Death  Tube: Broadcast Murder Show   2010 . In the “Killer Chat” episode of  the crime-drama Numb3rs  2005–2010 , something similar occurred: A  man  sought  revenge  on  pedophiles  by  posting  torture  videos  of  their  murders onto a suicide website.      T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    251  A different kind of broadcast crime transpires in narratives about sex  crimes. The “Friending Emily” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims  Unit for example, centered on a website—Lolitaville—that hosted a live  feed of a girl’s kidnapping and incarceration. In the “Breath of Life” epi- sode of the police-drama The District  2000–2004 , a website was dis- covered  providing  live-streaming  of  sexual  assaults  committed  against  intoxicated  girls;  as  Detective  Debreno   Jonathan  LaPaglia   scathingly  surmised, “Molestation as entertainment.” In the drama Afterschool, Rob- ert divulged his enjoyment in watching strangulation-type videos to his  counselor, Mr. Virgil  Gary Wilmes , admitting that the appeal lay in how  genuinely scared the girls are. In cultural critic Robert Shearman’s discus- sion of the “Mikado” episode of Millennium he spotlighted some of the  themes relevant for interpreting these violence-voyeurism scenes:  The sick voyeurism with which people turn to a website to see a woman  murdered is matched only by the prurient curiosity we the viewers feel as  we too watch the screens refresh to display another horrifying image. You  don’t want to look, but it’s hard to resist—and that’s the clever appeal of  an episode like The Mikado, which turns us all into spectators, and turns  death into performance art.64  Just as webcam sites are invariably marketed as a kind of private reality  made public, Shearman alludes to the capacity to find a similar enjoyment  in watching real—rather than fake or simulated—violence: Narratives like  those  discussed  in  this  section  make  meta  statements  about  violence- voyeurism transpiring in society at large.  While the motives for looking at gore porn are not exclusively sexual— for example, theorists identify appeal also lying in feeling shocked and  disgusted65—sex and arousal nevertheless are repeatedly noted as part of  the explanation for the kind of voyeurism transpiring in gore porn con- sumption: There is something titillating about watching gruesome acts  via webcam in the same way that horror or thrillers are consumed at the  cinema.66  Again,  while  many  definitions  of  voyeurism  center  only  on  secretly observed sex acts, in line with the broad definition used here is  the scopophilic pleasure of watching violence.67  One of the central appeals of webcams—and certainly something iden- tifiable in the webcam scenes from Look @ Me, NCIS, Killer Net, Little  Children,  Shame,  On_Line,  Ci  qing,  and  Selling  Innocence—is  the  idea  of customization and interactivity: While consumption of porn is often  thought of as a manifestation of scopophilia, in these scenes consumers    252   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  actually  interact  with  the  webcam  girls  making,  in  some  cases,  special  requests: Such behavior can still be considered scopophilic although the  ability to control and orchestrate a scene distinguishes webcam viewing  from simple netporn consumption. While in Killer Net, Little Children,  Shame, Ci qing, and Selling Innocence characters seemingly paid for their  interactions—thus framing the exchange akin to porn consumption or  prostitution—the idea of the Internet facilitating characters to interact  sexually and to offer a potentially reciprocal sexual outlet, transpires in  several noncommercial examples explored later in this chapter.  A perversion frequently coupled with voyeurism in deviance discussions   is exhibitionism, something with an inextricable screen link to webcams.  Internet-Aided Exhibitionism  While psychological discussions of exhibitionism define it as exposing  one’s genitals to an unsuspecting audience, in popular parlance, the term  describes behavior that simply puts the self on display;68 in recent years  the term has been used liberally to describe revealing social media posts  with no connection to sex or genitals whatsoever.69  In line with most perversions, exhibitionism is construed as predominantly  participated in by men.70 However, just as voyeurism changes somewhat in  the context of an Internet discussion, similarly, exhibitionism also takes on  a more flexible application in the context of cyberspace. While the major- ity of voyeurs are male both off screen and on, this isn’t actually the case  for exhibitionists in screen narratives where most exhibitionism is conducted  by women. This is partly explained by the nondiagnostic use of the term  deployed in this discussion—and thus, those classified as exhibitionists here  wouldn’t be counted as patients, nor appear in published cases studies—but  also partly because, as apparent in discussions on voyeurism in the context of  art71 and cinema,72 not only are audiences used to looking at and consum- ing the bodies of women, women are also expected to display their bodies in  ways that men are not. Exhibitionism via the use of webcams, therefore, is  made easy and inexpensive and also provides the opportunity to effortlessly  gain an audience and potentially even commercialize the act. Not all such  webcam displays, of course, are sexual. In the Australian romantic-comedy  Goddess  2013 , Elspeth  Laura Michelle Kelly  is a bored housewife woman  who dreams of being a singer and sets up a webcam site to showcase her  music. Elspeth’s use of a webcam is akin to performers who post videos of  themselves online playing music—for example, Katie  Aisling Franciosi  in  the crime-drama The Fall or Marnie  Allison Williams  in the comedy-drama       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    253  Girls  2012– —in the hope of attracting an audience. While esteem might  come from any fame reaped, for the purposes of this discussion I focus specifi- cally on erotic exhibitionism where the overt intention is sexual gratification. Mentioned already in this chapter is Sex Tape. While Annie and Jay cer- tainly didn’t set out to be exhibitionists, nevertheless, the idea of amateur  pornographers taking advantage of the Internet to be exhibitionists was  certainly discussed in the narrative. In one scene, the unnamed proprietor  of YouPorn  Jack Black , explained to Annie and Jay why he would hap- pily remove their video off his site:  Do you have any idea how many people are makin’ sex tapes out there?  We get about a thousand new ones every day. I don’t need to be puttin’ up  sex tapes from people who don’t want their sex tapes up there.  While the proprietor is, of course, being hyperbolic, nonetheless, the idea of  the Internet facilitating those with an exhibitionist yen to experience their perver- sion—or profit from it—is apparent in several examples. While the female per- formers on the webcam sites in Killer Net, Little Children, On_Line, and Shame  could be construed as  at least partly  interested in exhibitionism, in fact, in each  example the narrative focus was on the male voyeur rather than the exhibition- ist. Even in Ci qing and Selling Innocence—which both centered on the lives of  the webcam performers—motives beyond money were not explored. This same  situation transpires for the housewife webcam performers in the “Voyeur’s Web”  episode of NCIS: The only motive articulated for participation was financial.  Finance was similarly alluded to as a vague driver in the “Twanging Your Magic  Clanger” episode of Two and a Half Men, in a scene where Michelle  Liz Vassey ,  a woman Charlie was dating, was arguing with her daughter, Shauna  Krista  Kalmus , about her webcam “business”:  Michelle:  Shauna, how do you expect to pay me back? Shauna:  Michelle:  A webcam in your bathroom and a PayPal account is not a job!  I still have a job.  In each example the performers are presented as exhibitionists for profit  rather  than  perversion.  Of  course,  in  some  examples  perversion  is  an  explicit motive; something the Jack Black character in Sex Tape alluded to:  Internet porn gets a bad rap in some circles, but it’s not deserved. I’m  always  tellin’  people  this.  YouPorn  is  a  community.  A  safe,  supportive  place where people can go to display videos of themselves ass-fucking each  other.   254   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  While in these examples, the exhibitionism is presented as closely aligned  to sexual perversion, in other examples it is driven by different motivations.  Another rationale centers on the appeal of fame. In Goddess, for example,  Elspeth’s exhibitionism was centered on fame rather than sex: She wanted  an audience so she could feel talented rather than desirable. Other exam- ples fuse sex and fame objectives. Discussed earlier was the popularity of  celebrity sex tapes. In real life the Internet release of a sex tape delivered the  world Kim Kardashian;73 and attempts to achieve similar fame through  the  release  of  explicit  material  is  alluded  to  in  several  screen  narratives.  In the pilot episode of Selfie  2014 , Eliza  Karen Gillan  is obsessed with  increasing her social media followers and thus produces ever more sala- cious content. In the drama King Kelly  2012 , Kelly  Louisa Krause  is the  star of a pornographic webcam show: Her motives for participation center  explicitly on becoming an Internet celebrity. The same thing transpires in  Men, Women & Children: Donna  Judy Greer  established a website with  sexy photos of her daughter, Hannah  Olivia Crocicchia , in order to make  her daughter famous.74 Similar themes are evident in “The Blackout, Part  2: Mock Debate” episode of the drama The Newsroom  2012–2014 : A  woman, Sandy  Alison Becker , leaked sexual Tweets she had received from  a congressman in order to establish her own celebrity profile.  In a discussion of teen sexting, Lori Andrews, a lawyer and the director  of the Institute for Science, Law and Technology in Chicago, examined  the idea of fame as a motive for the production of Web content: “It’s a  perfect storm of technology and hormones . . . Teen sexting is all a way of  magnifying girls’ fantasies of being a star of their own movies.”75 A similar  point was made by the actor Alan Cumming in his memoir book Not My  Father’s Son:  It’s really hard to talk about being famous. We live in a society that is  obsessed with it, that ranks it as the best thing you could possibly achieve  in your life. I believe social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter are an  absolute product of this obsession, as they partly manufacture how it feels  to be famous for people who are not. You put personal information and  images out into the world and the more friends or followers you obtain,  the less knowledge you have of who is watching or keeping track. It’s great  to feel popular of course, but there is a downside.76  This analysis can be extended to participation in other exhibitionism  where fame—something highly prized in the Zeitgeist—gets experienced  in varying degrees.      T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    255  Discussed  earlier  was  White’s  contention  that  the  gaze  in  webcam  porn  is  not  necessarily  about  the  male  consumer  as  all-empowered.  A  different analysis of the female exhibitionism scenes is one whereby the  performer—be it consciously or subconsciously—is an active participant  in  her  own  objectification;  where  cultural  messages  about  the  role  of  women in society have been internalized and therefore the exhibitionist  sees herself as both a performer and a product:  Girls are encouraged to think of themselves as decorative objects for oth- ers’ enjoyment and are rewarded for their self-objectification.77 Rooted in socio-cultural approaches to the psychology of women, self- objectification is the tendency to introject an external observer’s perspec- tive on one’s body, evaluating it in terms of its value and attractiveness to  others rather than its value and function  i.e., what it can do .78  While self-objectification is often discussed in the context of the media  and body image,79 the idea that a woman can choose to actively objectify  herself  through  exhibitionism  in  order  to,  potentially,  establish  a  pub- lic profile or sate her sexual interests, is certainly a theme in numerous  narratives. For the female webcam performers in NCIS, Killer Net, Little  Children,  Shame,  Ci  qing,  Selling  Innocence,  and  Two  and  a  Half  Men,  while we don’t have a deluge of information about these characters, it can  be assumed that the capacity to make money from commercializing their  body is a driving motive.  Outside  of  webcam  performances,  the  Internet  offers  other  options  for  self-objectification.  In  About  Cherry,  teenager  Angelina’s   Ashley Hinshaw  involvement in erotic photo shoots—and then porn  video  production—was  motivated  by  money.  Another  kind  of  self- objectification transpires in narratives where women are engaged in sex  work.  In  Men, Women  &  Children,  the  idea  takes  the  form  of  escort  services, something that also plays out in The Craigslist Killer  2011 .  Another variation is virginity auctions. The Taiwanese drama Girl$, cen- ters on girls who use the Internet—notably chat rooms—to set up “paid  dates.” One aspect of the film involved the online sale of one girl’s vir- ginity. The virginity-auction plot leads to a murder in the “Pure” episode  of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and was also a theme in the “Väter”   “Fathers”  episode of the German soap opera Verbotene Liebe  Forbid- den Love   1995– .  While there aren’t many narratives that show couples using webcams  to  broadcast  their  ass-fucking—although,  in  On_Line  Moe   Harold    256   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Perrineau  does coerce his reluctant girlfriend Moira  Isabel Gillies  to do  so—in most screen examples webcam performers tend to be solo females  performing for a male audience. Be it in reality or simply the illusion for  profit, motives beyond money are also apparent in these narratives. In  Look @ Me, the exhibitionism motive is presented explicitly: While Tina  does perform on webcam for money, she actually has a well-paid office job  elsewhere and is presented as having overt exhibitionist tendencies—on  camera  she  tells  her  audience,  for  example,  “I  feel  desirable  when  you  look at me,” and off screen she is presented as enjoying sex with the win- dows open as well as the feel of her office colleagues’ eyes on her. Tina is,  of  course,  punished  for  her  unorthodox  exhibitionism  and  her  violent  kidnapping works to “prove” the dangers of her perversion. By the end of  the film, Tina elects to give up her webcam site, subtly implying that she  learned her lesson the hard way. Similar themes are apparent in a subplot  of Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life: Teenager Monica  Nicole Dicker  was  presented as being so into porn that she performed on webcam herself;  doing so, however, saw her slut-shamed within the narrative in line with  the cyberbullying portrayals discussed in Chapter 3.80 In the Canadian  comedy Control Alt Delete, by the end of the narrative it is discovered  that Jane  Sonja Bennett  is the star of a webcam site focused on her use  of the bathroom: While not much is known about the character, she is  certainly framed as hiding a secret deviance; her sexual interest in Lewis   Tyler Labine —a man who literally had sex with computers—bolstered  her status as a pervert. In a scene from the “Gun Control” episode of the  cartoon High School USA!  2013– , a conversation between two teen girls  hints to another Internet-aided exhibitionism outlet:  Cassandra:  How about we make out? Amber:    What’s the point of making out if we can’t record it with our  phones and send it to guys to make them frustrated?  While the girls don’t actually kiss, they do highlight a thrill coming  from the performance, and broadcast, of sexuality. The idea of sexuality— specifically lesbianism—performed for an audience has been explored by  several theorists. Feminist theorist Megan Seely, for example, discussed  the cultural prominence of “faux lesbianism”:  Sexual pairing of women is common in male-centered porn and advertis- ing. Of course, these women are not there for the enjoyment of other  women—but for men, they are the ultimate male fantasy.81      T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    257  The ultimate fantasy idea played out on webcam in the aforementioned  NCIS episode, and was also alluded to in education theorist Susanne Gan- non’s discussion of the Australian sitcom Summer Heights High  2007– 2008  where lesbianism was appropriated for social objectives. Gannon  discussed a scene from the series where the narcissist teen protagonist,  Ja’mie  Chris Lilley , tried to convince her school friends that going to the  formal with a girl would be useful for her social status:  Ja’mie wins them over with arguments about image and the at-any cost  celebrity moment. Lesbianism here, or rather faux-lesbianism, like many  other behaviours in the volatile repertoire of cool, is an optional acces- sory for Ja’mie and her school friends . . . [L]esbian desire has been tamed  within the circuits of teenage female popularity.82  The teen series Faking It  2014–  in fact is explicitly premised on two high  school students who fake lesbianism for popularity.  While  thus  far  I  have  discussed  exhibitionism  scenes  whereby  the  focus is on women, it is important to spotlight those few examples where  men are the online exhibitionists. Interestingly, unlike the females, men  generally do not run webcam sites for profit or to sate their own exhi- bitionist  desires  either.  Underage  boys,  for  example,  were  exploited  via  webcams in the “Web” episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, the  “P911” episode of Criminal Minds  2005– , and in the drama Disconnect.  More commonly, however, male exhibitionism occurs as part of perverse  courting. In the “Joey and the Holding Hands” episode of the sitcom  Joey  2004–2006 , Michael  Paulo Costanzo  finds himself coerced, for  example, to dance on webcam for a transsexual he had met online. In  “The Rebuttal” episode of the sitcom Alpha House  2013– , political aide  James  Ben Rameaka  took a photo of his penis to send to his girlfriend  Lola  Willa Fitzgerald ; he accidentally Tweeted the image using his boss’s  Twitter account. While a comic example, the Alpha House scene refer- ences real-life sex scandals involving politicians; something also apparent  in  other  more  serious  screen  examples.  In  the  “October  Surprise”  epi- sode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Alex Muñoz  Vincent Laresca   was a political candidate who used social media to send erotic photos to  women. The same thing occurred in the “Say Hello to My Little Friend”  episode of the drama series Scandal  2012–  centered on Senator Richard  Meyers  Patrick Fabian  who was caught e-mailing photos of himself in  his underwear to a woman who was murdered. In the “Coon 2: Hind- sight” episode of South Park a real life scandal was again referenced when    258   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  the  character  Captain  Hindsight  remarked,  “Brett  Favre  should  never  have sent actual pictures of his schlong.” The real-life Anthony Weiner  sexting scandal was also referenced in the “The Blackout, Part 1: Tragedy  Porn” episode of The Newsroom. While on one hand these examples can  be construed as illustrations of the diagnostic definitions of perversion  where men are more likely to participate, other explanations are at play.  As noted earlier, screen fiction—particularly television—likes to employ  “ripped from the headlines” storylines. Given that real-life male politi- cians and sportspeople have been embroiled in sexting scandals, it is no  surprise that such themes have been fictionalized: While in South Park  and The Newsroom the real-life link is verbalized, several writers have spot- lighted the parallels between the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and  Scandal episodes and the Weiner scandal.83  A  different  type  of  exhibitionism  involving  men  transpired  in  the  aforementioned “Manhunt” episode of Stalker. Paul’s  Preston Jones  girl- friend, Cara  Cherilyn Wilson , broke up with him because she wanted  to explore lesbianism. In the aftermath, it is suspected that Paul uploaded  a video of him and Cara having sex to prove to his friends that he hadn’t  “turned” her: “Now they can see that I was laying it down right.” While  this example can be construed as revenge porn  Chapter 4 , part of Paul’s  incentive, of course, was to exhibit his sexual prowess. Similarly, in Black  Christmas,  given  that  the  sex  scene  was  recorded  and  uploaded  by  the  male participant, Kyle  Oliver Hudson , seemingly part of his motive was  also to seize an opportunity to exhibit his sexuality.  An extension of the idea of the perversion of exhibitionism is the Inter-  net used for erotic confession.  Confession and Perversion  In the “The Importance of Not Being Too Earnest” episode of the drama  series Dawson’s Creek  1998–2003 , teenager Audrey  Busy Philipps  pro- nounced, “E-mail expression is the scourge of the modern age. The Inter- net has made it way too easy to express oneself.” A similar comment was  made in the pilot episode of Selfie when Henry  John Cho  remarked—in  reference to his cybercelebrity colleague Eliza—“Why does her generation  feel compelled to Tweet every item that goes into their mouths?” While  these comments were insights into the  over communication capacities  of the social media, they also provide a useful introduction to the idea of  the Internet creating a space for confession. While confessions can simply  describe any divulged secret, and while the motives for such confessions       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    259  are numerous,84 in this section I focus on sexual confessions and propose  one possible motive being the sexual pleasures derived from exhibiting  secrets publically.  In his book Striptease Culture, media theorist Brian McNair contended   that confessionary behavior has a key role in the pornified landscape:  Striptease culture frequently involves ordinary people talking about sex  and their own sexualities, revealing intimate details of their feelings and  their bodies in the public sphere. It is all those forms and contexts in which  people outside the starry world of celebrity claim or are given space in the  media to engage in sex talk . . . And although striptease culture involves  forms of exposure and self-exposure which refer to the sexual, and which  may at times be sexually explicit, neither can it accurately be described as  pornographic. The words and images one encounters in striptease culture  are not necessarily erotic, although they may well be about eroticism.85  I discuss similar ideas in Part-Time Perverts contending that one of the  subtle ways perversion is participated in—and certainly one of the ways  relevant to a discussion of the Internet—is via the kinds of confession and  sex talk that McNair alludes to: “Confessing to a sexual perversion can  be a Clayton’s strategy used to obtain sexual pleasure from a perversion  without physically participating.”86 In Part-Time Perverts I contended that  such sex confessions—be they written or verbal—are designed to arouse  both the self and others:  In 1975 literature professor and theologian Walter J. Ong wrote, “It is  characteristic of our present age that virtually all serious writing tends to  be confessional.” In a 2009 episode of the Australian game show Talkin’  ‘Bout Your Generation [2009–2012], comedian host Sean Micallef intro- duced the Generation Y team as, “The generation who list their turn-ons  anywhere they can.” In 1975, Ong could not have predicted blogs and  Facebook and Myspace and Twitter, but his comments are as applicable  now  as  they  were  over  three  decades  ago:  social  networking  Web  sites  simply offer another means for us to write—and easily broadcast—the  turn-ons that we have confessed for eons.87 Regardless  of  whether  it  is  in  a  therapist’s  office,  in  the  bedroom,  or  online, being part of a sexually confessionary dynamic where fantasies are  divulged and sexual practices confessed to can often appear indistinguish- able from “dirty talk” and thus provoke similar reactions.88  Portrayals of Internet-aided confessions transpire in numerous screen  narratives,  the  obvious  being  when  characters  make  entries  in  public    260   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  diaries. In On_Line, John  Josh Hamilton  kept an online video journal  in the aftermath of his relationship breakup. In the romantic-comedy The  Perfect Man  2005 , the teenager, Sam  Hilary Duff , blogged about her  nomad lifestyle. In the biopic Julie & Julia  2009 , Julie  Amy Adams ,  cooked  and  blogged  her  way  through  Julia  Child’s  famous  cookbook;  food blogging was also mentioned in the “Meme Is Murder” episode of  the crime-drama series Castle  2009– . In this same episode, one of the  detectives was revealed to be operating a crime blog. In the comedy Moth- erhood   2009 ,  Eliza   Uma  Thurman   blogged  about  parenting.  In  the  comedy Easy A  2010 , Olive  Emma Stone  kept a video blog about life  as a high schooler. Each of these examples center, in varying degrees, on  public confessions. While any kind of self-disclosure could be construed  as  possibly  stimulating—research,  for  example,  has  found  that  confes- sion produces physical signs of arousal89—the screen offers some specific  examples where erotic confessions are key.  In the beginning of Sex Tape, Annie keeps a blog that discussed the  early years of her sexual relationship with husband Jay; reminiscing about  their once-vibrant sex life seemingly served as a way for her to sexually  reminisce  and  re-experience  pleasure  from  a  bygone  sexual  time.90  In  the  “David  &  Ellie”  episode  of  the  British  drama  series  Dates   2013 ,  Ellie  Montanna Thompson  divulged her own online sexual confessions,  admitting to her date David  Will Mellor , “I’m doing a collection of,  like, William Blake–style lithographs depicting my entire sexual history to  put on Tumblr . . . It’s just an ironic gesture of how romance is outdated.” While online confessions and revelations provide another way for the  Internet to aid characters in participating in their perversions in a dirty  talk  kind  of  way,  online  confessions  also,  in  fact,  can  be  construed  as  an extension of other perversions already discussed in this chapter, for  example, exhibiting one’s own  real or imagined  sex life and facilitating  others partaking of it in a voyeuristic fashion.  Just as webcams play an integral part in the experience of voyeurism,  exhibitionism, and even confession on screen, it also facilitates another  kind of perverse behavior—cybersex—an online sexual activity that has  forced a rethink of our definitions of sexual intimacy.  Cybersex  Control Alt Delete provided a quite literal example of Internet sex when  Lewis  repeatedly  had  sex  with  networked  computers  by  drilling  holes  into them and thrusting his penis inside. Other, more typical examples       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    261  of Internet-aided sex are, of course, easily detected. While the philoso- pher Louise Collins notes that the term cybersex “is sometimes construed  broadly, to refer to a growing array of erotically charged activities medi- ated by new information technology” including netporn or erotic mes- sages posted to a social media site,91 in most published work such activity  has a relatively narrow definition, such as the one offered by the philoso- pher Aaron Ben-Ze’ev:  [A]  social  interaction  between  at  least  two  people  who  are  exchanging  real-time digital [video, auto, but typically, text-based] messages in order  to become sexually aroused. People send provocative and erotic messages  to each other, with the purpose of bringing each other to orgasm as they  masturbate in real time.92  Cybersex, as defined by Ben-Ze’ev, is relatively easily detected in film  and television. In the “Sexual Perversity on Cleveland” episode of the sit- com The Drew Carey Show  1995–2004 , the title character  Drew Carey   has text-based cybersex with a woman who turns out to be his colleague  and nemesis Mimi  Kathy Kinney . In the “Fashion of the Christ” epi- sode  of  Weeds  Andy   Justin  Kirk —pretending  to  be  his  nephew  Silas   Hunter Parrish —used Instant Messenger to engage in a sex chat with  Silas’s girlfriend. In the British biopic UWantMe2KillHim?  2013 , Mark   Jamie Blackley  and Rachael  Jaime Winstone  have cybersex with the  use of a webcam. In the “Take Me with You” episode of the sitcom The  Mindy Project  2012– , the title character  Mindy Kaling  and her boy- friend, Casey  Anders Holm , practiced webcam cybersex in preparation  for an upcoming geographic separation. In the “The Infestation Hypoth- esis” episode of The Big Bang Theory, Leonard  Johnny Galecki  and Priya   Aarti Mann  attempted cybersex while residing in different countries. In  the biopic Talhotblond  2012 , Thomas  Garret Dillahunt  masturbated  while having cybersex with “Katie.” The fact that cybersex exists in these  mainstream examples alludes to a kind of normalization of new technol- ogy for sexual purposes, particularly so if the couple is already established  offline  as distinct from random anonymous online hook-ups . While in  examples such as The Mindy Project and The Big Bang Theory cybersex is  simply used akin to how characters might have engaged in erotic telephone  conversations in previous generations,93 the sci-fi drama Her  2013  took  this a step further. The film imagines a world where we are each connected  to an intuitive operating system that is constantly gaining information  about us to meet our needs. In one scene a variant on the way cybersex has    262   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  been discussed thus far involved Theodore’s  Joaquin Phoenix  operating  system, Samantha  Scarlett Johansson , talking to him while he mastur- bated through to orgasm. Given the deluge of empty, guilt-worthy ways  masturbation is often portrayed on screen,94 this scene presents the act as  much closer to a shared sexual experience than lonely solo sex. Cybersex as Experimental  In the aforementioned “Gun Control” episode of High School USA!,  two teenagers alluded to using the Internet as part of their sexual experi- mentation;  that  their  flirtations  with  lesbianism  would  only  happen  because  of  the  broadcast—and  thus  audience—potential  of  the  tech- nology. In fact, teens using technology for such purposes plays out in  numerous  examples.  In  the  “Hairography”  episode  of  the  high  school  comedy-drama series Glee  2009–2015 , it is revealed that Puck  Mark  Salling   and  Santana   Naya  Rivera   had  sexted.  Teens  were  similarly  involved in this activity in the “Crush” episode of Law & Order: Special  Victims Unit, the aforementioned “Shoot to Thrill” episode of Degrassi:  The Next Generation, and the “Tin Man Is Down” episode of the political- drama series Homeland  2011– .  While teen sexting has received both academic analysis95 and popu- lar criticism,96 and in line with the Law and Order franchise objective  of delivering stories “ripped from the headlines,” sexting depictions can  be construed as in sync with the social issue moral panic storylines dis- cussed earlier. Another interpretation, however, is viewing such behavior  as a modern kind of sexual experimentation. In a scene from the comedy  Ten Inch Hero  2007 , Priestly  Jensen Ackles  comments, “the only safe  sex is watching porn.” While his remark isn’t dissected in the script, it  can be assumed to reference the fact that, in comparison to intercourse,  porn is free from a lot of consequences such as disease, pregnancy, and  relationship dramas. For young teens, therefore, who are at the stage of  experimenting  with  their  sexuality—something  particularly  relevant  to  pregay teens as discussed later in this chapter—it is worth considering the  Internet as providing an outlet for sexual trial and error. In her critique  of moral panics specifically around sexting, media theorist Amy Hasinoff  notes: “Concerns that girls who sext are seeking ‘the wrong kind of atten- tion’ both erase girls sexual desires and underscore their need to raise their  self-esteem through safe, appropriate nonsexual means.”97 Sexting scenes  offer the opportunity for teens within narratives to comparatively safely  experiment with sexuality, taking advantage of new technology, in line  with thinking of masturbation as an alternate erotic experience.      T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    263  Cybersex as Substitute  Separating  masturbation  from  a  discussion  of  cybersex  is  impossible:  While there is, of course, greater interactivity transpiring between cybersex  participants than occurs during the more passive consumption of netporn,  as noted in the context of the Her example, the physical sexual behavior  that happens in such situations is self-touch; as Goldman contends cybersex  is “an imaginative substitute for the real thing”98 as opposed to an incarna- tion of intercourse itself. The masturbation component, therefore, raises  issues of cybersex being perverted on the grounds of autoeroticism being  perverted but also, more specifically, when it becomes a preferred sexually  activity  for example, as Bud in Married with Children came to view it .  The screen, in fact, positions the idea of cybersex in a variety of different  ways. While for coupled characters like those in The Mindy Project and The  Big Bang Theory, cybersex, in fact, was merely a substitute for the inter- course that they would prefer but which geography thwarted, for Drew  in The Drew Carey Show and Andy in Weeds they too seemingly would  likely have preferred intercourse but settled for cybersex because it was all  that was available. A female example of this transpired in an episode of  Ally McBeal  1997–2002 . The title character  Calista Flockhart  spent the  duration of the series looking for love; in the “Turning Thirty” episode she  has “computer sex” for the first time with a man she had been correspond- ing with online. Online dating appears to be a method Ally deploys only  after exhausting many others. In the thriller Net Games  2003 , cybersex  is explicitly discussed as a substitute for sex in a conversation between two  friends: Adam  C. Thomas Howell  and Ray  Sam Ball . Adam updates  Ray about the mental health progress of his partner, Jennifer  Monique  Demers   who had been raped , which led the two to discuss sex:  So let me ask you this. Are you guys, um—  Ray:  Adam:  What? Ray:  You know— Adam:  Sex? Not yet. Ray:  Adam:  Yes. Ray:   Adam:  Cyber chat?  Good God! Are you serious?   You’re going to like this [hands Ray a business card]. This is for you  until you and Jen get back to normal.  Later, after Adam uses the site for the first time, he tells Ray, “This  morning was the closest thing I’ve had to sex in about eight months.”    264   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Adam and Jen weren’t having intercourse so cybersex served as a substi- tute. Noted earlier, behavior like masturbation was considered notably  perverse when it substitutes for “normal” sexual activity like intercourse.  In  academic  discussions  cybersex  is  similarly  considered  problematic  when, for example, it comes to replace marital sexual activity, something  discussed later in this chapter in the context of infidelity.  Discussed earlier was a key benefit of netporn as Jon in Don Jon viewed  it, notably that he didn’t have to bother with reciprocating sexual favors  or foregoing pleasures that women were reluctant to indulge him in such  as fellatio. In the Married with Children episode, Bud similarly noted that  he liked how he could have sex on demand. Certainly on screen the idea  that cybersex allows characters to participate in not merely a substitute for  intercourse but, more specifically, a substitute for a certain kind of inter- course is identifiable in numerous examples where characters go online  to  participate  in  the  kinds  of  sex  that  is  too  difficult  to  orchestrate  in  real life. In the sci-fi film The Lawnmower Man  1992 , for example, a  cybersex scene takes place via virtual reality  a topic discussed further in  the  next  section ;  a  scenario  exploited  by  Jobe   Jeff  Fahey   who  seizes  the opportunity to play out a rape scene with Marnie  Jenny Wright .  In the “Hammerhead Sharks” episode of The Practice, a murder suspect,  Dennis  Ted Marcoux , had used e-mail to write anonymous erotic let- ters  to  the  victim,  some  of  which  expressed  sadomasochistic  and  also  necrophilic themes. In the “Rubber Man” episode of the series American  Horror Story  2011– , Patrick  Teddy Sears  satisfied his sadomasochistic  tendencies by engaging in rough-play sex in a chat room. In the “La Dou- leur Exquise!” episode of Sex and the City  1998–2004 , Stanford  Willie  Garson  catered to his underwear fetish online; something Carrie  Sarah  Jessica Parker  documented:  Meanwhile, at a fetish across town, Stanford Blanche had a secret sex life.  A very active secret sex life on the Internet as “Rick9Plus.” It all started  innocently enough as a goof on a lonely Friday night. But pretty soon he  was logging in hours and hours on his favorite website. It was a comfort  to know that others shared his underwear fetish. Sometimes as many as  2,000 hits a day. No sooner had Rick9Plus entered the chatroom that he  got a message from his favorite on-screen pal, “Bigtool4U.” Some fetishes  can only flourish behind closed doors in the very late night hours on a  laptop.  In a scene from Chatroom, a middle-aged Tony Layton  Gerald Home   visited the “Chelsea Teens” chat room posing as a teenage girl; for Tony,       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    265  the Internet provided an opportunity to play out his pedophilic fanta- sies. In the drama The Dying Gaul  2005 , Jeffrey  Campbell Scott , who  was married to Elaine  Patricia Clarkson , had an affair with the male  screenwriter Robert  Peter Sarsgaard . For Jeffrey, erotic e-mail correspon- dence was part of the fuel—and then became a supplement—to his and  Robert’s physical consummation: It was a way for him to experience his  homosexual desires while still remaining in his heterosexual marriage. A  similar example transpired in the “Lifeline” episode of the lesbian-themed  drama series The L Word  2004–2009 : Tina  Laurel Holloman  who was  in a relationship with Bette  Jennifer Beals —used chat rooms to play  out her attraction to men; it was a way for her to play with heterosexual  desires while remaining in her lesbian dyad.99 Cybersex in these examples,  gave characters the opportunity to participate in the kinds of sex that is  unavailable to them—for a variety of reasons—offline. Physically acting  on  rape,  sadomasochistic,  pedophilic,  and  homosexual  fantasies  might  prove legally or emotionally problematic, so the Internet is used as an  outlet to play out fantasies—much like netporn serves in other scenes—in  a comparatively safe r  space.  While thus far I have discussed cybersex in the context of Ben-Ze’ev’s  text audio video exchange definition, in fact, the screen offers a variety  of other examples whereby—as alluded to in The Lawnmower Man and  Married with Children examples—the act is substantially broader than the  masturbating-in-front-of-a-computer-screen depictions offered in Ameri- can Horror Story, The Mindy Project, The Big Bang Theory, The Drew Carey  Show, Weeds, Net Games, or Talhotblond.  Virtual Sex  Virtual reality has long been a narrative in popular films such as Logan’s  Run   1976 ,  Welcome  to  Blood  City   1977 ,  Brainstorm   1983 ,  TRON   1982 , and The Lawnmower Man where narratives envisaged a virtual  environment in a world predating the Web. Some of these films—notably  Logan’s Run and The Lawnmower Man, along with other early Web-era  films like Demolition Man  1993  and Virtuosity  1995 —actually tried  to imagine the role sex might have in such spaces. Demolition Man, for  example—taking  inspiration  from  earlier  future-sex  representations  in  films like Barbarella  1968  and Sleeper  1973 —presented a world where  machines had a dominant role in sexual pleasure and envisioned sex as  a practice less about the body and more about the brain. In one scene  in  Demolition  Man,  for  example,  John   Sylvester  Stallone   and  Lenina    Sandra Bullock  “have sex” by each wearing helmets that send stimulation    266   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  directly to each character’s brain; the genitals play no obvious part at all.  Given the film’s 1993 production—and the impact of AIDS on the Zeit- geist—perhaps  removing  fluids  from  sex  was  considered  aspirational.  Direct brain stimulation as a substitute for intercourse also transpires in  the sci-fi miniseries Wild Palms  1993 : Harry  James Belushi  is given a  drink of “Mimezine”  a so-called empathogen  that serves to enhance a  virtual reality experience by directly sexually stimulating his brain; as tech  entrepreneur Gavin  Charles Hallahan  explains, “it’s flooding your cere- bral cortex . . . The Mimezine will give the illusion of touch.” Mentioned  earlier was Brainstorm: As in Demolition Man, helmets connected a user  directly  to  a  sensory  experience  via  direct  brain  stimulation.  Brain-sex  also occurs in the sci-fi film Strange Days  1995  whereby a hairnet-type  apparatus inserts sexual pleasure directly into the brain. A variant on this  theme transpired in the sci-fi film Surrogates  2009 : The titular surrogates  experience sexual pleasure via a cylindrical probe-type object that delivers  pleasurable shocks direct into their nervous system.  Helmets are eschewed in place of virtual reality glasses in the sci-fi tele- vision series VR.5  1995 , when Sidney  Lori Singer  goes into a virtual  reality world and plays out a sexual fantasy. The same method transpires  in the James Bond film Die Another Day  2002  when, again via the use  of special glasses, Miss Moneypenny  Samantha Bond  lives out a sexual  fantasy with James Bond  Pierce Brosnan . In Virtuosity, Clyde’s  Kevin J.  O’Connor  experience with cybersex involves no props at all, in fact, just  him standing in front of large screen and magically experiencing pleasure.  On one hand, such scenes share much in common with netporn: The act  of viewing erotic images provides the sexual stimulation. The fact that we  don’t see characters masturbating—or, in fact, experiencing any kind of  genital stimulation at all—indicates these examples can be considered as  akin to a future where sex is experienced more so as a cerebral—if not also  a  primarily  voyeuristic—pleasure.  Unsurprisingly,  the  idea  of  future-sex  has featured prominently in academic discussions of the Internet, notably  in media scholar Hannu Eerikäinen’s work:  Cybersex as an idea emphasizes, first, a cerebral understanding of sex; that  is, it puts into the foreground sex as something rational, something that  could and should be under control, that should function in accordance  with  a  technological  system;  ultimately  according  to  machine  logic,  to  male logic. And second, it emphasizes the genital aspect of sex, but curi- ously enough, such that the genitals are strictly under control of the brain,  and especially under control of the technological extension of the brain;  that is, controlled by the computer.100      T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    267  Another  interpretation  of  a  future  of  sex  with  less  emphasis  on  the  body links to the idea of the Internet as a kind of leveler. In the “Who Is  Max Mouse—Part 1” episode of the children’s series Ghostwriter  1992– 1995 , student Erica  Julia Stiles , lauded the benefits of the Internet: “It’s  a world where you are judged by what you say and think, not by what you  look like. A world where curiosity and imagination equals power.” With  such ideas in mind, an interpretation for brain-stimulation presentations  of sex is underpinned by factors like personality and sense of humor com- ing to dominate as turn-ons rather than aesthetics. Certainly in numerous  examples, characters that are otherwise judged by their appearance do use  the Internet to socialize in ways experienced as more difficult offline. This  idea, in fact, is explicitly discussed in Selling Innocence. In one scene a  party is held for the biggest clients of a webcam site to meet the camgirls.  At the party, the teen model Mia is approached by one of the site’s over- weight subscribers  Donovan Workun :  Oh, you must think we’re a bunch of disgusting, repulsive toads . . . You  know, I’m never going to be with a beautiful woman, Mia. I’m too poor,  too fat. But when I look at your pictures, it’s like your smile is meant for  me and me alone. So thanks for that.  The  same  themes  are  briefly  alluded  to  in  the  “Mikado”  episode  of  Millennium: In one scene, a socially awkward, overweight man articulates  that his use of websites is, in essence, the entirety of his sex life, that, in  lieu of real contact with women, he fulfils his fantasies online. In the afore- mentioned “Eyes In” episode of Flashpoint, Stuart had been paralyzed by  a stroke, but with the help of his webcam he could position himself on  webcam in a way to disguise his disability and, thus, engage with women  on a level playing field. In each example, characters get to participate in  socializing that would be, likely, more difficult to orchestrate offline.  Virtual  reality  in  each  of  these  examples  is  presented  as  somehow  cognizant  of  fantasies  that  users  may  have  never  acknowledged,  thus  making the software more intuitive than cybersex or netporn.101 In the  made-for-television sci-fi film The Cyberstalking  1999 , for example, the  virtual  reality  entrepreneur,  Rob   Jason  Hildebrandt ,  boasted,  “If  you  can think it, you can experience it.” This premise plays out in numer- ous virtual reality scenes whereby the sex that transpires appears not just  as  an  immersive  sexual  experience  but  as  a  manifestation  of  the  user’s  most  deep-seated  fantasies;  as  Taylor   Daniel  Caltagirone   explains  in  The Cyberstalking, “the connection taps into your subconscious. It would  materialize  thoughts  nobody  knew  were  there.”  Sidney  in  VR.5,  for    268   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  example, seemed not to fully acknowledge her attraction to her colleague  until she entered the virtual reality space. Harry in Wild Palms, similarly  seemed surprised that the virtual reality system conjured up a pageant  contestant fantasy that he appeared not to have even admitted to him- self. In the “User Friendly” episode of Married with Children the cybersex  project was explained to Bud as centering on technology used to “create  your ideal sexual experience.” The same idea plays out in Virtuosity when  the workings of the virtual reality technology were explained to Clyde by  the creator Lindenmeyer  Stephen Spinella :  She’s interactive, Clyde . . . While you were in my ring Sheila 3.2 is col- lecting  information  from  136  aspects  of  your  physiology.  Your  heart  rate,  pupil  dilation,  vocal  intonation,  syntax.  Any  degree  of  detectable  tumescence.  While these examples present cybersex as something largely cerebral  and offering sex that differs substantially from our concepts of “normal”  intercourse—both in a physical and fantasy sense—other examples pro- vide a cybersex future that at least has links to the present, for example,  through the portrayal of the body still having a role. In the “Virtual Real- ity” episode of the sitcom Mad about You  1992–1999 , for example, Paul   Paul Reiser  uses a headset as well as sensory gloves to participate in a fan- tasy involving Christie Brinkley, his sensory gloves enable him to “touch”  her, in turn likening the experience at least somewhat to real sex. In The  Lawnmower Man scene, Jobe and Marnie wore helmets and body suits— covered, seemingly in sensors—to simulate a kind of intercourse. Akin to  The Lawnmower Man, in the Belgian speculative future film Thomas est  amoureux  Thomas in Love   2000 , the agoraphobic title character  Ben- oît Verhaert  had cybersex with animated characters as well as real people  with the help of body suits: As in The Lawnmower Man these suits were  covered in sensors in an attempt, seemingly, to produce an intercourse- like  experience.  “The  Infestation  Hypothesis”  episode  of  The  Big  Bang  Theory provides another attempt at simulating familiar physical sensations  when Howard builds a machine that can facilitate kissing between two  geographically separated characters.  While  arguably  the  simple  premise  of  sex  with  a  machine  could  be  considered perverse,102 virtual reality mediated sexual experiences, in fact,  allow other perversions to be experienced: Just as netporn and cybersex  facilitate certain kinks to be experienced, so too do the virtual worlds in  numerous screen examples.      T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    269  At the comparatively tame end of the spectrum is the “Virtual Slide”  episode of the series Sliders  1995–2000 . Quinn  Jerry O’Connell  used  virtual reality technology to participate in a sexual fantasy involving his  colleague Maggie  Kari Wuhrer . When the real Maggie intruded on his  virtual reality scene she rebuked him: “You have sex with me without my  consent? . . . For God’s sake, Quinn, you can’t just go around using peo- ple’s likenesses for your own twisted pleasure.” In the “Skin Deep” episode  of The Outer Limits  1995–2002 , Sid  Adam Goldberg  used hologram  technology  akin to what transpires in Logan’s Run  to don an attractive  physique in order to seduce women who were deceived by his new physi- cality. In The Lawnmower Man, Jobe and Marnie were in the same room  when they put on their helmets and body suits. The fact, therefore, that  they had virtual reality sex rather than physical sex highlights that, appar- ently, the virtual environment presented them with the opportunity to  do something sexually different than what would transpire in real life. In  Lawnmower Man, Jobe tells Marnie, just before they began their virtual  sex, “In here we can be anything we want to be.” For Jobe being “any- thing” apparently extended to being a rapist: During the virtual sex scene  Marnie gets trapped in a kind of sticky net and Jobe sexually assaults her.  Cyberspace is exploited to experience sex that in real life is illegal. Such  a theme is taken to the extreme in the sci-fi film Gamer  2009 , centered  on a live-action sim-game; as the software creator Ken  Michael C. Hall   explained, “You can get paid to be controlled, or you can pay to control.”  For characters who control, they can indulge in a range of fantasies; Gorge   Ramsey Moore , for example, played out several rape fantasies as both a  rapist and a rape victim.  While in these examples characters use the technology to play out dif- ferent sexual scenarios, worth noting is that virtual reality—and Internet  technology more broadly—allows for identities to be played with and cor- poreal restrictions to be overcome; that just as the Internet is a leveler in  terms of physical attraction, it can also be interpreted as a leveler in regard  to mobility. In real life Sidney in VR.5, for example, was a shy, dowdily  dressed woman who online became a sexy cybergoth. For Sid in The Outer  Limits, technology allowed him to feel attractive in a world that would  largely consider him to be a hairy nerd. For a character like Thomas in  Thomas est amoureux he could experience sex with another person without  having to fully overcome his social phobias. For Gorge in Gamer who is  fat and in a wheelchair, he too had the opportunity of adopting an alter- nate identity, playing out his sexual fantasies, and not being restricted by  his corporeal self.103   270   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  The idea of cyberspace offering the capacity to play with identity has  been a key theme in Internet-themed narratives as well as published dis- cussions on the Internet, and certainly something explored in Chapter 5.   While for some people, playing out fantasies in cyberspace is a way to  participate in a compartmentalized fashion without impacting on other  areas of life, in practice such activities can negatively influence a real life  relationship. In the aforementioned Mad about You episode, for example,  following Paul’s experience with the virtual reality software, he and his  wife Jamie  Helen Hunt  discussed—and then argued—about the virtues  of the software:  Paul:    You can ski on the Alps. You’re riding a raft through the Colorado  River. You’re in the space shuttle. You’re flying all over the Earth. You  can sing on Broadway. You’re on-stage, singing. And everything you  do, it’s like you’re doing it. You’re right there.  Jamie:  Could we do these things together? Paul:  Of course, yeah. Jamie:  What did you do? Paul:    I gave Christie Brinkley a massage. She had an itch. Listen, I gotta  tell you, it’s phenomenal. You really, you can’t believe what this is. It’s  like, I’m like, it’s Christie Brinkley. I’m looking at Christie Brinkley.  I’m talking to Christie Brinkley. Christie Brinkley is talking to me.  We’re talking. Christie Brinkley and I were talk—You could see her.  I could feel Christie Brinkley. You know? It’s so funny. They had,  like, lotion, this oil, so she asked me to put on some. I’m putting this  lotion, and I’m rubbing oil right on her. And I’m telling you, you’ve  never felt skin like this. Jamie:  You’re a little, little man. Paul:  What? Jamie:    You could choose anything and that’s what you chose? To be with  another woman? I was waiting for a bus. She started it. No, she did.  Paul:  Jamie:  Have you no shame? Paul:  Jamie:  Yes, it was. You just got finished telling me how incredibly real it was.  Listen, it’s not like I was really with her.  In this scene, Jamie construes Paul’s virtual reality sex as cheating. The  idea  that  sexual  experiences  transpiring  in  cyberspace  not  only  fail  to  completely be compartmentalized but in fact are considered to be real  enough to constitute cheating highlight the theme of the Internet’s role in  aiding the participation in infidelity.      T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    271  The Internet and Infidelity  In this section, sex outside of a committed relationship is considered  as an outlier sexual practice. In Talhotblond, Amanda  Courteney Cox , a  friend of Thomas’ wife—comments, “It is the digital age. You don’t have  to leave your house to have an affair.” With this in mind, in this section  the Internet’s role in facilitating sex outside of a committed relationship  in examined.  Internet Solace  In my book  Cheating  on  the  Sisterhood:  Infidelity  and  Feminism, I  discussed  the  my  wife  doesn’t  understand  me  trope  that  is  often  used  as  an  instigator  for  extramarital  liaisons.104  In  numerous  examples,  the Internet serves a similar function: Rather than characters seeking  solace in the arms of a lover, the Internet becomes a place to go for  succour.  In the pilot of Selfie, Eliza was at a wedding, dejectedly watching the  couple exchange vows and via voiceover she explains, “As I listened to  Maureen [Hayley Marie Norman] recite those crazy vows, it hit me. I  might get thousands of likes and retweets and favorites. But it’s entirely  possible that no one will ever look at me the way Terrence [Samm Levine]  was looking at her. So I did what I guess I’ve always done when I need  to distract myself from my feelings.” Eliza then played with her phone;  the Internet was where she went to escape from her bad feelings. In the  first  season  of  House  of  Cards,  Francis  is  repeatedly  shown  relaxing  by  playing an online first-person shooter game; such gaming is his way to  escape from stress. In the opening of Don Jon, the title character discussed  his relationship with netporn, alluding to a similar relationship with the  Internet:  Jon:    I never actually touch my cock ’til I find the right clip. Then, once I do  . . . goodbye. For the next few minutes, all the bullshit fades away, and  the only thing in the world is those tits . . . that ass . . . the blowjob, the  cowboy, the doggy, the moneyshot, and that’s it.  Jon  used  netporn  to  escape  “the  bullshit.”  In  the  made-for-television  drama Every Mother’s Worst Fear  1998 , as soon as her boyfriend broke up  with her, Martha  Jordan Ladd  went into a chat room and typed “I need  a friend.” In Chatroom something very similar transpired: Jim  Matthew  Beard  argued with his parents in one scene and then, in the very next,    272   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  rushed into a chat room. In the British comedy-drama  Dogging:  A  Love  Story  2009 , following an unpleasant exchange with her overprotect father,  college student Laura  Kate Heppell  went into a chat room which was an  outlet for her loneliness and isolation. In each of these examples, characters  go online as a way to moderate bad feelings. The same motivations, needless  to say, underpin characters going online to deal with, or even escape, rela- tionship issues and, in the process, becoming embroiled in an affair. In Net  Games, after Adam fails to initiate sex with his wife, Jennifer, the two have a  brief argument and he logs on to a sex chat site for the first time and says to  himself, “What the hell, it ain’t cheating buddy.” In the made-for-television  thriller Web of Desire  2009 , after her husband chooses to go back to sleep  rather than hear about her workday, Beth  Dina Meyer  logs on to a medi- cal forum to initiate a chat and ends up in a romantic entanglement with  a woman; as it turns out, her husband, Jake  Adrian Hough , had—dur- ing this same period—also been engaging in intimate chat online, at one  point justifying his actions claiming, “I needed an escape, alright?” In Men,  Women & Children, Don and his wife Helen  Rosemarie DeWitt  were in  bed playing on their iPads when a television commercial came on: “At Ash- leyMadison.com we know nothing lasts forever and so if you are ready, if  you are truly ready, then we are happy to bring you back to those ‘Remember  When’ experiences with someone new, someone exciting.” Shortly thereaf- ter, Helen logs on to the advertised site and establishes a profile “Bored- Wife123” detailing, “I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be desired. I want to  remember what it’s like to enjoy sex.” At the very same time, Don uses the  Internet to search for escorts. In the drama Downloading Nancy  2008 , the  unhappily married title character  Maria Bello  uses the Internet to find  someone to kill her and ends up embroiled in a sadomasochistic affair. In  the “Free Dental” episode of The Practice, the married dentist Henry  Henry  Winkler  uses the Internet to meet a woman willing to exchange free teeth  cleanings for crushing bugs with her feet; an act he found sexually arousing.  In the gay-themed romance eCupid  2011 , Marshall  Houston Rhines  and  Gabe’s  Noah Schuffman  relationship had become stale: Marshall sees an  app advertised for the eCupid app and he fills in the questionnaire agreeing  that he feels like his life lacks sex, he is frustrated, he is feeling trapped and  unsatisfied. In the Korean romantic-comedy Baram-pigi joheun nal  A Day  for an Affair   2007  two women—Tweetie  Jin-seo Yoon  and Dewdrop   Hye-su Kim —also solicit affair partners in chat rooms as a way to cope  with the tedium of married life.  Many writings link infidelity to a desire for escapism. In Cheating on  the Sisterhood, for example, I identified, “While infidelity can obviously       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    273  be construed as a distraction, more than this, however, is the idea of the  affair  as  escape:  initially,  psychologically  but  also—when  compounded  with  false  hope—potentially, permanently.”105 In social worker Herbert  Strean’s work on infidelity, he likewise contended, “For some men and  women the realities of marriage are experienced as so burdensome that  they have to escape to a Neverland—the blissful land of an extramarital  affair.”106 Family therapists Rona Subotnik and Gloria Harris make simi- lar points identifying that “some spouses, overwhelmed by the stress in  the family and tired of seeking solutions to problems, seek escape in an  affair.”107 While the Internet certainly makes finding someone to cheat  with  effortless—and  Men, Women  &  Children  and  the  real-life  Ashley  Madison scandal of 2015108 both reference the industry that now sur- rounds this—it also boasts a number of properties that aid the feeling of  escapism. Escapism is often mentioned as a motivating factor in use of the  Internet in general,109 but more specifically in online gaming,110 social  media use,111 and netporn.112 Therapists Kate Anthony and Stephen Goss  even link escapism to what they term “cyberinfidelity.”113  In psychologists Monica Whitty and Adam Joinson’s work on the Inter- net, they make the point that “sexual intercourse is not the only sexual  activity that individuals consider as infidelity.”114 While in the examples  discussed thus far physical infidelity transpires, in many others netporn,  along with cybersex, are implicated in infidelity narratives.  Infidelity and Netporn  In Cheating on the Sisterhood, I examined porn as a kind of betrayal  within relationships. I referred, for example, to Rachael Jones writing for  Spectator magazine, who discussed the betrayal she experienced after dis- covering her husband’s netporn use:  All my old Seventies’ feminism was revived in an instant. These girls were  younger  than  his  daughters.  I  had  a  disagreeable  vision  of  him  sitting  there at his desk masturbating over young females who were simply two- dimensional images on a screen. Suddenly Andrea Dworkin became my  heroine, my role-model. I saw with instant clarity how right she is.115  According  to  the  definition  offered  in  Lori  Limacher  and  Lorraine  Wright’s work on family therapy, “infidelity can be understood as a breach  of trust between a couple, in which the secrecy and lies become the culprit  in destroying the relationship, not the sex.”116 While in real life and on  screen, there are always a wide variety of factors motivating relationship    274   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  breakdowns, some screen examples do present netporn as a catalyst. In  Little Children, after Sarah  Kate Winslet  caught her husband Richard   Gregg Edelman  masturbating to netporn, the two begin sleeping sepa- rately. In Don Jon, Jon and Barbara’s first fight transpired after he left the  bed to watch netporn: Eventually his continued use killed their relation- ship. In a subplot in Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life, Beth revealed that  her marriage was in fact destroyed by netporn. In the drama series Tell Me  You Love Me  2007 , the breakdown of a marriage was linked to a hus- band’s netporn use; the same idea was a theme in the Christian-dramas  Fireproof  2008  and Uphill Battle  2013 . In Men, Women & Children  although audiences don’t know Don prior to his life with netporn, it is  certainly hinted at that this might be a factor in his troubled marriage.  While, according to Limacher and Wright, porn can be construed as  a problem because it breaches trust in a relationship, cybersex can both  achieve this and also create a new problem: emotional infidelity. Internet and Cybersex  In Net Games, while Adam explicitly says to himself “it ain’t cheating  buddy,” the fact that after his use of the site he tells his friend that he  had “sex” highlights that he was certainly experiencing something special,  something beyond mere masturbation; certainly special enough to dub  his interactions as sex. In the “Virtual Reality” episode of Mad about You,  Jamie overtly perceived Paul’s cybersex session as a kind of betrayal: Just  as the simulated reality experience had felt real to Paul, it also felt real to  Jamie—a situation that Paul didn’t understand until Jamie used the tech- nology herself and he promptly feared that she would use it for sex with  a man.117 The “touching each other’s minds” idea and the perception that  cybersex facilitates more of an emotional bond than netporn consump- tion transpires in numerous examples. In the “Lifeline” episode of The  L Word, for example, Tina used chat rooms to play out her attraction to  men. When her partner, Bette, found out she considered this a betrayal.  “You’re acting like I have some big secret Internet sex life,” Tina argued,  defensively.  One  study  indicated  that  75  percent  of  participants  would  find  it  acceptable for their partner to visit an adult site, whereas 77 percent said it  would be unacceptable for their partner to participate in an adult one-on- one video conversation.118 In his discussion of this research, Ben-Ze’ev  identified that “due to the interactive nature of cyberspace, virtual activi- ties on the Net are accorded moral significance.”119 Along such a defini- tion, the noninteractive use of netporn is considered as less egregious and       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    275  less of a betrayal than the interactive nature of an activity like cybersex, an  idea referenced in comments made by a participant in Ben-Ze’ev’s study:  Cybersex  is  closer  to  having  a  hooker  than  plain  pornography  because  there is a real and active person involved on the other end. People are  touching each others’ minds in a mutual and cooperative way that silent  fantasy does not permit.120  A similar comment was made by the partner of a cybersex participant  in psychologist Jennifer Schneider’s research. Schneider discussed substi- tution in the context of cybersex ruining relationships; something evident  in the case studies she reported from. This partner, for example, divulged:  Currently we have sex only every 3 months, usually only after I blow my  stack and I suppose he feels obligated . . . For me the issue has not been  the difference between him having e-mail or actually physical contact, it is  that someone else is receiving his attention and I am not.121  Something that netporn consumption alludes to but cybersex amplifies  is that the energies that “should” be spent within the primary relation- ships are being redirected, in turn leading to feelings of betrayal.  The perversion most commonly catered to by the Internet as depicted  on screen—and something briefly alluded to already in this chapter in  the context of eCupid, American Horror Story, The Dying Gaul, and The L  Word—is homosexuality.  Homosexuality  In  a  scene  from  Untraceable,  after  having  wrongly  arrested  Arthur  Elmer  Jesse Tyler Ferguson  as a suspect in a serial killer investigation,  the investigator, Jennifer  Diane Lane , explained to her team:  Got our proof it wasn’t Elmer. Starting Friday at 1pm, Elmer was logged  into a chat room for twelve consecutive hours. At the time Miller disap- peared, Elmer was engaged in a steamy, private chat with the first tenor of  the men’s chorus of Greater Tacoma.  While Elmer’s chat room session could, simply, be justified in the nar- rative as an alibi akin to any other, filmmaking is, of course, not a game  of chance. Not only does Elmer’s same-sex steamy chat session work to  seemingly justify his initial arrest—i.e., that he is apparently still pretty  creepy; as Jennifer’s colleague, Eric  Billy Burke , commented, “Still felt    276   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  good arresting him”—but it can also be construed as a nod to the idea  that homosexuals are often thought to have a particularly close relation- ship with the Internet, that this technology has long been used as a way  for them to connect with one another.  Before I explore this close relationship as depicted on screen, it is worth- while briefly justifying the inclusion of homosexuality in a discussion of  perversion.  While  tolerance  toward  homosexuality  has  increased  over  time122—and thus, same-sex sexual relations are unlikely today to be con- sidered as taboo as they once were—using the statistical definition of perver- sion presented at the beginning of this chapter, perversion is still a minority  sexual behavior and thus exists as sex that is nonmainstream. While atti- tudes toward homosexuality have liberalized, the fact that same-sex attrac- tion is not yet fully mainstreamed and continues to be plagued by a number  of long-standing concerns about shame, embarrassment, and denial, it is  no surprise that the Internet—driven by the Triple-A engine of affordabil- ity, accessibility, and, importantly, anonymity123—has long boasted specific  appeals for gay people. Such appeals, needless to say, have been extensively  documented in academic research. Since the earliest days of the Internet,  academics have identified the crucial role of the Internet in helping to con- nect homosexuals who may, for example, only be at the pregay stage of their  coming out journey,124 who may still be living at home,125 who live in coun- tries  with  specific  prohibitions  against  homosexuality,126  or  alternatively  who are reluctant or unwilling to physically meet with other homosexu- als but nevertheless want some kind of intimacy. Communications theorist  John Campbell spotlighted how, since the earliest days of the Internet, “gay  men have been quick to employ computer-mediated communication tech- nologies to expand their social networks.”127 Psychologists Michael Ross  and Michael Kauth similarly identified that cybersex has provided an outlet  for gay men in situations “where disclosure of gay or a MSM [men who  have sex with men] would endanger their personal or occupational safety or  social supports.”128 As the authors explained:  For men struggling with their sexuality, going to gay bars, bookstores, or  support groups makes a public statement about self-identity that can be  risky and frightening. However, accessing sexual images on the Internet  or participating in male chatrooms entails less personal risk or stigma.129  With these ideas in mind, it is unsurprising that film and television  often  depict  homosexual  characters  using  the  Internet.  While,  as  dis- cussed throughout this book, heterosexual characters are also often shown       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    277  using the Internet, because of the continued minority and marginalized  status of homosexuality, the Internet still uniquely serves gay people in  ways less relevant for most heterosexuals.  In Untraceable, the audience is not given a great deal of information  about Elmer other than he is an unpleasant person, that he got fired from  a job after installing cameras in the men’s bathroom, and that he spent  12 hours straight in a chat room. We don’t, therefore, know whether the  character was closeted and, thus, whether chat room activity was the pri- mary outlet for his homosexuality or whether it was simply an adjunct.  On one hand, Elmer’s chat session could, in fact, simply reflect the way  characters—irrespective of sexual preference—are shown as connecting in  our modern, tech-obsessed culture. It is important, therefore, to consider  that gay people using the Internet are akin to the common screen scenario  of straight people using the Internet to meet people. American gay-themed  comedies like Breaking the Cycle  2002 , Eating Out 3: All You Can Eat   2009 , Is It Just Me?  2010 , and eCupid, along with the “Daddy Dear- est  Sonny Boy ” episode of Queer as Folk, the Filipino drama inter.m@ tes  2004 , and the Argentinian Film El tercero  The Third One   2014 ,  can thus each be likened to the wide variety of films about heterosexuals  using the Internet for romance—You’ve Got Mail  1998 , Must Love Dogs   2005 , Because I Said So  2007 , for example—whereby lonely hearts sim- ply use the technology to connect; that a desire for intimacy is a stronger  driver for Internet use than sexual preference. While, of course, similarities  exist between these homosexual and heterosexual narratives, as noted, gay  characters often have sexuality-specific reasons for use of the technology.  Gay teens using the Internet in the comedy Geography Club  2013  and  the “Versatile Toppings” episode of the mystery series Veronica Mars  2004– 2007  illustrate the themes alluded to earlier about pregay young people  who may still be living at home130 and only at the very beginning of their  coming out journey,131 and both narratives also mirror some other sexuality- specific reasons for Internet use, most notably privacy maintenance.  Privacy Maintenance  Geography Club opened with teenager Russell  Cameron Deane Stew-  art  scheduling a meeting via a gay chat room:  72FINS:  RUS96:   I have these sick shades. Orange frames. I’ll wear those.  Cool. I’ll be wearing a green shirt with a cartoon lizard on it. Don’t  be jealous.   278   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  72FINS:  Ha. Okay. RUS96:  Look . . . it’s really important you don’t tell anyone. 72FINS:  For sure. Same here. RUS96:  72FINS:  Totally get it. I don’t like labels either.  I mean, I’m not even sure I’m . . . you know.  While  Russell  doesn’t  articulate  his  reasons  for  wanting  to  keep  his  meeting private, the reasons why any gay teen might not wish to advertise  such a meeting makes sense to an audience: Even well into the twenty-first  century there is a cost to being transparent about nonmainstream sexual  desires. The cost, incidentally, actually panned out for Russell: When his  sexuality was exposed, he was thrown off the football team and was widely  ridiculed; his initial reasons for using the chat room were thus validated.  Similar themes play out in the “Versatile Toppings” episode of Veronica  Mars. The episode centered on the title character’s  Kristen Bell  investi- gations into a hacked website. The website—The Pirate’s SHIP [Student  Homosexual Internet Posting]—was established by the gay student Ryan   Bradford Anderson  as a means for closeted Neptune High students to  discretely and anonymously communicate. The hacking of the site was  brought to teen sleuth Veronica’s attention because the users were being  blackmailed: If they didn’t pay the nominated sum, their homosexual- ity would be exposed. As in Geography Club, students used the Internet  because not only did they want to connect with other gay students, but  they wanted to do so discretely. Just as Russell’s valid fears of exposure were  his motivation for using the Internet to connect in Geography Club, so too  were they for The Pirate’s SHIP users in Veronica Mars: When site user  Kylie  Kristin Cavallari  requested Veronica’s help and revealed that she  was a lesbian, while Veronica responded, “That’s cool,” Kylie commented,  “Only in college.” Another student, Kelly  Lucas Grabeel , explained to  Veronica his reasons for using the site including that he “wants to survive  high school” and that if people found out about his sexuality “then I’m  dead.” Equally, just as in Geography Club, the fears of exposure articulated  in Veronica Mars were actually validated: In one scene, Marlena  Miriam  Korn , a user of The Pirate’s SHIP site, did have her sexuality mocked by  a classmate after it was exposed.  The Pregay Driver  Something hinted to in the Veronica Mars episode and made explicit  in Geography Club is the idea of the Internet used at what academics term       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    279  the “pregay” stage: The psychologist Vivienne Cass, for example, identi- fied pregay as the first in six common stages in homosexual identity for- mation.132 Pregay is often considered as the time when a child or teen  “feels different growing up”133 but hasn’t yet identified as homosexual. For  young people  as well as, of course, for some adults  in the pregay stage,  the  Internet  provides  several  useful  functions,  as  explained  by  psycho- therapist Michael Shernoff:  Psychologically,  it  may  feel  vastly  safer  for  a  man  who  is  in  a  stage  of  pre-gay identity formation to test the waters chatting online with men  either to homosocialize or to arrange a sexual liaison, rather than having to  actually brave going into a gay bar, club, or community center or having  real-life sexual or social encounters, which were the only available options  in the days prior to the Internet.134  Russell in Geography Club, for example, made his pregay identity clear:  “I mean, I’m not even sure I’m . . . you know.” The Internet provided  the character a relatively low-risk means to experiment with his sexuality  without risking his identity. The Pirate’s SHIP website in Veronica Mars  provided a similar function for teen characters like Ryan, Kylie, and Kelly:  Characters could try on homosexuality without having to commit to the  identity  or the label .  Another key aspect of the pregay identity is not necessarily knowing  where one wants to take their sexual identity: as Russell in Geography Club  commented, “I’m not even sure.” While Russell’s ambiguity could be con- strued as a kind of hedging—this is certainly the case for the character Ike   Alex Newell  in Geography Club who initially claimed to only be 20 per- cent gay, but then eventually admitted to being 100 percent—the reality  is for a teenager at the pregay stage they may still be unsure of their sexual  identity and not necessarily be willing to embrace it yet, be it through  identifying with the label or by participating in homosexual activity. In  Geography Club, when Russell goes to the park to meet 72FINS, his cor- respondent  fails  to  turn  up: We  can  assume  that  while  the  chat  room  similarly provided 72FINS the ability to participate in his sexuality in  a  gentle,  introductory  manner,  he  was  not  yet  ready  for  an  in-person  meeting. This same scenario transpires in the “Four to Tango” episode  of Dawson’s Creek. In the episode, gay teen Jack  Kerr Smith  received  much e-mail correspondence after an online news story about him join- ing the football team went viral. One of the e-mails was from a fellow gay  teen, Ben  Tony Schnur . The two communicated via Instant Messenger    280   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  and eventually decided to meet. Interestingly, while the Internet helped  Jack connect with another gay teen—in the same way it aided Russell in  Geography Club as well as some of the characters in Veronica Mars—it also  provided a very good illustration of a fundamental aspect of the pregay  identity: A pregay teen might be interested in pursuing some aspects of  homosexuality—for example, homosocialization—but not want to fully  commit to physical contact. Despite scheduling to meet up with Ben, for  example, Jack doesn’t end up going through with it; he wasn’t ready to  commit to a physical manifestation of his sexuality, something he explains  to his sister Andie  Meredith Monroe :  Andie, this is different. This is a whole new level of my life that I don’t  even know if I’m ready for. When I walk through that door and I say hello  to this guy my entire life is going to be different. I’m not just going to be  telling the world that I’m gay, I’m actually going to be gay.  While  the  low-risk,  nonphysical,  and—what  Jack  in  Dawson’s  Creek  terms—“baby  steps”  method  of  communicating  with  other  gay  and  pregay peers motivated Internet use in the examples discussed in this sec- tion, Shernoff identified the homosocialization function, something that  the sociologist C. J. Pascoe also explored in relation to the motivation for  gay teens going online:  The internet and new media have given a great gift to gay boys in terms of  their ability to find a community of youth like themselves. Because there  often are not enough out gay boys at school to form a community, gay  boys use social network sites to link to other teenagers like themselves who  might not attend their school. In this way teens both expand their friend- ship circle and their dating pool.135  Jennifer Egan, in a 2000 article for the New York Times, similarly docu- mented the role of the Internet in helping teens to develop a support sys- tem. “Jeffrey,” the subject at the center of Egan’s article, identified, “The  Internet is the thing that has kept me sane . . . the Internet is my refuge.”  As Egan explains:  For homosexual teenagers with computer access, the Internet has, quite  simply,  revolutionized  the  experience  of  growing  up  gay.  Isolation  and  shame persist among gay teenagers, of course, but now, along with the  inhospitable families and towns in which many find themselves marooned,  there exists a parallel online community—real people like them in cyber- space with whom they can chat, exchange messages and even engage in       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    281   online  sex. What was most critical to the gay kids I spoke with was the  simple, revelatory discovery that they were not alone.136  “Brent,”  a  boy  in  Ruth  Bell’s  work  on  teens,  personalized  the  ideas  discussed by Pascoe and Egan and also verbalized the motivations for the  gay teens using the Internet in the Veronica Mars episode: “I’ve met lots  of gay teens through Internet chat rooms, though most of them don’t live  anywhere near me. But still, it’s nice to be able to talk to people who think  like I do.”137  While thus far I have discussed gay teens using the Internet to con- nect, adults use the technology similarly. In Murder Dot Com  2008 , the  lesbian character, Lauren  Robyn Lively , briefly mentioned her reasons  for participating in online dating: “I work 18 hours a day, do you think  it’s easy to meet women in a courtroom? Give me a break.” The Scottish  lesbian series Lip Service  2010–2012 , as well as Queer as Folk also had  online dating as a theme. In the gay-themed drama Breaking the Cycle,  Chad  Ryan White  was talking to a friend, Sammy  Stephen Halliday ,  about his roommate’s online sexcapades and highlighted how the Internet  has changed the gay hook-up:  Sammy:   Chad:  Sammy:    Gay guys meeting on the net is the latest thing. Years ago gay peo- ple had to meet on a beach or cruised a parking lot or even a park. Yeah but they got caught by the cops—  People meeting on the net that’s the thing. You gotta admit, it’s  better than the park.  In these examples, the Internet is presented as an alternative meeting  place for anybody but specifically people whose sexual preferences might  make serendipitous offline meetings more difficult.  Geographic Isolation  In sociologist Keith Durkin’s work on the Internet, he identified that  “one  of  the  most  sociological  significant  aspects  of  the  Internet  is  its  capability to bring together geographically dispersed individuals.”138 On  screen,  gay  adults  who,  for  a  variety  of  reasons  have  difficulties  meet- ing people offline, do so with the help of the Internet. The backstory of  the  romantic-drama  Ciao   2008 ,  for  example,  is  an  online  friendship  between two gay men: Andrea  Alessandro Calza  from Italy and Mark   Chuck  Blaum   from  the  United  States.  Andrea  had  planned  to  visit  Mark but Mark was killed in a car crash before he arrived. Andrea visits    282   C Y B E R B U L L I E S ,   C Y B E R A C T I V I S T S ,   C Y B E R P R E D AT O R S  Mark’s friends anyhow, and at one point he has a conversation with Lau- ren  Ethel Lung  about why he was dating someone in the United States:  Lauren:  Andrea:   Is there no one in Italy you could date? People who live in Genoa?  There’s not much of a scene there. It’s not like Rome, you know. It’s  not easy to meet other guys. So my social outlet is quite limited and  I end up meeting people online.  The same idea themes are identifiable in On_Line where a young gay  man—Ed  Eric Millegan —was in a suicide chat room lamenting that  “I’m the only queer in all of Ohio.”  Egan,  cited  earlier,  referenced  isolation  and  while  this  is  something  that plagues teenagers who, like Kylie and Kelly in  Veronica  Mars were  “marooned” in high school and still living with their parents, themes of  isolation—be it geographic, as was the case for Andrea in Ciao and Ed  in On_Line, or attributable to being closeted as was the case for Oliver   Ian Veneracion   in  inter.m@tes  and  the  actor  Russell   Marc  Blucas   in  the “The City That Never Sleeps” episode of the police-drama Blue Bloods   2010– —the Internet can provide a solution to isolation. Social theorist J.  Dallas Dishman, for example, discussed communities for adults in cyber- space, identifying that “in the virtual spaces that gay men create, they are  not . . . the ‘odd man out in society.’” 139 The sense of connection offered  online thus exists to help alleviate the sexuality-based isolation felt offline.  More Than Just Sex  An interesting distinction between heterosexual narratives like You’ve  Got Mail, Must Love Dogs, and Because I Said So compared to homosexual  ones such as Breaking the Cycle, Eating Out 3: All You Can Eat, and Is It  Just Me?, is the focus on casual sex: Whereas heterosexual-themed films  commonly focus on the Internet used to seek out relationships, for the  gay narratives the focus is on hook-ups. Is It Just Me opens with Blaine   Nicholas Downs  writing a newspaper column that highlights the casual  sex theme evident in many gay male narratives:  I am writing today’s article about my seemingly never-ending quest to  find true love. Is it just me, or am I the only one who can’t seem to find  someone special? I beg the question, am I the only gay man looking for  more than what’s behind a zipper?  The fact that Blaine had to explicitly explain that he was looking for  more than what’s behind a zipper highlights that the default assumption       T H E   C Y B E R P E RV    283  is gay male promiscuity. While the politics of this assumption is addressed  elsewhere,140 the idea of gay narratives reflecting a phenomena occurring  offline  is  worth  identifying.  As  early  as  1998,  Steve  Friess,  writing  for  The Advocate, identified chat rooms as the new gay bars.141 David Tuller,  writing for the New York Times in 2004, identified that the Internet is  often dubbed as “gay takeout.”142 Certainly the appeal of the Internet as  an easy way for gay men to organize sex is illustrated in films like Break- ing the Cycle, Eating Out 3: All You Can Eat, Is It Just Me?, eCupid, and   El tercero  The Third One , equally the convenience of such chat rooms  for masturbation purposes is illustrated well in The Dying Gaul and is also  well documented in academic research.143 Social researchers, for example,  have identified that the majority of both gay and bisexual young men  met their first sexual partner using the Internet,144 and that the majority  of young gay and bisexual men had used the Internet to find a romantic  or sexual partner.145 Worth noting, hook-up apps for both gay men and  lesbians  are  beginning  to  have  a  role  on  screen,  their  use  featuring  in  episodes of Blue Bloods, Faking It, the gay drama Looking  2014–2015 ,  the sitcoms 2 Broke Girls  2011– , Please Like Me  2013–  and Marry Me   2014–2015 , and the dramas How to Get Away with Murder  2014–  and  Orphan Black  2013– .  Interestingly, while isolation was a theme for the adult gay men in Ciao  and On_Line—and thus the Internet fulfilled a function of helping to create  a community—for the gay characters in Breaking the Cycle, Eating Out 3:   All You Can Eat, Is It Just Me?, eCupid, and El tercero  The Third One ,  these are not characters who are closeted or socially isolated but are in  fact part of supportive gay communities. The Internet, therefore, helps to  fulfill functions other than simply connecting the isolated. Friess’s article  centers on gay men in the East Village of New York using chat rooms  highlighting that even in progressive cities where communities of like- minded people exist, there is still something desirable about online com- munication. Friess notes some of the unique appeals including users not  needing to worry about whether they are stylish enough.  In this chapter, I examined the stereotype of the cyberperv as presented  in screen narratives. The Internet has long been associated with sex and as  explored in this chapter the technology provides a wide range of ways for  characters with outlier sexual interests to satisfy their bodily yens.    Conclusion  Over 500 film and television references to the Internet, to its users, were  discussed in this book, and as examined across six chapters, a complicated  and largely negative portrayal emerges.  Ubiquitous Internet use off screen—the second-nature way in which  we each turn to Google for information, to social media to see our friends,  to  netporn  and  Netflix  for  recreation—is  a  reality  largely  absent  from  the screen. Instead, popular media tells a tale of the Internet as a thing,  a  place,  a  tool,  worth  fearing;  of  Internet  users  as  somehow  different,  scarier, more strange, awkward, nefarious, duplicitous, and ultimately less  fuckable than everyone else.  While  the  picture  is  bleak,  we  probably  shouldn’t  be  too  surprised.  Three  key  factors  underpin  this  fraught  presentation.  First,  there  are  media effects. Despite decades of research debunking magic bullet ideas  of the press, such theories remain popular and keep getting repeated, pri- marily because they are seductive: As a society, we want answers as to why  people do bad things, because there is empowerment—albeit faux—in  pretending that we can have some control over our precarious environs.1 The second factor is techno- and, more recently, cyberphobia: fears of  new technology and notably fears of the Internet. With an even longer  history  than  fears  of  the  media  leading  to  social  decay  exists  the  fear  that new things are scary things. Such fears are hinged upon beliefs that  machines change—if not sometimes even replace—the ways things have  always been done and thus threaten our concepts of what it means to  be human. For those of us from nontech backgrounds, such technology  also exposes our intellectual shortcomings and thus we fear it because it’s    286   C O n C L U S I O n  changing our lives so rapidly and yet our understanding of how this is all  transpiring is limited.  Third, and an answer, in fact, to why we don’t see scenes of people  doing other things as normal as using the Internet—i.e., brushing teeth  or swallowing vitamins—is not because these things don’t happen in real  life but rather because they happen so very often that they simply don’t  make for interesting viewing. To justify the inclusion of the mundane in  a screen narrative it needs to lead somewhere: move a plot forward or,  at  the  very  least,  to  reveal  something  about  a  character.  The  hundreds  of  Internet  portrayals  discussed  throughout  this  book  are  thus  skewed  toward fear, danger, and perversion because such scenes make for much  more interesting—more dramatic—viewing than an online search for a  recipe train timetable new pair of sneakers.  Cyberbullies,  Cyberactivists,  Cyberpredators,  like  all  my  research  on  media representations, offers a multidisciplinary analysis into a reality  representation disparity. There are, of course, some reasons I think this  particular disparity is worth harboring some concern about. As discussed  throughout  this  book,  Internet  users  are  often  demonized  on  screen.  Off screen, while netgeeks may have an easier time than in generations  past, there still exists a news media that is quick to spotlight the Internet  use of suspects; to repeat the idea that people who game or date a lot  online are more worthy of suspicion and scorn than everyone else. Ours  is a culture that likes to frame gamers, netporn aided–masturbators, and  online soulmate searchers as somehow less than normal and more than  creepy, without any evidence other than well-established biases against  technology, against sexuality, against change. This is unhelpful, inaccurate,  and thoroughly disparaging.  Cyberbullies, Cyberactivists, Cyberpredators is a continuation of my work  on representations of gender, sexuality, and deviancy on screen. My work  aims  to  examine—and  illuminate—the  curious  relationship  that  exists  between reality and its portrayal and to examine the hows and whys of  this strange and often entertaining dance.   notes  Introduction  1.

In  the  “Physical  Education”  episode  of  the  sitcom  Community   2009–2015 , the geek character Abed  Danny Pudi  remarks to his classmates,  “Like the movie Can’t Buy Me Love [1987], you’re going to change me from zero  to hero, geek to chic,” in response to their efforts to make him appear less geeky  in front of a possible love interest. In both Community and Can’t Buy Me Love,  reference is made to male makeovers. Communications scholar Patrice Oppliger  also discussed these “boy makeovers”  Patrice A.

Howard’s garish look is actually shared by the FBI computer geek Kevin    Nicholas Brendon  in the crime-drama Criminal Minds  2005– .  21.  The connection between nerds and bad health is often made on screen. In  the romantic-comedy Sleepless in Seattle  1993 , for example, nerdish Walter  Bill  Pullman  has a barrage of allergies. In the hacker-drama Antitrust  2001 , it is  noted that Milo is allergic to sesame seeds. In the “Kid Charlemagne” episode of  the sitcom Betas  2013–2014 , the nerd Nash  Karan Soni  is revealed to be, like  Leonard in The Big Bang Theory, lactose intolerant. In the animated film Jimmy  Neutron: Boy Genius  2001 , the title character has a geeky friend with allergies  named Carl Wheezer. In the romantic-comedy Sydney White  2007 , the nerd  Lenny  Jack Carpenter  admitted to a deluge of allergies including, “dairy, wheat,  peanuts, bee stings, cats . . . shellfish, pollen, wood.” In Friends  1994–2004 , the  scientist Ross  David Schwimmer  is the geekiest of the cast and also noted as  being allergic to kiwi fruit, peanuts, and lobster. In the pilot of the comedy series  Dweebs  1995 , the computer programmer Morley  David Kaufman  claimed to  be allergic to the carpet: “Every part of my body is breaking out, swelling up or  oozing,” he explained. In the same episode, the nerd working at the computer  store  Andy Berman  repeatedly used an asthma inhaler. Maurice  Richard Ayo- ade  is also asthmatic in The IT Crowd  2006–2013 , as too is nerdy Shane  Aus- tin Williams  in the long-running soap opera One Life to Live  1968– . Another  way  the  poor  health  of  the  nerd  is  highlighted  is  via  disability.  Artie   Kevin  McHale  in Glee  2009–2015  and Gorge  Ramsey Moore  in Gamer  2009  are    290   n O T E S  two examples of netgeeks in wheelchairs. The wheelchair, in fact, was construed  as an essential prop in the netgeek uniform in Cyberstalker  2012  and the thriller  Dot.Kill  2005  where villains went in disguise as nerds.  22.

Arguably the nerds who achieve success while staying true to their nerdi- ness are actually not a completely new presentation. Film theorist Timothy Shary,  for example, highlighted that this in fact was part of the plot for Revenge of the  Nerds  1984 : “The nerd transformation that is common to virtually all other  such  depictions  is  thus  somewhat  challenged,  because  the  characters  achieve  pleasure, power, and popularity without shedding their nerdy images.”  Timothy  Shary, Generation Multiplex: The Image of Youth in American Cinema after 1980  [Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 2014], 38 .  26.

This, of course, is not a new thing in fashion. The comedy Zoolander   2001 , in fact, poked fun at this idea with the “derelicte” fashion range, which  was a celebration of the “style” of homelessness. This mirrors real-life fashion  trends such as the “heroin chic” look of the 1990s, whereby visual elements of a  group of frequently stigmatized people was reappropriated into a catwalk trend. 31.

Such a situation, presumably, means that filmmakers aren’t beholden to  an “accurate” or “faithful” portrayal of the syndrome, and thus can pick and  choose which aspects they exploit for humor.

Excessive computer use is also demonized in the opening of the sci-fi film  Surrogates  2009 , when the narrator proclaims, “We’re not meant to experience  the world through a machine.” A theme of the film is that excessive use of tech- nology makes people less human and not more.  86.

The idea of the nerd being called out for being unmanly transpired in  the pilot of The IT Crowd when Roy  Chris O’Dowd  and Maurice  Richard  Ayoade   decided  to  divulge  to  their  boss   Chris  Morris   that  Jen   Katherine  Parkinson  knew nothing about computers. Jen accused them of being “like a  pair of horrible old women.”  91.  Jennifer S.

As literary theorist Maria Nikolajeva explained: “Masculine space is fre- quently perceived as being outdoors while feminine space is indoors; masculine  space is open while feminine space is closed . . . masculine field of activity is  away from home, while feminine sphere is home; masculine concern is to con- quer nature, while feminine concern is to ‘understand’ and be one with nature.  Male characters perceive home as restrictive while female characters perceive it as  secure and protective”  Maria Nikolajeva, Power, Voice and Subjectivity in Litera- ture for Young Readers [New York: Routledge, 2010], 132 .  94.  This  expression  comes  from  the  sociologist  R.  W.  Connell  who  used  the item to describe the attributes of masculinity most highly prized in modern  Western  culture   R.  W.  Connell,  Masculinities  [Berkeley,  CA:  University  of  California Press, 1995] .  95.  The Big Bang Theory  2007–  and The IT Crowd  2006–2013  both offer  examples of netgeek characters actually becoming feminine. In the “The Decep- tion Verification” episode of The Big Bang Theory, for example, Howard absorbed  some of the estrogen in the cream he had been applying to his mother’s skin  and  went  on  a  hormonal  rollercoaster  ride  of  weight  gain,  breast  tenderness,  and moodiness. In the “Aunt Irma Visits” episode of The IT Crowd, Maurice   Richard Ayoade  and Roy  Chris O’Dowd  somehow got on Jen’s  Katherine  Parkinson  menstrual cycle: like Howard, the men experienced a variety of symp- toms including weight gain, breast tenderness, and moodiness. While in both  examples,  the  scenes  are  comic,  they  are  also  open  to  interpretation  as  being  centered on the susceptibility of male netgeeks to extreme emasculation.  96.

While the beards of computer users discussed in this chapter often work  to amplify unkemptness, another interpretation references virility: that facial hair  growth is a way for a man emasculated by his computing to reassert his gender. 13.  Emotional work is “the social interaction work required to produce positive  or negative emotional states in others such as fear, gratitude, happiness and plea- sure”  Niall Hanlon, Masculinities, Care and Equality: Identity and Nurture in Men’s  Lives [New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012], 32 . While both sexes participate  in this, it is something disproportionately associated with women and something  encapsulated  in  psychologist  Carol  Gilligan’s  work  on  the  ethics  of  care   Carol  Gilligan, In a Different Voice [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1982] .  14.  While the neckbeard themes discussed in this chapter are ones largely  associated with men on the screen, such civilizing—or, more specifically, femi- nizing—is directed toward a female character in The Big Bang Theory. Sheldon’s   Jim  Parsons   girlfriend,  Amy   Mayim  Bialik ,  is  a  dowdy  nerd,  depicted  in  frumpish attire, and is generally presented as not stereotypically attractive; as she  reveals in the “The Santa Simulation” episode, “In college, I passed out at a frat  party and woke up with more clothes on.” Penny  Kaley Cuoco  is a feminizing  influence on Amy: In several episodes Penny educates Amy in the ways of hege- monic femininity, such as nail painting, heels, and make-up.  15.

As psychologist Bruce Evan Blaine noted, “femininity is associated with  sociability and nurturance”  Bruce Evan Blaine, Understanding the Psychology of  Diversity [Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2013], 114 . A similar point  is made by psychologists Stephanie Goodwin and Susan Fiske who note that  women  are  stereotyped  as  “more  communal  caring,  emotionally  expressive,  and responsive to others”  Stephanie A. Goodwin and Susan T. Fiske, “Power  and  Gender:  The  Double-Edged  Sword  of  Ambivalence,”  in  Handbook  of  the  Psychology  of Women  and  Gender,  ed.  Rhoda  K.

In the “Internet Troll” episode of the sitcom Maron  2013– , a live-action  Comic Book Guy  Dominic Burgess  is the proprietor of a comic store: He is  overweight, bearded, and sarcastic.  19.  As  sociologists  Holin  Lin  and  Chuen-Tsai  Sun  explain,  “a  griefer  behaves in a disruptive or distressful manner so as to negatively affect other  players’ gaming experiences for the sole purpose of deriving enjoyment from  their behavior”  Holin Lin and Chuen-Tsai Sun, “‘White-Eyed’ and ‘Griefer’  Player  Culture:  Deviance  Construction  in  MMORPGs,”  in  Worlds  in  Play:  International Perspectives on Digital Games Research, eds.

Gaming addiction leading to disastrous consequences is also referenced  in the drama  Men, Women  &  Children  2014  when Internet safety crusader,  Patricia   Jennifer  Garner ,  claims,  “A  couple  in  China  played  Guild Wars  so  much they neglected their baby and it died of dehydration.”  21.

This is an interesting contrast to the presentation of the Steve Wozniak  character  in  Pirates  of  Silicon Valley   1999 :  While  Steve   Joey  Slotnick   was  bearded  he  was  presented  as  slender  compared  to  the  same  character  in  Jobs   2013 .  24.  The same themes are identifiable in the Uruguayan drama Gigante  Giant    2009 , whereby an overweight supermarket security guard  Horacio Camandule   becomes obsessed with a female janitor, watching her via CCTV. The same narrative  is also identifiable in the comedy Paul Blart: Mall Cop  2009 : The title character   Kevin James  is an overweight mall security guard who uses surveillance cameras to  keep an eye on mall worker Amy  Jayma Mays .  25.

During  the  episode,  the  murderer,  Kurtis  Kevin Christy , created a composite photo of an attractive man that he  used to lure a woman via a location-based dating app called “Date or Hate?”  During  Kurtis’s  interview,  he  explained  his  motives  to  Agent  Booth   David  Boreanaz  for running the victim down:  Kurtis:    Booth:    Kurtis:     She said she wanted a funny, smart, successfully guy. That’s me. I  just wanted a chance.  Really. And you thought she’d overlook the fake photo that you put  in there too, huh?  All these beautiful women on my service, but none of them will  look at me. I’m better than half the losers that sign up.  The same thing, in fact, transpired in the “Juliet Takes a Luvvah” episode of the  comedy-crime series Psych  2006–2014 . The murderer, Mike  Ethan Sandler — a man who had created a fake profile online to lure women—explained once  caught, “I created him. To prove a point . . . to all you women. Because you  lie. Yeah, you say you want the nice guy. You say you want the good guy, but  then . . . Ha ha ha! You’re all so shallow. And I just proved it.”  47.

As social researchers Peter Naccarato and Kathleen Lebesco identify, the  Internet has created a democratization of opinion, particularly in the world of  restaurant reviews: “There has been a crucial shift across the culinary landscape  in how such status, credibility, and authority are acquired that is characterized  by  claims  of  democratization  like  those  espoused  by  online  restaurant  review  sites.  Now  that  laypeople  have  become  accustomed  to  being  asked  for  their  opinions . . . the surge of amateur criticism on the Internet makes elite differen- tiation seem quaint.”  Peter Naccarato and Kathleen Lebesco, Culinary Capital  [New York: Berg, 2012] , e-book.  50.

Even as early as 1997, the use of the Internet to sexualize and objectify  women was evident in the “The Kiss” episode of Ally McBeal  1997–2002 . In  one scene a television executive  David Spielberg  explained his decision to fire  an older female news anchor: “Unfortunately there was not enough buzz on the  Internet about wanting to see her naked.”  71.  While most trolling on screen involves men, the British miniseries Killer  Net  1998  provides an example of female trolling. The female character, Charlie   Kathy Brolly , “flames” Scott  Tam Miller  by posting messages online about  the  small  size of his penis.  72.

The British film Tormented  2009  and the American film Unfriended   2014 ,  present  variations  on  the  Internet-as-supernatural  theme;  in  both  examples,  dead  victims  of  cyberbullying  use  the  Internet  to  haunt  their  perpetrators.  3.

While not specifically connected to cyberbullying, an Internet-themed  suicide attempt transpired in the drama Men, Women & Children  2014 . Erro- neously thinking that Brandy  Kaitlyn Dever  had broken up with him via text  message, Tim  Ansel Elgort  attempted suicide.      n O T E S    307    6.  While in these examples cyberbullying led to suicide, another kind of  negative consequence transpired in the “Meme Is Murder” episode of the crime- drama Castle  2009– , when a murderer is exposed as a former teen cyberbully- ing victim. Something similar played out in the “Elephant’s Memory” episode  of crime-drama Criminal Minds  2005–  when a former cyberbullied teen seeks  revenge as an adult.    7.  This point was made in a heavy-handed way in the television holiday  film A Snow Globe Christmas  2013  where, within the perfect world of the snow  globe, the Internet had not been invented.    8.

It should be noted that physical intimidation by girls does happen, for  example, in the animated series The Simpsons  1989– , the schoolgirl character  Francine  Rhenquist  physically  bullied  Lisa  throughout  the  “Bye  Bye  Nerdie”  episode. This, however, is a good example of female physical bullying presented  as funny; a topic that cultural theorist Patrice Oppliger discussed: “In the world  of television, girl bullies are more likely to appear in comedies than dramas, spe- cifically young girls who are bigger and physically more mature than their male  peers”  Patrice A.

It is worth noting that Ezra Klein’s relationship difficulties could be part  of the explanation for why he hacks—as a way to reassert masculinity—and to  compensate for deficits in his life.    90.

Child  porn  more  broadly—exchanged  using  dark  Web  channels  rather  than Google-able sites—transpires in many screen examples including the “Duty  Bound” episode of The Practice, the “Fire in the Hole” episode of The Shield  2002– 2008 , the “Web,” “Wednesday’s Child,” “Friending Emily,” “Downloaded Child”       n O T E S    323  and “Chicago Crossover” episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, the “Devi- ant” episode of CSI: Miami  2002–2012 , the “Sweet and Vaded” episode of Sons  of Anarchy  2008–2014 , the “A Shade of Gray” episode of Criminal Minds and the  pilot of Mr. Robot  2015– .  12.  A variant of this occurs in the drama Men, Women & Children  2014   when Don  Adam Sandler  sat down at his 15-year-old son’s computer and  discovered that his son had been accessing porn. Via voiceover it is revealed,  “Don  had  purchased  the  computer  for  his  son’s  birthday.  It  was  meant  for  homework.” The idea here, is that the very computer that Don had bought  his son had also exposed him to the world of pornography  and also sexual  dysfunction .  13.  Kendall R.

It is interesting to note that in the famous virtual reality sex scene in the  sci-fi film The Lawnmower Man  1992 , it is a literal web that Marnie  Jenny  Wright  gets caught in, enabling Jobe  Jeff Fahey  to rape her.  21.  A variant of this transpired in the sci-fi film Ex Machina  2015  where  every cell phone was hacked and recorded to create a repository of facial expres- sions for artificial intelligence technology. In the musical Annie  2014 , every cell  phone in New York was hacked to track the whereabouts of the titular character   Quvenzhané Wallis .  22.  A  variant  on  the  figure-from-the-Internet   in  the   Christian-drama The Saber  2007 . Cameron  Zac Klammer  logged on to the  Internet and a female holographic figure appeared by his side and said, “I noticed  you among the young men, so I came out to meet you.” The figure in The Saber  exists to represent the danger of netporn temptation.  idea  transpires   23.

A similar thing transpires in the “C Is for Curiouser & Curiouser” epi- sode of the sitcom A to Z  2014–  when Stephie  Lenora Crichlow  reviews her  online matches “wanker, wanker, oh, actual wanker.” The dismissal of profiles  in this way also happens in the comedy-drama Burn after Reading  2008 , when  Linda  Frances McDormand  shows her colleague Chad  Brad Pitt  her BeWith- MeDC.com matches: “Loser.

This “only game in town” idea  was well illustrated in an unnamed episode of the lesbian-themed Scottish series  Lip Service  2010–2012 : Frankie  Ruta Gedmintas  suggested online dating to  Tess  Fiona Button , Tess declined, and Frankie remarked, “What’s the alterna- tive?” Frankie’s comment implies that nowadays online dating is the default way  to find companionship.  43.  Sociologist Brooke Harrington’s anthology traces such deception back to  Ancient times  Brooke Harrington, Deception: From Ancient Empires to Internet  Dating [Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2009] .  44.  This same idea was referenced in an  unnamed episode of the lesbian- themed Scottish series Lip Service  2010–2012  when Tess  Fiona Button —who  had just started online dating—remarked, “You should look at some of these  girls. Most of them are just desperate hets after a free lezzie floorshow.” One date  that Tess goes on actually does end up in her inadvertently performing in a “free  lezzie floorshow” when it turns out that her date had a husband who wanted to  watch.  45.

In the drama In Search of a Midnight Kiss  2007 , Vivian  Sara Simmonds   responded to Wilson’s  Scoot McNairy  online ad. She then described herself to  him: “I’m three hundred pounds, I’m into bondage and I like Hello Kitty.” Viv- ian was kidding, but she nevertheless described what she assumed—and what is  popularly assumed—to be the typical man’s online bogeyman. Something similar  occurred in Must Love Dogs  2005 : Sarah  Diana Lane  had advertised herself  as voluptuous and one of her matches left her a message asking, “What do you  mean by voluptuous? Do you mean big breasts or do you mean fat?” Fat, of  course, would have, presumably, been abhorrent. The same theme is apparent in  a conversation between friends Adam  C. Thomas Howell  and Ray  Sam Ball   in the thriller Net Games  2003 . Ray provides information to Adam about a  sex chat site. Adam sarcastically comments, “Hot chicks? Yeah, I’m sure they’re  all Playboy centerfolds with lesbian nymphomaniac tendencies, right?” to which  Ray replies, “Well, not all of them, no. I will admit that some of them might be  porkers.”  54.  Tammy  Bennett,  Guys,  Dating,  and  Sex:  The  Girls’  Guide  to  Relation- ships  Grand Rapids, MI: Revell, 2005 ; Jon Rubin, Bars Suck!

Worth noting, while this section has explored female webcam performers,  it is also worth briefly acknowledging the existence of male performers, too. In  the “P911” episode of Criminal Minds  2005– , the teen Kevin  Daryl Sabara   performed on a webcam site. This also transpired in the “Web” episode of Law &  Order: Special Victims Unit  1999–  and was a subplot in Disconnect  2012 , where  male and female teens produced erotic webcam content. While voyeurism is, of  course, a theme in these examples, they also allude to the perversion of pedophilia.   334   n O T E S  59.

In  the  “Cyber-Lebrity”  episode  of  CSI:  Miami   2002– 2012 , for example, teenager Miranda  Brianne Davis  murders her swim team  colleague Candace  Jessy Schram  because she was jealous of the online attention  she was getting. After getting arrested, Miranda enjoys her newfound fame as an  Internet celebrity. The dream of fame coming from a video going viral is part of  the motivation for the assault that transpires in the television movie Girl Fight   2011   discussed in Chapter 4 .  75.

Worth noting, the fact that girls who use webcams for chatting become  the  victims  of  awful  crimes  in  a  range  of  narratives—for  example,  Megan  Is  Missing   2011   and  Smiley   2012 —can  be  construed  as  an  extension  of  this  theme where women are punished for using a webcam and, seemingly, for tempt- ing men by exhibiting their sexuality.  81.

Just as the Internet provides a means to cater to, as well as connect people  with outlier sexual interests, it also provides a marketplace. Discussed in the con- text of Men, Women & Children, for example, Don was able to purchase time with  an escort via the Internet, customizing to the extent of being able to select her  quantity of pubic hair. The British thriller Birthday Girl  2001  provides another  example of this: Lonely John  Ben Chaplin  went online to acquire the modern day  equivalent of a mail-order bride. The same thing happened in the television drama  The Bride He Bought Online  2015 . Another illustration of the Internet-based sex  economy transpires in the pilot episode of the sitcom Betas  2013–  in the context  of sex toy acquisition: In one scene Hobbes  Jon Daly  asks a colleague—while  typing away at his laptop—“Have you seen those robotic vaginas? Well, you will  in three to five business days, because I ordered one.”  100.  Hannu Eerikäinen, “Cybersex: A Desire for Disembodiment.

Sam  Inkinen   Berlin:  Walter de Gruyter and Company, 1998 : 203–242, 234.  101.  Outside  of  virtual  reality,  such  ideas  play  out  in  the  artificial  intelli- gence-themed  sci-fi  narrative  Ex  Machina   2015 :  Large  amounts  of  data  on  Caleb’s  Domhnall Gleeson  netporn consumption were collated to help tailor a  convincing artificial intelligence subject to meet his fantasies.  102.  Lauren  Rosewarne,  Masturbation  in  Pop  Culture:  Screen,  Society,  Self    Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2014 .  103.  While  not  sex-themed,  the  idea  of  the  Internet  enabling  a  character  to overcome the physical constraints of their body transpired in the “Cain and  Gabriel” episode of the television series Intelligence  2014 . Despite the fact that  Jonathan Cain  Alan Ruck  was a housebound quadriplegic, he was—through  use of the Internet—able to orchestrate elaborate acts of bioterrorism from his  home.  104.

Interestingly, while Jamie used the technology for a very brief exchange  with tennis player Andre Agassi, ultimately she used it to hear her husband tell  her—repeatedly—that he was wrong and she was right, providing a very gen- dered  presentation  of  how  virtual  reality  technology  is  used  in  practice,  with  women, apparently, choosing to nag over have sex.  118.
