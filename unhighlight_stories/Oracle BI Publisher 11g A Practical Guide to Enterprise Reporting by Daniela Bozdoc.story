Technology development has radically changed the enterprise's way of doing  business. First, daily tasks such as sales, client, and vendor management became  computerized, and now all the resources are managed by enterprise applications.   But this type of daily task support proved not to be enough for the business   process, especially in the case of big organizations, which ended up with all   kinds of applications, according to their vast field of activities. At some point they  realized the need for some unified point of view. The choice was between replacing  some applications and providing an integration process tool. Thus, Business  Intelligence  BI  appeared in the scene. BI uses many types of data input, it doesn't  take any note  if not necessary  of department, organization, or specific activities,  and provides a unique answer for the corporate level.  Business Intelligence, in this way has become essential in most organizations. The  goal in the near future is to support more effective business processes. Initially, it  was used only for analysis and predictions based on the historical data; however,  the new tendency of BI is to be actively involved in the business process. Integration  seems to be the key to exploring the business possibilities, and providing the right  tools seems to be the necessary step for an advanced business management.  In response to fast-growing demands, software development companies have   come up with complex solutions, which can be used to plan, manage, and analyze   a company's resources.   Preface  Somewhere in between, or being an active part for both the business process   and software development, is the IT consultant. He has to stay in touch with the  latest technologies, business solutions, and tools. He is an important factor when   it comes to advising a company to adopt a new technology, a new tool, or a new  vision concerning the IT field. There are two main categories of IT professionals  involved in the process of providing these tools—the software developers and the  report developers.  Having in mind the report developer's point of view, I will go through explaining  the Business Intelligence concept—definition and process, Oracle BI, and finally an  important component of Oracle BI—the Oracle BI Publisher—the document factory  from Oracle.  What is Business Intelligence? Business Intelligence  BI  is the process of transforming data gathered from all the  business data sources into decision support business information. Most companies  gather data from their business activity, even using ERP and legacy applications with  different databases. The amount of data input depends on the software tools used.  Data characteristics depend on the company's structure, such as departments or  activity profile. At this point, the complex process of data processing and formatting,  which is necessary to generate even a simple report becomes visible. The need for a  tool to process the amount of data gathered becomes visible, as well.  Premises The first thing that makes you think about a BI solution is the lack of information  needed for the good course of the business process. Answers to questions such as  these are very important:    	 Which are my best suppliers?  	 How much will it cost to start a new product's production?  	 Where does all the money go?  The very first technical request to be accomplished is the data input quality. You  won't have a good result if you have nothing to start with.  Another factor to be considered is the cost of a BI software implementation.   This could be an expensive investment both from the perspective of time and  financial resources.  [ 2 ]   BI software application functions For a software application to work as a BI solution, it has to provide tools for   the following:  Preface   	 Data mining  	 OLAP  Online Analytical Processing   	 ETL  extract, transform, load   	 Predictive analytics  	 Business performance management  	 Reporting  The reporting tool has to be flexible enough to allow the creation of reports, charts,  or dashboards along with running and scheduling them at different access levels. It  has to allow reports viewing, printing, and saving in many formats. Integration with  other products like Microsoft Office is also important.  How it works For a better understanding of how the described tools work together, take a look at  the following figure:  DB  Extract  L o a d  ERP  Files  Transform  Data Warehouse  OLAP  Scorecard and strategy management  Alerts  m inin g  a ta  D  Reporting  Map based visualizations  Docs  Reports  As you can see, the process begins with the corresponding data of the business.  There are a lot of data sources types, such as databases and operational applications,  and local data sources such as spreadsheets and XML files.  [ 3 ]   Preface  An ETL  or ELT, if you focus on Oracle Data Integrator  tool will perform the   BI data integration process. In this way, the Data becomes accessible to the   BI solution's end user.  The data warehouse is the central point of the BI solution. This contains structured  data–detailed and consistent–for query analysis, and provides support for all BI  operations from data mining to reporting. Unlike the Online Transaction Processing   OLTP  databases, data warehouses have a very different design to support a  large amount of data  which does not need validation in this case , only a small  number of users, and at the same time a particular access to the data depending on  the particular queries that have to be processed. The historical data coming from  business transaction processes is stored using a structure based on business entities,  such as customer, product, and time.  The result of the business intelligence process is also visible through dashboards,  analysis, reports, alerts, scorecards, and all these being available in a variety of  designs and formats according to the end user requests.  Business Intelligence software As an introduction to the BI software world, here is a list of suggestions of actual  software offers available in the market:   	 Oracle BI  	 SAP Business Objects  	 Microsoft BI IBM  	  	 SAS  	 Microstrategy  	 Actuate 7 JasperSoft  	  	 Olik View  Oracle Business Intelligence Among the leading industry of BI software, Oracle's solution was designed to  address the entire spectrum of analytical requirements facing businesses including  information access, analysis and reporting, and data integration and management.  [ 4 ]   Preface  Oracle's offer could be divided into two main categories of software:   	 Oracle BI Tools and Technologies: It includes Oracle BI Foundation Suite,   Oracle BI Enterprise Edition, Oracle Essbase, Oracle BI Publisher, Oracle  Scorecard and Strategy Management, Oracle BI Standard Edition One, and  Oracle Real-Time Decisions.   	 Oracle BI Applications: These are built on OBIEE platform. Oracle BI   Applications also include CRM Analytics and ERP Analytics applications.  These solutions, being smart, agile, and aligned, will provide support for  companies to achieve management excellence.  Oracle has also acquired Hyperion to expand their BI solution. The company claimed  to be a leader in Enterprise Performance Management, by unifying Performance  Management and BI solutions. It will support a broad range of strategic, financial,  and operational management processes.  In the following sections, we will see how the Oracle BI solution maps to the  Business Intelligence concept, including a short introduction to some Oracle BI  components.  Oracle Data sources This refers to all data coming from sources interacting with the Oracle Business  Intelligence server. Oracle BI supports Oracle Database, Oracle E-Business Suite  and other Oracle based sources, IMB DB2 Database, Microsoft SQL Server, SAP  NetWeaver BI, Microsoft Excel, flat files, ODBC sources, and XML data sources.  Oracle Data Integrator Data integration products are used to improve the speed of handling data, to reduce  business process execution times, and to reduce development costs. Oracle Data  Integrator combines all the elements of data integration to provide timely, accurate,  and consistent information, which are as follows:   	 Real-time and bulk data movement  	 Transformation  	 Synchronization  	 Data quality  	 Data management  	 Data service   [ 5 ]   Preface  Oracle BI Interactive Dashboards Oracle Dashboards are in fact customized points of access for analytics information.  According to the user's requests, the personalized information displayed is used  in the decision making process. The resulting Web interface is provided to users  according to their group membership and permissions.  Oracle BI Server This is the OLAP server. The Oracle BI server collects and aggregates information  from all, even disparate data sources. It provides services to the other components,  and processes the request, forming queries, and sending these queries to the  underlying data source for processing. A very important factor in this case is the  time of response, for the user to access immediately the answer to complex business  questions, to be able to simulate various complex business scenarios   Oracle BI server is the heart that drives all the other components.  Oracle BI Answers Providing queries for the BI server, BI Answers is an ad hoc query and analysis tool.  The web environment used is the gate to interactive charts, pivot tables, reports,  and dashboards for the user. The user can save, modify, or format his view of  information through the BI Answers tool.  Oracle BI Delivers Based on analytics results, BI Delivers creates alerts. Specified results can be  detected within reports and the triggered alerts can be sent via multiple channels  including e-mail, dashboards, and mobile devices. The notified dashboards can   again trigger other alerts, resulting in a very close monitoring device for the   business process.  Alerts are being sent to users based on a subscribing service.  Oracle Scorecard and Strategy Management This tool provides the ability to set a goal at the management level, to trace, and  to apply all related activities involved in reaching the objective. The performance  is monitored through Key Performance Indicators  KPI  , and many visualization  types like KPI watch lists, maps, strategy trees, and diagrams are provided.  [ 6 ]   Preface  Oracle BI Publisher Oracle BI Publisher  formerly known as XML Publisher  is a reporting engine based  on a very versatile open source language : XML. It can access relational, OLAP, and  other data sources; in fact any data sources mapped to Oracle BI server.   It enables the creation, management, and delivery of all kinds of operational reports,  financial reports, and any other customer-facing documents.  The result, consisting of high fidelity and highly formatted documents is delivered in  a wide diversity of formats, such as: PDF, Excel, RTF, HTML, and electronic transfer  documents. The results can be viewed online, saved for further processing, can be  e-mailed, can be sent over FTP or scheduled for a delivery by, and for, a wide range  of users and destinations.  However, the most important feature of Oracle BI Publisher is the fact that the report  developer  not necessarily the software developer  is able to choose data sources and  design the necessary reports.  The result types a user can get from Oracle BI are:  Interactive dashboard: Provides with security, driven navigation   	  	 Ad hoc analysis and interactive reporting: Provides with metrics, hierarchies,   and calculations   	 Enterprise reporting: It is provided by BI Publisher  	 Proactive detection and alert: The alert engine can trigger workflows based  on business events and notify stakeholders via their preferred medium or  channel, such as: on the cell phone, via e-mail, a PDF file, or an Excel file   	 Actionable Intelligence: The business process can be invoked from within the   BI platform   	 Microsoft Office integration: Information can be passed from Oracle BI to   Microsoft Office documents such as Excel, Word, or Power Point   	 Spatial Intelligence: It is provided via map-based visualization  	 Scorecard and strategy management: Communicates strategic goals across   the organization and monitors the process over time   	 Server based query, reporting, and analysis: Provided by Oracle BI Server,   which generates a query optimized from each data source, aggregates them,  and presents the result.  [ 7 ]   Preface  What this book covers This book introduces Oracle Business Intelligence Publisher 11g, providing a suite  of examples to help illustrate its main functionalities.

[ 11 ]    What's New in Oracle BI  Publisher 11g?  Oracle BI Publisher  formerly known as Oracle XML Publisher  is Oracle's reporting  XML-based technology, which generates highly formatted data output using  multiple data sources. It was originally developed to solve the reporting problems  faced by Oracle Applications, released as a standalone version, and finally it also  became a part of the Oracle BI Enterprise Edition as Oracle BI Publisher. Starting  with the 11g version, Oracle BI Publisher was completely redesigned to incorporate  new functionalities. In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:   	 A comparison with 10g  	 Getting started with Oracle BI Publisher 11g  	 Backward compatibility of BI Publisher 11g with BI Publisher 10g reports  A comparison with 10g The new 11g release of Oracle BI Publisher introduces some new features highly  anticipated and desired by both reports' developers and the reports' end users.   Let's take a look at the major improvements brought about with the new release.  Building a Data Model In the 10g release, for a data definition you had to create an XML configuration file  containing both data sources definition and XML structure definition.

With the new release of BI Publisher, you don't need to see and edit XML templates  anymore. The new web-based user interface makes it all visual. The Data Model  Editor provides tools to build queries, define the data structure, and create formulae  from different data sources, as you can see in the following screenshot:  [ 15 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  Another advantage of the Data Model is that it now has a life of its own. A Data  Model can be saved and, afterwards, used as many times as you like, increasing  reusability and data quality. Compared to 10g, where a Data Model couldn't be  reused, this is a great new feature.  Designing a layout In BI Publisher 10g, the layout template can be designed using external tools such  as: Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Excel, and Adobe Flash. Templates  created using these tools contain embedded fields with properties that determine  how the XML data will be merged into the template. Using a combination of native  Microsoft Word features and BI Publisher command syntax, you can create a report  template that is ready to accept XML data from your system. You have to choose the  desired tool to build the data template according to the design specifications and  final output type.  For example, RTF templates can generate the following output types: PDF, HTML,  RTF, Excel, Power Point, zipped PDF, and MHTML. The following screenshot shows  how you can assign an XML element  this could be a formula or a parameter  to a  report field in the template builder for Word:  [ 16 ]   Chapter 1  Double click on the Text form field to get the Text Form Field Options window and  then click the Add Help Text button to get the Form Field Help Text window. You can load a sample XML and you have tools to support adding tables, pivot  tables, charts, grouping and formatting data, and also to preview the final result.  But with the arrival of BI Publisher 11g, the layout template definition changed  radically—a web-based layout editor was introduced. This can generate pixel  perfect reports, and the most exciting part is that you can interact with data allowing  re-sorting and filtering of existing reports. Clicking on any section of a component  such as Table, Chart, Pivot Table, or Gauge refreshes other linked components in the  report to reflect the selection, without refreshing the whole report or page.  In the following screenshot, you can see the correspondence created between the  right side chart where I have the total revenue divided by quarters, and the left side  chart where revenues for only one quarter is displayed. The link created between  these two entities allows you to interactively change the values from the Quarterly  Sales Revenue by clicking the desired quarter on the Percent %  Revenue by  Quarter chart:  [ 17 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  You can add multiple templates of different types to your report,  whereas with 10g you had to use many reports containing the same  data. Now with 11g you can include many data perspectives in one  report, and have many output types attached to the same report.  The different types of templates are shown in the preceding screenshot.  There are a few more features introduced  improved upon by the BI Publisher 11g  release. These include:  Managing sub-templates For defining a reusable formatting functionality in BI Publisher, a Subtemplate can  be defined in an RTF or an XSL file format. Previously the sub-templates were saved  and called from an external directory; but with the new release, sub-templates are  considered catalog objects and are saved and managed in the catalog.  [ 18 ]   Style templates Also managed in the BI Publisher catalog are the newly introduced Style Templates.  To keep the company identity intact across all company reports, a style template   can be applied to RTF layouts. You can see an example style template in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 1  Zipped PDF The BI Publisher 11g release also introduces a new output type: PDFZ or zipped  PDF. The purpose was to have smaller and more manageable files instead of a   large PDF output file. So when PDF output splitting is enabled for a report, this   file is split into multiple files generated in one zip file. An index file is also created  with from to in it.  [ 19 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  Scheduling a report job Another thing improved from the previous release is the scheduling options. Now  you can schedule multiple outputs for a report with a different layout applied as you  can see in the following screenshot and send each output to a different destination.  Also to define schedule times, there are now more recurrence pattern options:  Getting started with Oracle BI   Publisher 11g  The main components for working with Oracle BI Publisher are:   	 Data query: This engine formats XML data provided by any system that can  generate XML, including web services and any data available through Java  DataBase Connectivity  JDBC .   	 Layout template: This defines the layout format. The layout template can   be designed using Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Excel   standalone version , Adobe Flash  standalone version , and Oracle BI  Publisher's own layout editor.   	 Report definition: This brings together the query and one or more templates,   which you will see in the Layout Options section of this chapter.   	 Report jobs: This means submitting, scheduling, and delivering reports to   multiple destinations.  To start with, let's take a tour through BI Publisher's interface components.  [ 20 ]   BI Publisher homepage Starting on the homepage, it is very easy to see all of the main actions that you can  proceed with. You can create a new:  Chapter 1   	 Report  	 Report Job  	 Data Model  	 Style Template  	 Sub Template   You can also browse the existing ones.  You can access the current running jobs from the Report Jobs  link, and completed jobs from Report Job History.  In this screenshot, the central section shows a list of Recent accessed objects:  [ 21 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  Catalog For browsing existing entities, you must open the Catalog. The Catalog page  contains a tree-like structure of folders of all the elements created in BI Publisher.  It is, in my opinion, a very friendly interface which enables quick access to general  actions  available for any kind of component , such as Delete, Copy, Cut, Rename,  and so on, and also to specific actions. For example, when you look at a report you  can see that a report can be opened, scheduled, and edited, or its submissions tracked  in Jobs or Jobs History lists. Notice the Search bar on the top, where you can search through All entities, or you  can select other categories of entities to search through:  Let's browse the catalog to find and edit an existing Data Model.  [ 22 ]   Chapter 1  Data Model Editor The Data Model Editor provides tools to choose various types of data sources and to  build the desired model and structure of data. For data type sources, you can choose  one or more from: SQL query, MDX query, Oracle BI Analysis, view object, web  service, LDAP query, XML file, Microsoft Excel file, and HTML  XML Feed .  As you can see in the left section of the next screenshot, you can attach the following  to a Data Model:   	 Data Sets: Contains the Data Model query structure  	 Event Triggers: Triggers to be executed before or after the report  	 FlexFields: Oracle EBS Flexfields  	 List of Values: LOV's for parameters  	 Parameters: Report variables, which are requested by the report at runtime  	 Bursting options: Setup of bursting destinations  These options will be addressed in much more detail in Chapter 2, Creating a Data  Model for a Report.  To design your Data Model query structure, the Data Set editor presents three  different approaches:   	 Diagram view: This enables data grouping, entities linking, sorting, and   calculations   	 Structure view: This allows you to assign a name to each XML element that   will be displayed in the final layout, and to assign values in case of NULL  values or to change data types   	 Code view: This provides the XML structure  For example, to create a SQL Data Set, you must choose the Data Source  from all the  options available in the data source list  and provide the SQL query. But we'll go into  more detail with this in Chapter 3, Multiple Data Sources, of this book.  [ 23 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  After creating the Data Model, there is another feature you can take advantage  of, that is, you can generate a sample XML data by accessing the Get XML output  option, which is shown in the preceding screenshot. In this way, you will be able to  take a first look at the generated data, and afterwards test your layout template.  Layout options Once you have built the desired Data Model, you can start building the report. First,  you have to choose the template designer type to use. This is somehow a difficult  task to complete because you have to take the following into consideration:   	 The tools offered by each template designer  depending on the template type   you choose from those specified in the next screenshot    	 The desired output, requested in specifications  As shown in the next screenshot, choosing a template type from the Create Layout  section will trigger BI Publisher's own layout editor. Newly available in the BI  Publisher 11g release, templates can be created, edited, and viewed online. But, you  still have the option to build your template using an external tool. From the Upload  or Generate Layout section, you can access an interface for browsing and uploading  these types of template files:  [ 24 ]   Chapter 1   	 RTF  	 PDF  	 Excel  	 Flash  	 XSL Stylesheets  	  eText  An RTF template can also be simply generated. In this case, BI Publisher  BIP  will  actually create a default layout for you, which includes all the fields specified in   your Data Model:  [ 25 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  Template builder for Word To edit a BIP template using Template Builder for Word, you have the option of  logging into BIP to choose and open the desired template.  Once all modifications are complete, the template can be uploaded back into BIP by  following the menu function Upload Template. The Template Builder will import  your changes back into the BIP report definition.  Using the Template Builder for Word you can build an RTF template as shown in the  following screenshot:     To map the template field to the XML element data field, a placeholder is created. At  runtime the placeholder is replaced by the value of the element with the same name  in the XML data file. A more in-depth description of the methodology will follow  later in the book, in Chapter 6, Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word.  Finally, on opening the created report, BI Publisher immediately displays the results  obtained by applying the attached templates against the chosen Data Model. As   you can see in the next screenshot, for the current report You have five layouts  defined in tabs:  [ 26 ]   Chapter 1   	 Simple  	 Advance Page Totals  	 Batch Manager Salary  	 W-2 2010  Partial   	 Manager Summary  Each tab page contains a report layout, depending on the number of   attached templates:  From here, you can further edit the report or the layout, or export, send, or schedule  the report, but you also have access to an another interesting BI Publisher feature: the  Online Analyzer.  [ 27 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  The Online Analyzer The Online Analyzer enables you to create ad hoc pivot views of your data. In a  pivot table structure, you can drag and drop data elements, which can be afterwards  arranged, filtered, and summarized. You can see in the next screenshot the interface  offered to build a pivot table.  You can save your pivot table as a layout for your report by exporting it and saving  it as a BI Publisher layout. The export command saves the pivot table as the BI  Publisher layout type  .xpt . It will then have all the features and properties of a  BI Publisher layout:  Schedule report job Besides having the report running online, you can also schedule the report. Using  the Schedule Report Job page, you can submit a report job with precise parameters,  define multiple outputs for a scheduled job, and add different delivery destinations.  The BI Publisher interface provides four tabs to input Report Job parameters, as  shown in the next screenshot:   	 On the General tab you have to choose the report name and input   its parameters.   	 On the Output tab you can choose to:  	  Use a bursting definition to determine the output and delivery   destination. This option is available only if the report has a bursting  definition and disables all the other fields on the page.  [ 28 ]   Chapter 1  	  Make the output public. The output will be available to all users with   access to the report. Save the data for republishing, that is, save the XML data.  	   On the same tab, in the output table, you can add multiple outputs, that   is, you have to set output parameters: Name, Layout, Format, Locale,  Timezone, and Calendar. Multiple destinations can also be set for the  report to be delivered to. There are five destination types:  Email Printer Fax FTP  	  	  	  	  	  HTTP   	 On the Schedule tab, schedule times are defined. You can set a combination  of parameters between: Frequency, Every, On, Start, End, Right now, and  On a fixed day.   	 The Notification tab allows you to configure a notification to be sent by   e-mail or HTTP when the report is Completed, is Completed with warnings,  or Failed:  [ 29 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  Bursting options Bursting definitions are defined in the Data Model design interface. Bursting is a process of splitting data into blocks. For each block of the data, a  separate document is generated and delivered to one or more destinations. For the  delivery, based on an element in the Data Model, you can have different templates,  output format, delivery method, or locale. On the Bursting page you have to set a few parameters, as shown in the  next  screenshot:   	 Split by: An element from the Data Set, used to split the data  	 Deliver By: An element from the Data Set, used to format and deliver    	 SQL Query: Provides the required information to format and deliver the   the data  report parameters  [ 30 ]   Chapter 1  Report job history The following is the Report Job History page, which displays information about  running report jobs and completed report jobs. In the first place, this page provides   a filter list to facilitate report job searching. A matching criteria jobs list will be displayed and from the Report Job Histories list  you will be able to do the following:   	 View the status and details of running and completed report jobs. For this   click on the Report Job Name drop-down.  Download or view the report XML data.  Download or view the report document.  Republish the report data.  Delete report jobs from history.   	  	  	  	  [ 31 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  Integrated thin-client report design editor You have a complete set of tools to provide multiple layouts for your data, grouped  into three tabs, as shown in the following screenshot: In the Insert tab, you can choose to insert components such as:   	 Chart  	 Data Table  	 Pivot table  	 Layout grid  	 Gauge  In the Page Layout tab, you can set the page orientation and insert the page footer  or header.  The third tab is contextual and contains characteristics that one can set for the  current selected component. For example, for a text field you can set font  characteristics and alignment.  Data elements available on the left side of the layout editor are added into the  desired structure by simply dragging-and-dropping it into the designated locations.  Notice these very useful hints: Drop Value Here or Drop Label Here:  [ 32 ]   A complete list of properties can be accessed on the left side too, as shown in the next  screenshot. Gauge properties list is shown in this example:  Chapter 1  To complete the new features list, let's see how the Interactive Viewer, which is  the most exciting new feature added in the 11g release works, by making different  components on the report page interact. This is only a short introduction of this  feature, and we'll discuss this in detail in Chapter 5, The New XPT Format.  [ 33 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  In the following screenshot, on the Page Layout tab you have the Configure Events  option, which triggers the Configure Events interface:  As you can see in this screenshot, the Configure Events interface adds layout  components to the Components list  only if they can trigger events  and to the  Targets list  all the components . In the next step, the user creates links between  elements belonging to these two categories using the Events list.  Backward compatibility of BI Publisher  11g with BI Publisher 10g reports Seeing all these new great features, you may be asking how much trouble it would  be to upgrade your work to the BIP 11g release? But once BIP 11g is installed, Oracle provides the upgrade assistant utility to  upgrade the repository and web catalogs.  [ 34 ]   When moving from 10g to 11g, we will have to use the upgrade utility because the  repository structure and the web catalog structure have changed a lot between the  different versions.  Chapter 1  A direct copy and paste into the 11g version will not work,  so the upgrade assistant utility must be used.  Summary Oracle Business Intelligence Publisher 11g proves to be a great reporting solution,  generating any kind of data output you might need. The following are among the  strengths of the new release:  Incorporated layout editor   Incorporated Data Model designer   	 Various data sources types  	  	 Separation of the Data Model from the report layout  	  	 A great variety of output formats  	  	 Multiple possible destinations  	 Report jobs scheduler  	 Report translations support  Interactive viewer  Oracle  database  SQL Server, other databases  HTTP  XML feed   XML file  EBS Oracle,  Custom  Applications  Web Service  MS Excel file  Data Sources  ORACLE BI Publisher  RTF, PDF,  Excel, Flash,  XSL  Stylesheet,  eText  Templates  Zipped PDF  PDF  CSV  RTF  MS Excel  file  XML file  HTML  Fax  Printer  FTP  HTTP  E-mail  Reports  Destinations  Layout Editors Microsoft Word Adobe Acrobat Microsoft Excel Adobe Flash  [ 35 ]   What's New in Oracle BI Publisher 11g?  As the preceding figure reveals, BI Publisher can query or accept data from different  data sources like databases, web services, HTTP feeds, or file data. BI Publisher  structures the input data in an XML-based format, applies a format against it, and  delivers it to the end users.  BI Publisher layout templates can be designed using Microsoft Word, Microsoft  Excel, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash tools or its own layout designer.  It is a tool that can efficiently generate thousands of pre-formatted documents like  invoices, financial statements, sales reports, and so on, per hour with minimal impact  to transactional systems. Reports can be published to different output formats and  delivered in environments like online reports, e-mail, printers, faxes, FTP, and HTTP.  In the next chapter, you'll learn to work with the Data Model Editor to configure and  use multiple data source types for your reports.  [ 36 ]   Creating a Data Model   for a Report  The Data Model is a new concept introduced in BIP 11g. Using the Data Model  Editor, you can choose multiple data sources for your reports. You can also create  and refine elaborate structures of data to extract XML report data from, and attach  report-connected entities as event triggers or parameters.  In this chapter, we will see the components of a Data Model. We will see in detail  how each component is addressed by the BIP Data Model Editor with the help of a  few examples, which will give us a better understanding of the way the Data Model  builder works.  Report Data Model Editor interface To get to the Data Model Editor interface go on the BIP Home page and select  Data Model from the Create section. Alternatively, you can click New on the  Catalog page and select Data Model from the drop-down menu. You'll get the Properties page displayed as shown in the following screenshot. On  this page, you can set multiple report characteristics, such as:   	 Description: This is your Data Model description.  	 Default Data Source: To get access to multiple data sources to design your   report data structure. All the data sources that you want to use must be  configured. You must go to Administration, the link on the upper-right  corner of the screenshot. Data sources configuration and multiple data  sources will be widely discussed in the next chapter.   	 Oracle DB Default Package: This will be the default package to look for the   event triggers.   Creating a Data Model for a Report   	 Backup Data Source: This name can be used if the default data source is   not available.   	 XML output options: There are three options provided. You can select the  most suitable options to fit your work needs. For example, you check only  the Include Parameter Tags option depending upon your needs.   	 XML Tag Display: The possible options are: Upper Case, Lower Case, and   Follow the Data Structure:  On the upper-right corner you may notice a few icons. These are the shortcuts to  manage your Data Model. For example, you can preview the XML data for the Data  Model and save the current Data Model.  Through the interface provided for the XML data preview, the XML data can be  viewed, exported, or saved as sample data. In this case, it will be listed in the Sample  Data section of the interface as shown in the previous screenshot. This is helpful  when designing and testing the layout templates.  The main functionality of the Data Model Editor interface is to provide tools that  help you to build your data structure, aggregate data, customize data, and do  different calculations. This is available in the Data Sets section of the Data Model.  But there are also a few elements required by the report  both at design and at  run time , such as:  [ 38 ]   Chapter 2  Let's go deeper into these components and their functionality.  Data Sets As you can see in the following screenshot, the available data set types are:   	 Event Triggers  	 Flexfields  	 List of Values  LOVs   	 Parameters  	 Bursting options   	 SQL Query  	 MDX Query  	 Oracle BI Analysis  	 View Object  	 Web Service  	 LDAP Query  	 XML file  	 Microsoft Excel File  	 HTTP  XML Feed   To add a particular Data Set to your data structure, containing one of the types  described in the previous screenshot, you first have to provide some parameters,  which depending on the Data Set type, precisely identify your data.  [ 39 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report  Data Set types Let's go through the steps required to add data sets of the most common types:  SQL query To configure a SQL Query Data Set you have to enter the following, which is shown  in the following screenshot:   	 Name: Data set name of your choice  	 Data Source: Choose a data source from the list  data sources added using    	 SQL Query: Within BIP's Data Model Editor, queries may be manually coded   the Administration interface   or created using Query Builder  The Query Builder interface BIP offers you a very powerful tool for building your query.  On the left side of the window, as you can see in the following screenshot, you have  a list of available tables in the mentioned Catalog and Schema of your database. You  can simply click the desired table name and you'll have the table structure shown in  the main section of the Query Builder interface. The four tabs provide different tools  to fine tune your query:  [ 40 ]   Chapter 2   	 Model: To check the fields and create links between the tables. The links   between tables are created by simply dragging and dropping one table field  over another, as shown in the preceding screenshot.  [ 41 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report   	 Conditions: Enables filtering, ordering, sorting, grouping, calculations,   entering field aliases, and so on, which is shown in the preceding screenshot.   	 SQL: All the options entered in the Conditions tab are gathered and as a  result you have this SQL query—the third tab in the preceding screenshot.   	 Results: The actual interrogation of the database is made and the   Results tab displays the selected range of results—the fourth tab in  the previous screenshot.  [ 42 ]   Oracle BI analysis The Oracle BI Presentation catalog is accessed through this type of data source and  you can select an Oracle BI analysis as a data source.  Chapter 2  Integration with Oracle BI must be enabled.  To add the data set type of Oracle BI analysis to your Data Model, you must provide  the following information as shown in the next screenshot:   	 Name: The data set name  	 Oracle BI Analysis: It can be used as the default name, selected from the   Oracle BI presentation catalog   	 Time Out: This is the time period in seconds that BIP waits for the   analysis data and it is optional  XML file In case of an XML file, you must select the XML filename. The next screenshot shows  the information that you must provide:  [ 43 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report Microsoft Excel file To use an Excel file as a data set, you must first name your data. Use the Excel option  Define Name as shown in the following screenshot:  Once this step is completed, the data set can be created. You must provide the  following information as shown in the following screenshot:   	 Table Name specifies the table name used in case of multiple tables per sheet  	 Parameters can be added from the report's list of parameters. Only one value   per parameter is supported  In this way, you will have the desired XLS structure translated into BIP.  [ 44 ]   Chapter 2  Data Structure builder In order to provide an intuitive, well designed Data Model, its structure plays a  very important role.  Improving your Data Model structure will result in easy-to-design and   faster-running reports.  To build a data set's structure, the BIP's model editor offers you multiple views:   	 Diagram view  	 Structure view  	 Code view  Let's now look at each of these in a bit more detail:  Diagram view As the following screenshot shows, the Data Model Editor allows you to:   	 Create links between data from different data sets  	 Create groups that can be used to separate data into sets or to filter data  	 Aggregate data to apply aggregate functions on data elements  	 Perform calculations to compute data values from multiple data elements  [ 45 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report Structure view The Structure view has two models: Table View and Output. While the Output model provides a non-updatable tree-like view of the data  structure, the Table View allows you to update the XML element alias names,  display names, null values, sorting, and reset options. The Table View model is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 46 ]   The Output model is shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  Code view Those familiar with the BIP 10g data template structure may remember that it  includes a data structure section. As you can see in the following screenshot,  the Code view shows a similar structure of elements: a dataStructure element  containing many group and element tags. As data structure can now be considered  an independent entity, we can see in the Code view that no other report-related  entities are included or mentioned in its structure, as was the case for the   data template:  [ 47 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report  The Code view is shown in the following screenshot:  Let's start building a data structure in BIP's Data Model Editor using the previously  described types.  Creating a new Data Model To create a new Data Model do the following:   	  In the Home page choose Data Model to create a new Data Model, as shown  in the following screenshot:  [ 48 ]    	 The Data Model Editor interface opens, starting with the Properties  page. Choose mystore as the Default Data Source, as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 2   	 On the left side of the page, click the Data Sets link. As you can see in   the following screenshot, now you can choose your data set type. Choose  SQL Query:   	 For this data set you have to enter the following details as shown in the    following screenshot:  	  Name: The name of the data set displayed in the Diagram interface 	  Data Source: Choose mystore, as this is the data source created for   these examples, providing access to the Microsoft SQL database  named MYSTORE  Now, let's continue with the Query Builder to build the query structure.  [ 49 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report  Building the query structure To build a query structure follow the steps given here:  1.  Choose the Catalog name  MYSTORE  and the Schema name  dbo . Enter   a Search criteria to narrow your search area and get a smaller list of the  available objects. As the following screenshot shows, on the left we have the filtered list of   available tables:  2.   In the Model tab, check the fields you want for your Data Model as shown in  the preceding screenshot. For example, from the Employee table choose:  First Name  	  No_ 	  	  Middle Name 	  	   Last Name Job Title  3.  Create links between the tables. For example, No_ from the Employee table   has to be linked with the Employee No_ field in the Salary Base table to  obtain the desired result, that is, the employee and its salary in a row, as  shown in the following screenshot.  [ 50 ]   4.  Use the Conditions tab to change Alias column, to sort, group, filter, or   calculate your data:  Chapter 2  You will have your resulting SQL Query in the SQL tab, as you can see in the  following screenshot:  5.  Don't forget to save your query.  [ 51 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report  Data modelling using the Data Model Editor Once the query is built and the data is available for further modelling, there are some  actions that you can perform on this data, which are as follows:  1.  Right-click on the group and choose Add Element by Expressions to create   new calculated elements. If the necessary data is not available, new data fields can be calculated   using data from the existing fields and operators as you can see in the   following screenshot. Add Element by Expressions offers an expression  builder interface and a tool: Validate Expression.  2.  Calculate a new element called NAME by applying the concat function on   the FIRST_NAME and the LAST_NAME fields.  This is the list of all the available functions: MAX, MIN,  ROUND, FLOOR, CEILING, ABS, AVG, LENGTH, SUM,  NVL, CONCAT, STRING, SUBSTRING, INSTR, DATE,  FORMAT_DATE, FORMAT_NUMBER, AND NUMBER.  Another important tool offered is for grouping elements in the same data set  by other elements. Our data set contains the DEPARTMENT_CODE field, which  has the same value for employees from the same department.  [ 52 ]   3.  Choose the Group By menu option as the following screenshot shows, and   you'll have your employees grouped by departments:  Chapter 2  4.  You can create links between two data sets.  Choose the Create Link option and the Create dialog will launch, displaying  available elements to link your current element with. In the following example, the DEPARTMENT CODE column from the ROW  group is linked to the CODE column from the G_2 group:  [ 53 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report  Once a parent-child link is created at the parent level, an aggregate element  data can be created.  5.  Drag the AMOUNT PAID element from the G_2  employees  over   G_1  departments . The element named CS_1 is created, and as you can see  in the following screenshot, you can choose any of the following aggregate  functions to apply:  First Last  	  Count 	  Average 	  	  	  Maximum 	  Minimum Summary 	   6.  Use the Structure view to manage the element's Business View.  [ 54 ]   7.  Change the element's CS_1 Display Name into AMOUNT_PAID, as this will be   the name displayed by the reports using this Data Model, as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 2  Getting XML output To test your data, use the Get XML output option. It will display a page as the  following screenshot shows. On this page, you must select the Number of rows  to return and enter the desired values for parameters. As an example, let's choose 50 rows to return and All as the Department parameter:  Click Run and you will have your data displayed. Now you have the option to save  your data as sample data or to export the XML for later use at the report's layout  template design. Both actions are available by clicking the Option toolbar button.  [ 55 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report  Event triggers Event triggers are the equivalent of Report triggers from the Data Template in BIP  10g. A trigger can be set to fire before or after the completion of the report. This will  call one or more database functions. To get access to these functions, an Oracle DB  Default Package has to be mentioned on the Data Model Properties interface:  As you can see in the preceding screenshot, you can change the default package.  Once the package is set, a list of Available Functions is displayed and you can add  one or more functions to the Event Trigger list using this interface. For example,  salary calculation is too complicated to be included in a report expression, so we can  move it out in a database package.  Flexfields Oracle flexfield is an important feature of the Oracle Applications tool. It is because  of the flexfields that Oracle Applications is so generic in nature and can be used  to suit any industry or organization. Being so important for Oracle Applications,  flexfields also needs to be integrated with BIP.  [ 56 ]   Chapter 2  To add a flexfield to your Data Model, enter the following details as shown in the  preceding screenshot:   	 Name: The name of your flexfield component.  	 Type: Choose a type from Segment Metadata, Select, Where, Order By, and   Filter. Depending on the type you choose, a specific list of more detailed  characteristics appears at the end of the flexfield table.   	 Application Short Name: This can be an abbreviation for the name of the   flexfield, for example, GL. ID Flex code: The code defined in the Register Key flexfield is the code for  this flexfield. ID Flex Number: The name of the source column or parameter that contains  the flexfield structure information.   	   	  List of Values You can add two types of List of Values  LOVs  to a Data Model: SQL Query or  Fixed Data.  [ 57 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report  For the SQL type, as you can see in the following screenshot, you must do   the following:   	 Select a Data Source  	 Check Cache Result if you want your result to be cached for the   current session   	 Enter or build your SQL Query  The other type, Fixed Data requires pairs Label, that is the value to be entered.  [ 58 ]   Parameters The available types of parameters are: Text, Menu, and Date. You can see in the following screenshot that type menu uses the LOV already   defined previously:  Chapter 2  A menu type parameter also needs the following settings:   	 Display Label: The Parameter's description displayed at runtime  	 Options: There are three options provided:  	  Multiple Selection: Allows you to select more than one value from   the list  	  Can select all: Includes an All option in the list and when this value   is selected you can choose to pass null values or all values  	  Refresh other parameters on change: Performs a page refresh, taking   into consideration all the values linked to the current value  [ 59 ]   Creating a Data Model for a Report  Bursting You can use bursting options when you need your reports to be delivered to  different destinations in different formats.  Here are some examples of circumstances in which using bursting would be  a good choice:   	 Generate invoices, delivery based on customer-specific layouts, and    delivery preference   	 Financial reporting, that is, generating a master report of all cost centers and   bursting out individual cost center reports to the appropriate manager   	 Generate pay slips for all the employees based on one extract and deliver    via e-mail  The possible output types are:   	 HTML  	 PDFZ  zipped PDF   	 PDF  	 RTF  	 EXCEL  	 EXCEL2000  	 MHTML  	 PPT  	 PPTX  	 XSLFO  	 XML  	 CSV  	 ETEXT  [ 60 ]   Chapter 2  For a bursting definition, as you can see in the preceding screenshot, you   must provide:   	 Name: Enter a description of your choice  	 Type: The only type available for a bursting definition is SQL Query  	 Data Source: The data source containing delivery information  	 Split By: An element from the data; data set must be ordered or sorted by   this element   	 Deliver By: Defines how delivery data and formats are applied  	 SQL Query: The query containing formatting and delivery details  Summary After completing our walk through the Data Model Editor universe, I hope you  realise what a complex and powerful tool it is. The variety of tools and features  offered allow you to create data structures that enable optimal document generation.  In the next chapter, we will see even more complex Data Model examples using  multiple data sources.  [ 61 ]    Multiple Data Sources  We met the Data Model Editor in the previous chapter. The editor's interface deals  with all the components and functionalities needed for the data model to achieve the  structure you need. However, the main component is Data Set. In BIP, to create your  data model structure you can choose from a variety of data set types:   	 SQL Query  	 MDX Query  	 Oracle BI Analysis  	 View Object  	 Web Service  	 LDAP Query  	 XML file  	 Microsoft Excel file  	 Oracle BI Discoverer  	 HTTP  Taking advantage of this variety requires multiple Data Sources of different types to  be defined in the BIP. In this chapter, we will see:   	 How data sources are configured  	 How the data is retrieved from different data sets  	 How data set type characteristics and the links between elements influence   the data model structure   Multiple Data Sources  Administration Let's first see, how you can verify or configure your data sources. You must choose  the Administration link found in the upper-right corner of any of the BIP interface  pages, as shown in the following screenshot:  The connection to your database can be chosen from the following   connection types:  Java Database Connectivity  JDBC  Java Naming and Directory Interface  JNDI    	  	  	 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  LDAP   	 Online Analytical Processing  OLAP   Available Data Sources To get to your data source, BIP offers two possibilities:  1.  You can use a connection. In order to use a connection, these are the   available connection types:  JDBC 	  JNDI 	  LDAP 	  	  OLAP  2.  You can also use a file.  In the following sections, the Data Source types—JDBC, JNDI, OLAP Connections,  and File—will be explained in detail.  [ 64 ]   JDBC Connection Let's take the first example. To configure a Data Source to use JDBC, from the  Administration page, choose JDBC Connection from the Data Sources types list, as  shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 3  You can see the requested parameters for configuring a JDBC connection in the  following screenshot:   	 Data Source Name: Enter a name of your choice.  	 Driver Type: Choose a type from the list. The relating parameters are: 	  Database Driver Class: A driver, matching your database type. 	  Connection String: Information containing the computer name on  which your database server is running, for example, port, database  name, and so on.   	 Username: Enter a database username.  	 Password: Provide the database user's password.  [ 65 ]   Multiple Data Sources  The Use System User option allows you to use the operating system's credentials  as your credentials. For example, in this case, your MS SQL Database Server uses  Windows authentication as the only authentication method.  When you have a system administrator in-charge of these configurations, all you  have to do is to find which are the available Data Sources and eventually you can  check if the connection works. Click on the Test Connection button at the bottom of  the page to test the connection:  JNDI Connection JNDI Connection pool is in fact another way to access your JDBC Data Sources.  Using a connection pool increases efficiency by maintaining a cache of physical  connections that can be reused, allowing multiple clients to share a small number   of physical connections.  [ 66 ]   In order to configure a Data Source to use JNDI, from the Administration page,  choose JNDI Connection from the Data Sources types list. The following screen  will appear:  Chapter 3  As you can see in the preceding screenshot, on the Add Data Source page you must  enter the following parameters:   	 Data Source Name: Enter a name of your choice  	  JNDI Name: This is the JNDI location for the pool set up in your application  server, for example, jdbc BIP10gSource  The users having roles included in the Allowed Roles list only will be able to create  reports using this Data Source.  OLAP Connection Use the OLAP Connection to connect to OLAP databases. BI Publisher supports the  following OLAP types:   	 Oracle Hyperion Essbase  	 Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services  [ 67 ]   Multiple Data Sources   	 Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services  	 SAP BW  In order to configure a connection to an OLAP database, from the Administration  page, choose OLAP Connection from the Data Sources types list. The following  screen will appear:  On the Add Data Source page, the following parameters must be entered:   	 Data Source Name: Enter a name of your choice  	 OLAP Type: Choose a type from the list  	 Connection String: Depending on the supported OLAP databases, the   connection string format is as follows:  	  Oracle Hyperion Essbase  Format: [server name]  	  Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services  Format: Data Source=[server];Provider=msolap;Initial Catalog=[catalog]  	  Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services  Format: Data Source=[server];Provider=msolap.3;Initial Catalog=[catalog]  	   SAP BW  Format: ASHOST=[server] SYSNR=[system number] CLIENT=[client]  LANG=[language]   	 Username and Password: Used for OLAP database authentication  [ 68 ]   Chapter 3  File Another example of a data source type is File. In order to gain access to XML or  Excel files, you need a File Data Source. In order to set up this kind of Data Source,  only one step is required—enter the path to the Directory in which your files reside.  You can see in the following screenshot that demo files Data Source points to the  default BIP files directory. The file needs to be accessible from the BI Server  not on  your local machine :  Multiple Data Sources Having a large amount of data at your disposal for creating a Data Source  necessitates a great effort in creating a good structure of data with the necessary  relationships between its elements.  Here are some of the tools, provided by BIP 11g Data Model Editor to design links  between elements in your Data Model structure.  Add different types of Data Sets to a   Data Model You will see how the structure of the Data Model changes, after different data  connections  links  are created.  As shown in the following screenshot, the Data Sets added are:   	  	  Independent: An HTTP type Data Set trend: An Oracle BI Analysis type Data Set  [ 69 ]   Multiple Data Sources   	 Sales: A XML file type Data Set  	  	  countries: A Microsoft Excel file type Data Set reader, library, and book: SQL Query type Data Sets  No links between the inserted Data Sets are created at this moment.  From the XML file and HTTP Data Sets, no metadata is  available, hence you cannot create links using these types  of Data Set.  [ 70 ]   In the following screenshot, you can see from the Structure view that there is no  hierarchy in the Data Model:  Chapter 3  [ 71 ]   Multiple Data Sources  Joins between Data Set objects Using the Query Builder, you can create links between table columns as shown in  the following screenshot. This kind of relationship is called a join and specifies how  the rows of one table are combined with the rows of the second table. Columns of a  table, view, or materialized view can be used to create links. Query Builder supports  inner, outer, left, and right joins. You can find a detailed description of these  operations in the Structured Query Language  SQL  documentation:  In the SQL tab of the Query Designer, you can see the SQL syntax generated for the  created links. Three conditions were generated in a where clause. This is shown in  the following screenshot:  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  Links between Data Sets There are two options when creating Data Sets links. You can create element-level  or group-level links.  Element-level links An Element-level link refers to a link created between an element of a Data Set and  an element of another Data Set. In this way, a parent-child relationship is created  between different Data Sets. As the following screenshot shows, by binding the READER_ID column from the  G_Library group and the READER_ID_1 column from the G_Reader group, a link  was created between the two mentioned groups:  You can link different types of Data Sets using element-level links. The procedure  for creating a link has been covered in the previous chapter. For example, as you   can see in the following screenshot, a link between a SQL Query Data Set and a  Microsoft Excel file Data Set was created by dragging the parent field Country from  the G_Reader group over the Code field in the G_Country child group:  [ 73 ]   Multiple Data Sources Group-level links A group-level link also defines a link between two Data Sets to obtain a  hierarchically-structured XML. But in this case, the child group must have the   same Data Set type as the parent group. For example, you cannot create a   group-level link between G_Reader and G_Country  from the preceding  screenshot , as one is a SQL Query Data Source type and the other is an   MS Excel type.  To create a group-level link, go to the group menu  upper-right corner of the group   and choose the Create Group Link option. The following screenshot shows, how  available Child Groups are displayed for selection when a Group link is created:  There is another request for a group-level link to work. You have to define a bind  variable in the child query, as shown in the following screenshot. This variable is  linked to a column from the parent Data Set. Considering G_Book  the child group , you can see that only the Book_ID field  could be used as a link between G_Library and G_Book, as Book_ID is the only  field which is common to both the groups:  [ 74 ]   Chapter 3  Group-level links are provided for backward compatibility  with Data Templates from earlier versions of BIP. However,  element-level links are preferred.  Group-level aggregate elements Once a parent-child link is created between two Data Sets, you can insert values  obtained by applying aggregate functions on the child's elements into the parent data  set. Depending on the element type, different aggregation functions are available.  As you can see in the following screenshot, for a string data type element, you can  choose between the following functions:   	 COUNT  	 FIRST  	 LAST  [ 75 ]   Multiple Data Sources  Global-level functions There is a special group in the Data Model designer: Global Level Functions, and  you can add values to this group, obtained by the aggregation of elements belonging  to any of the available Data Sets. For example, let's add a value called TOTAL_ BOOKS to the Global Level Functions group. To obtain this value, as the following  screenshot reveals, the aggregation function COUNT is used on the BOOK_ID field  from the G_Book group. The same procedure is used to obtain the values: TOTAL_ LOANS, TOTAL_READERS, and TOTAL_COUNTRIES:  [ 76 ]   You can further refine the result and create more complicated expressions, such as  the example shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 3  Parameters In order to add parameters to a data set, parameters must be first declared. For example, let's add a List of Values  LOV  named countries, as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 77 ]   Multiple Data Sources  A parameter named country is defined and it uses the LOV countries, as shown in  the following screenshot:  After a parameter is defined, there are many ways to use it. The advantage is more  accurate and precise data for the reports using the parameterized data model.  SQL Query statements You can use parameters in SQL Query statements. For example, by including the  parameter country, as shown in the following screenshot, the readers list is narrowed  to the readers from a specific country:  [ 78 ]   Group filter expressions Another option is to use parameters in group filter expressions. The result is similar  to the previously described case, with the difference being that a group filter can also  be used for another Data Set type than SQL type; for example, an Oracle BI Analysis  Data Set  G_Trend  can be filtered using a parameter-based filter expression as you  can see in the following screenshot:  Chapter 3  Data Set parameters You can also specify parameters when you create a Data Set. In the following  screenshot, you can see the interface to add parameters to an HTTP Data Set:  [ 79 ]   Multiple Data Sources  The following screenshot shows the interface for a Microsoft Excel file data set type:  Microsoft Excel Data Set types support only one value  per parameter.  As opposed to HTTP and Microsoft Excel Data Set types, for an Oracle BI Analysis  Data Set type, you cannot add parameters, as you can see in the following  screenshot. Parameters and lists of values will be inherited from the BI analysis and  they will show up at runtime:  However, there are a few actions supported by this Data Set type:   	 Global level functions  	 Group filters  	 Setting the value for elements in case of null values  [ 80 ]   Finally, the following screenshot shows, how the Data Model structure changed to  reflect the links between Data Sets and group-level filters:  Chapter 3  There are only a few cases in which Data Models with multiple Data Sources   are recommended:   	 When you need to perform functions not supported by the query type  	 When the Data Model has to support complex views  	 When you want to simulate a view, in case you don't have a view or you   don't want to use one  Otherwise, it is recommended that the number of Data Sets used be reduced. The  reason is that single Data Set models execute faster than multiple Data Set models—in  a parent-child hierarchy the child is executed for each element of the parent. However,  the main advantage of a Data Model based on multiple data sets remains, and thus, a  model offers a more intuitive and simple view of the data structure.  [ 81 ]   Multiple Data Sources  Summary In this chapter, we saw how to use different tools offered by the Data Model Editor  to shape a data structure composed of multiple data sets, into a compact and  organized form.  For reports, the advantage of using a good structured Data Model is easy and also  provides intuitive data access.  Keeping in mind the various aspects related to the Data Model structure we will  proceed with the report layout design in the next chapter.  [ 82 ]   Report Layout Template  When creating a report using Oracle BI Publisher 11g, the report has two main  components—the Data Model and the Layout Template. In this chapter, we will see:   	 How to add a layout to a report  	 Which are the options available when choosing Layout Template types  	 Output types for a report.  Add a Report Layout Template There are a few steps that you need to follow to add a Layout Template:  1.  Save the created Data Model: After creating the Data Model structure for a   report, it should be saved for further use in the report creation phase. As you can see in the following screenshot, a new object is added to the   desired Catalog folder:   Report Layout Template  2.  Save a sample data: Sample XML data is needed in the layout design phase.   On the XML output page, choose Save As Sample data, as shown in the  following screenshot. Try to save a small but representative set of data,  because a small sample file will help in improving the performance when  used in a layout design:  3.  Create a new report: In order to create a new report, choose Report from the   home page or from the menu, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 84 ]   4.  Choose an existing Data Model: For the newly created report, you will be  asked to choose an existing Data Model. Browse to the desired saved Data  Model and click on it, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 4  5.  Finally, the Create report interface will be displayed. From this point, as   you can see in the following screenshot, you have three options: First, you can create a layout by choosing an option from the Basic  Templates or Shared Templates section. A new layout will be created  using BI Publisher's Layout Editor. Second, you can upload a layout or you can choose to upload an existing   layout, already created with an external tool. The Upload or Generate  Layout section allows you to use the following template types:  	  RTF PDF 	  Excel 	  Flash 	  	  XSL Stylesheet 	   eText  Finally, the third option allows you to generate a layout. Using this option,  a RTF template can be automatically generated, which is shown in the  following screenshot:.  RTF Templates are generated using a standard format.  You can start with this version in case you don't have  your own standard layout format for the reports. When  a distinct format is preferred, the better choice is to start  with your personalized layout.  [ 85 ]   Report Layout Template  Layout Template types In order to help you to choose a Template type, here are a few characteristics of each  type that you can use in BI Publisher 11g.  BI Publisher Template This is the new Layout Template introduced by BI Publisher 11g. It can generate  reports in the following formats:   	 PDF  	 RTF  	 Excel  	 PowerPoint  	 HTML  [ 86 ]   Chapter 4  The most exciting feature of this Template type is the interactive HTML output that  allows you to execute actions such as dynamic sorting, grouping, or filtering. It is  recommended for simple to medium reports to get the best response times in case   of the interactive output; however, its performance is similar to that of an RTF report  when generating a static output.  In the following screenshot, you can see some of the components of the BI Publisher  layout editor. On the left, the Data Source pane displays all your Data Model  elements. You can drag the desired element and insert it into a layout component:  For layout and layout components manipulation, two toolbars are provided:   	 The static toolbar for actions such as:  	  Undo or redo 	  Copy or paste 	  	   Layout preview Layout create, open, and save   	 The tabbed toolbar for actions such as:  	  Component insert 	  	  Component-specific actions  currently selected component   Page layout components  The design area occupies the remaining space of the layout editor.  [ 87 ]   Report Layout Template  You will see a more detailed approach of the BI Publisher Template further in the   next chapter.  RTF Template RTF Templates use Rich Text Format  RTF , a specification used by common word  processing applications, including Microsoft Word. BIP provides a plugin—Template Builder for Word—that assists in template design  and enables a connection to the BIP to access data and upload templates directly  from Word. As shown in the following screenshot, you can find the necessary link  for downloading this tool on the home page:  [ 88 ]   BIP supports Word format features, as well as advanced reporting features such as  conditional formatting, dynamic data columns, running totals, and charts.  Chapter 4  As you can see in the preceding screenshot, which shows the BIP generated RTF for  the chosen Data Model, Placeholders and Groups are inserted for mapping data  to the template. Placeholders are tags within a template that contain the name of a  corresponding XML element. Groups contain processing instructions for BIP.  [ 89 ]   Report Layout Template  You can add data fields and other markups to your template, as shown in the  following screenshot. BI Publisher's simplified tags for XSL expressions are used to  make the task easy for you:  BI Publisher also supports the use of pure XSL elements in the template and you can  use pure XSL XSL:FO code instead of simplified tags.  Generated report types using RTF Templates are:   	 PDF  	 HTML  	 Excel  	 RTF  	 Power Point  [ 90 ]   The Preview report function is provided by the BIP's plugin for Word, as you can see  in the following screenshot:  Chapter 4  In this way, you do all the work required by the report design phase in Word and  you instantly have access to the desired type of generated output, without even  opening BIP.  In the following screenshot, you can see both the RTF tags and the generated  PDF file.  After the report design phase is completed, you have to upload the template to BIP.  [ 91 ]   Report Layout Template  We will go into more details with this template type and the Template Builder for  Word in Chapter 6, Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word:  Microsoft Excel Template In order to design a Microsoft Excel Template, first you have to download and install  Analyzer for Excel. As you can see in the following screenshot, from the home page,  in the Get Started section, select Analyzer for Excel from the drop-down list. You  can then proceed with the necessary steps:  [ 92 ]   Chapter 4  There are two options available when working with the Excel analyzer:   	 Online mode: In this case:  	  You have to enable macros 	  You can update report parameters or apply a new BIP template   	 Offline mode: By choosing this option:  	  You can handle large Data Sets more efficiently 	  You can enable your own macros 	  You cannot login or connect to the BI Publisher server from the   Microsoft Excel session  Here are the steps required when working with the Analyzer for Excel tool in  online mode:  1.   In the Report Viewer window, choose Analyzer for Excel from the menu, as  shown in the following screenshot:  [ 93 ]   Report Layout Template  2.  When prompted, click on the Enable Macros button as shown in the   following screenshot:  The report is displayed but currently does not contain any data.  3.  Connect to Oracle BI Publisher using the Login option from the menu, as   shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Choose the values of the desired report parameters and refresh data.  [ 94 ]   The report that we have here, has only one parameter named Country. After  choosing a value for this parameter, you have to click on the Refresh Data  menu action, as shown in the following screenshot, to get data from the  saved XML sample file:  Chapter 4  5.  Apply a Layout Template and refresh the report.  You must select a layout that allows HTML output. Let's choose the template  named Readers as this is a BI Publisher Template. Now, click on Refresh  Formatted Data and you will have the Readers Template applied. Also,  data will be displayed according to the chosen template, as shown in the  following screenshot:  XSL Stylesheet Template In order to apply the XSL Stylesheet Template, select the Export option from the  Template Builder for Word tools menu and then select XSL-FO Stylesheet, as  shown in the following screenshot. This will export your RTF file in an XSL  Stylesheet format:  [ 95 ]   Report Layout Template  In the following screenshot, you can see a sequence from the generated XSL file:  Now, upload the template into BIP, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 96 ]   We saw that we can create an RTF template using BI Publisher's simplified syntax or  we can generate an XSL-FO Stylesheet from the BIP's plugin for Word. However, you  also have the option to use XSL or XSL-FO code instead of the simplified syntax. The  following are the necessary steps required for adding components without using the  Template Builder:  1.  Let's take an XML file for example. The following screenshot shows this file:  Chapter 4  Your template content has to follow the XML structure. Placeholders  are defined for the XML elements and groups are defined for   repeating elements.   2.  To insert a placeholder in Microsoft Word 2010, go to File  Options    Customize Ribbon.  [ 97 ]   Report Layout Template  In the right pane, check Developer from the main tabs list to enable the Form  toolbar, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.   4.   Insert a form field area in your document by selecting the Text Form Field  icon as shown in the preceding screenshot. In the Text Form Field Options dialog box  which is opened by double- clicking on the form field , enter a description for the field and the element's  tag name in the Help Text field as the following screenshot shows:  [ 98 ]   5.  Create placeholders for each XML element. As the following screenshot   shows, after completing the task, the template will look like this:  Chapter 4  6.  Create groups in the XML file. As you can see in the XML structure,   READER is a repeating group. Thus, you have to insert form fields to mark  the beginning and the end of a group:  You have to use the following syntax in the Help Text field:   	  : For the element inserted before the first element    	  : For the element inserted after the last element of   of the group  the group  Notice the Group READER and End READER form fields inserted in the  RTF document.  [ 99 ]   Report Layout Template  Let's now take a look at a more complex example to follow its code structure:  The following table shows the BI Publisher's simplified syntax. However, for using  the form fields the procedure is the same as the procedure for XSL and FO elements:  Code        Text Field  HEADER:START COMPANY_NAME DATE FROM_DATE_PARAM   TO_DATE_PARAM HEADER:END  TP F SUPPLIER_NAME INVOICE_DATE GL_DATE INVOICE_NUMBER CURRENCY_CODE PAID_UNPAID INVOICE_AMOUNT                           [ 100 ]   Chapter 4  Text Field  E  F 0.00 REP_AUTHOR FOOTER:START COMPANY_NAME FOOTER:END  Code <?xdoxslt:set_variable $_XDOCTX, 'TP',  xdoxslt:get_variable $_XDOCTX, 'TP'  + INVOICE_ AMOUNT ?>               Other Template types In order to give you a complete overview, let's take a look at the other accepted  template types.  PDF Template PDF Templates are designed using Adobe Acrobat by applying a BI Publisher  markup to an existing PDF document. You can use PDF files from any source,  including downloaded predefined forms  such as government forms . There are   a few requests concerning the tools you need:   	 Adobe Acrobat Professional 5.0 or a later version to apply or edit PDF    	 Adobe Acrobat Distiller  optional  to convert Microsoft Word documents   form fields  into PDF  In order to use form fields, you have to map Data Source element names to the PDF  fields, to create placeholders for the data. You can define text, check box, or radio  button placeholders. BI Publisher supports the following options available from the Text Field Properties  dialog box:  [ 101 ]   Report Layout Template   	 General: This option provides the following settings:  	  Read Only 	  Required 	  Visible Hidden 	  Orientation  degrees    	 Appearance: This option provides the following settings:  	  	  	   Border Settings  color, background, width, and style  Text Settings  color, font, and size  Border Style   	 Options tab: You can set the following properties with this option:  	  Multi-line 	   Scrolling Text   	 Format tab: This tab provides the settings for numbers  	 Calculate tab: You can use the calculation functions provided in this tab  [ 102 ]   Chapter 4  The following is a short insight of the syntax used:   	 To define a group, enter    where n is the row   number of the item on the layout  into the Tooltip field of Text Field  Properties dialog. For text fields and checkboxes, the field name must match the name of the  XML element.   	 To add page breaks, enter     into the Tooltip field.  PDF Templates are less flexible than RTF Templates, but more appropriate for  creating form-like reports, such as invoices, purchase orders, and particularly those  documents that do not require frequent updates.  Flash Template In order to work with PDF Templates, you need a few tools installed on  your computer:   	 Adobe Flash Player 9—to view the report output from the Flash Template  	 Adobe Flash Player 9 plugin—to view reports over the BIP user interface  	 FlexBuilder IDE from Adobe—to build templates  I would recommend this template type for those who are already familiar with   these technologies.  eText Template eText Templates are specialized RTF Templates for constructing Electronic Funds  Transfer  EFT  and Electronic Data Interchange  EDI  transaction files. In other  words, an EFT is an electronic transmission of financial data and payments to   banks. EDI is a delimiter-based text file used to exchange business documents  between companies.  The generated output text has a very specialized layout and BIP uses tables to define  the position, length, value of the fields, and data manipulation commands. Each  record is represented by a table.  [ 103 ]   Report Layout Template  The following screenshot shows an example of the instructions for filling an EFT file:  A sample EFT file generated considering these rules is shown in the   following screenshot:  As the use of this template type requires many specific commands and a lot of  formatting, I won't go further describing all these specific features. You will have to  do more extensive research before using it.  [ 104 ]   Valid output types for layout types The following table shows a list of output types, which you can get by choosing  different layout types:  Chapter 4  Layout Type  PDF  RTF   XPT   XLS  Flash  XSL Stylesheet  FO    Valid Output Types  PDF, PDFZ, CSV, Data  HTML, PDF, PDFZ, RTF, Excel, Excel2000, PowerPoint,  PowerPoint2007, MHTML, CSV, FO, Data  Interactive, HTML, PDF, PDFZ, RTF, Excel, Excel2000,  PowerPoint, PowerPoint2007, MHTML, CSV, FO, Data  Excel, Excel2000, CSV, Data  Flash, PDF, MHTML, CSV, Data  HTML, PDF, PDFZ, RTF, Excel, Excel2000, PowerPoint,  PowerPoint2007, MHTML, CSV, FO, Data HTML, XML, Text, Data   XSL Stylesheet  HTML    XML   Text   eText   Text, CSV, Data  Summary In this chapter, we saw a variety of Layout Template types that Oracle BI Publisher  offers for designing your report. It is up to you to choose the tools that you  prefer, but you also have to consider a few requests such as desired output type,  interactivity, or performance.  In the following chapters, we will have a more detailed look at the BI Publisher  Template type and the Template Builder for Word. After completing these, in the  report configuration phase, you will know how to choose more suitable tools for  your report.  [ 105 ]    The New XPT Format  In the previous chapter, we learned about the types of Layout Templates that  BIP offers for a report's design. The XPT format is a new template option and it is  designed in a totally BIP-integrated layout design interface. In this chapter, we will  see how to use this interface to design a complete report. We will cover the following  topics in this chapter:   	 The Layout Editor presentation  	 Designing a Layout  	 Export options  The Layout Editor First, you have to choose a predefined layout from the Create Report Interface.  As you can see in the following screenshot, this interface displays a list of   predefined layouts:   The New XPT Format  You can add your own predefined layouts to this list and make them available for  your later use or even for all the users. After choosing a layout from the Basic Templates or the Shared Templates group,  the Layout Editor interface is displayed.  Designing a Layout In the Layout Editor Interface, as shown in the following screenshot, you have tools  to perform activities such as:   	  Insert a component: Select the desired component from the Components  pane on the left or from the Insert tab of the toolbar and drag-and-drop it  into the design area   	 Set component properties: Set the component properties from the Properties   pane on the left or from the component-specific tab of the toolbar  only the  most commonly used components   [ 108 ]    	  Insert a data element: Drag the element from the Data Source pane to the  design area  Chapter 5  As shown in the preceding screenshot, a precise dropping area is marked.  For example, in a chart you have the following marked areas:  	  Drop Value Here 	  Drop Label Here 	  Drop Series Here   	 Set page layout options: In order to set the page layout options, use the Page   Layout tab and the Properties pane   	 Save the Layout: Use the activity icons from the toolbar on the right side In the following sections, a few elements will be inserted to complete our report  design. You will also see the steps that you need to follow when inserting and setting  the properties of these components.  [ 109 ]   The New XPT Format  Text elements In order to make changes in the settings of Text elements, follow the steps  given here:  1.  Click on the Insert tab and choose the Text Item component from the toolbar,   as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Click on the Text tab and set a font color for your text using the Font Color   icon from the toolbar, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.  Set the text margins using the Properties panel, as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 110 ]   In this way, we obtain the desired report title, as you can see in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 5  In order to insert data elements in our report's components, we will use the  following Data Model:  [ 111 ]   The New XPT Format  Charts In order to create Charts, follow the steps given here:  1.  Click on the Insert tab and choose the Chart component from the toolbar, as   shown in the following screenshot.  2.  Select the newly inserted chart and go to the Chart tab on the toolbar to set  the chart type  Vertical Bar in this example  and the chart style  Project in  this example .  3.  Drag the LOAN_PERIOD and the PRICE fields from the Data Source   from the left pane  over the Drop Value Here area of the design view.  4.  Drop the TITLE field from the Data Source over the Drop Label Here area:  [ 112 ]   Chapter 5  Data tables In order to create Data tables, follow the steps given here:  1.  Click on the Insert tab and choose the Data Table component from the   toolbar, as shown in the following screenshot.  2.  Drag the fields LOAN_DATE, LOAN_PERIOD, TITLE, and YEAR from the   Data Source over the area marked as Drop a Data Item Here.  3.  Select the LOAN_DATE column and in the Properties pane set the   Formatting Mask to yyyy-mm-dd.  4.  For each column of the table, enter a suitable value for Width, in the   Properties pane. For example, the first column has a width of 1.00 inch:  Automatic filtering Now, we will bring all the previously described components into a report, and create  an interaction between the chart and the table. When viewing in an interactive mode,  the events triggered by the user will determine the layout components to respond to  these configured events.  [ 113 ]   The New XPT Format  For example, in order to filter the table rows according to the chart selection and to  show only the selected section of the chart, follow the steps given here:  1.  On the Page Layout tab of the toolbar, click on the Configure Events option.   You will get the Configure Events interface.  2.  Select Chart 1 in the Components list. A list of events and a list of targets will   be displayed, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.  Check on the appropriate options in the Events and the Targets lists   respectively, as shown in the preceding screenshot.  4.  Click on the Save icon to save your layout. 5.  Click on Return to see your result. 6.  Click on a section of the chart.  As you can see in the following screenshot, only the selected section of the chart is  displayed along with only those rows of the table that meet the selection criteria:  [ 114 ]   Chapter 5  Notice that the data details are displayed when you mouseover  a chart item.  Don't check the Show Selection Only option if you want to keep all the values of the  chart and filter only the table values. The result will be as follows:  Repeating sections Repeating sections is used to group report data using a data element with multiple  occurrences. In order to have all the loans of our example grouped by their titles,  follow the steps given here:  [ 115 ]   The New XPT Format  1.  Click on the Insert tab of the toolbar and choose Repeating Section to insert   a Repeating Section, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 116 ]   2.   In the Insert Repeating Section dialog, enter TITLE as the repeating    grouping by element, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  In case of nested sections, you can use Group Detail as the  repeating   grouping by element.  3.  Save and return to check the elegant and interactive manner of BIP that   displays repeating sections, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 117 ]   The New XPT Format  In order to see the difference, the same report is displayed in a PDF format, which is  shown in the following screenshot. Seven groups are displayed following each other,  or on different pages according to the page break option settings:  Export options Using your BIP Layout Template, you can generate reports in the following formats:   	 PDF  	 RTF  	 Excel  	 PowerPoint  	 HTML  [ 118 ]   When viewing your report, click on Actions and then select Export to choose the  desired export format, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  Summary After completing this chapter, you should know how to use the Layout Editor  Interface, how to add layout elements and set properties for these elements, and how  to take advantage of some of the BIP Template features such as automatic filtering  and repeating sections.  The Template Builder for MS Word will be the main topic for the next chapter as this  is an important tool available for RTF layouts design. It is suitable even when coding  is a necessary part of the layout design.  [ 119 ]    Oracle BIP Template Builder  for Microsoft Word  Rich Text Format  RTF  layouts are preferred when designing reports that request  complex word formatting and processing. The advantage of being designed in Word  is that it can use all the formatting tools offered by Microsoft Word. We saw in Chapter 4, Report Layout Template that you can design RTF templates even  without the Template Builder. However, this add-in simplifies a lot of your work by  enabling the following:  Insertion of elements such as data fields, tables, or charts   	  	 Template preview with sample XML data  	 Translations test  In this chapter, we will go through the most important features of the Template  Builder for Word. The 11.1.1.3.0 version of Template Builder for Word along with  Microsoft Office Word 2007 was used for these examples. This chapter will cover the  following topics:  Insert template elements   	 BIP and Template Builder interaction  	  	 Modify template elements  	 Template validation  	 Translations   Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word  Installing Template Builder for Word In order to install the Template Builder, select the Template Builder for Word from  the options provided for downloading BI Publisher tools on the home page of BIP  11g, as shown in the following screenshot:  Your installation was correct if you can find TemplateBuilder.dot in the  Active Application Add-Ins section of the Word add-ins, which is shown in  the following screenshot:  You will get a ribbon type menu in Word 2007, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 122 ]   The BI Publisher menu—the one which is active—has six groups of tools:  Chapter 6  Insert   	 Online  	 Load Data  	  	 Preview  	 Tools  	 Options  We will see how to use these tools into the RTF template building process.  BIP and Template Builder interaction For BIP to communicate with the Template Builder and vice versa, multiple ways can  be used. They are as follows:  Upload or generate layout In order to generate an RTF layout in BIP, use the Create report interface, as shown  in the following screenshot:  [ 123 ]   Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word  For example, we have a structured Data Layout, which is shown in the   following screenshot:  For this structure, BIP generates the following RTF layout:  You can see that all the elements of your data source are now displayed in the  corresponding form of the RTF layout.  Using the same Create report interface, upload the modified version of the template  to BIP that will look similar to the following screenshot:  [ 124 ]   Login to BIP Another way of interaction between BIP and the Template Builder for Word is  using the Log On option of the BI Publisher menu that is accessible in Word after  installing the Template Builder add-in. After accessing this option, the BIP login  interface is displayed as you can see in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  After logging in, you get the following options:   	 Open: You can open a BIP template  	 Upload Template: You can upload a Template to BIP  	 Save: You can save any XML data  [ 125 ]   Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word  Template preview Load your previously saved XML data into the Template Builder using the Sample  XML option, as shown in the following screenshot:  Loading sample data enables the tools for inserting elements, such as fields or charts,  into your template and also the Preview options. As you can see in the following screenshot, the Field dialog provides sample data for  a selected XML field:  [ 126 ]   However, for a preview, you can choose from the following formats:  Chapter 6   	 PDF  	 HTML  	 Excel  	 Excel 2000  	 RTF  	 PowerPoint  For example, you have the PDF file generated in the following screenshot:  Insert template elements In the following sections, you will see how to insert some of the template elements  and how to set their properties.  Text field In order to get the desired fields into your template, drag-and-drop the fields using  the Field dialog, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 127 ]   Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word  As shown in the following screenshot, double-click on the inserted field and on the  Properties tab, set the data type and format. On the Advanced tab, the code using  the BIP syntax, such as  , is automatically inserted in edit mode:  You also have the option to insert all the fields at once. For doing so, select the All Fields option on the BI Publisher menu. For our  example, we got the following result:  [ 128 ]   Chart Use the Chart option from the BI Publisher menu to get the Chart dialog, which is  shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  Drag-and-drop the fields Quantity and Price from the tree view structure of the XML  file on the Values area and the Description field on the Labels area. Also choose the  Type and Style for the chart. The result, using the sample data, is shown in the following screenshot:  To make changes on your chart, right-click on the chart  and go to the BI Publisher Chart option of the menu.  [ 129 ]   Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word  Conditional region Use a conditional region to put a filter on your data. Depending on the condition  entered, the data matching the criteria only will be shown in the region between  the form fields C and EC that are entered to mark the condition start and end. The  underlying code for these fields in our example is as follows:   10?>    In the BI Publisher menu, go to the Conditional Region option and enter your  condition, as shown in the following screenshot. Move the EC field wherever you want your region to end:  As you can see in the following screenshot, the products were filtered with respect to  the entered condition:  [ 130 ]   Chapter 6  Table or form In order to insert a table, go to the Table Form option on the BI Publisher menu. You will get the Insert Table Form interface, which is shown in the  following screenshot. Drag a repeating group marked with bold text in the Data Source panel to the  Template panel. For example, add the Products node to the Template panel. You are  prompted to choose to either drop all the nodes or a single node; however, choose to  add a single node. After the parent node is added to the template, you can start with  the child nodes:  Notice the Insert Position option. If you set this option to Same Level, you can  add nodes to the template by dropping them over nodes having the same level. For  example, drag Value over Price. If the option is set to Child, you must drag the child  node over its parent. For example, drag Product Id over Products.  [ 131 ]   Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word  Modify template elements A double-click on the template element will display the element's Properties dialog.  Alternatively, you can right-click on the desired element to get more BI Publisher  options in a menu, such as the one shown in the following screenshot:  Template validation Multiple options are available when validating your template. In order to check this  follow the suggestions given here:  1.  Check the validity of your template by using the Validate Template option   from the Tools group:  As you can see in the preceding screenshot, an error message is displayed  indicating the error.  When there are no errors, the text No Error found is displayed.  [ 132 ]   2.  At the same time, a template error makes the preview unavailable and   3.   choosing any preview option displays an error window. In order to check the underlying code of these errors, you have the   Field Browser option. The Field Browser dialog is shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 6  As the preceding screenshot shows, you can search, edit, and update any line that  you choose. When a template section is selected, the Field Browser displays only  the corresponding instructions.  Translations When dealing with report translations, consider the following two cases:   	 The translated report has the same layout as the original layout when a   XLIFF file has to be used   	 Another layout must be provided for the translation  [ 133 ]   Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word  The following are the steps required for a simple translation, addressing the first case  from those we just saw:  1.  Go to Translation  Extract Text on the BI Publisher tool bar. You   will get an XLF file that has a structure similar to the one shown in the  following screenshot:  2.  Update   elements with translation of   elements. For   example Invoice date from our example template was translated to Data  factura in Romanian. Also, change the target-language, which is an  attribute of the file element, found at the beginning of the XLF file.  [ 134 ]   3.  Go to Translation  Preview Translation and open the previously modified   XLF file. You will get the PDF result, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  4.  Localize your template—this means that you will have the original version  of your template replaced by the translated one. For this, you have to go to  Translation  Localize template.  5.  Upload the translated template to BIP.  In the second case, a completely new layout is designed and uploaded to BIP.  Be careful to choose the appropriate locale when uploading  a translated template to BIP.  Appendix A, Report Translations of the book will offer a more detailed look into  report translations.  [ 135 ]   Oracle BIP Template Builder for Microsoft Word  Summary After a detailed look into the Template Builder for Word functionalities, you   should be able to communicate between BIP and Template Builder, to insert and  modify template elements, to validate your template, and to create a localization for  your report.  In the next chapter, we will continue with managing reports, in which we will   cover setting report properties, viewing and running reports, consulting job history,  and so on.  [ 136 ]   The Report Configuration  Besides Data Model and Layout Template discussed in the previous chapters,  BIP deals with some more aspects concerning the report's life. Depending on the  properties set for the report, you will get different results. Some BIP features will be  enabled or disabled, or your reports will be given different formats. This chapter will  also include instructions on managing report jobs and consulting jobs history.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   	 Properties settings  	 Report Viewer options  	 Schedule Report Job  	 View report history   The Report Configuration  Properties settings You can set report properties throughout the life cycle of a report starting  with its creation.  As you can see in the following screenshot, you have two options available on the  home page for starting report creation:   	 Click on the New drop-down to create a new report.  	 Choose the Report link from the Create section  [ 138 ]   You will be prompted to choose an existing Data Model for your report. The Create  Report interface, shown in the following screenshot, appears as a result of choosing  the desired Data Model. The actions available on this interface are quite interesting  and essential for report settings. At this point you can:  Chapter 7   	 Choose or create a Data Model  	 Set properties for the report's parameters  	 Set report properties  	 View a report  	 Save a report  	 Create or upload a layout  [ 139 ]   The Report Configuration  Parameters When designing the report's Data Model, the parameters have also been defined   if necessary . Launch the Parameters dialog by clicking on Parameters in the page  header. In this phase, as you can see in the following screenshot, only some display  settings can be changed, which are as follows:   	 Show  	 Display Label  	 Default Value  	 Parameters Display per line  Properties Launch the Report Properties dialog by clicking on Properties in the page header.  Report Properties are divided into five categories:   	 General  	 Caching  	 Formatting  	 Font Mapping  	 Currency Formatting  In the following sections, we will discuss the meaning of these properties and how to  set their values in different circumstances.  [ 140 ]   General On the General tab, you will find all the properties, as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 7   	 Description: The description is displayed in the Catalog with the report.  	 Run Report Online: You can disable this option for long-running reports or  for reports where online viewing is not appropriate. You can also check the  following settings as per your need:  	   Show controls: You can disable this option if you don't want the user  to control Output, Parameters, and Template lists.  	  Allow Sharing Report Links: A URL link is displayed and users can   copy the current report link.  	  Open Links in New Window: You can open links in a new window   using this option.  	  Asynchronous Mode: When this option is enabled, the BIP   uses a separate execution thread to run the current report. For  example, using this option for large reports leads to a BIP increased  performance in executing other tasks.  	  Auto Run: By disabling this option during report opening, the online   viewer will be displayed but without running the report.  [ 141 ]   The Report Configuration   	 Excel Analyzer: It controls the way the BIP interacts with Microsoft Excel.  	 Advanced: This option provides the following settings:  	   Enable bursting: If you have a bursting definition in your Data  Model, select the definition type to be used for delivering the report.  	  Report is Controlled by External Application: Use this option in   case you don't want users to run or view this report directly from the  catalog. These tasks are left to be controlled by the application with  which the BIP is integrated.  Caching  On the Caching tab, report properties specifiy how, and for what duration, the data  generated by the report will be used. When caching is enabled, a report request  having the same parameters will use data stored in the cache. This setting enhances  performance by using stored data to generate a report rather than regenerating the  data from the source. The data will remain in the cache according to the time limit  specified in the Caching Duration property. If the User Can Refresh Report Data  option is enabled, the user can force data refresh. In this case, data stored in the cache  will not be used.  Formatting This section contains template settings for all the format types that you can  use in the BIP.  [ 142 ]   For example, you can see the Formatting properties settings for a Flash template and  settings for a CSV output in the following screenshot:  Chapter 7  For an RTF Output, you can set the following properties:   	 Enable change tracking  	 Protect document for tracked changes  	 Default font  Font Mapping Have you experienced the situation in which everything coming from the BI  Publisher looks OK, but in PDF there are question marks like this: ??????? ????????  ???? This is because other formats use the local machine's fonts but PDF format uses its  own fonts.  [ 143 ]   The Report Configuration  The solution for this is to add the missing font type   to $BI_HOME  jdk jre lib fonts . After the font types are copied to the server you have to do a Font Mapping  in the BIP:  Currency Format Set a currency format to have multiple currencies on a single report displayed  in their own format. Currency formatting is only supported for RTF and  XSL-FO templates:  The format mask is in Oracle number format. This is explained by the example  shown in the preceding screenshot:  9  number : Only if present in data   	  	 G: Group separator  	 D: Decimal separator  	  0  explicitly number : May or may not be present in data  [ 144 ]   Report Viewer options Runtime options can be set using the Report Viewer interface. One way to access  Report Viewer is by opening the report from the home page link, as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 7  As a result, the Create Report interface is displayed, with the templates attached in  the main section as thumbnails or a list. In the following screenshot, you can see that the View Thumbnails option in  the upper-right corner is active and you can proceed with the following actions   on a template:   	 Add New Layout  	 Edit  	 Properties  	 Delete  [ 145 ]   The Report Configuration  The same actions can be found in the list view of the report templates, as shown in  the following screenshot. On the top-left corner of the list, you can see the four icons  active for the selected layout:  This Properties interface, which is shown in the following screenshot, enables  uploading and deleting of templates for different locales and translations. It also  manages the extracting, uploading, and deleting of XLIFF files:  [ 146 ]   Chapter 7  In order to get to the main subject, choose the View Report option on the  Create Report interface. The Report viewer window is displayed as shown in  the following screenshot:  Now, let's go through the components of this interface.  [ 147 ]   The Report Configuration  Parameters As shown in the preceding screenshot, choose a value for the report's parameter s   found in the upper section. You have to select Apply to have the results displayed on  the report according to the new parameter values. For example, choose 3 for Invoice  ID to get the quantities on that invoice, which is shown in the previous chart.  Layout This in the main section of the window. Separate tabs are provided if the report has  more than one layout. Here we have four layouts for the Sales report:   	 Sales RTF  	 Sales  	 Price  	 Quantity  View Report menu Depending on Properties settings and Template types, the possible values are:  Interactive : For templates designed in the BIP's editor   	  	 HTML  Hypertext Markup Language : For any Internet browser  	 PDF  Portable Document Format : For Adobe Acrobat reader  	 RTF  Rich Text Format : For word processing applications  	 Excel: For Microsoft Excel 2003 or later  	 Excel 2000: For Microsoft Excel 2000 or 2002  	 PowerPoint: For Microsoft PowerPoint 2003  	 PowerPoint 2007: For Microsoft PowerPoint 2007  	 Flash: Flash templates will open in a browser that needs Adobe flash Player   plugin installed   	 CSV  Comma Separated Values : For a file containing data stored in   plain-text delimited by a symbol   	 Data: It will display data in XML format  [ 148 ]    	 MHTML  Mime Hypertext Markup Language : Saves an HTML page as a   single .mht file   	 PDFZ  Zipped PDF : Split PDF saved in a .zip file along with an index file  	 FO: The result is an XML file with XLS-FO information  Chapter 7  Actions menu  This menu contains options depending on user privileges and report properties  settings, and the complete list of these options is as follows:   	 Edit Report: Opens the Create Report interface.  	 Edit Layout: Enables you to open or create layouts.  	 Export : Exports the report to the default application for the selected   output type.  [ 149 ]   The Report Configuration   	 Send: Enables report scheduling for delivery by launching Schedule Report   Job  will be discussed later in this chapter .   	 Schedule: Creates a report job  will be discussed later in this chapter .  	  	  	 Analyzer: Launches the Online Analyzer, which enables you to create a pivot   Jobs: Opens the currently scheduled jobs manager for this report. Job History: Offers a view of completed report jobs.  table using current data.   	 Analyzer for Excel: Exports the report data to Microsoft Excel.  	 Share Report Link: You can copy and reuse the report link. As you can see,   different options regarding the page content are available.  Schedule Report Job There are many ways to get to the report jobs scheduler interface. As you can see  in the following screenshot, one such possible option is Report Job, present in the  Create section of the home page:  Some other available options are:   	 Access Catalog, find the report you want to schedule, and click on the   Schedule link   	 From the Report Viewer go to Actions and then to Schedule  The Schedule Report Job page contains four tabs to define the options for your  report job: General, Output, Schedule, and Notification.  [ 150 ]   General  Chapter 7  The General tab, shown in the preceding screenshot, contains the report name if  you accessed the Schedule page from the report, or allows you to browse for the  desired report.  On this tab, you have to also choose the values for the report parameters. The  selected values will be used for the current schedule.  Output  [ 151 ]   The Report Configuration  As you can see in the preceding screenshot, on the Output tab you can set the output  properties and add destinations for the report. First, you have some options that  concern all the outputs:   	 Use Bursting Definition to determine Output & Delivery Destination: This   option is shown only if the report has a bursting definition   	 Make Output Public: When this option is enabled, the report will display in   the Report Job History page, making the report available to all users with  rights to see it   	 Save Data for Republishing: XML data generated for this job will be saved  Then, for each new output, you have to enter or set the following properties:   	 Name  	 Layout  	 Format  	 Locale  	 Timezone  	 Calendar  	 Save Output  Also, set the delivery options in the Destination area. In order to add destinations,  you need to set up Delivery servers in the Administration interface but this job is  usually done by the BIP's administrator.  Schedule A recurrence pattern is defined in the Schedule tab.

Summary We can consider a report designed using the BIP as a complex entity; the benefits  of using BIP are the numerous properties and tools offered to suit the user's needs  better and to facilitate the designer's approach in following a report's status in every  stage of its life. This chapter proposes a practical guide for setting report properties,  setting viewing options, and taking actions on a report. After completing this  chapter, you should also know how to deal with report jobs as this is an important  step in a report's life.  In the next chapter, we will see a complete example and go through all the stages of a  report's life from creating the Data Model to consulting the Job History.  [ 160 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A  Simple Report Example  We've been busy in the earlier chapters analyzing the report's structure in BIP, taking  a more in-depth look at its components, behavior, and tools used to create its data  sources structure, to design its layout, to translate, to set its properties, and finally,  to manage report jobs. To get a comprehensive view of all these mechanisms, this  chapter will show a complete example for you to follow when designing a report,  considering the following points:   	 Data Model  	 Layout Template  	 Report configuration  	 Report Job  	 Translation  Data Model First, create the data source's structure using the Data Model Editor interface.  Although there is more than one way to get to the same point, we'll choose a precise  path for our example. So, we will use the following steps to create your Data Model: 1.  On the BIP homepage, select Data Model from the Create section. The Data   Model Editor interface will be displayed.  2.  Set the Data Model properties.   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  In the left menu, go to Data Sets.  3.  4.  On the toolbar, select SQL Query to create a SQL Query type data set. 5.  Enter a Name, choose the Data Source, and open the Query   Builder interface.  6.  Choose your tables, create links between them, and check all the fields you   want to display on your report. For this example, you have the structure  displayed in the following screenshot:  7.   In the Query Builder interface, go to the Results window to take a look at  your data. You'll find in this view, data from all selected columns.  8.  Save your query:  [ 162 ]   Chapter 8  9.  Go to List of Values in the menu on the left in the Data Model Editor   interface and create List of Values  LOV . The invoice_id LOV was created  for this example as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 163 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  10.  Go to the Parameters link on the left, to create parameters that use previously   created LOVs. In this example, the invoice_id parameter of Menu type was  added. On this page you also have to set the Menu properties as shown in  the following screenshot:  	  Display Label List of Values 	  	  Options  11.  Click on the newly created data set in the Diagram view and access the data   set menu:  [ 164 ]   12.  Group the header data using Group by and Move selected elements to   Parent Group options from the menu as shown in the following screenshot.  As a result of these actions, we'll have the Sales as the parent group and  Sales_1 as the child group:  Chapter 8  13.  Right-click on the group and choose Add Element by Expressions to create   new calculated elements. For example, the column VALUE was added as  the result of QUANTITY * PRICE as this column's Properties window  shows in the following screenshot. Valid combinations of data on the left   data columns or parameters  and operators on the bottom are allowed.   Don't forget to have your data validated—click on Validate Expression.  [ 165 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  14.  Click on OK to go back to the Data Model Editor interface. 15.  Create aggregate elements by dragging values from the child group  Sales_1  is our child group  and dropping them into the area marked for aggregated  function of the parent group  Sales is our parent group . In this example,  we'll get INVOICE_VALUE column by summing the VALUE column:  16.  Enter group filters using the created parameters. In order to do this, go to   the group menu and click on the Create Group Filter option. A filter on the  INVOICE_ID column was created by entering the expression depending on  the invoice_id parameter as you can see in the following screenshot:  [ 166 ]   Chapter 8  17.  Use the Data Model's Structure to set:  	  XML Tag Name 	  Value if Null 	  Display Name  Changing value on this tab is optional, but it brings, in certain cases, a visible  improvement to the final look of your report, as follows:  18.  It will be very useful to have a sample of your data attached to the Data   Model when designing the report's layout  you cannot test the report's layout  design without an XML sample . Go through the following steps to save a  sample of your data:  	  Go to Get XML output in the icons menu. 	  On the page displaying the XML output, choose values for your   parameters. In this case, for the Invoice ID parameter.  [ 167 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  	  Choose a value for the Number of rows to return variable. 	  Click on Run. 	  Go to the Actions menu and choose the Save As Sample Data option:  At this point you have a Data Model created and ready to use for your report. For  more info on the Data Model see Chapter 2, Creating a Data Model for a Report of this  book. So you can proceed with the report's layout design.  Layout Template To create a Layout Template for your report, perform the following steps:  1.  On the BIP homepage select Report from the Create section. 2.  Choose the Data Model you've created when prompted to Choose Existing   Data Model. Click on Open.  [ 168 ]   3.  On the Create report interface, choose the type of template to create  or upload. You can also choose to generate an RTF template. For this   example let's choose to create a Chart type template from the Shared  Templates group:  Chapter 8  4.   Insert report template elements by dragging and dropping them from the left  menu Components or from the Insert tab of the toolbar to the main area of  the Layout Editor interface. By choosing the Chart type template we already  have a chart element inserted:  [ 169 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  5.  Drag data fields to the marked areas. You can see that for a chart there are   two marked areas: Drop Value Here and Drop Label Here:  	  	   Insert PRICE and QUANTITY fields as values in the chart. Insert DESCRIPTION as the label.  6.  Set the chart properties using the Properties menu on the left, or   the Chart tab on the Layout Editor's toolbar. As you can see in the  following screenshot, to set the color for the chart label font go to   Properties  Chart Label  Font Color and pick a color:  [ 170 ]   Chapter 8  7.  Save the layout. On the Save Layout dialog, enter the Layout Name and   don't forget to choose the Locale, as locale information is used when  matching a layout with the user's account preferences. For more information  on this read Appendix A, Report Translations of this book:  8.  Click on Return to close the Layout Editor and return to the Create   Report interface.  [ 171 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  9.  On the Create Report interface, save the report as shown in the   following screenshot:  10.  Go to the Report Viewer interface by clicking on the View Report option. 11.  Choose a value for the Invoice ID parameter. Click on Apply. 12.  Export the report as a PDF file: Go to the Actions menu and choose   Export  PDF:  [ 172 ]   Chapter 8  Following the preceding steps, you have completed the first version of your report  and its PDF format was successfully generated. For this we used the report's default  settings and the report was instantly generated. Also, we didn't provide any  translation. We'll deal with these details  important details , in the following part   of this chapter.  Report configuration Configuring a report consists mainly of setting properties for the report and for the  report's parameters. To configure your report perform the following steps:  1.   In the Create Report interface, select the Properties option to open the  Report Properties dialog. Set the main properties on the General tab as  shown in the following screenshot:  [ 173 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  2.  Set formatting properties on the Formatting tab. For example, set a password   for access to the open PDF outputs. Click on OK:  3.  Choose Parameters on the Create Report interface to set properties for the  report's parameters, in the Parameters dialog window. For the invoice_id  parameter set the following values, as shown in the following screenshot:  Show - This checkbox should be checked  	  	  Display Label - Set the Display Lable as Invoice ID 	  Default Value - Set this value as 2  [ 174 ]   Chapter 8  Report job Concerning report jobs, the actions you can take are: submit report jobs, manage  report jobs, and consult the history list of report jobs. The following steps will take  you through the details of these actions:  1.  To schedule a report job go to the Schedule option in the Actions   menu in the Report Viewer interface:  2.  The Schedule Report Job interface is displayed. On the General tab you  can see that the report's name  including the path  is already provided   and you have to choose the parameter's values that will be used when  running this job:  [ 175 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  3.  Go to the Output tab to enter the output name and to choose either of the   following options:  Layout 	  Format 	  Locale 	  Timezone 	  	  Calendar 	   Save output   4.  Set time-related parameters in the Define Schedule Time section. As you can  guess from the following screenshot, there are endless possible combinations  available to define your report's schedule.

Go to Translation  Localize Template... on the BI Publisher toolbar and   open your modified XLF file when prompted.  5.  Upload your localized template to BIP. [ 179 ]   Exploring BI Publisher 11g: A Simple Report Example  Summary This example was meant to draw the "red line" of report designing in BIP from its  Data Model to translation. As a result of following the steps described in this chapter,  now you should be dealing with easier report components and knowing BIP's  interfaces and their purposes much better.  In the next chapter we'll go on to discussing BIP and e-Business Suite integration.  [ 180 ]   BI Publisher 11g and  E-Business Suite  Along with the new 11.1.1.5 release of BIP came the integration with E-Business  Suite  EBS  capability. You can use EBS's security to navigate to BI Publisher and  also to return to the EBS within a context from BIP. As the functionalities require a  lot of system configuration, this chapter will provide only a brief introduction of the  subject. This chapter will cover:   	 Setting up Oracle BI to use Oracle EBS security to authenticate users  	 Using actions to integrate Oracle BI with Oracle EBS  Set up Oracle BI to use Oracle EBS  security to authenticate users Taking EBS as the beginning point, there are a few steps to complete in order to  enable the communication with Oracle BI  BIP in particular .  Integrate EBS database into the Oracle   BI repository To enable integration with Oracle EBS, you must create a database object and  connection pool for the EBS database in the Oracle BI repository.

In the Data source name field enter the TNS name of the Oracle  EBS database. In the Username and Password fields enter the username and password of  the Oracle EBS super user. Use a super user to ensure access to all administrative functions in case of  failures with the configured security model.  4.   [ 183 ]   BI Publisher 11g and E-Business Suite  5.  Select the Connection Scripts tab:  6.  Click on New under Execute on connect. 7.  Enter the following SQL code, and then click on OK:  call APP_SESSION.validate_icx_session     'valueof NQ_SESSION.ICX_SESSION_COOKIE '   This script is used to send the ICX cookie to EBS and open a database session  based on the user's context.  8.  Check to make sure this script is enabled. 9.  Click on OK in the Connection Pool dialog. 10.  Save the repository.  Use EBS authentication to access Oracle BI To enable EBS authentication when accessing Oracle BI, set up session variables and  update the authenticationschemas.xml and instanceconfig.xml files.  Set up session variables for authentication In the Oracle BI repository, the configuration steps include the set up of eight session  variables and an initialization block. To set up session variables for authentication in the Administration Tool, open the  repository that you want to integrate with Oracle E-Business Suite and carry out the  following steps:  1.  Navigate to Manage  Variables. The Variable Manager dialog box   will be displayed.  [ 184 ]   2.  Go to the Action menu and select New  Session  Initialization Block:  Chapter 9  3.

In order to do this, open the file in edit mode. The file  authenticationschemas.xml can be found at:  ORACLE_HOME bifoundation web display  Then perform the following steps:  1.  Find the following element:  <AuthenticationSchema name="EBS-ICX"  2.  Locate the sub-element RequestVariable source="cookie" and change the   value of the nameInSource attribute from ICX_SESSION to the name of the  EBS ICX authentication cookie prefix. For example: <RequestVariable source="cookie" type="auth" nameInSource="VIS"     biVariableName="NQ_SESSION.ICX_SESSION_COOKIE"  >  3.  Do not update the RequestVariable source="url" sub-element. 4.   In the same entry  RequestVariable source="cookie" , ensure that the  value of the biVariableName attribute is the same as the value you entered  as part of the connection script when you created the connection pool for the  Oracle EBS database.  5.  Find the following element:  <SchemaKeyVariable source="cookie"  6.  Change the value of the nameInSource attribute from ICX_SESSION to the  name of the EBS ICX authentication cookie prefix  often VIS . For example: <SchemaKeyVariable source="cookie" nameInSource="VIS"     forceValue="EBS-ICX" >  7.  Save the file and close it.

[ 193 ]   BI Publisher 11g and E-Business Suite  Using actions to integrate Oracle BI with  Oracle EBS As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the solution to navigate to EBS from  BIP exists. To create this link, Action Framework is used. Action Framework, a  component of the Oracle BI EE architecture, consists of the following:   	 Actions Web Services—for creating and invoking actions that are deployed    	 Components that reside within the Presentation Server and    in the application server  Scheduler Services   	 Action-specific JavaScript in the presentation tier for creating actions and   invoking certain action types directly from the browser  To prepare the Action Framework for use in Oracle BI Presentation Services, you  must perform the following tasks:   	 Configure the Action Framework  	 Secure actions  	 Set up action targets  Functionality  The Action Framework provides functionality for creating, managing, and  invoking actions. Actions provide functionality to navigate to context and to   invoke operations, functions, or processes in external systems. Actions are   created and managed in the Oracle BI Presentation Services user interface.  Action types and action execution The action types available in Oracle BI EE are categorized into actions that:   	 Navigate to related content  	  Invoke operations, functions, or processes in external systems  Based on the technology they invoke, actions can be further categorized into actions  that invoke URLs or Web services. The action type Navigate to E-Business Suite allows users to navigate from Oracle  BI EE to Oracle EBS. The Oracle BI EE session holds the context of the user's Oracle  EBS session, including the current Oracle EBS responsibility in the Oracle BI EE  session variables.  [ 194 ]   Chapter 9  A Navigate to Oracle E-Business Suite action takes two parameters:   	 Connection Pool: Contains the name of the BI connection pool that connects  to the target EBS environment as defined in the repository. Oracle EBS 12 in  our example.   	 Function: Contains the name of the target EBS function to which to navigate.  The EBS administrator needs to provide the target function ID. For example,  use BIPUBLISHER —the function ID we've created in this chapter.  To invoke a Navigate to EBS action, the user must have privileges to execute direct  database requests against the EBS connection pool. Also, the target EBS function  must be accessible from the user's current EBS.  This short introduction will help you to figure out how this process works, but it  is a little more complicated to set up actions. So let's leave this task to the Oracle BI  system administrator.  Summary At the end of this chapter you should be able to set up Oracle BI to use Oracle   EBS security to authenticate users, and you should have an idea about what   Action Framework is and what action type you should use to integrate   Oracle BI with Oracle EBS.  You must have realized by now that you have all the reasons, including the EBS  integration to use or upgrade to BIP 11g. However, there is another category of  reports that deserve our attention, Oracle reports. Oracle reports and their migration  to BIP will be the main topic of the next chapter.  [ 195 ]    Report Translations  Providing a translation for a report is an important part of the report layout design in  cases of foreign customers, foreign providers, or any other document exchange with  a foreign partner. It is important in countries using English language too.  This chapter proposes a walkthrough for all the translation techniques that BI  Publisher offers, including:   	 Translation file  	 Step by step translations  	 Locale selection logic  Translation file The translation file, named XLIFF, is generated either inside BI Publisher or from MS  Word using the Template Builder add-on for Word.  The XML Localization Interchange file Format  XLIFF  is the standard format used  by localization providers.  In the following image, you can see the elements of an XLIFF file structure. Open the  XLIFF file in a browser to get a similar view of the DOM  Document Object Model   structure. The most important tags, you will be working with in the translation  process, are as follows:   	    	    	     Report Translations  This is not a translated version of an XLIFF file—the   and   tags  have identical content, as shown in the following screenshot:  The circumstances under which BI Publisher is used depends on the user's need, and  business partners, there are more techniques available in BI Publisher.  Check out the next section to get a better understanding of the way the XLIFF   file is used.  Catalog translation You can use this type of translation when you want all the objects that BI Publisher  includes to be translated. This feature allows translation of the following:   	 Report layouts  	 Catalog object descriptions  	 Report parameter's names  	 Data display names  It is a good choice to use catalog translation when the users working with BI  Publisher use a language other than English. Users viewing the catalog will see  the item translations appropriate for the UI Language and report translations  appropriate for the Report Locale they selected in their My Account preferences.  [ 198 ]   On the home page of BI Publisher, click on the My Account link found under your  username, to set your preferences. This is shown in the following screenshot:  Appendix A  Your preferences may be inherited from another Oracle product. In this case,  you cannot update your preferences from within BI Publisher. This is one of the  situations captured in the preceding image.  When BI Publisher is integrated with Oracle BIEE, BI  Publisher catalog translation is ignored.  For a catalog translation perform the following steps:  In BI Publisher, open the catalog and select the folder to be translated.  1.  2.  Click on the Translation icon shown in the following screenshot and select   the Export XLIFF menu option.  3.  Save the .xlf file in a folder of your choice:  [ 199 ]   Report Translations  4.  Open the XLIFF file using a text editor. It will look like the   following screenshot:  5.  Change the target-language attribute of the   tag with the target   language code.  Only en is available for the source language.  6.  Provide a translation for the text contained by the   tags. You have   to enter the translation between the corresponding   tags. This file also contains object names and not only text strings contained by  these objects, as you can see in the following screenshot:  Notice that opening the file in MS Word 2007—as shown in the following   image—will generate a simplified version, not allowing attribute   changing or viewing. But at the same time, simpler is better when you only  need   and   tags to enter the translation and your work  will be ready in no time:  [ 200 ]   Appendix A  7.  Upload the translated file back to BI Publisher.  Click on the Translation icon and go to the Import XLIFF menu option.  This will open the Upload dialog window. Browse for the file containing  the catalog translation and click on Upload:  File translation At a lower level than catalog translation, file translation allows you to translate  only specific objects from the BI Publisher catalog. The objects you can translate   are as follows:   	 RTF templates  	 Style templates  	 Subtemplates  	 BI Publisher templates  .XPT   [ 201 ]   Report Translations  Using this technique, you will be able to provide translations in circumstances where  the users want to consult only some reports in another language, or they want to  send documents to the partners in different languages.  The way file translation is actually realized depends on another factor: whether the  translated template needs another layout than the original template or not. In the  first case, you must create another localized template, in the second case you'll use an  XLIFF file, allowing you to translate only the text strings of the template.  This section will present concrete steps to follow in order to generate report  translation for the cases listed as follows:   	 Same layout using BIP  	 Same layout using Template Builder for Word  	 Different layouts  Same layout using BIP Let's assume first that you only need the text strings of the layout template to be  translated. In this case, follow the steps:  1.  Open BI Publisher catalog. 2.  Click on the Edit link under the report name you want to translate. 3.  Click on the Properties link under the report layout to be translated, as   shown in the following screenshot:  [ 202 ]   4.  This will open the Properties page shown below:  Appendix A  5.  Click on Extract translation to trigger the process that generates the   XLIFF file.  6.  Save the XLIFF file to a folder of your choice. 7.  Update the XLIFF file by providing text between the   tags   corresponding to the translated text from the   tags as you can see in  the following screenshot:  [ 203 ]   Report Translations  8.  Click on the Upload icon in the Translations section to get your translated   XLIFF file into BIP:  In this way, when choosing Romanian as Report Locale,  BI Publisher will apply the  translation for this particular report layout template when viewing the report.  Same layout using Template Builder for Word As mentioned earlier, the Template Builder for Word can be used to generate the  XLIFF file. The steps required in this case are as follows:  1.  Open the RTF layout template file using Word. 2.  Go to the Translation  Extract Text... menu option on the toolbar. This will   generate the XLIFF file.  3.  Save the XLIFF file in a folder of your choice using the .xlf extension. 4.  Translate the text between the   tags providing translation for the   text between the   tags, and save your work:  [ 204 ]   Appendix A  5.  Go to the Translation  Preview Translation... menu option on the   toolbar and choose the modified file to see the result, as shown in the  following screenshot:  A good result means that your XLIFF file is correct and now you can proceed  to upload it into BIP. In BIP, click on the Upload icon in the Translations section, and browse for  the saved XLIFF file in order to get your translation file into BIP.  6.   Different layouts Here are the steps to follow when different layouts are needed for  different languages:  1.  Design a brand new layout for your report. For example, here the columns   have a different order than those in the original layout template and a  column is missing. At the same time, the template text strings are translated:  [ 205 ]   Report Translations  You can make changes to the translated template permanently  by clicking on the Translation  Localize Template... menu  option on the toolbar. In this way, when only minor changes  are necessary, you don't need to start your new layout design  from scratch  or worst, with a blank document .  2.  Upload the template into BIP. Be careful to choose the appropriate Locale for   your template, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 206 ]   Locale selection logic My Account interface allows you to choose a Report Locale to determine which  RTF file, and then which XLIFF file, will be used. If an exact match on language- territory is not found, BI Publisher will try to match on the basis of language only.  For example, you have a report template called Sales.rtf uploaded for the ro-RO  locale. BI Publisher will search the RTF template and translation files like this:  Appendix A   	 Sales.rtf  ro_RO   	 Sales.xlf  ro_RO   	 Sales.rtf  ro   	 Sales.xlf  ro   	 Sales.rtf  default    	 Sales.rtf  en_UK   	 Sales.xlf  en_UK   	 Sales.rtf  default   For situations such as different territories, it is recommended that we provide an RTF  or XLF file named for the language only. Suppose that you have:  In this case, when BIP looks for en_CA and this locale is not found, the default  template will be applied and not the template including en as language. To avoid  this, include only Sales_en.rtf or Sales_en.xlf for the language. For this you  need to upload the mentioned files  Sales_en.rtf or Sales_en.xlf  selecting only  the language for the Locale, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 207 ]   Report Translations  Summary You should now be familiar with all kinds of report translations, both from the  theoretical and practical point of view. The step-by-step examples were provided  to identify the differences between the techniques BI Publisher offers and the  circumstances for each of them to be used. We saw that there are many cases in  which report translations are used, but there is not much effort required when  following step-by-step instructions.  [ 208 ]   Migrating Oracle Reports to  BI Publisher  The advantages presented throughout the previous chapters might have convinced  you to use BI Publisher to design your reports. But why not use the same capabilities  on your old Oracle Reports? Beginning with release 10.1.3.3, BI Publisher introduces  the ability to convert Oracle Reports to BI Publisher.  In this chapter, we will see the following:   	 Converting Oracle Reports to BI Publisher prerequisites  	 Conversion steps  Prerequisites To start report conversion, you need to have the following installed on  your computer:   	 Oracle Reports Designer  	 BI Publisher   	  JDK  Installing Oracle Reports Designer You need to install Oracle Reports Designer only if your Oracle Reports are not  already in XML format.    Migrating Oracle Reports to BI Publisher  We will use version 10.1.2.0.2 for this example. To install this version follow the steps  given here:  1.  Download Oracle Developer Suite 10g from:  http:  www.oracle.com technology software products ids   index.html  2.  Run the setup process providing the parameters, as described in the   following screenshot:  [ 210 ]   3.  Select the Complete option for Select Installation Type, as shown in the   following screenshot:  Appendix B  After completing the installation, you should be able to run Oracle Reports Designer  from the menu link, as shown in the following screenshot:  Installing BI Publisher You can skip this step if you are using Oracle EBS.  Download BI Publisher 10.1.3.4 release from:  http:  www.oracle.com technetwork middleware bi-publisher downloads  index.html  Now, follow the setup process to install the BI Publisher.  Installing JDK The conversion utility requires JDK version 1.1.8 or later.  Test your currently installed version, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 211 ]   Migrating Oracle Reports to BI Publisher  In case your version does not satisfy the requirements, get the latest version from:  http:  www.oracle.com technetwork java javase downloads jdk-6u26- download-400750.html  Conversion steps  1.  Search for the aolj.jar, collections.jar, xdocore.jar, and   xmlparserv2-904.jar files on your computer at the location provided in  the following URL: C:\OraHome_1\oc4j_bi\j2ee\home\applications\xmlpserver\  xmlpserver\WEB-INF\lib You may also find these libraries, or the corresponding classes, under JAVA_ TOP  this is a folder on the Oracle Application middle-tier machine  if you are  using Oracle EBS.  2.  Copy the files mentioned before to a location of your choice. In this   example, the C:\oracle\convert folder is used, which is shown in the  following screenshot:  3.  Copy the Oracle Reports that have to be converted into the source folder.  [ 212 ]   4.  Run Oracle Reports Builder and go to the File Conversion tool. Skip this step   if your reports are already in the XML format, as shown in the   following screenshot:  Appendix B  Browse for your .rdf file in the Source field and choose Report XML File   XML  as the Destination Type, as shown in the following screenshot:  Once done, a Conversion successful message is displayed, as shown in the  preceding screenshot.  [ 213 ]   Migrating Oracle Reports to BI Publisher  6.  Now, run the conversion utility.  BIPBatchConversion is the utility to migrate reports from Oracle Reports to  BI Publisher. It takes the following parameters:   	 source  required : Source directory for Oracle Reports files. All reports must   be in the same format, that is, either RDF or XML.   	 target  required : Target directory to create Oracle BI Publisher report   objects. This includes the Oracle BI Publisher Report file  .xdo , the layout  template file  .rtf , the PL SQL package, and the log file.   	 oraclehome  optional : If your reports are in Oracle Reports XML format,   do not specify this parameter. If your reports are not in Oracle Reports XML  format, specify the Oracle home path where Oracle Report Designer  9i or  later version  is installed. Refer to the Install Oracle Reports Designer section  for this. BIPBatchMigration assumes that rwconverter is contained in the  bin directory beneath the Oracle Home path.   	 debug  optional : To run the utility in debug mode and write debug   statements to the log file.  We already converted our reports to XML format, so the oraclehome  parameter won't be needed in this case.  Leave the reports only in XML format in the  source folder.  The command line in our example is: C:\"Program files"\Java\jre6\bin\java -classpath C:\oracle\convert\xdo- core.jar; C:\oracle\convert \collections.zip; C:\oracle\convert\aolj.jar; C:\ oracle\convert \xmlparserv2-904.jar oracle.apps.xdo.rdfparser.BIPBatchCon- version -source C:\oracle\convert\source -target C:\oracle\convert\target Output files are generated in a folder for each report. In our case, the folder  Sales600 contains these files, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 214 ]    	 Sales600.xdo: Report definition file that includes the Data Model. This file is   not needed for EBS users.    	 Sales600_template.xml: It is a Data Template. This is not required for   Oracle BI Publisher Enterprise users because the data template is embedded  in the .xdo file.  Appendix B   	 Sales600S.pls: This is the default PL SQL package.  	 Sales600B.pls: This is the default PL SQL package body.  	 Sales600.rtf: This is the RTF Layout Template.  	 Sales600.log: This is a log file.  	 Sales600_LOV.xml: This is a list of values file.  7.  Load the PL SQL package into the database.  Create the package and the package body from the .pls files, as shown in  the following command lines: SQL> @C:\oracle\convert]target\Sales600\Sales600S.pls SQL> @C:\oracle\convert]target\Sales600\Sales600B.pls  8.  Upload the report to the Oracle BI Publisher repository.  First copy the files to the repository and then refresh the repository metadata.  For this, log on to Oracle BI Publisher with administrator privileges, go to the  Admin page, and select Refresh Metadata from the System Maintenance  section, as shown in the following screenshot:  9.  Test the report and check the conversion log files to identify any manual   modifications needed to complete the conversion.  When converting a complex Oracle Reports report, the Data Template or  PL SQL may contain minor errors and require manual correction. For example,   the conversion utility does not convert any PL SQL format trigger logic present   in the report. Instead the conversion utility writes all the format trigger code to a   log file. You will need to implement any corresponding PL SQL logic as XSL  code. Refer to Appendix C, Debugging Oracle Reports to BIP Migration, for a more  comprehensive example.  [ 215 ]   Migrating Oracle Reports to BI Publisher  Summary Going through the steps mentioned in this chapter should have made you  understand the process of converting Oracle Reports to BI Publisher, that is, how  to meet the prerequisites and the actual conversion steps. The main purpose is to  work on the same platform when designing reports and to take advantage of all the  beautiful features that BI Publisher offers. Appendic C, Debugging Oracle Reports to BIP Migration, will deal with an error that  frequently occurs in the Oracle Reports to BIP migration process.  [ 216 ]   Debugging Oracle Reports to  BIP Migration  In Appendix B, Migrating Oracle Reports to BI Publisher, we went through the  necessary steps involved in converting Oracle Reports to BI Publisher. There   were a few cases mentioned, in which manual correction was needed after the  conversion of a complex Oracle Reports report to BIP. Here, we will have   described one of those cases.  Finding the error In this case, the conversion utility does not convert a PL SQL format trigger logic  present in the report:   Debugging Oracle Reports to BIP Migration  The fields highlighted in red are added in the template to help you quickly indentify  the problem. The missing objects are mentioned in the Form Field Help Text dialog  window, as you can see in the preceding screenshot.  The log file A log file named as your template will show the code behind the missing objects. For  our case we will have:  The following format triggers which are the part of RDF, has not been supported in this Template: --------------------------------------------------------  Object Name : BLN_NO_DATA_FOUND  Object Type : frame ========================================================= PL Sql code        function BLN_NO_DATA_FOUND FormatTrigger return boolean is begin  RETURN :C_count = 0 ;  return  TRUE ; end; --------------------------------------------------------  Correcting the error In order to correct an error, all we have to do is to rewrite the trigger and the  XLS_FO. The following are the alternatives depending on the XML structure:   	  In the case the element is not present:      	 The element is present and the value is not null:   desired behavior          desired behavior     [ 218 ]   Appendix C   	 The element is present, but is null:      desired behavior     As the first case is the suitable match in this example, the XSL-FO code will   be as follows:  According to your data, many other more or less complicated situations can be  encountered. But you have a lot of clues helping you to solve the case. Finally, you  will have your report converted into BIP.
