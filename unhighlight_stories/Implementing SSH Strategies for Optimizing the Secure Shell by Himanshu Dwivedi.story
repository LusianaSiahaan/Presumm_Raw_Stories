It can be described as a protocol, an encryption tool, a client server application, or  a  command  interface. Along  with  its  various  descriptions,  SSH  provides various functions with a single package. SSH’s diverse set of services and the ability to provide those services in a secure manner have allowed it to become a staple in many enterprise networks.  Most  security  professionals  probably  discovered  SSH  very  early  in  their careers and have fallen in love with it ever since. SSH to the security profes- sional is like a donut to Homer Simpson: a godsend. Professionals continually ask themselves if there is anything SSH can’t do. For the security professional, SSH provides everything one could ask for, including a free car wash on week- ends  well, that is what it seems like sometimes . One of the great things about SSH is that not only do security professionals use and love the utility, but non- security technical professionals and nontechnical professionals love it as well. Furthermore,  SSH  is  compared  with  other  security  utilities  in  the  industry, such as RSA SecureID tokens, it is evident that security professionals are the predominant end-users of these other utilities. SecureID tokens are not widely used by nontechnical personnel and are not deployed often in environments that are not closely affiliated with corporate security. On the other hand, SSH is deployed in many Unix workstations servers, Windows workstations, and a variety of network devices such as Cisco routers and switches.   Some books on the market today cover SSH. Unlike most of them, this book does not cover the ins and outs of SSH as a protocol, the encryption modules used in SSH1 and SSH2, or the supported algorithms. Instead, it covers the ins and outs of implementing and optimizing SSH. Think of this book as a tactical guide to SSH: Now that I understand SSH, how can I use it? This book covers the  xix   xx  Introduction  how can I use it part. Covered in detail is how to install, implement, optimize, and support SSH in Unix, Windows, and network architecture environments.  What Secure Shell Is  What is Secure Shell? For the purposes of this book, Secure Shell is a solution, period!  Most  readers  should  have  some  knowledge  of  Secure  Shell,  having used it in a given capacity, read about it, or even deployed it in some manner. I do not explore the theoretical foundations of Secure Shell but rather its prac- tical definition, simply stated as follows:   Secure Shell: A well-balanced and flexible solution that can solve a vari-  ety of security and functionality issues within an organization  To  expand  the  preceding  definition,  the  following  elements  of  SSH  are explored during the course of this book, as are the following solutions SSH provides:  Secure Management Solution Secure Proxy Solution Secure Telnet Solution Secure Remote Access Solution Secure “R” services Solution Secure File Transfer Solution Secure VPN Solution Secure Wireless  802.11  Solution Secure Backup Solution Secure Web Browsing Solution                                  Implementing and Optimizing SSH  The chapters that follow focus on the methods and options for implementing and optimizing Secure Shell. In addition to understanding this book’s primary focus on implementation, it is important to understand that this book does not make recommendations regarding why or when to use SSH. It does, however, make recommendations regarding how to use it. It would not be in your best interest for me to say that SSH should be used in all situations where X and Y exist  where X and Y are specific problems in a given organization . Not only                           Introduction  xxi  would  that  be  a  very  risky  alternative;  it  would  make  me  irresponsible  by  portraying SSH as a silver bullet. There are no silver bullets in the world of security.   Once  an  organization  has  decided  to  implement  SSH  or  is  interested  in learning more about how to optimize it, this book can provide step-by-step guidelines on how to implement SSH in a secure and stable manner. Further- more, once an organization has decided that SSH might be one of few solu- tions  to  a  particular  problem,  this  book  can  describe  the  ways  SSH  can  be optimized, helping the organization determine if SSH is the right solution.  In addition to describing the specific implementation steps for deploying SSH, this book discusses ways to optimize current implementations of SSH. Also, this book can be used by organizations that already have deployed SSH but are interested in learning additional ways to optimize the utility.    To add to the focus of implementation  and to avoid any confusion about this book being a primer on SSH , various chapters throughout the book offer several architectural examples that illustrate the methods for optimizing SSH. For example, the chapter concerning port forwarding has two to three real net- work architectures where there are problems in a given environment, concern- ing  both  security  and  functionality.  The  solutions  that  SSH  can  offer  are discussed in detail in each example. Also, the methods for optimizing SSH, according to the issue discussed in each example, are described in detail in order to satisfy technical and business requirements.   Why More Secure Shell?  One of the many reasons why I wanted to write this book was to explain SSH usage. Despite the flexibility, advantages, features, and, most of all, security of SSH, few implementations of SSH take advantage of all its capabilities. Even the savviest Unix administrators, who have been exposed to SSH a lot longer than many Windows or Macintosh users have, may not know that there is a whole world to SSH besides encrypted Telnet. Features such as port-forward- ing, secure e-mail, proxy, dynamic port forwarding, VPN, and so on are minor when it comes to deploying SSH; however, these features can significantly add to the value of an organization.   Another reason I wanted to write this book was to promote SSH’s ease of use. Many administrators know that using SSH as a replacement for Telnet is quite easy; however, many administrators assume that using SSH as a security file transfer protocol, a port-forwarder, and a VPN solution is quite difficult. Furthermore, many administrators think there is an involved process to con- figuring an SSH server in order to get its full functionality. As I demonstrate in this book, the implementation of SSH as a server is not only quite easy, but   xxii  Introduction  most  of  the  configuration  required  takes  place  on  the  client  rather  than  the server.  Furthermore,  many  environments  that  deploy  SSH  still  use  Telnet,  RSH, Rlogin, and FTP. While there may be problems with interoperability and SSH on various platforms and applications, a lot of organizations use SSH but leave FTP enabled for file transfer  or even worse, use SFTP for file transfer but leave Telnet enabled for command line execution . SSH not only can do both; it can do both with one daemon or service, eliminating the need to have two separate services running on a single machine.   This book provides a detailed guide, with screen shots and steps, for using SSH in a variety of ways. The goal of this book is to be an accessible reference used in data centers to deploy a range of services  from secure FTP to secure e-mail with Microsoft Exchange .  Best Practice Benefits for Security  What are the benefits of using SSH in any type of environment, and why is there a need for utilities like SSH? SSH offers many best practices in terms of security.  Best  practices  are  prerequisites  in  order  to  deploy  an  acceptable amount of security in a given entity. Four of the best practices that SSH offers are:     Authentication: Two-factor authentication     Encryption: Secure  encrypted  communication with 3DES or   equivalent Integrity: MD5 and SHA1 hashing         Authorization: IP DNS filtering  SSH provides two-factor authentication by offering the use of public and private  keys,  in  addition  to  a  username  and  password,  to  authenticate  two SSH  servers.  In  addition  to  providing  two-factor  authentication,  SSH  offers safe  and  encrypted  communication  with  a  variety  of  encryption  standards, including triple-DES  3DES , Blowfish, Two-fish, and so on. SSH also offers packet-level integrity by using MD5 and SHA1 hashing of each session. Lastly, SSH has the ability to permit or restrict nodes based on an IP address or host- name. These four best practices can help defend against many security attacks in sensitive networks that contain critical data.           Introduction xxiii  Defenses  The primary purpose for deploying SSH is security. SSH defends against sev- eral attacks that plague IP  Internet Protocol  version 4 networks, including poor protocols with IPv4, such as Address Resolution Protocol  ARP , Initial Sequence  Numbers   ISN ,  and  various  clear-text  protocols,  such  as  Telnet, RSH, Rlogin, FTP, POP3, IMAP, LDAP, and HTTP.   Because  space  is  limited,  Implementing  SSH  does  not  discuss  in  detail  all types of attacks that SSH defends against. You should be aware of three critical types of security attacks against which SSH is quite effective.  Be aware that while SSH cannot prevent all of these attacks, it has safeguards in place that make it extremely difficult, if not well-nigh impossible, to execute them.  The three major types of security attacks are:  Man-in-the-Middle  MITM  attacks. Man-in-the-Middle attacks occur  against ARP in IPv4 networks. Such attacks allow an unauthorized entity to sniff the network even on a switched environment by capturing the communication between two trusted entities. SSH version 2 prevents attackers from gaining access to communication by fully encrypting it. The chances that an attacker can capture the communication between two entities are minimized, as the communication is in a form that is unreadable to the attacker.  Session hijacking. Session-hijacking attacks occur against the ISN in the  TCP header of a TCP IP packet. An attacker can take advantage of the poor sequence numbers used by the ISN and hijack a session between two trusted entities. SSH can make it virtually impossible for an attacker to view, capture, or attempt to hijack the ISN altogether, although it can- not always make the ISN in a TCP header less predictable.   Sniffing. Sniffing is the simple act of viewing the communication  pack- ets  in a network. SSH provides a strong level of encryption that can pro- tect weak protocols such as Telnet, RSH, Rlogin, FTP, POP3, IMAP, LDAP, and HTTP either by replacing them altogether  for Telnet, RSH, and Rlogin, for example  or by wrapping them within a tunnel  for POP3 . This encryption prevents most, if not all, unauthorized users from sniffing the network.  How This Book Is Organized  This book is organized into three main parts: SSH Basics, Remote Access Solu- tions, and Protocol Replacement. Part One covers the basics of SSH. Chapter 1   xxiv Introduction  gives a broad overview of SSH, which can be used as a refresher for profes- sionals familiar with this utility. It also explores why SSH should be used and some of the major features that make it useful in a network environment.   Chapters 2 and 3 present the various SSH servers and clients that exist on the market today, both commercial and freely downloadable. SSH’s features, functions, and capabilities often differ from each other, sometimes in extreme ways, depending on which client or server is used; therefore, these two chap- ters show the similarities and differences, and positives and negatives of some of the major SSH vendors in the market.   Chapter 4 delves into authentication, a process that covers everything from username and password to key-based authentication with digital certificates.  To round out Part One, Chapter 5 explores how SSH can be used on network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, and other devices that are tradi- tionally managed by Telnet. In addition, Chapter 5 covers management meth- ods to be used with SSH.   Part Two shifts to the different remote access solutions available with SSH. Chapter 6 examines the basics of port forwarding, from theory and setup to configuration,  and  Chapter  7  discusses  port  forwarding  in  greater  detail, explaining specifically how it functions as an enterprise-wide remote access solution.  Part Three provides a detailed discussion of protocol replacement with SSH. Chapter 8 describes the versatility of SSH. This chapter not only investigates how SSH can be used to replace insecure protocols such as RSH, Rlogin, and FTP but also shows how to use SSH as a secure file transfer solution, a secure chat  server,  and  a  server  backup  solution.  Chapter  9  describes  methods  for using SSH with SOCKS proxies and dynamic port forwarding, plus ways in which SSH can be used as a secure Web and a secure wireless solution.  Chapter 10 presents three case studies involving remote access, secure wire- less  connectivity,  and  secure  file  transfer  in  mixed  operating  environments. Each  case  study  describes  a  problem  situation,  presents  several  business requirements, and provides a solution involving SSH.  Who Should Read This Book  Implementing SSH is intended for professionals working in data centers. The material  presented  in  the  chapters  that  follow  is  essential,  need-to-know  information  on  how  to  implement  SSH  from  small  networks  to  enterprise  networks.  This  book  covers  common  “How-Tos,”  providing  the  necessary implementation  steps  and  detailed  descriptions  of  all  the  services  SSH  can provide to an environment. You are encouraged to use this book as a quick ref- erence for how to do certain tasks. It is not necessarily meant to be read from   Introduction  xxv  start to finish; thus, individual chapters are self-supporting, without requiring any prior knowledge of the other chapters. For example, if you need or want to learn how to use SSH as a proxy service, you can simply go to Chapter 9, “Proxy Technologies in a Secure Web Environment,” and begin reading.

In this book we will discuss, reference, or describe the following imple- mentations of SSH:     OpenSSH  www.openssh.org     OpenSSH—Win32  http:  lexa.mckenna.edu sshwindows        SSH Communications Commercial  www.ssh.com      VShell and Secure CRT  www.vandyke.com     Putty  www.putty.com       F-Secure  www.fsecure.com      Mindterm—SSH over Java with Web browsers   www.appgate.com mindterm      WinSCP  http:  winscp.vse.cz eng                    PA R T  One  SSH Basics    C H A P T E R1  Overview of SSH  Secure Shell  SSH  is a program used to secure communication between two entities. SSH uses a client server architecture, where SSH clients, available on all  versions  of  Windows,  different  flavors  of  Unix,  and  various  Macintosh operating systems, connect to SSH servers, which can be operating systems such as Sun Solaris or Microsoft Windows or devices such as a Cisco router. In its  simplest  sense,  SSH  is  used  to  execute  remote  commands  securely  on another entity, often used as a replacement for Telnet and the Berkeley “R” protocols such as remote shell  RSH  and remote login  Rlogin , discussed fur- ther in Chapter 8. In addition to executing remote commands, SSH is used as a secure  remote  copy  utility,  replacing  traditional  protocols  such  as  the  File Transfer Protocol  FTP  and Remote Copy Protocol  RCP .   Despite the name Secure Shell, SSH is not a shell at all. Unlike other tradi- tional shells found in different flavors of Unix, such as BASH, KORN, and C, SSH provides encryption between entities, not a shell interface between enti- ties. The encryption methods and algorithms used for SSH are all based on industry standards such as 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, and AES.   The paragraphs that follow discuss the basics of SSH: how it works, what it can be used for, and why it is tremendously flexible. This chapter is useful for readers who do not have experience with SSH or who have never been  3   4  Chapter 1  introduced to it aside from a casual reference. Advanced users may want to skip to the next chapter. Specifically, this chapter discusses the following topics:    Differences between SSH1 and SSH2   Uses of SSH  Client server architecture for SSH SSH’s Encryption Architecture Basic miscues with SSH Types of SSH clients servers Basic setup of SSH Summary of SSH’s optimal uses  Differences between SSH1 and SSH2  SSH version 1  SSH1  was the first iteration of SSH; however, SSH1 had several limitations, including the use of port forwarding, which led to the second iter- ation of SSH: SSH version 2  SSH2 . In addition to its limitations, SSH1 had several security issues associated with its cryptography, which also led to the establishment of SSH2.  The  differences  between  SSH1  and  SSH2  may  seem  minor  to  most  end- users; however, the differences are quite significant. SSH1 and SSH2 are two different  protocols.  SSH2  was  completely  rewritten  from  scratch,  giving  it more security, performance, and flexibility than SSH1. Also, SSH1 and SSH2 encrypt  communication  differently,  which  mitigated  several  of  the  docu- mented issues with SSH1’s encryption methods. SSH1 is not being developed now, whereas SSH2 is becoming the standard when referring to SSH. There are still many implementations of SSH1, but the implementations are becoming fewer and more in favor of SSH2. For the purposes of this book, I do not refer to, use, or demonstrate the use of SSH1. I concentrate solely on the usage and optimization of SSH2. The following is a short list of the advantages of using SSH2 instead of SSH1:  Significant improvements with security and speed  Considerably greater flexibility with Secure File Transfer Protocol  SFTP   Interoperability with several different public key algorithms, including Diffie-Hellman  see http:  www.rsasecurity.com rsalabs faq 3-6-1. html for more information on Diffie-Hellman      New architecture that requires far less code usage                                             Overview of SSH  5  Various Uses of SSH  SSH can be used in a variety of ways, depending on your network environ- ment and business requirements. The flexibility that SSH provides in any type of dynamic or static environment gives it a significant advantage over other utilities  in  the  industry,  both  security-focused  utilities,  such  as  IPSEC,  and nonsecurity-focused utilities, such as FTP. SSH can be used for multiple users with just a single process  daemon  or service running on the server, with most of the configuration required on the client side. During the course of this book, I explore the various uses of SSH; however, I take the better half of this chap- ter to describe the different uses of SSH to illustrate its full capabilities:  Security Remote command execution Remote file transfer Remote network access  Secure management Proxy services  Security The implementation of SSH in a trusted or nontrusted environment can pro- tect against many of the security issues with Internet Protocol version 4  IPv4 . IPv4 has been plagued with security issues ranging from poor initial sequence numbers   ISN   in  TCP header  packets,  which  leads  to  session  hijacking,  to unauthenticated  address  resolution  packets   ARPs   being  distributed  to  the network. The use of SSH not only protects against the common LAN attacks described previously; it guards against the following types of attacks as well:  Spoofing of IP addresses. A remote device, usually an operating system, can change its IP address and pretend to be a different source, usually a trusted source.   Data modification. As data is passed through corporate networks and  the Internet, any intermediary can modify the data while it is in transit. ARP pollution. This occurs when incorrect ARP packets to redirect and  capture sensitive data are distributed.  Session hijacking. This occurs when individuals guess or predict the  ISN in TCP headers, gaining control of Telnet and RSH sessions.  Clear-text data. This occurs when critical or sensitive clear-text data, such  as usernames, passwords, and commands, is intercepted.                           6  Chapter 1  The preceding list is not exhaustive, as SSH can protect against many other attacks, which may be direct or indirect. Another reason SSH is so popular is its  ability  to  protect  against  network  sniffing  on  both  Local Area  Networks  LANs   and  Wide  Area  Networks   WANs .  That  feature  allows  network administrators  and  server  administrators  to  manage  and  connect  to  remote systems without the risk of losing sensitive information to unauthorized users. Figure 1.1 shows a Telnet packet between two entities in clear-text:  Notice in Figure 1.1 that the username is in the clear-text, “kusum,” and the password is also in the clear-text, “password.” The session can be captured by any type of network sniffer, as long as the session is in clear-text. Some of the most common and vulnerable connections that often get targeted for sensitive information  such  as  passwords  are  Telnet,  FTP,  POP3,  SMTP,  IMAP,  SNMP, and HTTP. Figure 1.2 shows an SSH packet between the same two entities used in Figure 1.1.  Notice in Figure 1.2 that none of the information is in clear-text or compre- hendible, thus being encrypted. This connection mirrors the Telnet connection  remote command line execution , but with significantly greater security over the password and the username “kusum.”   SSH provides the following three key security features:  Encryption. SSH encrypts all communication with a variety of cipher  algorithms to choose from.   Two-factor authentication. SSH can require a username password or  public key for authentication. In addition, these two options can be used together for two-factor authentication  Integrity. SSH can create a digital signature of the data transferred from  one entity to another, ensuring that the data has not been modified or tampered with in any way.

Remote Command Line Execution SSH offers the ability to execute commands on a remote entity, which can be an operating  system  or  a  network  device.  In  the  Unix  world,  SSH  gives  the remote user the shell listed in the passwd file of the  etc directory; however, the communication is still encrypted over the wire. For example, based on the following Unix passwd file:  root:x:0:0:root: root: bin bash kusum:x:4:101:kusum: home kusum: bin bash shreya:x:4:102:shreya: home shreya: bin bash sudhanshu:x:4:103:sudhanshu: home sudhanshu: bin csh sangeeta:x:4:104:sangeeta: home sangeeta: bin ksh jignesh:x:4:105:jignesh: home jignesh: bin csh kanchan:x:4:106:kanchan: home kanchan: bin bash katie:x:4:107:katie: home katie: bin csh amit:x:4:108:amit: home amit: bin bash rohan:x:4:109:rohan: home rohan: bin sh anand:x:4:110:anand: home anand: bin bash amiee:x:4:111:amiee: home amiee: bin sh neeraja:x:4:112:neeraja: home neeraja: bin sh jum4nj1:x:4:113:jum4nj1: home jum4nj1: sbin nologin  root gets a bash shell, sudhanshu gets a C shell, neeraja gets a Korn shell, and the user jum4nj1 is not allowed to log in, since the shell allocated to jum4nj1’s   8  Chapter 1  account is nologin, despite making a valid SSH connection. The SSH daemon running on the Unix server would query the information from the passwd file in order to process usernames for authentication. SSH does not use its own username  and  passwords  for  authentication;  it  uses  the  operating  system’s username and password information, which makes the process a lot easier to use. The result would be that valid accounts with an appropriate shell in the passwd file would be authenticated and given the correct shell, while being encrypted with SSH.  The process works a bit differently in the Windows world, but the result is still the same. Since Windows does not have different shell options, all SSH users would be given a command prompt  cmd.exe  or some form of the com- mand prompt itself. Similar to the Unix world, SSH services in Windows use the existing password database  the SAM or ntds.dit files  for authentication.   Remote File Transfer Remote file transfer is similar to remote command line execution. SSH offers the ability to retrieve and send files to and from a remote entity. Remote file transfer  actually  comes  in  two  forms  in  the  Unix  world.  SSH  offers  Secure Copy Protocol  SCP  in some installations of SSH1 and SSH2, or Secure File Transfer Protocol  SFTP , in most installations of SSH2. In the Windows world, only SFTP exists. Both SCP and SFTP provide similar, if not the same, function, which is to put and get files from a remote entity in a secure fashion. SFTP uses the existing SSH daemon on Unix and the existing SSH service on Windows. There is no extra step required to enable secure file transfer; it is automatically enabled on most versions of SSH2. Many SSH clients also come packaged with SCP or SFTP clients; therefore, the use and execution of the additional func- tionality  is  very  straightforward.  Furthermore,  there  are  SCP SFTP clients only, such as PuTTY, which are discussed in Chapter 3. But several installa- tions of SSH clients have some type of file transfer utility included.   Similar to the Telnet session described previously, most SCP or SFTP instal- lations are able to protect against the weaknesses of their counterpart: clear- text  communication  of  FTP.  Figure  1.3  shows  an  FTP packet  between  two entities in clear text.  Figure 1.3 Contents of an FTP packet.   Overview of SSH  9  Figure 1.4 Contents of an SFTP packet.  Notice in Figure 1.3 that the FTP username  kusum  and password  dwivedi  is in clear-text, similar to the Telnet session described previously. Furthermore, since FTP provides remote file service, SCP and SFTP provide the same service with a significant amount of security. Also, with a single service, remote com- mand  line  execution  and  secure  file  transfer  can  be  provided,  instead  of enabling two different services such as Telnet and FTP. Figure 1.4 shows the same two entities but uses SFTP instead.  Notice in Figure 1.4 that none of the information is in clear-text and readable to anyone; thus, it is encrypted. In addition, Figure 1.5 shows the SFTP client interface, which is similar to many FTP interfaces.  Figure 1.5 SFTP client for secure file transfer.   10  Chapter 1  While  SCP and  SFTP are  good  replacements  for  FTP,  in  certain  environ- ments  they  also  can  replace  other  risky  protocols  such  as  Windows’  Server Message Block  SMB  and Unix’s Network File Server  NFS . Both SMB and NFS  networking  have  had  problems  with  security  and  continue  to  plague many networks today. The use of SFTP for a common file server can reduce or even eliminate reliance on SMB or NFS networking. Also, using a standard protocol such as SFTP, both Unix and Windows clients can access the same server, since both can communicate and use SSH but cannot necessarily com- municate with SMB or NFS. Note that SSH can make the file-transfer process longer than FTP, NFS, or SMB; however, in many cases, the delay is minor.   Remote Network Access  In addition to providing remote command line and remote file transfer utili- ties, SSH can provide access to remote networks, creating something similar to a virtual private network  VPN . SSH can not only provide VPN functionally in the typical sense of the word  PPP over SSH , but can also provide services that many VPN users require, such as e-mail, file transfer, and Intranet services with port forwarding. Also, using SSH as a VPN solution is far less expensive than using a typical VPN solution. When considering any SOHO VPN appli- ance, a VPN card in a current network device, or any full-scale VPN server  device, the cost of any such device is not any different from the cost of most other network devices, but far exceeds the cost of SSH server implementations. SSH as a VPN solution not only provides access to services such as e-mail, internal file servers, and Intranet services, but with the use of advanced tun- neling,  it  provides  access  to  X11  services,  remote  applications,  and  remote tunneling.   Secure Management Many  networks  today  adhere  to  poor  management  practices,  leaving  their critical systems and devices vulnerable to management attacks. Many envi- ronments secure network devices and operating systems and create a properly segmented  network  perimeter,  but  then  they  connect  to  sensitive  systems  devices with poor management protocols over wide-open or nonexistent man- agement networks. The clear-text protocols mentioned earlier, such as Telnet, FTP, and SNMP, are not the only poor management protocols in question, but many management applications have not secured their communication appro- priately or have known issues identified with them. Older versions of certain management  applications  such  as  pcAnywhere,  Virtual  Network  Computer  VNC ,  and  Citrix  have  either  had  poor  encrypted  management  protocols, which  were  reversed  through  engineering,  or  do  not  require  any  type  of   Overview of SSH  11  encrypted  management  for  the  sensitive  communication.  Furthermore,  any attacker can download the client version of these applications and attempt to connect to the application’s agent with a captured or guessed username and password. This assumes that there is no separate management network that the attacker cannot access, which prevents him or her from connecting to any agents.  While  separate  management  networks  are  ideal  for  safe  and  secure management,  implementation  of  out-of-band  management  networks  is  not only very costly but adds a significant amount of complexity to a network.   SSH can be used as a secure management alternative by providing encrypted communication for any type of system or device management. Not only does SSH provide secure communication for remote command line management, which is the most popular management method on most Unix systems; it pro- vides secure communication of graphic user interfaces  GUIs  with less secure applications such as VNC. In addition, SSH can provide two-factor authenti- cation for all management methods by requiring a public key and password for management access. As best practice, two-factor authentication should be used  for  all  management  methods,  as  it  reduces  the  number  of  brute-force attacks, password-guessing attacks, and dependencies on passwords for secu- rity. SSH can enforce two-factor authentication quite easily, which supports a critical best practice in management security. Lastly, SSH can eliminate the need for an out-of-band management network, removing a significant amount of cost and adding administrative simplicity in managing the systems and devices. The following list describes the advantages of using SSH for management:  Encrypted management Encrypted GUI management with port forwarding  discussed further in Chapter 6  Significant cost savings Elimination of separate out-of-band management networks    Added simplicity  Two-factor authentication  Proxy Services SSH can also be used to secure proxy services. Proxy servers have been identi- fied to contain established benefits to which SSH can add value. Deploying SSH as a proxy service to access remote systems, devices, and applications in a safe and easy manner is one of the strongest, but most unused, benefits of SSH. SSH proxies can work with traditional proxy services such as SOCKS in order to secure the application from end to end. A SOCKS server can be set up in an                         12  Chapter 1  environment and tunnel traffic via SSH. This setup allows remote applications such as SQL, Oracle, FTP, HTTP, and MySQL to be available with client appli- cations such as SQL*PLUS and Query Analyzer over a secure channel.   SOCKS and SSH proxies can eliminate the need for an abundance of port forwarding, as discussed in Chapter 9, and can provide secure access to appli- cations that may not be available from the network perimeter.   Unlike  the  use  of  Secure  Sockets  Layer   SSL   in  encrypted  Web  traffic  denoted by the HTTPS  Hyper-text Transfer Protocol over SSL  prefix in URLS , SSH proxies can be used in a couple of ways to secure Web traffic over hostile networks, such as the Internet or wireless networks. SSH proxies can be used to connect to remote Web servers running on internal networks, by using HTTP tunneling over SSH, over the Internet. This function adds application security and Web security when internal systems are accessed from remote sites.  Client Server Architecture for SSH   SSH uses client server architecture in its implementation. An SSH server can be deployed and allow several SSH clients to connect to it. The architecture is not unlike any other client server architecture, where the server portion of the program is running a daemon or service that usually listens on port 22. SSH does provide the ability for the daemon service to listen on any port; however, it must be listening on a TCP connection. SSH has a configuration file, where the different options can be configured, such as password public key authen- tication, port options, and home directories. SSH clients just need to know the IP address of the SSH server  or hostname  and the port on which it is listen- ing, such as port 22. Based on the configuration of the SSH server, such as login requirements, the client just needs to authenticate to the server with the pre- defined requirements and get access to the session, whether it is SSH or the built-in SFTP functionality. Figure 1.6 shows a very simple example of the SSH architecture.  SSH client authentication request  SSH server grants denies access  based on authentication credentials  SSH session begins if  authenticated appropriately  SSH Client  SSH Server  Figure 1.6 SSH Communication from an SSH client to an SSH server.   Overview of SSH  13  As shown in Figure 1.6, the SSH process is as follows:  The SSH client on the left provides authentication to the SSH server on the right. In the initial connection, the client receives a host key of the server; therefore, in all subsequent connections, the client will know it is connecting to the same SSH server. This places less emphasis on the IP address of the SSH server, which can be easily spoofed, and more emphasis on the host key of the server, which cannot be spoofed very easily.  The SSH server determines if the client is authorized to connect to the SSH service by verifying the username password or public key that the client has presented for authentication. This process is completely encrypted. If the SSH server authenticates the client and the client is authorized, the SSH session begins between the two entities. All communication is completely encrypted.  The client server architecture for SSH provides the ability for clients to have a single source for authentication and or authorization. The single source for authentication authorization  allows  access  only  to  the  SSH  service,  while access to various other services such as e-mail, intranets, extranets, and IRC requires further authentication. Also, with the use of SSH proxies described previously, a single source of authentication can provide access to applications without the need for more usernames and passwords.   SSH’s Encryption Architecture  One of the many benefits of SSH is that it provides a fully encrypted protocol for transferring information, but what is the encryption architecture that SSH uses, and how is it deployed? This book does not explore in detail the encryp- tion algorithms used or how they are implemented in SSH  since optimization and implementation are the focuses of this book , but I do briefly examine the architecture in order to provide some background knowledge of its deployment.  SSH’s implementation architecture is just as flexible as the protocol itself. SSH is compatible with the major encryption algorithms used today, including the following:  3DES Blowfish Twofish  128 and 192                            14  Chapter 1    AES  128, 192, and 256    Arc Four  CAST    DES RC4  Any of the preceding encryption algorithms can be used for the ciphers for the SSH connection. Most of the ciphers are well supported, but the use of DES is strongly discouraged for the more secure 3DES option.   In addition to the preceding cipher algorithms, SSH offers Message Authen- tication Code  MAC  algorithm hashes. Two of the choices supported in most SSH implementations are MD5 and SHA1. MAC algorithm hashes are used for data integrity. Data transferred from one entity to another is hashed with a unique cryptographic signature, differentiating it from other data. The crypto- graphic  signature,  generated  with  MD5  or  SHA1  hashes,  does  not  change under  any  circumstances  from  one  entity  to  the  next.  This  ensures  that  the entity receiving the data has obtained it without any modification, tampering, or general abuse by unauthorized entities.   Basic Miscues with SSH  Many protocols used in enterprise networks have several security issues. SSH is no different. SSH offers a wide variety of solutions, but it is important to mention that SSH has had security issues, including severe issues that may result in remote access to unauthorized users. I do not discuss all the security issues  associated  with  OpenSSH  or  other  variants  of  SSH.  I  do,  however, encourage  awareness  that  SSH,  like  any  program  or  service,  needs  to  be patched on a regular basis. Inform your internal patch management process and network operations personnel to patch and monitor SSH services on a reg- ular basis.   Some of the security issues identified with SSH involve buffer overflows, incorrect X11 forwarding, weak Challenge Responses handling, remote infor- mation leakage, and privilege escalation.

To confirm that the service has started, type netstat –an and you should see the same results as in Figure 1.20.  Optimal Uses of SSH  SSH  can  be  optimized  in  a  variety  of  ways,  both  for  security  purposes  and functionality purposes. One of the great things about SSH is that it can be opti- mized for so many different things, usually with a single installation. Follow- ing is a list of issues that SSH can help solve. This list presents different options that can be addressed by SSH:  Secure Remote Access solution  VPN  via the Internet Remote access to internal applications, such as Road Warrior applica- tions  Time and Expense  Secure file sharing  replacing NFS, CIFS, and SMB  Secure command line execution Secure GUI management  X11 connections and port forwarding  Secure Wireless connections                           30  Chapter 1  As you can see in the preceding list, SSH can address a variety of network issues that concern security and functionality. For example, the process of port forwarding an application protocol, such as Windows Terminal Server, may not necessarily be a security requirement, but might be a functional require- ment that limits the number of holes punched though a firewall. This allows a single  firewall  rule  to  allow  access  from  outside  connections  to  the  internal SSH server and to port forward other applications, such as Windows Terminal Server’s 3389 port, to internal hosts.   On the other hand, there could be a security requirement that all manage- ment  traffic  should  not  only  be  encrypted  but  should  enforce  two-factor authentication. By setting up an SSH proxy that requires two-factor authenti- cation, all clients are required to use a username password and public key for authentication, while all information is encrypted. These uses fulfill the secu- rity requirements of the network without the extra costs and complexities of a separate solution.  The  benefits  of  using  and  optimizing  SSH  will  continue  to  grow. As  this book unfolds, I will explore the different methods for using SSH on both Unix and Windows environments for security and functionality. I will also demon- strate many examples of using SSH with the greatest amount of flexibility to meet the needs of complex and convoluted networks.   Summary  In this chapter, some of the basics of SSH are discussed. Discussions about the differences between SSH1 and SSH2 and the different uses of SSH itself estab- lish an understanding of the protocol. The chapter also addresses the architec- ture  of  SSH,  both  client server  and  encryption  architecture,  with  a  brief description of the types of SSH servers and clients. The chapter concludes with a detailed, step-by-step guide to installing SSH. This provides a basic under- standing of the protocol as well as basic setup of the application. In the next two chapters, I discuss the basic implementation and setup of several different SSH servers and clients, allowing you to proceed with optimal usages for SSH in Chapter 4 and the rest of the book.   From  this  point  forward,  you  should  have  two  SSH  servers  deployed  in some type of network environment: one Unix based and one Windows based.    C H A P T E R2  SSH Servers  There are three main SSH servers that provide different types of functionality and usage: OpenSSH, SSH Communications’ SSH server, and VanDyke Soft- ware’s VShell SSH server. In chapter one, we install all three of these servers; however, we do not discuss the configuration, the uses, and the different fea- tures of these servers. While the three main SSH servers offer similar SSH ser- vices, they provide different levels of functionality, several of which may be better for your environment than others. The type of SSH server you use can significantly affect the type of SSH experience you have. For example, several SSH servers offer both command line access and secure file transfer; however, if SSH is being deployed for port forwarding only  discussed in Chapters 6 and 7  or for file transfer, giving the user command line access may not be acceptable.  This chapter discusses the three main SSH servers available for Unix and Windows. Also, the focus of the chapter is on selected configuration items and the  menus  of  the  three  SSH  servers,  in  terms  of  customization  and  optimal usage. The following SSH servers are examined in this chapter:  31   32  Chapter 2    OpenSSH server    Unix and Windows SSH Communications’ SSH server   Unix  *Windows  VanDyke’s Software VShell SSH server   Windows  OpenSSH  OpenSSH servers are available on both Windows and Unix environments. The Windows version is actually a port of OpenSSH’s Unix version using the pop- ular Cygwin utility  see www.cygwin.com for more details . While the Win- dows port of OpenSSH uses Cygwin, note that the port is not a full installation of  Cygwin  and  does  not  require  additional  Cygwin  utilities,  which  is  ideal since Cygwin requires a separate installation procedure. Since both the Unix and  Windows  versions  of  OpenSSH  use  the  same  configuration  file  for  the SSH server, the sshd_config file, I discuss the file itself in detail. It can apply to both Windows and Unix platforms. To view the configuration file, enter the following commands.  On Unix:  cd  etc ssh more sshd_config  On Windows:  C:\cd “Program Files”\OpenSSH\bin C:\Programe Files\OpenSSH\bin\type sshd_config  NOTE All lines in the sshd_config file that are changed must be uncommented  the  must be deleted from the beginning of the line .   The first section I present is the simple network configuration:  Port 22 Protocol 2,1 ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 ListenAddress ::                       Table 2.1 describes the first four options in the sshd_config file.   SSH Servers  33  Table 2.1 Options in the sshd_config File  OPTION  Port  DESCRIPTION  Sets the port number for SSH to listen on. The default port is 22; however, listening on several  ports, including other nonstandard ports, such as  80, 443, or 8080, may be optimal, since business  travelers may not be able to make outbound connections on port 22, but since port 80 or 443 are usually available. To listen on multiple ports, add the following lines:  Port 22 Port 80 Port 443 Port 8080  Allows the usage of only SSH version 1, SSH version 2, or both. Since SSH version 1 is more insecure, it may be a good option to only use version 2; however, several devices do not support SSH version 2 yet. To use only SSH version two, add the following line: Protocol 2  Sets the IP address to have the SSH daemon listen on. The default, which is 0.0.0.0, enables the SSH services on all interfaces. If there are interfaces where SSH should not be listening, such as the external interface of a firewall, remove 0.0.0.0 and add the appropriate IP addresses. To listen on only select interfaces, addl the following lines:  ListenAddress 172.16.1.1 ListenAddress 192.168.0.1  Protocol  ListenAddress  The next section discusses the host-key section. The host-key section dis- cusses parameters around the SSH server’s host key, which is the fingerprint used to identify the SSH server.    HostKey for protocol version 1  HostKey  etc ssh ssh_host_key  HostKeys for protocol version 2  HostKey  etc ssh ssh_host_rsa_key  HostKey  etc ssh ssh_host_dsa_key  This section of the sshd_config file is fairly straightforward. It simply states the location of the host-key file for both the SSH version 1 format and the SSH   34  Chapter 2  version 2 format. Also, for SSH version 2, the section states the location of both the RSA and DSA keys.   The next section addresses the server key:   Lifetime and size of ephemeral version 1 server key KeyRegenerationInterval 3600 ServerKeyBits 768  This section sets specifics on the server key. The KeyRegenerationInterval is the  time,  in  seconds,  to  regenerate  the  server  key;  the  ServerKeyBits  is  the number of bits to be used.  The next section addresses logging:   Logging obsoletes QuietMode and FascistLogging SyslogFacility AUTH LogLevel INFO  This section sets the logging option for the SSH service. The differentiation between  QuiteMode  and  FascistLogging  is  that  QuiteMode  logs  only  fatal errors, whereas FascistLogging enables verbose logging. SyslogFacility speci- fies the syslog code to use when logging messages from SSH, such as Daemon and Auth. Loglevel specifies the level used when logging messages from SSH, such as only informational messages  INFO .  The next section addresses authentication options with SSH:   Authentication LoginGraceTime 120 PermitRootLogin yes StrictModes yes  RSAAuthentication yes PubkeyAuthentication yes AuthorizedKeysFile  Table 2.2 Authentication Options  OPTION  LoginGraceTime  Table 2.2 describes the authentication options available for the SSH server.  .ssh authorized_keys  DESCRIPTION  The amount of time the user has to complete the authentication process. Specifically, from the time the user initiates the connection to the time the user enters his or her username password or public private key password.   SSH Servers  35  Table 2.2   continued OPT  OPTION  PermitRootLogin  StrictModes  PubkeyAuthentication  AuthorizedKeysFile  DESCRIPTION  Option to allow  yes  or disallow  no  the root user to log in to the SSH session. Best practice is to restrict root access and have only users ‘su’ or ‘sudo’ to root. Also, if the root account must be able to log in directly, the value of “nopwd” can allow root to log in directly, but only with public-key authentication.  Enables  yes  or disables  no  the checking of a users’ permission in their home directory and rhosts files before accepting authentication. This should be set to yes to protect against world-writeable files in home directories.  Option to allow public-key authentication; possible values are yes and no.  The directory where the user’s public key will be stored. The default is .ssh authorized_keys, which is the users’ home directory in the .ssh folder  for example,  home   .ssh authorized_keys on Program Files\OpenSSH\.ssh on Windows .  RSAAuthentication  Option to allow RSA authentication.  Under the authentication section in the ssh_config file is an authentication option for using rhosts with RSH. While rhosts usage is not recommended due to its poor security standards, the following lines address rhost configuration options:   rhosts authentication should not be used RhostsAuthentication no  Don’t read the user’s ~ .rhosts and ~ .shosts files IgnoreRhosts yes  For this to work you will also need host keys in  etc ssh ssh_known_hosts RhostsRSAAuthentication no  similar for protocol version 2 HostbasedAuthentication no  Change to yes if you don’t trust ~ .ssh known_hosts for  RhostsRSAAuthentication and HostbasedAuthentication IgnoreUserKnownHosts no  Table 2.3 describes the rhost authentication options available for the SSH  server.   36  Chapter 2  Table 2.3 Rhost Configuration Options  OPTION  DESCRIPTION  RhostAuthenication  To allow rhosts authentication   Ignore Rhosts  To ignore  yes  or read  no  rhosts files in the users home directory, stored in .rhosts or .shosts files  RhostsRSAAuthenication  To attempt rhosts authentication from RSA host keys  HostbasedAuthenication  Enable  yes  or disable  no  host-based authentication under SSH version 2  IgnoreUserKnownHosts  Ignore  no  or read  yes  the known hosts file in the users’ home directory   The last authentication section for the sshd_config file addresses more pass-  word options, including Kerberos usage:   To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here! PasswordAuthentication yes PermitEmptyPasswords no   Change to no to disable s key passwords ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes   Kerberos options KerberosAuthentication no KerberosOrLocalPasswd yes KerberosTicketCleanup yes  AFSTokenPassing no   Kerberos TGT Passing only works with the AFS kaserver KerberosTgtPassing no  Table 2.4 describes the password and Kerberos authentication options avail-  able for the SSH server.   Table 2.4 Password and Kerberos Options  OPTION  DESCRIPTION  PasswordAuthentication  To enable  yes  or disable  no  password authentication.  PermitEmptyPasswords  To allow  yes  or disallow  no  the use of blank passwords.   SSH Servers  37  Table 2.4   continued OPT  OPTION  DESCRIPTION  ChallengeResponse Authentication  Enable  yes  or disable  no  challenge response  authentication. Challenge Response authentication occurs when the server sends the client a challenge; the client’s response will determine if authentication is allowed.   Kerberos Authentication  To enable  yes  or disable  no  Kerberos authentication, which involves session tickets.  KerberosOrLocalPasswd  KerberosTicketCleanup  AFSTokenPassing  KerberosTgtPassing  To permit  yes  Kerberos or local-system passwords for authentication.  To enable  yes  or disable  no  the ability to automatically delete the Kerberos ticket upon logout.  To enable  yes  or disable  no  the ability to use AFS tokens for authentication.  To enable  yes  or disable  no  the ability to use Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets for authentication.  The next section of the sshd_config file addresses X11 options that can be  used with forwarding:   X11Forwarding no X11DisplayOffset 10 X11UseLocalhost yes  X11 forwarding can be enabled or disabled in this section of the sshd_config file. If X11 forwarding is enabled, the offset can be set, where 10 is the default, and the option to use the localhost can be enabled, which is the most typical installation of X11 forwarding. Using the localhost to forward X11 connections allows all X11 traffic to prorogate from the local machine.   The last section of the sshd_config file addresses a variety of options that can be set with the service, such as printing, banner information, and subsystems:  PrintMotd yes PrintLastLog yes KeepAlive yes UseLogin no UsePrivilegeSeparation yes PermitUserEnvironment no Compression yes   38  Chapter 2  MaxStartups 10  no default banner path Banner  some path VerifyReverseMapping no   override default of no subsystems Subsystem    sftp     usr libexec sftp-server  Table 2.5 describes the various miscellaneous options that are available for  the SSH server.  Table 2.5 Miscellaneous Options for the SSH Server  OPTION  PrintMotd  PrintLastLog  UseLogin  UserPrivilegeSeparation  PermitUserEnvironment  Compression  Banner  DESCRIPTION  Enables  yes  or disables  no  any text located in the motd  Message of the day  file   etc motd  to be displayed at login. This is very useful since messages can be displayed to all users who are logging in to the system, such as system downtime, security issues, and so on.   Enables  yes  or disables  no  information to be displayed to the screen about the last time a user logged in to the service.  Enables  yes  or disables  no  the authentication process to be handled internally using  usr bin login instead of the SSH utility.  Enables Disables the use of separate privileges for users using the SSH service.  Allow  yes  or disallow  no  users to have their environment variables loaded after authentication.  Enable  yes  or disable  no  compression of the SSH transmission process.    Path to the file that holds the banner messages that will be displayed after login.  Subsystem sftp  Path to the secure file transfer subsystem.  You may have noticed that many of the options in the sshd_config file are specific to Unix implementations of OpenSSH. While a full sshd_config file can be used on Windows platforms, many of the items will not apply, since they do not exist in the Windows world, such as Syslog and rhost authentica- tion. Once you have opened the sshd_config on the Windows machine, you should see only an abbreviated portion of the bigger sshd_config file on Unix, as the following code shows:   SSH Servers  39  HostKey                          ssh ssh_host_key HostDSAKey                       ssh ssh_host_dsa_key PidFile                          ssh sshd.pid Protocol                        2 Port                            22  PermitRootLogin                 yes PasswordAuthentication          yes IgnoreRhosts                    yes IgnoreUserKnownHosts            yes RhostsAuthentication            no RhostsRSAAuthentication         no RSAAuthentication               no  Subsystem       sftp     ssh sftp-server  Despite the abbreviated portion of the sshd_config file, all the entries have  the same definition described in the previous file portion.  SSH Communications’ SSH server  SSH Communications’ SSH servers are also available on both Windows and Unix environments. The sshd2_config file is used by SSH Communications’ SSH server for all configuration management for the service. The Windows version has a different configuration utility, which uses a graphical user inter- face   GUI   to  display  and  report  changes  to  the  sshd2_config  configuration file. On the other hand, the Unix version provides only the sshd2_config file for configuration management without any extra configuration tools. Since the Unix and Windows versions provide different configuration utilities, I address the sshd2_config file first, since both platforms either rely  Unix  or refer  Win- dows  to this file for configuration; then I address the Windows GUI for con- figuration management.  SSH Communications’ SSH Server: Unix  To view the configuration file, enter the following commands:  cd  etc ssh2 more sshd2_config  SSH Communications’ sshd2_config file is similar to the sshd_config file of OpenSSH; however, there are many differences that distinguish the two. The following paragraphs discuss the various sections of the sshd2_config file.   40  Chapter 2  General  The general section of the sshd2_config file should look similar to the following:   General     VerboseMode                   no     QuietMode                     yes     ForcePTTYAllocation           no     SyslogFacility                AUTH     SyslogFacility                LOCAL7  Table 2.6 describes the general options available for the SSH server.

Table 2.7 Options in the Network Section  Unix   DESCRIPTION  OPTION  Port  SSH Servers  41  Sets the port number for SSH to listen on. Default port is 22; however, listening on several ports, including other nonstandard ports, such as 80, 443, or 8080, may be optimal since business travelers may not be able to make outbound connections on port 22, but since port 80 or 443 is usually available. To listen on multiple ports, add the following lines:  Port 22 Port 80 Port 443 Port 8080  Sets the IP address to have the SSH daemon listen on. The default, which is 0.0.0.0, enables the SSH services on all interfaces. If there are interfaces where SSH should not be listening, such as the external interface of a firewall, remove 0.0.0.0 and add the appropriate IP addresses. To listen on only select interfaces, add the following lines:  ListenAddress 172.16.1.1 ListenAddress 192.168.0.1  Enables  yes  or disables  no  the requirement of DNS lookups to succeed, in order to work with AllowHost and DenyHost entries. If enabled and the DNS lookup fails, the request is denied. If disabled and the DNS lookup fails, the IP address in AllowHosts and DenyHosts is checked.   Identifies the number of UDP broadcasts the server should handle per second. The default value, which is zero, has no broadcast handled.   Enables  yes  or disables  no  the socket option for TCP_NODELAY.  Enables  yes  or disables  no  whether the SSH server should send KeepAlive packets to the SSH clients. This value helps prevent hanging sessions by determining if the client on the other side is still running and hasn’t crashed or blue-screened.   Identifies the number of concurrent connections the SSH server will handle. If the value is set to zero, the number of concurrent connections is unlimited.

Identifies the location of the random seed file. This file is used to generate randomness for the SSH server.  Identifies the location of the identity file, usually name identification. It is located in the users’ home directory on the SSH client. This file is used by the SSH client to indicate which private keys are authorized for use during the process of authentication. For example, if a user has two private keys for authentication, such as id_dsa_2048_a and id_rsa_2048_a, the contents of the identification file will look like the following:  IdKey id_dsa_2048_a IdKey    id_rsa_2048_a  Note: The private keys listed in the identification file need to be in the users’ home directory also, discussed further in Chapter 4.  Identifies the location of the authorization file, usually name authorization and located in the users’ home directory on the SSH server. This file is used by the SSH server to indicate which public keys are authorized for acceptance during the process of authentication. For example, if a user has two public keys for authentication, such as id_dsa_2048_a.pub and id_rsa_2048_a.pub, the contents of the authorization file will look like the following:  Key    id_dsa_2048_a.pub Key    id_rsa_2048_a.pub  Note: The public keys listed in the authorization file need to be in the users’ home directory also, discussed further in Chapter 4.

Table 2.12 Options in the Authentication Section  Unix   OPTION  BannerMessageFile  PasswordGuesses  AllowedAuthentications  RequiredAuthentications  DESCRIPTION  Identifies the location of the file that contains the text to be displayed before the client logs in to the SSH server. This is very useful for legal disclaimers.   Identifies the number of attempts a user is given before being disconnected if valid authentication is not submitted.   Identifies the types of authentication methods that are valid. Options include password, publickey, and hostbased.   Identifies the types of authentication methods required for authentication. If the value is empty, any values in AllowedAuthentication will be honored.   HostbasedAuthForce ClientHostnameDNSMatch  Requires an exact match of the SSH client’s  hostname and the client’s DNS entry.   SshPAMClientPath  Identifies the location of the SSH PAM client to use in order for PAM authentication to take place. The default location is  usr local bin ssh-pam-client.  Host Restrictions  The  Host  Restrictions  section  of  the  sshd2_config  file  should  look  like  the following:  AllowHosts                localhost, foobar.com, friendly.org AllowHosts               t..l.\..*      AllowHosts           [[:digit:]]{1\,3}\. {3}[[:digit:]]{1\,3}      AllowHosts          \i.*      DenyHosts                     evil\.org, aol\.com     AllowSHosts                   trusted\.host\.org     DenySHosts                    not\.quite\.trusted\.org     IgnoreRhosts                  no     IgnoreRootRHosts              no   48  Chapter 2  Table 2.13 describes the Host Restrictions options available for the SSH server.

This entry can contain a list of groups, separated by a comma, or a pattern-matching variable.  Enables  yes  or disables  no  the ability for the root user to log in to the SSH server. As best practice, this setting should be set to no, forcing admin-users to su  switch user  to root. If the root account must be able to log in directly, the value of “nopwd” can allow root to log in directly, but with only public-key authentication.  SSH1 Compatibility  The SSH1 Compatibility section of the sshd2_config file should look similar to the following:      Ssh1Compatibility                   Sshd1Path                           Sshd1ConfigFile            etc sshd_config_alternate  Table  2.15  describes  the  SS1  Compatibility  options  available  for  the  SSH  server.   50  Chapter 2  Table 2.15 Options in the SSH1 Compatibility Section  Unix   OPTION  Ssh1Compatibility  DESCRIPTION  Sshd1Path  Sshd1ConfigFile  Enables  yes  or disables  no  compatibility with SSH version 1, which is an entirely different implementation of SSH when compared with SSH version 2.

Identifies the location of the SSH version 1 configuration file  for example,  etc  ssh1 sshd1_config .  Chrooted Environment  The Chrooted Environment allows specific users to be limited to their home directories, either with a shell or with file transfer. In addition to entering the correct information in the sshd2_config file, the ssh-chroot manager needs to be initiated. The Chrooted Environment section of the sshd2_config file should look like the following:      ChRootUsers                   ftp,guest     ChRootGroups                  guest  Table 2.16 describes the Chroot options available for the SSH server.

In this section, I discuss both the con- tents  of  the  sshd2_config  file,  location  in  Program  Files\SSH  Secure  Shell Server, and GUI management tool, located at Start ➪ Programs ➪ SSH Secure Shell Server ➪ Configuration.   To view the contents of the sshd2_config file, the file that is used to config-  ure the SSH server, enter the following commands:  C:\cd “Program Files\SSH Secure Shell Server” C:\notepad sshd2_config  To view the configuration GUI, browse to the following shortcut: Start ➪ Programs ➪  SSH Secure Shell Server  The  configuration  screen  shows  the  subheadings  on  the  left  that  are  the same subsections in the sshd2_config file above. The GUI is just a graphical tool to modify the sshd2_config file. I will examine both the GUI tool and the sshd2_config file.   The first screen that appears using the GUI tool is the SSH server settings, as shown  in  Figure  2.1.  This  screen  provides  information  about  server  status, event log, and default settings. Server status allows you to start or stop the server by simply clicking the button. This button starts or stops a service asso- ciated with SSH, which is called SSH Secure Shell 2. The next button, View Event Log, opens the Windows Event Log in order to view any error or warn- ing messages from SSH. Lastly, the Restore Default Settings button reinstates default settings on the SSH server.    52  Chapter 2  Figure 2.1 Configuration menu of SSH Communications’ SSH server.  The  Windows  version  of  sshd2_config  file  is  similar  to  the  Unix  version; however, many differences distinguish the two versions. The following sec- tions address the Windows sshd2_config file.  General Settings   General settings  The general section of the sshd2_config file should look like the following:  MaxConnections                  0 EventLogFilter                  error, warning IdleTimeout                     0 BannerMessageFile               “” TerminalProvider                “cmd.exe” DoubleBackspace                 yes         ProtocolVersionString       The general section of the SSH configuration GUI should look like Figure 2.2.

SSH Servers  55  Table 2.19 Options in the Network Section  Windows   OPTION  Port  DESCRIPTION  Sets the port number for SSH to listen on. Default port is 22; however, listening on several ports, including other nonstandard ports, such as 80, 443, or 8080, may be optimal since business travelers may not be able to make outbound connections on port 22, but since port 80 or 443 is usually accessible. To listen on multiple ports, add the following lines:  Port 22 Port 80 Port 443 Port 8080  Sets the IP address to have the SSH daemon listen on. The default, which is 0.0.0.0, will enable the SSH services on all interfaces. If there are interfaces where SSH should not be listening, such as the external interface of a firewall, remove 0.0.0.0 and add the appropriate IP addresses. To listen on only select interfaces, add the following lines: ListenAddress 172.16.1.1,192.168.0.1 ListenAddress 10.0.0.1  Enables  yes  or disables  no  the requirement of DNS lookups to succeed, in order to work with AllowHost and DenyHost entries. If enabled and the DNS lookup fails, the request is denied. If disabled and the DNS lookup fails, the IP address in AllowHosts and DenyHosts is checked.   ListenAddress  RequireReverseMapping  ResolveClientHostname  sshd2_config file only   Enables  yes  or disables  no  the server resolving   via DNS  the client’s IP address.   MaxBroadcastPerSecond  sshd2_config file only   Identifies the number of UDP broadcasts the server  should handle per second. The default value, which is zero, has no broadcast handled.    continued    56  Chapter 2  Table 2.19  continued   OPTION  NoDelay  KeepAlive  DESCRIPTION  Enables  yes  or disables  no  the socket option for TCP_NODELAY.  Enables  yes  or disables  no  whether the SSH server should send KeepAlive packets to the SSH clients. This value helps prevent hanging sessions by determining if the client on the other side is still running and hasn’t crashed or blue-screened.   Crypto Settings  The Crypto section of the sshd2_config file should look like the following:  Ciphers                         AnyStdCipher MACs                            AnyStdMac RekeyIntervalSeconds            0 RandomSeedFile                  “server_random_seed”  The  Encryption  section  of  the  SSH  configuration  GUI  should  look  like  Figure 2.4.

As best practice, this setting should be set to no, forcing admin-users to su  switch user  to root. If the root account must be able to log in directly, the value of “nopwd” can allow root to log in directly, but with only public key authentication.  Enables  yes  or disables  no  the ability for a user to access a terminal session. If this option is set to admin, only administrators can access the terminal. This admin option works well for SFTP file servers giving the remote user access to cmd.exe.    SSH Servers  67  Subsystem Definitions  The Subsystem Definitions section of the sshd2_config file should look like the following:  subsystem-sftp                  sftp-server2.exe SftpLogCategory                 16 Sftp-DirList                    “HOME=%D” Sftp-Home                       “%D” Sftp-AdminDirList               “HOME=%D, C:=C:, D:=D:”         Sftp-AdminUsers     The SFTP Server section of the SSH configuration GUI should look like Fig-  ure 2.12.

The VShell server uses a GUI to display, edit, and report configura- tion options for the SSH server. The following paragraphs address the various settings and capabilities of the VShell SSH server.  General Settings To view the configuration screen  see Figure 2.14 , browse to the VShell short- cut, Start ➪ Program ➪ VShell ➪ VShell.  Figure 2.14 VShell configuration screen.   70  Chapter 2  In the configuration screen, highlight the general section first. The general section  describes  some  of  the  global  options  for  the  SSH  server,  which  are listed in Table 2.29.  Table 2.29 Options in the General Section  VShell   OPTION  ListeningPort  DESCRIPTION  Sets the port number for SSH to listen on. Default port is 22; however, listening on several ports, including other nonstandard ports, such as 80, 443, or 8080, may be optimal since business travelers may not be able to make outbound connections on port 22, but since port 80 or 443 is usually accessible. To listen on multiple ports, add the following lines:  Port 22 Port 80 Port 443 Port 8080  Enables  check  or disables  no check  whether the SSH server should send KeepAlive packets to the SSH clients. This value helps prevent hanging sessions by determining if the client on the other side is still running and hasn’t crashed or blue- screened.   Identifies the path to the MOTD  Message of the day  file  Program Files\VShell\  to be displayed at login. This is very useful since messages can be displayed to all users who are logging in to the system, such as system downtime, security issues, and so on.

SSH Servers  77  Access Control  Highlight the Access Control section next  see Figure 2.21 . The Access Control section describes the rights and privileges for different users, which are listed in Table 2.36.   Table 2.36 Options in the Access Control Section  VShell   OPTION  Name  Permissions  DESCRIPTION  Identifies the names or groups allowed to access the VShell SSH server. This option is very valuable since it can limit only a specific amount of users and or groups without exposing SSH to all users on the machine.   This option allows or denies specific rights to be associated with a user, such as log in, shell, remote execution, SFTP, Port Forwarding, and Remote Port Forwarding. This option provides a lot of value that is absent from other SSH implementations. For example, if SSH is being deployed as a secure management tool, a secure file transfer tool, and a remote access solution, using only one VShell SSH service, users in the Administrators group can be given Shell and Port Forwarding rights to manage the server. Furthermore, users in the File Transfer group can be explicitly denied rights to everything, including Shell, but allowed SFTP rights. This protects against users having a command prompt  cmd.exe  to the remote server, but having full file access to the specified directory  for example, d:\share\applications . Lastly, the Remote Access group can be explicitly denied access to everything, such as shell and SFTP, but granted access to Port Forwarding, which would allow them to tunnel ports, such as mail ports, for remote access but restrict them from getting a command prompt or file access to the VShell SSH server.    78  Chapter 2  Figure 2.21 Access Control screen from the VShell server.  SFTP Section Highlight the SFTP section next  see Figure 2.22 . The SFTP section describes the secure file transfer options, which are listed in Table 2.37. These options are also excellent because they allow the control of specific folders to publish to SFTP users.  This  can  help  secure  a  file  server  by  allowing  only  authorized directories on a file server, such as d:\Common files\, while restricting the users  from  sensitive  operation  system  files  and  folders,  such  as  c:\winnt\. This option allows an SSH server to provide full file-system security over an SFTP session  without  any  worries  that  the  user  may  be  able  to  access  and download other files that may be on the SSH server.

The triggers can be simple batch files, visual basic scripts, perl scripts, or java scripts that will be executed once an Upload process is requested.   Enables  checkbox selected  or disables  checkbox not selected  triggers to be executed during a failed authentication. The triggers can be simple batch files, visual basic scripts, perl scripts, or java scripts that will be executed once an authentication request has failed.  Connection Filters  Highlight the Connection Filters section next  see Figure 2.24 . The Connection Filters  section  describes  who  can  and  cannot  connect  to  the  SSH  server. Options are shown in Table 2.39. When a VShell SSH server is deployed on a network, access to everyone, which may be all internal machines or all Inter- net machines, may not be desired. This option allows you to set filters and restrict access to the VShell SSH server.   Table 2.39 Options in the Connection Filters Section  VShell   OPTION  Filter Entries  Test Filter  DESCRIPTION  Describes the filters that have been set. Options are either Allow or Deny, based on a particular IP address, hostname, network mask, or Domain. For example, if an SSH server is deployed for remote management, a list of specific IP address can be allowed, which will limit access to only authorized users while restricting all other accounts.  Tests any filters. By entering an IP address or hostname, the connectivity can be tested to the specified IP address hostname to ensure that the SSH server can access the specified machine.   SSH Servers  81  Figure 2.24 Connections Filters screen from the VShell server.  Port-Forward Filters  Highlight  the  Port-Forward  Filters  section  next   see  Figure  2.25 .  The  Port- Forward Filters section describes the port-forwarding options, which are listed in Table 2.40. The Port-Forward Filters section describes which machines can be accessed on which ports via SSH tunneling. When a VShell SSH session is established  between  a  source  and  a  destination,  port  forwarding  to  remote servers may not be desired for security purposes. This option allows you to set filters that specify the servers and ports allowed to be accessed, eliminating the security risk of authorized SSH users tunneling to machines they should   82  Chapter 2  not be accessing. For example, an SSH session may allow remote management to  a  Windows  Terminal  Server  on  port  3389   Terminal  Services ;  however, access to the FTP  port 21  service on the same machine may be not be desired. If a filter is set to allow only 3389 to be tunneled to the Windows machine, access to the FTP service via a port-forward tunnel will be denied.  Figure 2.25 Port-Forward Filters screen from the VShell server.   Table 2.40 Options in the Port-Forward Filters Section  VShell   SSH Servers  83  DESCRIPTION  Describes the filters that have been set. Options are either Allow or Deny, based on a particular IP address, hostname, network mask, or Domain. For example, if an SSH server is deployed on the perimeter of the network to allow remote management to a Windows Terminal Server in the internal network, the Target value will be the Windows Terminal server  for example, 172.16.1.100  on the specific port  for example, 3389 . This will limit port-forwarding access to the remote terminal server on port 3389 only, denying port forwarding access to everything else. This provides a significant level of security.   Tests any filters. By entering in an IP address or hostname, the connectivity can be tested to the specified IP address hostname.

Comparison of OpenSSH, SSH Server, and VShell  The SSH servers discussed in this chapter have similar functionality, but sig- nificant differences exist among them. For example, VShell SSH server offers easy configuration methods to restrict shell access to an SSH client but also allows other SSH options such as SFTP or port forwarding. If SSH needs to be set  up  for  secure  file  transfer,  shell  access  should  probably  be  restricted.  If Vshell  is  used,  this  restriction  can  be  set  quite  easily.  On  the  other  hand, OpenSSH does not offer quite the same ease of restricting shell access to users. Similarly, if SSH needs to be set up for remote management to internal servers only, all three SSH servers can be used; however, if remote management needs to be limited to a specific number of machines and ports, VShell and SSH Com- munications’ are probably good choices, since they offer SSH access with port- forwarding restrictions.  If  SSH  is  being  deployed  in  an  environment  where  several  different  SSH servers exist, OpenSSH is probably a good choice, since it offers the most flex- ibility and interoperability with any other SSH server that may be a different installation.   Your choice of an SSH server is highly dependant on the type of functional- ity required for SSH. Because SSH can be used in a variety of ways, you need to  understand  the  different  servers  and  the  specific  functionality  that  each offers.   SSH Servers  85  Summary  This chapter examines three SSH servers that can be used with any SSH client: OpenSSH, SSH Communications’ SSH Server, and VanDyke Softare’s VSHell SSH server. Many more, equally effective SSH servers exist than the ones dis- cussed here; however, in the interests of time and space, they have not been covered. Be aware that most of the other servers are very similar to the ones examined in the previous paragraphs. For example, F-Secure’s SSH server and SSH Communications’ SSH server are practically alike.  When deciding on the choice of an SSH server for your organization, it is important to know the business and technical requirements in addition to the different options available with each. While many SSH servers offer similar functionality,  many  offer  features  that  might  not  be  present  in  others.  For example, if your SSH architecture is being used for terminal access, port for- warding, SFTP, or all of the above, different SSH servers have strengths and weaknesses that should influence your decision.   In this chapter, I have described in detail the various options available in each SSH server and use this information throughout the rest of this book to highlight the strengths and weakness of the SSH servers. This approach will not only help you understand the features of the SSH servers, but will also allow you to make an informed decision when choosing a server.  Chapter 1 of this book has covered the basics of SSH  namely, the deploy- ment of SSH servers , and Chapter 2 has covered the detailed descriptions of SSH servers themselves. The next chapter focuses on SSH clients.     C H A P T E R3  Secure Shell Clients  Many SSH clients provide different types of functionality and usage. The list of SSH clients includes freeware, downloadable easily from the information superhighway;  noncommercial  freeware,  available  for  all  development  and learning environments; and pay commercial clients, used only for commercial use and commercial development. While there may be several SSH clients that can  be  used  for  various  operating  systems,  all  SSH  clients  are  not  created equal. The type of SSH client you use can significantly affect the type of SSH experience  you  have.  For  example,  several  SSH  clients  do  not  have  built-in SFTP or SCP functionality. The absence of such functionality requires you to download  and  use  two  separate  tools:  one  for  SSH  usage  and  one  for SFTP SCP usage. Although using two tools may be simple enough, the cum- bersome process might discourage novice users. The SSH clients that provide built-in SFTP SCP functionality might offer you a superior SSH experience.   This chapter explores several SSH clients available for Unix and Windows. Also, the configuration of various SSH clients and customization for optimal usage is discussed. The following clients are the focus of this chapter:  Command-Line SSH Clients Secure Shell Communications     OpenSSH   GUI SSH clients  87           88  Chapter 3  SecureCRT PuTTY   WinSCP   MindTerm   MacSSH  The discussion of SSH clients in this chapter, and throughout this book, is limited to the major ones. Keep in mind that there are many other types of SSH clients,  very  similar  to  and  as  good  as  the  ones  covered  here.  For  example,  F-Secure’s SSH client and SSH Communications’ SSH client are extremely similar.  Although  many  of  the  SSH  clients  discussed  in  this  chapter  offer  similar functionality, there are various subtle differences among them. For example, SSH Communications’ SSH client offers an integrated SFTP client that can be used in a seamless fashion. On the other hand, SecureCRT does not provide a fully integrated tool for SFTP in its SecureCRT SSH client; however, Secure- CRT does contain an HTTP proxy tunnel that is very easily configurable but not so simple on SSH Commutations’ SSH client. Furthermore, MindTerm’s FTP-to-SFTP bridging capability provides an easy method for connecting non- SSH enabled clients to gain access to an SFTP server. Despite the fact that the connection from the FTP client to the SFTP client is still insecure, the connec- tion from the SFTP server to SFTP client is still secure, which might be the only connection used over an insecure network such as the Internet.   Your choice of an SSH client is highly dependant on the type of functional- ity required for SSH. Since SSH can be used in a variety of ways, it is important to understand the various clients and the specific functionality that each offers. This chapter will allow your SSH-client decision to be as informed as possible. For example, if SSH is being deployed primarily for its file-transfer capabili- ties,  WinSCP and  SSH  Communications’  SSH  clients  are  probably  good choices. On the other hand, if SSH is being deployed for remote shell access via an HTTP proxy server, the SecureCRT and PuTTY clients are probably good choices. Lastly, if SSH is being deployed for remote access from undefined and uncontrolled terminal locations, MindTerm is probably a good choice, since it offers SSH access with the need of only a Web browser.  The SSH client you choose does not have to be based exclusively on techni- cal capabilities; personal preference is important as well. While there may be many  differences  among  SSH  clients,  their  basic  principle  is  the  same: encrypted communication.  Command-Line SSH Clients  Secure Shell Communications  www.ssh.com  and OpenSSH  www.openssh .org  produce two of the most-used command-line clients for both Windows                 Secure Shell Clients  89  and Unix. Since the OpenSSH and Secure Shell Communications’ clients are so similar, the following paragraphs cover both of the clients’ features. Also, since the command-line clients contain similar features, if not the same features, on Windows and Unix versions, the following section can be used on Windows command-line clients or Unix command-line clients.   The SSH clients can be purchased and or downloaded for commercial or  noncommercial use from the following Web site:   www.ssh.com support downloads secureshellwks    Since we will be using SSH for a noncommercial use, the noncommercial version  can  be  downloaded  from  www.secondstory.org mirror ssh .  Also, the OpenSSH client for Unix can be downloaded from the following site:  ftp:  ftp3.usa.openbsd.org pub OpenBSD OpenSSH portable   openssh03.5p1.tar   The Windows command-line client can be downloaded from the following  site:  http:  lexa.mckenna.edu sshwindows   Windows Installation Installing the SSH client is a relatively easy process on a Windows operating system.  Once  you  have  downloaded  the  executable  files  from  http:  lexa .mckenna.edu sshwindows   OpenSSH  or www.ssh.com  SSH Communica- tions , a wizard will walk you through the installation process. Keep in mind that you need to install only the clients for the purposes of this chapter. Instal- lation of the server is discussed in Chapter 1. Many of the client binaries are installed automatically when an SSH server has been installed on a Windows machine.  Unix Installation Once you have downloaded the SSH client from www.ssh.com or www.openssh .com on a Unix operating system, it must first be extracted.  The letters XYZ that follow are a variable that signifies the version number of the SSH client you will be downloading :  gunzip –c ssh-XYZ.tar.gz  tar xvf –  After extraction, change directories to the SSH folder. Once inside the SSH  folder, the binary must be compiled and created:   cd ssh-XYZ . configure   90  Chapter 3  make make install  Once the binary has been compiled, it will place the binary in  usr local bin.  At this point, the help file should be ready for viewing. SSH Communica- tions’ SSH client binary is called ssh2 on both Windows and Unix. On Win- dows, the file can be located at \Program Files\SSH Secure Shell\ssh2.exe. On Unix, the file can be located at  usr local bin ssh2. OpenSSH client binary is called ssh on both Unix and Windows. On Windows, the file can be located at \Program  Files\OpenSSH\bin\ssh.exe.  On  Unix,  the  file  can  be  located  at  usr local bin ssh. Once you have located the SSH client binary, type ssh2 –h for the SSH Communications’ binary or ssh –h for OpenSSH’s binary. The following help should appear:  Usage: ssh2 [options] [user@]host[port] [command]  Options:  -l         login_name Log in using this user name. -n         Redirect input from  dev null. +a         Enable authentication agent forwarding. -a         Disable authentication agent forwarding. +x         Enable X11 connection forwarding  treat X11 clients as  +X         Enable X11 connection forwarding  treat X11 clients as  UNTRUSTED .

As shown previously, the SSH help file is exhaustive and shows the wide array of options that SSH can provide. In its simplest sense, SSH can connect an  SSH  server  listening  on  its  default  port,  which  is  22.  The  –p  switch  is required in order to specify a port other than 22; however, if –p is not used, port 22 will be used as the default. Similarly, the –l switch needs to be used in order to specify a username. If you do not use the –l switch, the current user that the command is being executed from will be used:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –p 22 cdwivedi’s password: Authentication successful. Last login: Thurs June 12 05:52:06 2003 from 172.16.11.17  As an alternative, the same command can be written without any switches,  using SSH defaults:  ssh cdwivedi@10.0.0.322  –l  and  –p  are  two  of  the  various  switches  used  with  the  SSH  client.  The  following  section  describes  some  of  the  more  important  switches  used throughout the rest of this book.  The first switch is –i. The –i switch can be used to point to a pubic-key file used to authenticate to an SSH server. A copy of the public-key file needs to exist  on  the  SSH  server  for  public-key  authentication,  discussed  further  in Chapter 4. An example of the –i switch follows:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –p 60599 –i publickey.pub  The –L and –R switches are used for local port forwarding and remote port forwarding.  Port  forwarding  is  discussed  in  Chapter  6;  however,  a  general understanding of its syntax is required now. Local port forwarding allows the local connection to a port to be forwarded to a remote server on any remote port through the SSH server. For example, a mail server that has the IP address 10.0.0.100 and is listening on port 143 can be accessed using SSH. The SSH   92  Chapter 3  server, which has the IP address 10.0.0.3, needs a valid route to the machine. The following is an example of using the –L switch for local port forwarding:   ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –L 143:10.0.0.100:143  Remote  port  forwarding  can  also  be  conducted;  it  is  discussed  further  in  Chapter 6. The following is an example of remote port forwarding:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –R 139:127.0.0.1:139  Options can be also set for the type of encryption desired as well as the type of MAC algorithm. For example, if the SSH server accepts only connections using  Triple-DES   3DES ,  the  –c  switch  should  be  used.  Triple-DES  is  an  algorithm that can be used to encrypt data. This allows 3DES to be used to encrypt data that traverses the network. If more than one type of encryption is supported, multiple –c options can be used. The following are two examples of the encryption options:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –c 3DES ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –c 3DES –c Blowfish  The  MAC  algorithms  used  can  either  be  MD5  or  SHA1.  Both  MD5  and SHA1 are algorithms that can be used to verify the integrity of data. MD5 uses a  128-bit  message  digest  from  data  input  that  is  unique  to  the  data.  SHA1  uses a 160-bit message digest from data input that is also unique to the data. This allows the MD5 and SHA1 hashes to be used as a fingerprint for a partic- ular piece of data. To use the MAC algorithms, the –m flag should be used with the specific option  hmac-md5 or hmac-sha1  in order to hash the data that will be transferred between to entities. The following are two examples of the MAC options:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –m hmac-md5 ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –m hmac-sha1  The –F switch is used to point to a different configuration file for the SSH session. Every SSH session uses a configuration file as input when attempting to establish a connection. Configuration files are discussed in the next section, “SSH  Client  Configuration  File.”  If  an  end  user  needs  to  connect  to  two  or more SSH servers that have different parameters, such as listening on different ports, it is easier to point to a different configuration file than to remember the input parameters required for the SSH servers. Let’s say that SSH server A lis- tens  on  port  101,  enables  local  forwarding  to  the  mail  server,  and  requires   Secure Shell Clients  93  3DES for encryption. Furthermore, server B listens on port 701, enables local forwarding to the file server, and requires Blowfish for encryption. The two commands, without using configuration files, would be as follows:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –p 101 -L 143:172.16.1.100:143 –c 3DES ssh 10.0.0.4 –l cdwivedi –p 701 –L 139:172.16.1.200:139 –c Blowfish  Although remembering two commands may not be that difficult, connect- ing to more than two SSH servers with different forwarding rules, different port  specifications,  and  different  encryption  algorithms  becomes  a  cumber- some  process.  Using  two  configuration  files  significantly  eases  the  log  in process and user experience, as shown in the following example:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –F mail.config ssh 10.0.0.4 –l cdwivedi –F file.config  The next two switches are quite simple when you are using them with IP version 4 or IP version 6. Using IP version 6 assumes that an IP version 6 net- work is in use, which is beyond the scope of this book and SSH; however, SSH provides support for IP version 6 packets. IP version 4 is the default packet type, but both flags can be used if the networks are available. Following are two examples of the switches:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –4 ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi -6  The next switches do not add functionality to the SSH client, but they do provide the opportunity to gather additional information regarding the con- nection. The –d switch sets the debug level for a connection. The higher the debug value, the greater the amount of information that will be printed on the screen regarding the connection. The following is an example of the –d switch. Notice all the information that comes before the password request:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –l cdwivedi –d 1 debug: Connecting to 10.0.0.3, port 22...  SOCKS not used  debug: client supports 3 auth methods:* ‘publickey,keyboard- interactive,password’ debug: Ssh2Common sshcommon.c:537 ssh_common_wrap: local ip = 10.0.0.3, local port = 1077 debug: Ssh2Common sshcommon.c:539 ssh_common_wrap: remote ip = 10.0.0.3, remote port = 22 debug: Remote version: SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.4p1 debug: OpenSSH: Major: 3 Minor: 4 Revision: 0   94  Chapter 3  debug: Remote host key found from database. debug: server offers auth methods publickey,password,keyboard-interactive’. debug: SshConfig sshconfig.c:2717 ssh2_parse_config_ext: Unable to open  root .ssh2 identification debug: server offers auth methods publickey,password,keyboard-interactive’. debug: server offers auth methods publickey,password,keyboard-interactive’. cdwivedi’s password:   The next informational switch, -V, displays the version of the remote SSH server. This is helpful when you are trying to understand what version the remote SSH server is running for patching and security purposes. The follow- ing is an example of the –V switch:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –V ssh: SSH Secure Shell 3.2.3  non-commercial version  on i686-pc-linux-gnu  The last informational switch discussed here is –q. In essence, it tells the SSH server to be quiet and not display any warning messages to the end-user. If the –q switch is used, the SSH server will display only the request for the user’s password. The following is an example of the –q switch:  ssh 10.0.0.3 –q root’s password:  SSH Client Configuration File Now that I have covered the switches that may be used with the SSH client, I’ll discuss the configuration file itself. Table 3.1 describes where the configuration file can be located, depending on the operating system and type of SSH client.  The SSH client configuration file is divided into the following categories:    General   Network  Crypto    User Public Key Authentication  Tunneling SSH1 Compatibility    Authentication  Each of these categories is explored in the paragraphs that follow.                       Secure Shell Clients  95  Table 3.1 Location of Configuration Files  CLIENT  OpenSSH  WINDOWS OS  UNIX OS  \Program Files\OpenSSH\etc   etc ssh_config  SSH Communications  \Program Files\SSH Secure Shell \ssh2_config   etc ssh2 ssh2_config  The  general  section  of  the  of  the  configuration  file  lists  generic  flags  and switches that can limit the number of commands the end-user needs to type when  trying  to  access  the  SSH  server.  Fields  such  as  VerboseMode,  Quiet- Mode,  Compression,  GoBackground,  and  EscapeChar  allow  customized generic settings to be enabled from the profile file itself instead of typed into the command line. Some of the selected fields in the General section are pro- vided in Table 3.2, as well as a brief description of each.   General  Network  The  Network  section  of  the  configuration  file  lists  networking  settings required for the connection. An example of a network setting is the specific port that the SSH client should use when attempting to connect to the SSH server. Table 3.3 gives a brief description of some of the selected fields in the Network section.  Table 3.2 Fields in the General Section  FIELD  VerboseMode  QuietMode  DontReadStdin  BatchMode  Compression  GoBackground  EscapeChar  DESCRIPTION  Displays verbose information of the SSH session  Displays warning messages  Disables input for Standard input  Enables Disables batch-mode processing  Enables Disables compression  Sends the connection to the background  Sets the ESC character for the session  PasswordPrompt  Type of Password prompt  AuthenticationSuccessMsg  Displays success message after login  SetRemoteEnv   Sets environment variables for the session   96  Chapter 3  Table 3.3 Fields in the Network Section  DESCRIPTION  Sets the port to connect to  Enables Disables the delay process  Keeps the connection active  The network ID of SOCKS server  Support for SOCKS version 5  FIELD  Port  NoDelay  KeepAlive  SocksServer  UseSocks5  Crypto  The Crypto section of the configuration file lists the types of cryptography that can be set for the SSH clients. This section is useful when different SSH servers require different types of encryption algorithms. For example, a different SSH configuration file can be set for backups, enabling certain types of encryption that  have  the  least  effect  on  bandwidth  and  enabled  data  validation  with MAC. Table 3.4 gives a brief description of some of the selected fields in the Crypto section.  Table 3.4 Fields in the Crypto Section  FIELD  Ciphers  MACs  DESCRIPTION  Specifies which Ciphers can be used  Specifies which MACs can be used  StrictHostKeyChecking  Enables hostkey checking server validation  RekeyIntervalSeconds  Interval length for re-keying the session  User Public Key Authentication  The Public Key Authentication section of the configuration file simply speci- fies the location and name of the user’s public key to use for authentication. The fields in the Public Key Authentication section are described in Table 3.5.  Table 3.5 Fields in the Public key Authentication Section  FIELD   IdentityFile  DESCRIPTION  Name of identification file  RandomSeedFile  Name of random_seed file   Secure Shell Clients  97  Tunneling  The Tunneling section of the configuration file specifies the local and remote tunneling  options  that  should  be  used  on  the  SSH  client.  This  section  adds  a great deal of value when the client has enabled multiple local and remote port  forwards.  The  selected  fields  in  the  Tunnel  section  are  described  in  Table 3.6.  Table 3.6 Fields in Tunnel Section  FIELD TUNNELING  GatewayPorts  ForwardAgent  ForwardX11  DESCRIPTION  Allow interfaces to act as a gateway  Enable Disable forwarding of packets  Enable Disable X11 emulation  TrustX11Applications  Options to trust distrust X11  TUNNELS SET UP UPON LOGIN  LocalForward  LocalForward     Local port forwarding setting  143:IP:143   Local port forwarding setting  25:IP:25   RemoteForward     Remote port forwarding setting  22:IP:23     SSH1 Compatibility  The SSH1 Compatibility section of the configuration file specifies the options to use in order to be compatible with SSH1 version 1. In order for SSH2 clients to be compatible with SSH1 servers, the following fields must be set  shown in Table 3.7 .  Table 3.7 SSH Compatibility  Ssh1Compatibility  Enable Disable SSH1 support  DESCRIPTION  FIELD   Ssh1Path  The path to use for SSH1. The default is  usr local bin ssh1  Ssh1MaskPasswordLength  Enable Disable masking for the password length   98  Chapter 3  Authentication  The Authentication section of the configuration file specifies the options sup- ported for authentication. This section allows the client to know which type of authentication to use, whether to use a password and public key instead of just a  password,  in  order  to  authenticate.  Table  3.8  is  a  brief  list  of  the  selected fields of the authentication section.  Table 3.8 Authentication  FIELD   DESCRIPTION  AllowedAuthentication  Specifies the authentication types allowed, such as password, public key, or all of the above   GUI SSH Clients  Secure  Shell  Communications   www.ssh.com ,  VanDyke  Software,  PuTTY, AppGate, and WinSCP are several of the vendors that provide graphical user interfaces   GUIs   for  SSH  clients.  Since  there  are  several  GUI  clients  on  the market,  the  following  section  examines  some  of  the  optimal  features  of  the GUI  SSH  clients.  Also,  since  the  GUI  clients  are  primarily  available  for  Windows, the following section focuses on Windows 2000 and Windows XP.  Table  3.9  shows  where  the  SSH  clients  can  be  purchased  and or  down-  loaded.  Table 3.9 Web Sites Where SSH Clients Are Available   CLIENTS  URL  SSH Communications  www.ssh.com  VanDyke Software  www.vandyke.com   Putty  WinSCP  Mindterm  MacSSH  www.chiark.greenend.org.uk ~sgtatham putty   winscp.vse.cz eng   www.appgate.com mindterm   pro.wanadoo.fr chombier   Windows Installation Installing Windows-based SSH clients is relatively straightforward. I do not describe the process of installing each of the SSH clients listed in Table 3.9, but a wizard of each will walk you through the installation process.   Secure Shell Clients  99  SSH Communications SSH Communications’ SSH client is the first I will discuss. Open the SSH client and initiate a simple SSH connection by executing the following steps:  1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. File ➪ Open ➪ Quick Connect  SSH Secure Shell ➪  Secure Shell Client  As shown in Figure 3.1, the Host Name field is either the fully qualified DSN name for the SSH server, such as sshserver.aum.com, or the dot notation of the IP address of the SSH server, such as 172.16.11.17. The User Name field is the username  on  the  remote  SSH  server.  The  username  can  either  be  the  local account on a Windows machine or a domain account on a Windows domain, depending on how the SSH server is implemented. In Unix environments, the username  is  the  same  in  the   etc passwd  file.  The  Port  Number  field  is  used to specify the port number. If the SSH server is listening on a nonstan- dard  port   a  port  other  than  port  22 ,  the  appropriate  port  number  should  be placed in the port box, such as 202. Lastly, the Authentication Method spec- ifies  the  type  of  authentication  that  should  be  used  when  attempting  to  connect to the remote SSH server. The possible values and their descriptions are in Table 3.10.  Figure 3.1 “Quick Connect” menu.   100 Chapter 3  Table 3.10 Authentication Types  AUTHENTICATION TYPE  DESCRIPTION  Password  Public Key  SecureID  PAM  Username and password combination  Public and Private-key authentication  RSA SecureID tokens for authentication*   Pluggable authentication module**  * Requires RSA ACE server. ** The pluggable authentication module is a Unix authentication method that integrates various authentica- tion methods into one.  SSH  Communications  offers  different  settings  on  SSH  clients.  Using  the  Menu bar, open the settings menu by selecting Edit ➪  Settings.  Under the settings menu, there should be two sections: Profile Settings and Global  Settings.  Under  profile  and  global  settings,  there  should  be  several more options. In the following sections, each option is examined individually and its purpose and usage described.  Profile Settings  The profile settings are similar to the ssh2_config file discussed previously with the  command-line  utilities.  All  options  under  the  Profile  Settings  section directly correlate to settings used by default when attempting to connect to an SSH server. The description and usage of the settings are provided in Table 3.11.  Table 3.11 Options Under the Profile Settings Section   SETTING  DESCRIPTION AND USAGE  Connection  The following describes the options on each of the sections to the left. The options within those sections are also explained.    - Host Name: DNS name or IP address of the remote SSH server. - User Name: Username of the account to log in with. - Port Number: Port number that the SSH server is listening on. - Authentication Methods: Authentication types that can be used in order to log in to the SSH server. Options can be password, public key, SecureID, and PAM. - Encryption Algorithm: Sets the type of cryptography to be used for the session. -MAC Algorithm: Sets the type of hashes to be used when hashing the data being sent across the network. Options can be MD5 or SHA1.  The option chosen must be supported by the SSH server.   - Compression: Enables compression on the connection. The valid choice for compression in only zlib.   Secure Shell Clients 101  Table 3.11  continued   SETTING  DESCRIPTION AND USAGE  Terminal Answerback: Set the type of emulator to receive from the SSH server. Valid choices range from VT100 to xterm. - Connect Through Firewall: This checkbox determines if the connection will be taken through a SOCKS or proxy server. - Request Tunnels Only  Disable Terminal : Enables Disables the terminal window from appearing. If this is enabled, the user will not receive a command-line shell to execute commands, but only the session itself to port forward to.   Lists the types of Ciphers that can be used. Options can be 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, AES, Arcfour, and CAST128.  The option chosen must be supported by the SSH server.    Allows the cosmetic appearance to be modified.  Changes the keyboard functions.  Provides the ability to secure X11 connections via the SSH connection by tunneling the X11 packets inside SSH. - Outgoing: Sets Outgoing tunnels for the session  discussed more in the port-forwarding chapter . - Incoming: Sets Incoming tunnels for the session  discussed more in the port-forwarding chapter .  Cipher List  Colors  Keyboard  Tunneling  Global Settings  The global settings are used for any SSH connection attempt, regardless of the profile  that  might  be  used.  All  options  under  the  Global  Settings  section directly correlate to settings used by default when attempting to connect to an SSH server. The description and usage of the settings are shown in Table 3.12.  Table 3.12 Options Under the Global Settings  SETTING  DESCRIPTION AND USAGE  Appearance  User Keys  Sets some of the cosmetic items to display by default, such as profiles, hostname, color, and font.   Manages the public and private-key pairs that can be used for authentication  instead of a password . This section allows you to create a key pair, delete an old key pair, export a key to a flat *.pub file, import a key pair to a flat *.pub file, view the flat connects of a public key, change the passphrase in order to use the public key, and upload a public key to an SSH server  the SSH server must be compatible with the type of key created . The User Keys section is discussed further in Chapter 4.    continued    102 Chapter 3  Table 3.12  continued   SETTING  Host Key  DESCRIPTION AND USAGE  Identifies the SSH server. The host key is a virtual fingerprint of the server. The use of host keys protects against IP address attacks on IPv4 networks, such as Man-in-the-Middle and spoofing attacks.  Public Key  Infrastructure   PKI   Provides support for a certificate-based authentication system.  The options can include certificates from SSH clients, certificates  from integrated directory services architecture, such as LDAP, or using hardware devices.   - Certificates: Allows the SSH client to import, enroll, view, delete, or change the passphrase of a certificate. - LDAP: Provides LDAP directory integration with PKI certificates. - PKCS 11: Provides a certificate-based system to access hardware devices.  Configures Secure FTP and Secure Copy. Options that can be configured are the display types of Icons, the display of hidden or root directories, and the ability to confirm the deletion or overwriting of a file on the SFTP server. Also, allows the configuration of the default file viewing application of an extension that is not available for a particular file.   Configures SOCKS firewall operability. For example, socks:  172.16.1.100:1117 would be used to make an SSH connection via a SOCKS server  172.16.1.100  on port 1117.  Configures basic security options, such as the option to clear the host name upon exit or deleting the contents of the clipbook upon exit.   Sets the options for printing, such as fonts, margins, and header footer information.   File Transfer  Firewall  Security  Printing  The profile and global settings are the primary areas where the SSH client can  be  configured  for  functionality.  Like  the  command-line  clients,  the  GUI client can save settings based on different SSH servers. To customize the pro- file  settings  based  on  a  particular  SSH  server,  go  to  the  File  Menu  bar  and select File ➪ Profiles ➪ Add Edit Profiles.  A profile can automatically be set up after the initial valid connection to an SSH server. As shown in Figure 3.2, once the initial connect is made, the option to save the profile appears in the upper right-hand corner. The Add Edit pro- file option is a simple way to customize SSH connections. After opening the File ➪ Profiles ➪ Edit Add profile option, you should notice the same profile options that are available with the Edit Setting menu. However, these options do not globally change all options; they make changes based on the specific connection.   Secure Shell Clients 103  Figure 3.2 Automatic Profile save option.  One of the most useful options with SSH Communications’ SSH client is the built-in SFTP client. It allows the SFTP client to be executed without the need for any secondary client or another SSH connection. The SFTP client can be executed from the menu bar with Windows ➪ New File Transfer.  After this option has been selected, the SFTP client, with the original session to the SSH server enabled, displays the contents of the local machine on the left pane, which is the SSH Client machine, and the contents of the remote SSH server  on  the  right  pane.  This  allows  safe  and  simple  SFTP usage  for  the  SSH session. Figure 3.3 demonstrates the use of the SFTP client option with  an SSH session that has already been established.  The last option I will discuss for the SSH Communications’ SSH client is the Log Session. This option logs the entire connection, including commands, out- puts, and inputs, to a log file. The log file can be saved locally on the client machine for viewing at a later time. The log session option is also located at the file menu bar at File ➪ Log Session.  After Log Session is chosen, the client will display a prompt for a location to save the log file to. Session-logging capabilities will be enabled for the follow- ing connection after the option is enabled.    104 Chapter 3  Figure 3.3 SFTP client option on an established SSH session.  VanDyke Software’s SecureCRT VanDyke Software has an SSH client called SecureCRT. Open the SSH client and initiate a simple SSH connection by selecting Start ➪ Programs ➪ Secure- CRT 4.0 ➪  SecureCRT 4.0.  After you select the shortcut, SecureCRT will automatically open its Quick  Connect menu  see Figure 3.4  to begin an SSH connection.   Secure Shell Clients 105  display.

Authentication mechanism to be used for the SSH connection. Possible choices are RSA authentication  requires RSA ACE server on the server side of the connection , password, and TIS  requires TIS firewall server on the server side of the connection .   106 Chapter 3  The  last  options  on  the  Quick  Connect  display  are  two  checkboxes:  The Show  Quick  Connect  on  Startup  checkbox  displays  Quick  Connect  upon startup, and the Save Session checkbox saves the custom settings to a profile. SecureCRT offers different settings to be enabled on SSH clients. Using the  Menu bar, open the options menu by selecting Options ➪ Global Options.  Under  the  Global  Options  menu  are  seven  sections,  including  Options, Appearance, Firewall, SSH1, SSH2, Printing, and Web Browser. Under each of the sections are several more sections that can be used to configure the client. I will select options individually and describe their purpose and usage.  All Global Options under this section directly correlate to settings that will be used by default when attempting to connect to an SSH server. The descrip- tion and usage of each setting is shown in Table 3.14.  Table 3.14 Settings Under Global Options  SETTING  Options  Appearance  Firewall  DESCRIPTION AND USAGE  Mouse settings: - Copy - Paste - Hide Mouse Dialogs—Various Dialog information settings Other— Various appearance settings.  Various appearance settings, including color, menu tool bar options, margin settings, and so on.  Enables an SSH session via a SOCKS server, version 4 or version 5, or a proxy server. Both SOCKS and proxy servers can be used to relay an SSH connection to a device on behalf of an SSH client, discussed further in Chapter 9.   Type: - SOCKS  v4 or v5  with or without authentication. - Generic Proxy: Can be used on most proxy servers.   Parameters  SOCKS : - Hostname or IP: DNS name or IP address of SOCKS server. - Port: Port number that the SOCKS service is listening on  default is 1080 .  Parameters  Generic Proxy : - Hostname or IP: DNS name or IP address of the proxy server - Port: Port number that the proxy service is listening on. Note: If your remote SSH server is listening on port 22 and all outbound traffic is allowed via a proxy server only, consider changing the SSH server to port 443 and using the proxy server to proxy the SSH connection  discussed in detail in Chapter 9 . - Prompt: This field should be filled with the information that SecureCRT should expect from the proxy server.   Table 3.14  continued   SETTING  DESCRIPTION AND USAGE  Secure Shell Clients 107  - Command: This field should be filled with the information that SecureCRT should provide to the proxy server once the connection with the proxy server is established. For example, to connect to an SSH server listening on port 443 via a proxy server, check the firewall checkbox in the login screen and enter the following text in the command field: CONNECT %h:%p HTTP 1.0\r\n\r\n.  Allows the use of a pubic key, instead of a password, to authenticate an SSH server. Create Identity File: Allows the ability to create a public and private-key file.  Allows the use of a public key, instead of a password, to authenticate an SSH server, discussed further in Chapter 4.  - Create Identity File: Allows the ability to create a public and private-key file. - Use Certificate: Allows the use of X.509 certificate-based authentication, instead of a password or public key. Requires the use of a Certificate Authority. -Agent: Add keys to agent: Allow the use of the SecureCRT agent, which allows the ability to connect to multiple SSH servers with a single public key. Enable OpenSSH agent forwarding: Allow the ability to connect to an SSH server via an intermediate server.  - Host Keys: Host keys are public keys used to identify the SSH server. The host key is virtually a fingerprint of the server. The use of host keys protects against IP-address attacks on IPv4 networks, such as Man-in-the-Middle and spoofing attacks.  Set the options for printing, such as fonts, margins, and header footer information.   Sets the default Web browser to use when opening a URL via Secure CRT. In order to use this open, right-click on the URL string in Secure CRT, such as www.theonion.com, and select “Open URL”.    SSH1  SSH2  Printing  Web Browser  SecureCRT offers different settings to be enabled once a session has been established.  Once  a  connection  has  been  enabled  with  the  Quick  Connect  dialog, open the session options menu using the Menu bar; select Options ➪ Session Options.  Under  the  settings  menu  are  seven  sections:  Connection,  Emulation, Appearance, Options, File Transfer, Log File, and Printing. Under each of the sections are several more sections that can be used to configure the client. I will select options individually and describe the purpose and usage of each.   108 Chapter 3  All Session Options directly correlate to settings that will be used only when connecting to the appropriate SSH server. The description and usage of the set- tings are provided in Table 3.15.  Table 3.15 Session Options Settings and Descriptions   USAGE AND DESCRIPTION  SECTION  Connection  Connection-specific information can be configured under this section.  Logon Scripts - Automate Logon: Creates a script to automate the login process to an SSH server. - Logon Scripts: Allows the Secure CRT client to run automatic scripts to be used when logging on to a remote SSH server.  SSH2 - Use Compression: Enables compression on the connection. - Cipher: Encryption algorithm to be used for the connection. - MAC: Sets the type of hashes to be used when hashing the data being sent across the network. - SSH Server: Sets the type of SSH server being used on the remote server. Options are: Auto Detect, which is the best option; DataFellows, SSH Communications, and Standard.  Port Forwarding - Locally sets outgoing tunnels for the session  discussed more in Chapters 6 and 7 . - Remote: Set Incoming tunnels for the session  discussed more in Chapters 6 and 7 .  X11 Allows the ability to secure X11 connections via the SSH connection by tunneling the X11 packets inside SSH  Emulation  Sets options and properties for emulated terminals with Secure CRT.  Appearance  Sets cosmetic appearances for the session.  Options  File Transfer  Sets keyboard options for the session.  Allows the specific location to be set for the Upload and Download of file with the Xmodem and Zmodem utilities. - Xmodem: File transfer utility that supports error detection during transfer. Note: Xmodem functionality is required on the remote server. - Zmodem: File transfer utility to download and upload files. Note: Zmodem functionality is required on the remote server.   Secure Shell Clients 109  Table 3.15  continued   SECTION  Log File  USAGE AND DESCRIPTION  Allows the location of the log file to set to a specific location. Note: Logging must be enabled with “File > Log Session” or “File > Raw Log Session.”  Printing  Allows printing information to be configured.  File-transfer  capabilities  are  partially  available  via  the  SecureCRT  client. Another  client,  SecureFX,  is  the  fully  supported  SFTP SCP client  for VanDyke Software. Some utilities, such as Zmodem and Xmodem, allow basic file-transfer options, located under the Transfer menu bar.  To  further  automate  Secure  CRT,  ActiveX  scripting  is  available  with  VBScript and Jscript by selecting Script ➪ Run.  Any VB script, Microsoft Java script, and even certain Perl scripts can be loaded from the client’s machine to the SecureCRT SSH client, to be executed within the SSH session.  Secure CRT also offers the ability to create and use public keys for authenti- cation instead of passwords. To use a public key for authentication, a key must be generated. Use the utilities under the Tools menu, which can create keys for SecureCRT clients.  1. Select Tools ➪ Create Public Key. This creates a public key for the user. 2. Select Tools ➪ Public-key Assistant. This manages the public key for the  current user on the remote SSH server.  To  use  a  created  public  key  that  has  been  uploaded  on  the  remote  SSH server, the PublicKey option needs to be set under the Authentication drop- down box in the Connection or Quick Connect dialog.   The last options I will discuss for SecureCRT are Log Session and Trace. The log options simply log the entire SSH session, including commands, outputs, and inputs, to a log file. There are two options with Log Session: formatted, which only logs selected items; or Raw, which logs everything in an unfor- matted  fashion.  The  log  file  can  be  saved  locally  on  the  client  machine  for viewing at a later date. The Log Session option is also located at the file menu bar. Open the SSH client and complete the following steps:  1. Select File ➪ Open ➪ Quick Connect. 2. Choose File ➪ Log Session or File ➪ Raw Log Session.   110 Chapter 3  After Log Session or Raw Log Session is chosen, the client will save the ses- sion under the location specified in the Session Options section. The only dif- ference  between  the  two  settings  is  that  the  Raw  Log  Session  records connections  between  the  SecureCRT  client  and  the  SSH  service,  including escape commands.  The Trace options menu allows the display of hidden communication between the SSH server and the SecureCRT SSH client. To enable the Trace options, select the option File ➪ Trace Options.  PuTTY  PuTTY is  a  free  Telnet  and  SSH  client  for  Win32  platforms,  available  from www.chiark.greenend.org.uk ~sgtatham putty .  PuTTY has  similar  func- tionality as described in other SSH clients. After downloading PuTTY, double- click the executable and the configuration menu should appear.  As  shown  in  Figure  3.5,  four  sections  can  be  configured  using  PuTTY:  Session, Terminal, Window, and Connection. The description and usage of the settings are provided in Table 3.16.

MacSSH supports SSH2 only, with no support for SSH1. MacSFTP is similar to MacSSH but is used for the file-transfer portion of the connection. There are some other good clients for  the  Macintosh  environment,  including  JellyfiSSH   www.arenasoftware .com grepsoft   and Rbrowser  www.rbrowser.com .  This chapter explores several SSH clients that can be used in enterprise archi- tectures and different options. Each SSH client has been examined in detail in this chapter, with coverage of the options, settings, and configuration steps in a typical environment.   Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of this book have covered the basics: SSH servers and SSH clients. The focus of this book now turns from descriptions and imple- mentation steps of servers and clients to specific features and options of SSH servers and clients. Chapter 4 discusses the authentication methods provided by  SSH.  Although  I  have  covered  the  client-configuration  options  with authentication  in  this  chapter,  I  have  not  discussed  how  to  implement  the  various options and the best methods for optimal usage.  The remaining portions of this book assume that you are familiar with most of the features of the SSH clients discussed in Chapter 3, as well as the major uses of SSH servers from Chapter 2.   C H A P T E R4  Authentication  The first three chapters of this book focus on the various aspects of SSH servers and SSH clients. I now shift the focus from the actual packages of SSH to the detailed options and optimal uses of SSH. The first topic is authentication.  Authentication is the process of determining if an entity is actually who or what it claims to be. The entity can be a person, a server, an application, a ser- vice, or even a process. In most networks, authentication is commonly used with usernames and passwords. In this type of authentication, the password is the only object that guarantees that the entity is actually what it claims to be. While  users  can  choose  and  change  their  own  passwords  for  successful authentication, the fact that passwords are often stolen, shared, sticky-noted  a manual technique of writing passwords on a Post-It note and sticking it to a monitor , or simply forgotten makes the use of passwords for authentication a less-than-ideal solution.  Since passwords may not be the best solution for sensitive information or for hostile  environments,  SSH  offers  the  use  of  a  more  stringent  authentication process.  The  use  of  public  keys  or  digital  certifications  can  be  the  required method of authentication across any SSH environment that uses sensitive infor- mation or transcends hostile networks, such as the Internet or internal networks. Furthermore,  since  authorization  is  highly  dependant  on  authentication,  the authentication process needs to be as strong as possible, since most authoriza- tion processes do not perform a second layer of error checking for validity.  This chapter’s focus is common authentication methods used in SSH, pri- marily  passwords,  host-based  authentication,  and  public  keys.  The  chapter  117   118 Chapter 4  summarizes some of the other authentication options available via SSH, such as server authentication, where the client authenticates the server, and general- option authentication settings. The order of the discussions is as follows:    General options   Passwords    Host-based authentication  Server authentication Public keys  General Options  SSH offers several general authentication options depending on the type of SSH server deployed. The options range from valid password attempts to the use of blank passwords. The following paragraphs describe the SSH servers and the authentication options they provide.  SSH Communications’ SSH server  Windows  SSH  Communications’  SSH  server  offers  a  few  options  for  authentication. Open the SSH Server configuration screen  Start ➪ Programs  ➪ SSH Secure Shell Server ➪ Configuration  and highlight the User Authentication section of the screen. See Figure 4.1 for the authentication screen.  Figure 4.1 The User Authentication section of the screen for SSH Communications’ SSH server.                   Authentication 119  Tables 4.1 through 4.3 describe the general authentication options for SSH  Communications’ SSH server.  Table  4.1  describes  the  general  user-authentication  options.  Parameters  such as login grace time, number of retries, and delay between retries can be configured.   Table  4.2  describes  the  user-authentication  password  options  under  the password section. Parameters such as password authentication, empty pass- word permissions, and keyboard interactive can be configured.  Table  4.3  describes  the  user  authentication  public  key  options  under  the public key section. Parameters such as public key authentication, key direc- tory, and authorization file can be configured.  Table 4.1 User-Authentication Options  OPTION  Login grace time  DESCRIPTION  Sets the amount of time the user has to complete the authentication process. Specifically, from the time the user initiates the connection to the time the user enters a username password or private- key password  Stipulates the number of times a user can attempt to log in  Retries – Number of Retries  Retries – Delay between tries  Specifies the duration between retries   Table 4.2 User-Authentication Password Options  OPTION  DESCRIPTION  Password authentication  Allows, requires, or denies password authentication  Permit empty passwords  Enables blank passwords to be used for accounts  Keyboard interactive  Permits keyboard-interactive authentication with password authentication   Table 4.3 User-Authentication Public-Key Options  OPTION  DESCRIPTION  Public-key authentication  Allows, requires, or denies public-key authentication.   continued    120 Chapter 4  Table 4.3  continued   OPTION  User-key directory  Authorization file  DESCRIPTION  Specifies the directory where the user’s public key will be stored. The default is %D\.ssh2, which is the users’ home directory in the .ssh2 folder  for example,  home   .ssh2 on Unix and Documents and Settings\ \.ssh2 on Windows .  Stores a valid list of public keys that will be authorized for public-key authentication. The default is the authorization file, which is stored in the users’ home directory  for example,  home   .ssh2 on Unix and Documents and Settings\ \.ssh2 on Windows .  SSH Communications’ SSH Server  Unix  The SSH server for Unix offers authentication options similar to the Windows platform. One difference is that the Windows Server configuration screen is simply a GUI that points to the SSH configuration file, which is sshd2_config; the Unix version of the SSH Communications’ server does not use a GUI but directly uses the configuration file itself. To view the authentication options, enter the following commands.  Options  in  the  authentication  section  are  listed  in  Table  4.4,  along  with  a  cd  etc ssh2 more sshd2_config  description of each option.  Table 4.4 Authentication  OPTION  BannerMessageFile  PasswordGuesses  DESCRIPTION  Denotes the location of the file that contains the banner message, such as “The only way to win is not to play.” Default path is  etc ssh2 ssh_banner_message.  Specifies the number of attempts a user has in order to enter the correct password.   Authentication 121  Table 4.4  continued   OPTION  DESCRIPTION  AllowedAuthentication  RequiredAuthentication  Indicates the types of authentication methods that are allowed by the SSH server. Options include hostbased, publickey, password, and PAM.  Names the types of authentication methods required by the SSH server. Options include hostbased, publickey, password, and PAM.  HostbasedAuthForce ClientHostnameDNSMatch  Forces a DNS match for authentication. Possible  choices are yes and no.  SshPAMClientPath client is used   States the location of the PAM client, if a PAM  VShell SSH Server VanDyke Software’s VShell SSH server offers a few options for authentication. Open the VShell configuration screen  Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell  and highlight the Authentication section of the screen.  See Figure 4.2.   Table 4.5 describes the general authentication options for VShell.  Figure 4.2 The User Authentication screen for VShell SSH server.   122 Chapter 4  Table 4.5 Authentication Options for VShell  OPTION  DESCRIPTION  Limit failed attempts to  Time authentication after  Restricts the number of failed attempts a user can have before the session is disconnected.  Sets the amount of time the user has to complete the authentication process. Specifically, from the time the user initiates the connection to the time the user enters a username password or private- key password.  Requires a password for authentication.  Requires a public key for authentication.   Sets the number of times a user can log in with  only a password in order to upload a public key. The feature is very useful if public-key authentication is the only method for authentication, giving the user a method to upload a public key.  Specifies the location where the users’ public keys will be stored. The default is Program Files\VShell\ Publickey\ .  Required authentication  methods—Password  Required authentication  methods—Public Key  Required authentication  methods—Public Key Uploads  Public-key folder  OpenSSH  Unix and Windows  OpenSSH server offers similar authentication options to those of VShell and SSH Communications’ SSH server. To view the authentication options, enter the following commands:  cd  etc ssh more sshd_config  or  c:\cd “Program Files”\OpenSSH\ssh c:\notepad sshd_config  The  options  for  the  authentication  section  for  OpenSSH  are  described  in  Table 4.6.   Table 4.6 Authentication Options for OpenSSH  Authentication 123  OPTION  LoginGraceTime  PermitRootLogin  StrictModes  DESCRIPTION  Specifies the amount of time the user has to complete the authentication process. Specifically, from the time the user initiates the connection to the time the user enters a username password or private key password.  Allows  yes  or disallows  no  the root user to log in to the SSH session. Best practice is to restrict root access and have authorized users ‘su’ to root.  Enables  yes  or disables  no  the checking of a user’s permission in his or her home directory and rhosts files before accepting authentication. This should be set to yes to protect against world- writeable files in home directories.  Allows public-key authentication; possible values are yes and no.  Names the path to the authorized key-validation file on the SSH server. The default is .ssh authorized_keys, which is the users’ home directory in the .ssh folder  for example,  home   .ssh authorized_keys on Program Files\OpenSSH\.ssh on Windows .  RSA Authentication  Allows RSA authentication.  Publickey Authentication  AuthorizedKeysFile  Rhost Authentication  Permits rhosts authentication for RSH  RhostsRSA Authentication  Allows rhosts authentication from RSA host keys  Hostbased Authentication  Authorizes host-based authentication   Password Authentication  Enables  yes  or disables  no  password authentication  PermitEmptyPasswords  Allows  yes  or disallows  no  the use of blank passwords  Passwords  Password authentication is the basic method of authentication for SSH. SSH servers  support  authentication  for  both  Windows  and  Unix  platforms.  SSH servers on Unix platforms have two methods for password authentication:   etc passwd or  etc shadow PAM  Pluggable Authentication Module            124 Chapter 4  Similarly,  password  authentication  on  Windows  supports  the  use  of  the SAM   Security  Accounts  Manager   database  file,  located  at  %System- Root%\winnt\system32\config,  or  the  NTDS.DIT  database  file,  located  at %SystemRoot%\NTDS\ntds.dit.   Despite the database files that SSH supports, the location and type of oper- ating system is irrelevant to the actual setup and usage of passwords. It should be noted that password authentication is enabled by default on most, if not all, SSH servers. However, it is important to know how to disable enable pass- word authentication in order to possibly disable it in favor of stronger authen- tication, such as public-key authentication.   To enable password authentication, the process is quite simple. For a SSH server  installation  on  a  Unix  environment,  there  exists  a  configuration  file called sshd2_config  Commercial SSH  and sshd_config  OpenSSH . Both con- figuration files are quite similar. Sshd_config is usually located in  etc ssh, and  sshd2_config  is  located   etc sshd2.  Enter  the  following  command  to show the contents of the OpenSSH configuration file:  An abbreviated portion of the output is listed as follows:  cd  etc ssh more sshd_config   Authentication: LoginGraceTime 600 PermitRootLogin yes StrictModes yes   To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here! PasswordAuthentication yes PermitEmptyPasswords no   Under the Authentication section, denoted by Authentication, many set- tings are given that can be used for the SSH server. The option you are most concerned with is the PasswordAuthentication setting. This setting needs to be set to Yes in order for password authentication to be valid, which is the default. Furthermore, if password authentication should be disabled in favor of other authentication methods, this setting should be set to No and uncommented, which  means  deleting  the    from  the  beginning  of  the  line.  An  example  follows:   To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here! PasswordAuthentication no PermitEmptyPasswords no   Enter the following command to show the contents of the SSH configuration  Authentication 125  file for Commercial SSH:  cd  etc ssh2 more sshd2_config  An abbreviated portion of the output follows:   Authentication  publickey and password allowed by default         AllowedAuthentications          publickey,password        AllowedAuthentications          hostbased,publickey,password        AllowedAuthentications          hostbased,publickey,keyboard-        RequiredAuthentications         publickey,password        LoginGraceTime                  600        AuthInteractiveFailureTimeout   2  Under the Authentication section, denoted by Authentication, are many settings that can be set for the SSH server. The option you are most concerned with  is  the  AllowedAuthentications  setting.  This  setting  by  default  accepts both password and public keys. In order for password authentication to be valid, password must be written on this line, even though that is the default setting.  Furthermore,  if  password  authentication  is  not  required  or  desired, simply  remove  password  from  all  the AllowedAuthentications  lines,  which disables the use of passwords for authentication. As with OpenSSH, be sure to uncomment the line, which means deleting the  at the beginning. Refer to the following example to disable password for authentication:   Authentication  publickey and password allowed by default  AllowedAuthentications          publickey         AllowedAuthentications          hostbased,publickey,password        AllowedAuthentications          hostbased,publickey,keyboard-        RequiredAuthentications         publickey,password        LoginGraceTime                  600        AuthInteractiveFailureTimeout   2  The process of enabling password authentication on Windows-based oper- ating systems is equally simple; however, the process is different for OpenSSH than Commercial SSH or VanDyke’s VShell SSH server. For OpenSSH installa- tions  on  Windows  environments,  there  exists  a  configuration  file  called sshd_config  located  at  Program  Files\OpenSSH\ssh\.  Enter  the  following commands to show the contents of the OpenSSH configuration file:  C:\cd “Program Files”\OpenSSH\ssh\ C:\type sshd_config   126 Chapter 4  The following is an abbreviated portion of the output:  PermitRootLogin                 yes PasswordAuthentication          yes  Similar to OpenSSH on Unix, yes must be present on the Password Authen- tication line in order for passwords to be used; however, password authentica- tion is enabled by default. In order to disable the use of password, no must be present. The following example disables password authentication:  PermitRootLogin                 yes PasswordAuthentication          no  Enabling password authentication with VanDyke Software’s VShell is also quite easy. Using the configuration tool  Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell , there is an Authentication section for the Authentication options. Under the Authentication section, you will see many options that can be set. One of the options is Required authentication methods. Under this option are two check- boxes: one for Password and one for Public Key. Simply click the checkbox for Password and hit the Apply button in the lower right-hand corner. Password authentication has now been enabled for all SSH users on the server. If pass- word authentication is not required or desired, simply uncheck the Password checkbox and select the Public Key checkbox, which means public-key config- uration must take place  discussed in the following section . Figure 4.3 shows VShell’s Authentication menu.   Figure 4.3 Authentication section for VShell SSH server.   Authentication 127  Figure 4.4 User Authentication section for SSH Communications SSH Server.  Programs  ➪  Similarly, enabling password authentication for SSH Communications’ SSH server  on  Windows  platforms  is  quite  easy.  Using  the  configuration  menu  Start  ➪ SSH  Secure  Shell  Server  ➪ Configuration ,  there  is  a  User Authentication  section  for  the Authentication  options.  Under  the  User Authentication section, you will see many options that can be set. One of the options  is  Password  authentication.  Under  this  option  are  three  choices  in  the  drop-down  menu.  In  order  to  permit  password  authentication,  simply  set the drop-down menu to Allow and select Apply on the lower-half of the menu.

If  password  authentication  is  not  required  or  desired,  simply  select  Deny  from  the  drop-down  menu  and  hit Apply.  Be  sure  to  configure public-key configuration in order for authentication to occur  discussed in the following section . Figure 4.4 shows the SSH User Authentication menu.  Host-Based Authentication  Host-based authentication is another method of authentication in a SSH envi- ronment. Each entity in a SSH architecture, either an SSH server or SSH client, can contain a host key for identification. The host key is used to uniquely dis- tinguish the client or server from any other entity. Furthermore, the host key is unique only to the operating system and cannot be easily duplicated from one machine  to  the  next.  Host-key-based  authentication  is  used  to  replace  IP address  authentication  used  in  RSH   remote  shell   authentication.  Since  an    128 Chapter 4  IP address can be easily spoofed, using an IP address as a method of authenti- cation is extremely insecure. Furthermore, host keys cannot be easily spoofed and can be used to uniquely authenticate a SSH server or a SSH client. Host- based  authentication  is  best  suited  for  scripted  environments,  where  user- name password combinations cannot be used or are too cumbersome for the required  business  use   for  example,  nightly  encrypted  backups .  Table  4.7 shows the locations of the host keys in SSH servers.  Once the host keys have been located and identified, the public host keys, denoted  by  the  .pub  extension,  should  be  copied  to  the  remote  server.  For example, if a machine called AUM wants to connect to another machine called OM with host-based authentication, the public key host key should be copied to the OM SSH server. This will allow the OM SSH server to accept authenti- cation from the AUM machine based on the host key itself, without any need for a password. The following steps should be conducted in order to set up host-based authentication with the AUM server and OM server.  1. Host AUM should generate a host key.  Depending on the type of oper-  ating system and environment, the syntax may be different.  The fol- lowing is a list of the syntax depending on the environment: ssh-keygen –P Aum  OpenSSH  ssh-keygen2 –P Aum  SSH Communications   2. This will create the private host key and the public host key. The public  host-key file is Aum.pub and the private host-key file is Aum.  3. Copy Aum.pub to the knownhost folder in  etc ssh2 for SSH Commu-  nications’ SSH server and  etc ssh ssh_known_hosts for OpenSSH SSH’s server. For SSH Communications, copy Aum.pub to  etc ssh2 knownhosts; however, rename Aum.pub to the fully quali- fied DNS name in the following form: hostname.domain.ssh-dss.pub.  A fully qualified domain name is a full DNS name of a machine on a given network.  For example, if machine AUM belongs to the eNapkin domain, its name should be changed to Aum.eNapkin.ssh-dss.pub. For OpenSSH, just add the key to the authorized key file, as the following shows: cd .ssh cat Aum.pub >> authorized_keys  4. On the OM server, create a file called named .shosts. Place Aum  .eNapkin.com   and the username, such as root. The following  is an example: Aum.eNapkin.com   root   Authentication 129  Table 4.7 Types of SSH Software and the Locations of the Host Keys  SSH SOFTWARE  HOST KEY LOCATION  SSH Communications’ server  Unix     etc ssh2  SSH Communications’ server  Windows   Program Files\SSH Secure Shell Server  VShell SSH server  OpenSSH server  Program Files\VShell\hostkey   etc ssh  5. Configure the OM SSH server to accept host-based authentication by  editing the configuration file. Edit sshd2_config to enable host keys for authentication for SSH Communications’ SSH server:  Authentication  publickey and password allowed by default  AllowedAuthentications         publickey, hostbased  6. To enable host-based authentication for OpenSSH, edit the sshd_config  7. Test the configuration by resetting the SSH server and typing the fol-  file and change the line to yes: HostbasedAuthentication yes  lowing syntax: ssh root@OM  Server Authentication  In  addition  to  traditional  host-based  authentication  for  user  access,  a  SSH client can confirm the identification of a SSH server with host-key information. When  a  SSH  client  first  attempts  to  authenticate  to  a  SSH  server,  the  SSH server  sends  its  public  host  key  to  the  client  in  order  to  identify  itself.  The client can then accept and save the host key locally in order to authenticate or verify the connection the next time the SSH client attempts to log in. The host key accepted by the client is added to the host-key database that the SSH client stores locally on the client machine. Each time the SSH client attempts to log in to the SSH server, the client will compare the SSH server’s host key with the host key in the SSH client’s host-key database to make sure it matches. If the keys do not match, the SSH client can choose not to log in to the SSH server, due  to  possible  tampering  with  the  SSH  server  or  possibly  a  man-in-the- middle attack.    130 Chapter 4  Table 4.8 The Type of SSH Software and the Location of the Host Keys  SSH SOFTWARE  HOST KEY LOCATION  SSH Communications’ client  Unix     root .ssh2 hostkeys  SSH Communications’ client  Windows  Documents and Settings\Administrator\  SecureCRT   Application Data\SSH\HostKeys  C:\DocumentsandSettings\Administrator\ Application Data\Van Dyke Technologies\ SecureCRT\HostKeyDatabase  OpenSSH client   etc ssh hostkeys  The  server-authentication  process  protects  against  pure  IP-address  based verifications, where a SSH client would trust a SSH server based solely on its IP address.  Since  IPv4  networks  are  susceptible  to  IP address  spoofing, reliance on IP addresses for identification is not secure. Public host keys for SSH servers offer an excellent method for a SSH client to verify and authenti- cate the SSH server that they will be communicating with. Table 4.8 shows the location of the host-key database for SSH clients.  SecureCRT and SSH Communications’ SSH clients both show the host-key  database on their respective client GUI, as shown in Figures 4.5 and 4.6.  Figure 4.5 shows the host-key database for SecureCRT. This is the repository for the SSH client for all host keys obtained after a connection is made to a SSH server. This host-key database will be referenced each time the SSH client con- nects to the same SSH server to make sure the host keys match.  Figure 4.5 SecureCRT host-key database.   Authentication 131  Figure 4.6 SSH Communications’ host-key database.  Figure  4.6  shows  the  host-key  database  for  SSH  Communications’  SSH client. Similar to SecureCRT, this is the repository for the SSH client for all host keys obtained after a connection is made to a SSH server. This host-key data- base  will  be  referenced  each  time  the  SSH  client  connects  to  the  same  SSH server to make sure the host keys match.  Public Keys  Public-key authentication is one of the best authentication methods provided by SSH. Unlike password authentication, public-key authentication requires each user to contain a public-key file in order to authenticate. The fact that many corporate networks rely on user passwords, no matter how strong or weak, to protect sensitive and propriety information leaves many networks vulnerable to simple attacks. The following sidebar provides several reasons why  using  passwords  on  sensitive  systems  may  not  be  the  best  decision  in order to attain an acceptable level of security:   132 Chapter 4  WHY PASSWORDS MAY NOT PROVIDE THE BEST SECURITY  Passwords are often weak. Passwords can be shared easily. Brute-force attacks, the act of trying every password combination based on a dictionary list of words, can guess passwords in an automated fash- ion.  If a password is compromised, it is very difficult to detect an incident, since all communication would look like that of an authorized user. ◆ Hostile SSH clients could contain key-loggers to capture a password.  Passwords alone do not force two-factor authentication. Passwords are susceptible to the Sticky-Note attack  the act of writing down a password on a Post-It note and sticking it to a computer monitor . Passwords can be shared from one application, such as SSH, to another application, such as FTP or NTLM authentication. A hostile attacker could sniff other weak protocols, such as FTP and NTLM, for passwords. If the user has the same password for all three accounts, which is the case in many situations, the malicious attacker would have a valid SSH password.  Now that you have seen some of the security issues with passwords, you will learn about using public keys for authentication and why the use of key- based authentication can virtually eliminate many of the issues described pre- viously. The following sidebar lists the strengths that public-key authentication offers in a typical network environment, both internally to the network and externally.  Key-based  authentication  in  a  SSH  environment  uses  public  and  private keys. The following is a summary of the steps required to generate a key pair for SSH:  1. An authorized user must generate a public and private key pair. 2. The user has the option of password protecting the private key, which is  recommended in almost all environments.  3. The user’s public key needs to be securely uploaded to the SSH server,  usually stored in the user’s home directory. For example, the user Kusum would have a public key stored in  home Kusum .ssh  or Documents and Settings\Kusum\.ssh of the SSH server.  4. Authorization, Identification, and authorized_keys files need to be   5. Public-key authentication needs to be configured on the SSH server,  which is enabled by default on many SSH installations.  populated.  That is it!  ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆  Authentication 133  STRENGTHS OF PUBLIC-KEY AUTHENTICATION  Key-based authentication supports industry best practice of two-factor authentication. Public Private keys cannot be shared as easily as passwords  Public and private keys can still be shared from one machine to the next!  If a private key is stolen or compromised, the private key can be pass- word protected, which enforces another level of security, protecting it from being used successfully by a malicious user.  Sole reliance on user passwords is virtually eliminated. Brute-force attacks, and other password attacks, cannot be executed against public keys. Sniffing, key loggers, and the Sticky-Note attack are no longer significant threats with public-key authentication. In order for an unauthorized user to successfully authenticate to a SSH server, a malicious user would have to compromise an authorized user’s machine, obtain a copy of his or her pubic and private key, and guess the passphrase of the private key. This scenario may require more effort for an attacker than moving to an easier target or easier network.  For key-based authentication to be implemented, each valid user must con- tain a public and private key pair. The process of creating a public and private key pair is the responsibility of the SSH client, not the SSH server. The public and private keys are stored on the local machine—the user’s machine—and a copy of the user’s public key is stored on the SSH server. To authenticate, the user must contain both the public and private keys. The user must authenti- cate,  using  a  password,  to  his  or  her  local  private  key,  which  decrypts  the  private-key file and enables it. Once authentication is granted, the public key is used to authenticate to the SSH server. The SSH server receives the public key  and  determines  if  the  public  key  matches  the  same  public  key  that  the server holds for that particular user. If the match is correct, the user is then authenticated.  The  data  flow  for  public-key  authentication  is  illustrated  in Figure 4.7.  As noted in Step 1, creating a public and private key pair is the responsibil- ity of the SSH client, not the SSH server. Since several different SSH clients exist, I will address the process of creating a public and private key with each of the following SSH clients:    OpenSSH  Unix and Windows   SSH Communications  Unix and Windows Command Line  SSH Communications  Windows GUI  VanDyke SecureCRT                ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆ ◆  134 Chapter 4  1. SSH password  decrypts private key  2. SSH public key sent  3. SSH public successfully matched  4. SSH session begins  SSH Client  - Holds SSH Public and Private keys  Figure 4.7 Key-based authentication in SSH.  SSH Server  - Holds SSH Public keys  Furthermore, I will demonstrate how to convert specific SSH client keys to fit a particular SSH server. For example, OpenSSH keys are not interpretable to SSH Communications’ SSH servers by default. While it would be very nice if all public and private keys could be used from one SSH server to the other, the reality is that you need to modify your public and private keys in order to use them  across  multiple  environments.  The  SSH  servers  you  will  make  your client keys interoperable with are the following:  SSH Communications    OpenSSH  VShell  NOTE  In the following sections, the use of ssh, ssh-keygen, ssh.exe, and  ssh-keygen.exe refers to OpenSSH SSH clients. Furthermore, the use of ssh2, ssh-keygen2, ssh2.exe, and ssh-keygen2.exe refers to SSH Communications’ SSH clients. Lastly, the use of vsh.exe and vcp.exe refers to VanDyke Software SSH clients.   Creating Keys with OpenSSH  To create keys with the OpenSSH client, complete the following steps on the client machine.  1. Change directories to the location of the ssh-keygen binary:  cd  usr bin C:\cd “Program Files”\OpenSSH\bin  2. Create a DSA key pair:  ssh-keygen -d c:\Program Files\OpenSSH\ssh-keygen.exe -d Generating public private dsa key pair.             Authentication 135  3. Enter the name of the key pair  I will call ours Shreya ; then enter a  passphrase, and confirm the passphrase: Enter file in which to save the key   root  .ssh id_dsa : Shreya Enter passphrase  empty for no passphrase : Enter same passphrase again:  4. After you have confirmed the passphrase, both the public and private  keys should be generated. In this case, the names will be Shreya.pub for the public-key file and Shreya for the private-key file. The key finger- print will be displayed on the shell or command prompt: Your identification has been saved in Shreya. Your public key has been saved in Shreya.pub. The key fingerprint is: ed:1e:67:22:79:d8:81:c9:b4:ee:0d:f5:55:0d:cf:5c   5. OpenSSH client keys have been generated!  After the creation process has been completed, copy the OpenSSH client key to the SSH server, specifically to the .ssh folder in the users’ home directory  for  example,   home   .ssh PublicKey.pub.  The  following  sec- tion demonstrates how to use an OpenSSH key on an OpenSSH server, a SSH Communications’ SSH server, and a VanDyke VShell SSH server.  How to Use an OpenSSH Key on an OpenSSH Server  After the OpenSSH public key has been securely uploaded to the SSH server, typically  in  the  users’  home  directory    home Shreya .ssh Shreya.pub  or Program Files\OpenSSH\.ssh\Shreay.pub , you also need to append the key to the authorized key-list file, which is labeled authorized_keys in the users’ home  directory    home   .ssh authorized_keys .  Example  syn- tax is as follows on the server machine:  [Shreya@OpenSSH]$cat Shreya.pub >>  home   .ssh authorized_keys   Furthermore, the permissions on the public-key and private-key pairs need to be protected in order to be used. Set the following permission on the key files generated on the client machine:  [Shreya@localhost]$chmod 600 Shreya [Shreya@localhost]$chmod 600 Shreya.pub  Once  you  have  made  the  key  pairs,  uploaded  the  public-key  file  to  the appropriate home directory, added the key to the authorized_keys file, and set the correct permissions, you should be able to log in with the public key. Sam- ple syntax follows on the client machine:   [Shreya@localhost]$ssh   -i Shreya   136 Chapter 4  appear:  If  you  attach  a  passphrase  to  the  private  key,  the  following  text  should  Enter passphrase for key ‘Shreya’:  After  entering  your  passphrase,  you  should  be  logged  in  to  the  SSH   connection:  [Shreya@OpenSSH Shreya]$  How to Use an OpenSSH Key on SSH Communications’  SSH Server  To use an OpenSSH key on SSH Communications’ SSH server, the key must be converted to the SSH2 format, using the following commands.  1. Convert your OpenSSH client key to the SSH Communications’ SSH  compatible format. To convert the keys, you must set a blank passphrase for the private key  ssh-keygen -p -f Shreya . After the key conversation is complete, make sure you go back and set a passphrase for both the old OpenSSH key and the newly converted SSH2 key. Use the following commands to convert the key on the client machine: [Shreya@localhost]$ssh-keygen -e -f Shreya.pub > SSH2-Shreya.pub [Shreya@localhost]$ssh-keygen –e –f Shreya > SSH2-Shreya  2. Once you have copied the public key to the SSH Communications’ SSH server in the users’ home directory, specifically in the .ssh2 folder in the users’ home directory   home   .ssh2 publickey.pub on Unix and Documents and Settings\ \.ssh2\publickey.pub on Windows , you need to add a public-key entry to the authorization file, which is labeled Authorization, also in the users’ home directory on the SSH server. The contents of the authorization file on the SSH server should be Key, followed by the actual public-key name. Key       SSH2-Shreya.pub  3. After the authorization file has been created on the SSH server, an iden- tification file needs to be created on the SSH client, typically in the ssh2 folder in the users’ home directory   home   .ssh2 for Unix and Documents and Settings\ \.ssh2\ for Windows . This file is used by the SSH client to indicate which private keys to use for authentication. Furthermore, unlike OpenSSH, this file is used with the –i option to point to the correct private keys for authentication. For   Authentication 137  example, while OpenSSH uses “–i  ” syntax, SSH Commu- nications’ uses “–i identification” for the syntax. The syntax to create the identification file is as follows on the client: echo “IdKey SSH2-Shreya” >> identification  4. After the identification file has been created on the SSH server, the per- missions on the public-key and private-key pairs need to be protected in order to be used. Set the following permission on the SSH client for the appropriate key files that were generated. [Shreya@localhost]$chmod 600 SSH2-Shreya [Shreya@localhost]$chmod 600 SSH2-Shreya.pub  5. Once you have made the key pairs, uploaded the public-key files to the  appropriate home directory, added the entry to the authorization file, and added the entry to the identification file, you should now be able to log in with the public key. Be sure to use the identification file with the –i option, not the private-key file; otherwise you will receive a “No fur- ther authentication methods available” error. The following is sample syntax: [Shreya@localhost]$ssh2 SSH-Server –i identification  How to Use an OpenSSH Key on a VShell SSH Server  Using an OpenSSH client key for a VShell SSH server is more straightforward than the previous section. Since VShell SSH servers accept the OpenSSH key format, it is not necessary to convert OpenSSH keys to any other format, which saves  valuable  time  and  a  lot  of  potential  headache!  Since  you  have  an OpenSSH  client  key,  I  will  demonstrate  how  to  use  the  OpenSSH  key  for VShell SSH servers.   1. Copy the OpenSSH public-key file to the remote VShell SSH server,  specifically in public-key folder located at C:\ Program Files\VShell\PublicKey\%USER%.   2. Make sure public-key authentication is enabled on the remote VShell  SSH server.  3. From the client machine, connect to the VShell SSH server with the fol-  lowing syntax: ssh   -p 22 –i OpenSSHPrivatekey –l <username on VShell server>   138 Chapter 4  Using the preceding example, with Shreya as the OpenSSH private key, an  example authentication process is as follows:  ssh VshellServer –p 22 –i Shreya –l shreya Enter passphrase for key ‘Shreya’: Authenticated with partial success Shreya@VshellServer’s password: C:\  Notice that after the key is authenticated, VShell asks for a password on the VShell server. This happens only if both the password and public-key check- boxes are required on the VShell server. If public key was the only required authentication method, a password prompt would not occur; however, this is a  great  method  of  enforcing  two-factor  authentication,  which  should  be required for management purposes.  Creating Keys with SSH Communications’ SSH Client  Unix and Windows Command Line  To create keys with SSH Communications’ SSH client on either Windows or Unix, complete the following steps.  1. Change directories to the location of the ssh-keygen binary:  cd  usr local bin C:\cd “Program Files”\SSH Secure Shell\bin  2. Create a DSA key pair:  ssh-keygen2  Generating 2048-bit dsa key pair  2 OOo.oOo.oOo.  3. After the key has been generated, enter a passphrase, and confirm the  passphrase: Key generated. 2048-bit dsa, kusum@localhost.com, Fri Aug 15 2003 11:17:00 Passphrase : Again      : Private key saved to  home kusum .ssh2 id_dsa_2048_a Public key saved to  home kusum .ssh2 id_dsa_2048_a.pub  4. After you have confirmed your passphrase, both the public and private  keys should be generated. In this case, the names will be id_dsa_2048_a.pub for the public-key file and id_dsa_2048_a for the private-key file. The key should be automatically saved to the .ssh2 folder in the users’ hold directory in Unix   home    .ssh2   and the users’ home folder in Windows  Documents and    Authentication 139  Settings   Application Data SSH UserKeys . The follow- ing shows the Windows location: Private key saved to C: Documents and Settings Administrator Application Data SSH UserKeys id_dsa_2048_a Public key saved to C: Documents and Settings Administrator Application Data SSH UserKeys id_dsa_2048_a.pub  5. The SSH Communications’ SSH client keys have been generated!  After the creation process has been completed, copy the SSH public-client key to the SSH server. The following section demonstrates how to use SSH client keys with a SSH Communications’ SSH Server, an OpenSSH server, and a VanDyke VShell SSH server.  How to Use SSH Client Keys with  SSH Communications’ SSH Server  After  you  have  securely  uploaded  your  public  key   for  example,. id_dsa_2048_a.pub  to the SSH server, typically in the users’ home directory   home   .ssh2  for  Unix  and  Documents  and  Settings\<user- name>\.ssh2\ for Windows , you also need to add a public-key entry to the authorization  file,  which  is  labeled  Authorization,  also  in  the  users’  home directory. The syntax is as follows:  Key   id_dsa_2048_a.pub  After the authorization file has been created on the SSH server, an identifi- cation file needs to be created on the SSH client, typically in the ssh2 folder in the  users’  home  directory    home   .ssh2  for  Unix  and  Docu- ments and Settings\ \.ssh2\ for Windows . This file is used by the SSH  client,  with  the  –i  flag,  to  indicate  the  private  keys  to  use  in  order  to authenticate. Be sure to use this file with the –i option on the SSH client. The syntax to create this file is as follows:  echo “IdKey  id_dsa_2048_a” >> identification  Once  you  have  made  the  key  pairs,  uploaded  the  public-key  files  to  the appropriate  home  directory,  added  the  entry  to  the  authorization  file,  and added the entry to the identification file, you should be able to log in with the public key. The following is a demonstration of the syntax:  ssh2   -i identification   140 Chapter 4  How to Use SSH Client Keys with an OpenSSH Server  To use the SSH Communications’ SSH Client public-key and private-key pair with an OpenSSH server, complete the following steps.  1. Make sure your key pairs do not contain a passphrase. While it is  important to remove any passphrases during the conversation process, make sure you add a passphrase to both the old key and the newly con- verted keys after the conversation process is completed. To change the passphrase of your key, use the –e switch. ssh-keygen2 –e id_dsa_2048_a  2. Once the passphrases have been removed, we must convert our SSH  Communications’ SSH keys to the OpenSSH compatible format, using the following commands: [Shreya@localhost]$ssh-keygen2 -1 id_dsa_2048_a.pub >   id_dsa_2048_a_Open.pub  [Shreya@localhost]$ssh-keygen2 –1 id_dsa_2048_a > id_dsa_2048_a_Open 3. Once you have copied the public key to the SSH server, using SFTP or some alternative secure method  there is no automated tool to do this , enter the following command on the OpenSSH server to add the newly converted public key to the authorized key file, located in the users’ home directory, on the OpenSSH server. [Shreya@OpenSSHserver]$cat id_dsa_2048_a_Open.pub >>  home Shreya .ssh authorized_keys  4. On the SSH client, the permissions on the public-key and private-key pairs need to be protected to be used. Set the following permission on the key files that were generated: [Shreya@localhost]$chmod 600 id_dsa_2048_a_Open.pub [Shreya@localhost]$chmod 600 id_dsa_2048_a_Open  5. You should now be able to authenticate, since you have converted your  SSH Communications’ SSH client key to OpenSSH format and have added the key to the authorized key-list file:  usr bin ssh SSH-Server –i id_dsa_2048_a_Open  How to Use SSH Client Keys with a VShell SSH Server  Using a SSH Communications’ client key for a VShell SSH server is quite sim- ple. Since VShell SSH servers accept the SSH Communications’ SSH2 key for- mat, it is not necessary to convert SSH Communications’ keys to any other format,  which  saves  valuable  time  and  a  lot  of  potential  headache!  VShell   Authentication 141  accepts the OpenSSH key format; therefore, the converted OpenSSH key from the  previous  section  could  also  be  used  on  a  VShell  SSH  server.  I  will  now demonstrate how to use both an SSH Communications’ SSH key and a con- verted OpenSSH client key for VShell SSH servers.   1. Copy your SSH Communications’ key and OpenSSH public key-file to the remote VShell SSH server, specifically in public-key folder located at C:\ Program Files\VShell\PublicKey\%USER%.   2. Make sure public-key authentication is enabled on the remote VShell  SSH server.  3. From the client machine, connect to the VShell SSH server with the   following syntax. ssh2   -p 22 –i identification –l <username on VShell server> ssh   -p 22 –i OpenSSHPrivatekey –l <username on VShell server>  Using the previous example, with id_dsa_2048_a and the SSH Communica- tions’  key  and  id_dsa_2048_a_Open  as  the  converted  OpenSSH  client  key, complete the following steps to authenticate to the VShell SSH server.   SSH Communications’ Client Key  ssh2 VshellServer –p 22 –i identification –l   Enter passphrase for key ‘ : Authenticated with partial success Shreya@VshellServer’s password: C:\  OpenSSH Convert Client Key  ssh VshellServer –p 22 –i id_dsa_2048_a_Open –l   Enter passphrase for key ‘ : Authenticated with partial success Shreya@VshellServer’s password: C:\  Notice that after the key is authenticated, VShell asks for a password on the VShell server. This happens only if both the password and public-key check- boxes are required on the VShell server. If public key was the only required authentication method, a password prompt would not occur; however, this is a  great  method  of  enforcing  two-factor  authentication,  which  should  be required for management purposes.   142 Chapter 4  Creating Keys with SSH Communications  Windows GUI  To  create  keys  the  SSH  Communications’  SSH  client,  the  following  steps should be completed.  1. Open the SSH client: Start ➪ Programs ➪  SSH Secure Shell ➪  Secure  Shell client.  2. From the Menu bar, select Edit ➪ 3. In the Settings display, there should be a User Authentication section.  Settings.  Under the User Authentication section, there is a subcategory called Keys. Select the Keys subcategory.  4. At this point, you should see a screen similar to Figure 4.8. 5. To generate a new public and private-key pair, select the option that  says Generate New...  6. The wizard should be displayed, describing the process of creating a  key pair. After you have read the description, select Next.  7. The Key Properties screen should appear next. This screen gives you the option of selecting a DSA or RSA key type and the key length you would like to use. In general, the better the key length, the stronger the security; however, the greater the performance hit you will have to accept. After selecting the type of key and the key length, select Next.  8. The Generation screen should appear next. This screen initiates the process of actually creating the key. The key-generation process can take several minutes. Once the process is completed, select Next.   9. The Enter Passphrase screen should appear next. This screen allows  you to enter a name for the public and private-key pair, a comment for description purposes only, and a passphrase to protect the private key. Enter your preferred file name, such as your username, a comment, and a passphrase that is difficult to guess but easy to remember. After enter- ing this information, select Next.  Note that if the passphrases do not match, the Next option will not be enabled. Make sure your passphrases match before attempting to select Next.   10. The Finish screen should appear next. At this stage, the public and pri- vate keys have been generated and stored to your local machine. At this point, you have the option of uploading your public key to the SSH server if a valid connection currently exists. If a valid connection exists  meaning you connected to the SSH server before starting the key- generation procedure , select Upload Public Key; however, you will be uploading the key to multiple SSH servers later in this section, so select Finish and skip to Step 13 if you wish to skip this step.   Authentication 143  Figure 4.8 Keys subcategory for SSH Communications’ SSH client.  11. After selecting Upload Public Key, a new display should appear. The  display should contain the name of the public key, the destination folder for the key to be placed, which is the folder on the SSH server to place the key, most likely  home user .ssh2, and the authorization file to add the key to, such as authorization. After verifying that all the items are correct, select Upload.  12. After selecting Upload, you will see a successful completion of the  upload, where you can select finish; however, if you want to require the use of public keys only, you will have to go back and edit the sshd2_config file to require only the use of public keys and to delete password or host-based authentication. Also, if you receive an error in the upload process, probably the SSH server you are attempting to con- nect to is not a SSH Communications’ SSH server, so the key-converting process will have to be followed, listed as follows.  13. At this point, you should be redirected to the initial Key subcategory screen. To confirm that the keys have been generated appropriately, browse to Documents and Settings\ \Application Data\SSH\UserKeys. There should be both the public key  *.pub  and private key located in this folder. Also, the Key subcategory screen should appear with the newly generated key in the Keys field, as shown in Figure 4.9.  14. SSH Communications’ SSH keys have been generated!   144 Chapter 4  Figure 4.9 The private-key file name in SSH Communications’ SSH client.  After the creation process has been completed, the process of uploading the public  key  is  next.  The  following  section  demonstrates  how  to  upload  a  SSH Communications’ SSH client public-key and private-key pair to a SSH Communications’ SSH server, an OpenSSH server, and a VanDyke VShell SSH server.  How to Upload an SSH Client Key Pair to SSH Communications’ SSH Server  The process of uploading a SSH client key to an SSH server is quite simple if both the systems are the same, meaning they are both from the same applica- tion   OpenSSH  versus  Commercial .  To  upload  the  SSH  Communications’ SSH  client  public  key  to  a  SSH  Communications’  SSH  server   Windows  or Unix , complete the following steps.  1. Open the SSH Client: Start ➪ Programs ➪  SSH Secure Shell ➪  Secure  Shell Client.  2. Connect to the SSH Communications’ SSH server using a username and password. This can be completed with the File ➪ Quick Connect option.  3. Once authenticated and connected to the SSH server, select, Edit ➪  Settings from the menu bar.   Authentication 145  4. In Settings display, there should be a User Authentication section.  Under the User Authentication section, there is a subcategory called Keys. Select the Keys subcategory.  5. In the Keys subcategory, there should be a Public key management sec- tion where an Upload... button should exist. Simply select the Upload... button to upload the public key to the SSH server.  6. After selecting Upload..., a new display should appear. The display  should contain the name of the public key, the destination folder for the key to be placed in, which is the folder on the SSH server to place the key, most likely  home user .ssh2, and the authorization file to add the key to, such as authorization. The authorization file is read by the SSH server to identify which users can use public keys for authentica- tion. After verifying that all the items are correct, select Upload.   7. If the Upload box disappears suddenly, you have successfully uploaded  the public key to the SSH server. To confirm, check the home directory on the SSH server  Documents and Settings\ \Application Data\SSH on Windows and  home   .ssh on Unix  to  verify the existence of the *.pub file, which is the public-key file for  the user.   8. Using Quick connect, you should be able to authenticate with the   public-key option for Authentication Method.  How to Upload an SSH Client Key Pair to an OpenSSH Server  To use the SSH Communications’ SSH Client public and private-key pair to a OpenSSH server, complete the following steps.  1. Make sure your key pairs do not contain a passphrase. While it is  important to remove any passphrases during the conversation process, make sure you add a passphrase to both the old key and the newly con- verted keys after the conversation process is completed.  a. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ b. Select Edit ➪ c. Highlight the correct private-key file name, and select Change  Settings ➪ User Authentication ➪ Keys.  SSH Secure Shell ➪  SSH Secure Shell.  Passphrase...  d. Enter the old passphrase, and leave the textbox blank for the new  passphrases, as shown in Figure 4.10.  e. Select Yes when the warning appears about using an empty  passphrase; however, make sure you go back and add a passphrase after the conversion is completed.   f. Hit OK to confirm the change.   146 Chapter 4  Figure 4.10 The screen to change a passphrase with SSH Communications’ GUI client.  2. Once the passphrases have been removed, you must convert your SSH Communications’ SSH keys to the OpenSSH compatible format, using the following commands:  On the SSH client, use the OpenSSH ssh-keygen utility to convert the keys:  ssh-keygen -i –f SSH2.pub > SSH2Open.pub ssh-keygen –i –f SSH > SSH2Open  3. Once you have copied the public key to the SSH server, using SFTP or some alternative secure method  there is no automated tool to do this , enter the following commands to send the newly converted public key to the authorized key files on the SSH sever.  On the OpenSSH server:  cat SSH2Open.pub >> authorized_keys  4. At this point, you want to incorporate your newly converted OpenSSH  SSH Secure Shell ➪  key to your GUI client. a. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ b. Choose Edit ➪ c. Select Import ➪ d. You will receive an error describing how the SSH client can read your public-key file; however, this is okay and will not affect the usage of the key.  Settings ➪ User Authentication ➪ Keys. SSH2Open.pub, as shown in Figure 4.11.  SSH Secure Shell.  5. Using Quick connect, you should be able to authenticate with the   public-key option for Authentication Method, as shown in Figure 4.12. 6. After selecting Connect, you should receive a similar error, describing how it cannot read your converted OpenSSH key. Select OK and you should now be logged in with the convert OpenSSH key to an OpenSSH server using the SSH Communications’ SSH client.   Authentication 147  Figure 4.11 The SSH2 converted key in OpenSSH format in the SSH Communications’ SSH GUI client.  How to Upload an SSH Client Key Pair to a VShell SSH Server  Using a SSH Communications’ client key for a VShell SSH server is quite sim- ple. Since VShell SSH servers accept the SSH Communications’ SSH2 key for- mat, it is not necessary to convert SSH Communications’ keys to any other format, which saves valuable time and a lot of potential headache!   1. Copy your SSH Communications’ public key to the remote VShell SSH  server, specifically in public-key folder located at C:\ Program Files\VShell\PublicKey\%USER%.   2. Make sure public-key authentication is enabled on the remote VShell  SSH server.  3. Since the public key  SSH2.pub  is already listed as a valid public key, there is no reason to import a new key; however, you can validate the   Figure 4.12 The Quick Connection option with the Public Key Authentication option.   148 Chapter 4  existence of the key by selecting Edit ➪ Settings ➪ Keys on the SSH client. Once you have verified the existence of the SSH Communica- tions’ SSH key, hit OK.  4. On the VShell SSH Server disable password authentication and enable  only public-key authentication. a. Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell b. Authentication >  Uncheck Password Check Public key  5. On the SSH Communications’ SSH client, use Quick connect to authen-  ticate with the public-key option for Authentication Method.   6. After selecting Connect, be logged-in with the SSH2 key to a VShell  SSH server using the SSH Communications’ SSH client.  Creating Keys with VanDyke SecureCRT To  create  keys  for  the  SecureCRT  SSH  client,  the  following  steps  should  be completed.  1. Open the SSH client: Start ➪ Programs ➪  SecureCRT 4.0 ➪  SecureCRT 4.0  2. From the Menu bar, select Tools ➪ Create Public Key... 3. The Key Generation Wizard should appear. After reading through the  introduction wizard page, select Next.  4. The Key type screen should appear next. This screen gives you the option of selecting a DSA or RSA key type. After selecting your pre- ferred key type, select Next.  5. The Passphrase screen should appear next. This screen allows you to set a passphrase that will protect the private key. The passphrase will need to be entered in order to decrypt the private key. The screen allows you to set a comment, possibly with identification information of the public and private key pair.  6. The Key length screen should appear next. This screen allows you to   set the key length, anywhere between 512 and 2048. Generally, the higher the key length, the stronger the security; however, it will have  a greater performance penalty.   7. The Generation screen should appear next. This screen initiates the  process of actually creating the key. Move the mouse around in order to create the key. Once the process is completed, select Next.            Authentication 149  8. The location screen should appear next. Unless you have a particular area to store the keys, it is recommended to key in the default location  C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\ VanDyke\Identity ; however, make sure to place NTFS permissions in the folder to restrict access to Guests, Everyone, and other unautho- rized groups. After selecting the location, click Finish.  9. You should a see a pop-up box, asking if you would like to use the key as your global public key. Select No, since you may have multiple keys with one default global key.  10. VanDyke SecureCRT public and private-key pairs have been generated!  After  the  creation  process  has  been  completed,  the  process  of  uploading  the public key is next. The following section demonstrates how to upload a SecureCRT client public and private-key pairs to a VanDyke VShell SSH server, a SSH Communications’ SSH server, and an OpenSSH server.   VShell SSH Server  Using a SecureCRT public and private-key pair on VanDyke Software’s SSH server is quite simple. The following steps should be complete.  1. Open SecureCRT  Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Make a valid connection to the VShell SSH server using the Quick Con-  Secure CRT .  Secure CRT ➪  nection option.  3. Once a valid connection has been established, go back to the quick con-  nect menu  File ➪ Quick Connect . Under the authentication section, there should be two drop-down boxes. The Primary method should be Password. For the Secondary methods, choose PublicKey and select the Properties button to the right.  4. The Public Key Properties menu should appear. Make sure the Use  global public key setting radio button is selected and the Use identify file radio button is also selected. After you have confirmed this, select the ... button and browse to the location of your public key; then select the public-key file.  5. After you have selected to your public-key file, select the Upload but-  ton to upload the public key to the VShell SSH server.   6. When SecureCRT has established a connection, it will ask you to  authenticate using your username and password on the VShell SSH server. Enter the valid username and password and select OK.  7. Once the username and password are authenticated, the public key will be uploaded to the VShell SSH server. You should see a menu similar to Figure 4.13.   150 Chapter 4  Figure 4.13 The confirmation of the SecureCRT public-key upload process.  8. You should now be able to use your public key to authenticate. To con- firm, enable only public-key authentication on the VShell SSH server.  a. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell. b. Highlight the Authentication section. c. Uncheck Password and check Public key for the required authenti- cation methods. Be sure to uncheck the Allow 3 password attempts checkbox, since the public key is already on the VShell SSH server.  9. On SecureCRT, select PublicKey for the Primary authentication method  and   for the Secondary authentication method. Be sure to browse to the correct public key with the Properties button.   10. Select Connect and you will authenticate with your public key and then  receive a VShell SSH session.  OpenSSH  To  use  the  SecureCRT  Client  public  and  private-key  pair  for  an  OpenSSH server, complete the following steps.  1. Make sure your key pairs do not contain a passphrase. While it is  important to remove any passphrases during the conversation process, make sure you add a passphrase to both the old key and the newly con- verted keys after the conversion process is completed.  a. Go to Start ➪ Programs ➪ SecureCRT. b. Choose File ➪ Quick Connect ➪ Protocol  ssh2  ➪ Authentication  SecureCRT ➪   Public Key .  c. Select Properties ➪ Change Passphrase. d. Enter the current passphrase, and leave the new passphrase blank. e. Select OK.    Authentication 151  2. Once the passphrases have been removed, you must convert your SecureCRT keys to the OpenSSH compatible format. On the client machine, use OpenSSH’s ssh-keygen utility to convert the keys. The keys are located at Documents and Settings\ \Application Data\VanDyke. Use the following commands: ssh-keygen -i –f CRTpublickey.pub > CRTpublickeyOpen.pub ssh-keygen –i –f CRTprivatekey > CRTprivatekeyOpen  3. Once you have copied the public key to the SSH server, using SFTP or  some alternative secure method, enter the following commands to send the newly converted public key to the authorized key files on the SSH server. On the OpenSSH server: cat CRTpublickeyOpen.pub >> authorized_keys  4. You should now be able to authenticate, since you have converted your  SecureCRT client key to OpenSSH format and have added the key to the authorized key-list file:  usr bin ssh OpenSSH-Server –i CRTprivatekeyOpen  SSH Communications’ SSH Server  The process of converting a SecureCRT client key to a SSH Communications’ SSH server is more straightforward than the previous section. Since SSH Com- munications’ uses SSH2 keys, converting your SecureCRT key is not required for SSH Communications’ SSH servers. Since you have an SSH2 key with your SecureCRT key, I will now demonstrate how to use the SecureCRT key for SSH Communications’ SSH servers.   1. Copy your SSH2 SecureCRT public-key file SSH Communications’ SSH  Server, specifically in the .ssh2 folder in the Documents and Settings\  \ directory.  2. Open or make a file-name ‘authorization’ located in the following direc- tory: Documents and Settings\ \.ssh2. Add the new Secure- CRT public key to the authorized key lists. Key       CRTpublickey.pub Where CRTpublickey.pub is the SSH2 SecureCRT public key.  3. On the SSH SecureCRT client, open the Quick Connect screen  File ➪  Quick Connect , and enter the following information. a. Protocol: ssh2 b. Hostname:     152 Chapter 4  c. Port: port number, typically 22 d. Username: Username of the remote SSH server e. Authentication  Primary: PublicKey  Properties: Use your identity file: c:\Documents and Settings\ \Application Data\VanDyke\ CRTpublickey.pub  Secondary: Password  4. Select Connect. 5. You should now be logged in to a SSH Communications’ SSH server  using a SSH2 key generated from SecureCRT.  While the use of public keys for authentication purposes is by far the better solution of password authentication, the process of making SSH client keys interoperate with various SSH servers may not be an easy process in an enter- prise environment. For optimal usage, it is better to use tools and utilities that are interoperable with various platforms and technologies, and SSH is no dif- ferent.  The  use  of  VShell  SSH  servers  has  a  significant  advantage,  since  it accepts both OpenSSH keys and SSH2 keys without any need for any conver- sion from any client mentioned in this chapter. Similarly, using OpenSSH keys as your primary key may be a good solution, since both OpenSSH and VShell servers accept the OpenSSH format, leaving only one conversion required to work with SSH2 servers. Nevertheless, the choice of the SSH client-key format and SSH servers will depend on many items, not just the public-key conversa- tion process. As best practice, it is a good idea to have both formats of your public key made: one for OpenSSH and another for SSH2 formats.   SSH Agents The SSH agent is a simple utility that allows end-users to handle passphrases attached to public-key files in a simpler way. If multiple passphrases are being used with multiple public keys, it may be cumbersome for the end-user to type and retype all the passphrases several times. The SSH agent utility remembers your passphrases for you after the first time you have authenticated with the passphrase. It is a utility that remembers your private keys and provides the authentication portion to other SSH connections. Therefore, after you initially authenticate  with  your  passphrase,  the  SSH  agent  will  prevent  subsequent SSH sessions from asking you for your passphrase. The process to enable SSH agents involves the following four steps:               Authentication 153  1. Execute the SSH agent with the shell of your choice  bash, csh, tcsh,   or ksh .  2. Receive a new SSH shell  automatically . 3. Add the private keys with SSH-add command. 4. Log in to SSH sessions with the passphrase  only the first time .  In order to enable the SSH agent for OpenSSH and SSH Communications,  execute the following steps:  OpenSSH:  ssh-agent bash ssh-add    e.g. ssh-add Shreya  ssh –i OpenSSHPrivateKey    SSH Communications:  ssh-agent2 bash ssh-add2    e.g. ssh-add2 id_dsa_2048_a  ssh2 –i identification    Summary  This chapter discusses the various authentication options available in SSH. It should be noted that many of the authentication options, such as password attempts, are separate from the operating-system authentication options. For example, the operating system could have a password-attempts threshold at 5, while  the  SSH  service  has  a  password-attempts  threshold  at  3.  While  SSH servers on both Windows and Unix platforms use the local username pass- word database for authentication, such as  etc shadow or the SAM database, the  SSH  servers  can  have  additional  or  similar  authentication  options.  Fur- thermore, while SSH servers are using the same password database, the actual authentication options apply to different services. For example, to log on to a Windows  service  requires  the  use  of  SMB,  which  may  have  authentication options tied to it. These authentication options are separate from the authenti- cation  options  that  apply  to  the  SSH  service  on  the  operating  system,  even though both SMB and SSH are using the SAM database file.  While certain authentication options are discussed in detail in this chapter, such as password, public-key, and host-based authentication, there are several other authentications options, such as SecureID and Certificates, which are not discussed.  Both  SecureID  and  Certificate-based  authentication  are  strong authentication  methods  but  require  the  use  of  several  other  servers  and or   154 Chapter 4  devices, such as a RSA Ace server and a Certificate Authority, which are not included with any SSH package. RSA Ace servers and or a certificate author- ity require an additional amount of setup time and implemented architecture; therefore, SecureID and Certificate-based authentication fall outside the scope of this chapter.  The key things to focus on when it comes to SSH authentication are the func- tional and security requirements for the application. The following is a list of questions  and  answers  to  ask  when  trying  to  determine  which  method  of authentication is acceptable and or optimal.    Does the corporate culture enforce strong passwords?  Yes. Password authentication is an acceptable option.    No. Consider public-key authentication.    Will access be from trusted segments?  Yes. Host-based authentication is an acceptable option.    No. Rely on passwords and public keys for authentication.    Will the SSH service daemon be facing the public Internet?  Yes. Consider public-key authentication.    No. Password authentication is an acceptable option.    Will remote users be connecting from predefined locations?  Yes. Consider adding host-based authentication.    No. Public-key authentication is an acceptable option.    Are the SSH servers in a layered security architecture?  Yes. Passwords and public keys are acceptable options.    No. Consider using server authentication.    Are multiple SSH servers utilized in the environment?  Yes. Consider using public keys.    No. Passwords are an acceptable option.  Now that you understand all the authentication options with SSH and how to use them across different SSH servers, you will now shift your focus to man- aging  servers devices  that  are  SSH  enabled.  Knowing  and  using  different authentication methods in SSH is critical to fully understanding the security implications that exist in terms of server device management, as well as the functional uses that SSH can enable in the process.                                                   C H A P T E R5  SSH Management  Thus far, I have described SSH in terms of application servers or SSH client applications.  While  using  applications  such  as  VanDyke  Software’s  VShell, SSH Communications’ SSH, and OpenSSH, or core SSH server utilities, SSH services can also be available without any of these applications. SSH services are also available on network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, and storage filers. These services on network devices provide the same type of secure access that SSH applications provide. Furthermore, the SSH services on these devices provide secure management capabilities while replacing insecure clear-text protocols such as Telnet, FTP, and or SNMP.   In addition to SSH services being available on network hardware, SSH ser- vices can be integrated with other security utilities. Utilities such as Chroot, user restrictions, TCP wrappers, and IP access filters can be used with SSH to complement and enhance the overall security of network management.   Secure management is often overlooked when it comes to security. Many organizations and corporations deploy a strong perimeter defense with multi- ple firewalls and router-access control lists; however, they also use poor man- agement protocols that weaken the entire network environment. For example, for remote business travelers, the use of encryption to gain access to e-mail or internal  file  servers  is  usually  a  requirement,  either  through  SSH  port  for- warding  described in Chapters 6 and 7  or IPSec. In spite of this, many net- work administrators use Telnet to access perimeter devices such as routers, firewalls, and switches in order to conduct remote management. The odd thing  155   156 Chapter 5  about this situation is that many organizations do not allow insecure protocols such as IMAP and FTP for business travelers but do allow equally weak pro- tocols such as Telnet for more sensitive actions such as router management.   One of the keys to deploying a secure environment is the use of encryption whenever possible. In the case where encryption is unavailable, the use of mit- igating security controls to compensate for the lack of encryption should be used. For example, many network devices may not support standard encryp- tion protocols such as SSH for remote management. While these devices can- not  support  encryption,  other  mitigating  controls  should  be  set,  such  as access-control  lists,  which  can  limit  access  from  a  predefined  set  of  IP addresses and enforce two-factor authentication.   This chapter addresses the following features of SSH:     Network devices   Cisco routers   Cisco switches   Cisco VPN concentrator   Cisco PIX firewall   Network Appliance storage filers Secure management   Management stations  Two-factor authentication  SOCKS Management  SSH—User restrictions SSH—Network access controls  Network Devices  Our discussion of secure network devices will address the installation, setup, and usage of SSH on the specified network devices in terms of secure man- agement and secure networking. Our discussion will range from how to install SSH on network devices to actually enabling and using SSH on a regular basis on these same devices.                                     SSH Management 157  Cisco Routers Cisco Internetworking Operating System  IOS  started to support the use of SSH from version 12.0.5.S for servers and 12.1.3.T for SSH clients. Since then, IOS 12.x and up has supported SSH version 1 only. While the use of SSH ver- sion 1 still has its insecurities, the replacement of Telnet on Cisco devices has added tremendous security to the network device.   To use SSH on Cisco routers, complete the following steps:  1. Download the correct IOS to the router. Make sure you are download-  ing an IOS version that contains SSH support. Cisco SSH servers require IPSec  DES or 3DES  encryption software image from IOS 12.1 1 T. For SSH clients, IOS 12.1 3 T is required.   2. Make sure a hostname and host domain have been configured for the  router. The following commands are not SSH commands but com- mands on the router that are required in order to use SSH. Syntax:   Router config  hostname   Example:  Router config  hostname Belwa  Syntax:   Router config  ip domain-name   Example:  Router config  ip domain-name eNapkin  3. Generate an RSA key pair for the router, which will automatically  enable SSH: Router config  crypto key generate rsa This command will enable both local and remote SSH authentication to and from the router. When using the SSH client, be aware that it runs in EXEC mode with no specific configuration on the router. Now that SSH is enabled on the router, configure SSH appropriately.  4. Set the authentication timeout for SSH. The maximum timeout cannot  exceed 120 seconds, which is also the default; however, once the session is established, the VTY timeout setting applies, not the SSH timeout set- ting. The following syntax sets the router’s timeout session for SSH: Syntax:   Router config  ip ssh timeout seconds  Example:  Router config  ip ssh timeout 120  5. Set the authentication retries for SSH. The maximum number of retries  is five; however, the default is three. The following syntax sets the router’s authentication retries for SSH: Syntax:   Router config  ip ssh authentication-retries integer  Example:  Router config  ip ssh authentication-retries 3   158 Chapter 5  6. To show and confirm the configuration results of the SSH server, enter  the following commands: Router show ip ssh SSH Enabled – version 1.5 Authentication timeout: 120 seconds; Authentication retries: 3  7. To view the SSH session, enter the following command:  Router show ssh This command shows any connections that are established, the version, the encryption, the state, and the username.   8. Once SSH is enabled and configured, it may be appropriate to prevent  any non-SSH connections to access the router, such as Telnet. It is important to disable insecure protocols such as Telnet if a stronger and more secure protocol is in place and provides the same type of access. To require the use of SSH on terminal-line connections, enter the follow- ing command: Router config  line vty 0 4 Router config-line  transport input ssh  9. Once SSH has been enabled on the Cisco router, enter the following  commands to connect to the SSH service on the router: Syntax:      ssh –l userid –c   –p   IP.Address hostname Example:     ssh –l   –c 3des    In addition to providing SSH access to a router, Cisco IOS provides terminal- line access with SSH, which allows SSH access to non-SSH routers that have a console or serial-port connection to an SSH-enabled router. A simple terminal- line access configuration is illustrated in Figure 5.1.  Serial-Line  Router  non-SSH-Enabled  IPv4 Network Connection  SSH Client  Figure 5.1 Terminal-line access.  Router  SSH-Enabled   SSH Management 159  To set up terminal-line SSH access, each line must be configured with its own rotary, and SSH must be configured to use SSH when accessing the other devices. The following steps walk you through this process.   1. Each line must be configured on the SSH-enabled router. Note that the  line number refers to the port number on the remote SSH server. For example, line number 1 equates to port 2001, line number 2 equates to port 2002, and line number 3 equates to port 2003. The following syntax shows the router commands to enter a line number for SSH. Syntax:      Router config  line   Example:     Router config  line 1 200  2. Disable the EXEC process of each line using the following syntax:  Router config  no exec  3. Define the login authentication option, which must be username pass-  word, with the following syntax: Syntax:      Router config  login authentication   Example:     Router config  login authentication default  4. Define a group of lines that will be used when SSH is enabled using the  following syntax: Syntax:      Router config  rotary   Example:     Router config  rotary 1  5. Define the use of SSH on the line using the transport input command,  as listed: Router config  transport input ssh  6. Configure SSH for the TTY lines, the port number to connect to, and the  rotary group using the following syntax: Syntax:      Router config  ip ssh port   rotary   Example:     Router config  ip ssh port 2001 rotary 1  7. SSH terminal-line access should now be configured! Any SSH client connection to the SSH-enabled router on port 2001 should be given access to the non-SSH enabled router via the serial-line or console to the SSH-enabled router.  Once SSH has been enabled on the Cisco router, enter the following com-  mands to connect to the remote router via the serial-line:  ssh –c 3des –p 2001     160 Chapter 5  Cisco Switches Cisco Catalyst Operating System  CatOS  started to support the use of SSH from version 6.1. Since then, CatOS 6.1 and up has supported SSH version 1 only. While the use of SSH version 1 still has its insecurities, the replacement of Telnet  on  Cisco  devices  has  added  a  tremendous  amount  of  security  to  the network device. SSH is supported on the following Cisco switches: Catalyst 3550, 4000, 5000, 6000, 8540, and 8510.  To use SSH on Cisco routers, complete the following steps.  1. Download the correct CatOS to the switch. Make sure you are down-  loading a CatOS version that holds SSH support. Cisco SSH servers require the IPSec  DES or 3DES  encryption software image from  CatOS 6.1.   2. Generate the RSA Key with the following command:  Cat6509>  enable  set crypto key rsa 1024  3. Restrict SSH to authorized host subnets with the following commands:  Cat6509> set ip permit 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0  4. After the key hash has been made, enable SSH with the following   command: Cat6509>  enable  set ip permit enable ssh  5. Once SSH has been enabled on the Catalyst switch, enter the following  command to connect to the SSH services on the switch: ssh –c 3des –v    Cisco VPN Concentrator Cisco’s VPN device, the VPN concentrator, comes with SSH operability out-of- the-box. There is no need to load software on the VPN concentrator similar to the  routers  and  the  switches.  To  view  the  SSH  options  on  the  concentrator, browse to your VPN device with any Web browser, preferably over SSL. If SSL is not enabled, consider consoling into the VPN device, but do not use clear- text protocols such as HTTP over insecure networks such as the Internet. Once you have authenticated to the Configuration screen, browse to System ➪ Man- agement Protocols  ➪ SSH. You should see a configuration screen similar to Figure 5.2.   SSH Management 161  Figure 5.2 The SSH configuration screen of the Cisco VPN concentrator.  Table 5.1 lists and describes the various SSH configuration options available  on the configuration screen.  Table 5.1 VPN Concentrator SSH Configuration Options  OPTION  Enable SSH  SSH Port  Maximum Sessions  Key Regeneration Period  Encryption Protocols  DESCRIPTION  To enable, simply click on Enable SSH checkbox. This box should be enabled by default.   Determines the port the SSH service should listen on. The default port is 22; however, any port can be set.   Determines the number of simultaneous connections that are allowed. The number can range from 1 to 10, with the default setting to 4.    Sets the time interval to regenerate the key, specified in minutes. The range can be between 0, which disables key regeneration, and 10080, which is up to one week. The default setting is 60 minutes.   Specifies which algorithms should be used to negotiate the SSH session between the clients and the VPN concentrator. Possible options are 3DES-168- bit key, RC4-128-bit key, DES-56-bit key, and No entry. Unselecting all options disables SSH, and choosing No Entry provides no encryption whatsoever. As best practices, select 3DES-168-bit key and RC4-128-bit key.    162 Chapter 5  After the SSH options have been set, select the Apply button to apply the settings. SSH should now be enabled on the VPN concentrator on port 22 with the following settings:  SSH Port—22    Maximum Sessions—4  Key Regeneration Period—45 Encryption Protocols—3DES-168 and RC4-128  Cisco PIX Firewalls Cisco PIX firewalls started to support the use of SSH from version 5.2. Since then, PIX versions 5.2 and above have supported SSH version 1 only. While the use of SSH version 1 still has its insecurities, the replacement of Telnet on Cisco firewalls has added a tremendous amount of security to the network device.   To use SSH on Cisco firewalls, complete the following steps:  1. Download the correct PIX version to the firewall. Make sure you   are downloading a PIX version that holds SSH support. Cisco SSH servers require IPSec  DES or 3DES  encryption software image from version 5.2.   2. Make sure a hostname and host domain have been configured for the router. These are not SSH commands but are required in order to use SSH. The following information needs to be entered: Syntax:      PiX hostname   Example:     PiX hostname PiX-Firewall  Syntax:      PiX domain-name   Example:     PiX domain-name Aum.com  3. Generate an RSA key pair for the firewall and save it with the following  commands: PiX ca generate rsa key 1024 PiX CA save all  4. Select the interface on the firewall to use SSH. Most likely, this will be  the internal interface. The internal interface is called inside with an RFC 1918 address, as shown with the following syntax: PiX ssh 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.255 inside  5. Set the authentication timeout for SSH. The maximum timeout cannot  exceed 120 seconds, which is also the default; however, once the session                 SSH Management 163  is established, the VTY timeout setting applies, not the SSH timeout set- ting. The following syntax sets the firewall’s timeout session for SSH: PiX ssh timeout 60  6. Lastly, set the password for the firewall using the following syntax:  PiX passwd superhardpasswordforl33th4x0rs Once SSH has been enabled on the PIX firewall, enter the following command to connect to the SSH services on the firewall, assuming pix is the username: ssh –c 3des –l pix –v    Network Appliance Filers Network Appliance  NetApp  storage filers provide a data repository to store data, either for backup purposes or for file-server purposes. The filer can con- tain data for each employee and allow access to a specified set of folders and directories, controlled by CIFS NFS or NTFS Unix access permissions.   Traditionally,  NetApp  filers  use  RSH,  Telnet,  HTTP,  or  even  Rlogin   dis- cussed further in Chapter 8  to access the filer for management or configura- tion  purposes.  While  this  access  may  be  conducted  in  an  internal  network, several unauthorized users may have access to this segment, such as contrac- tors, consultants, and remote VPN users, who could capture the RSH session and log in to the filer themselves. One of the key problems with this situation is that after an unauthorized user has gained access to a NetApp filer, he or she may have access to all data on the NetApp filer, not just a subset of the data.  The use of poor protocols such as RSH, Rlogin, HTTP, and Telnet can virtu- ally negate the use of strong NTFS or NFS permission on the filer, since a pos- sible attacker could attack the management protocol of the filer, such as RSH, to  give  himself  access  to  data  instead  of  taking  the  more  difficult  route  of attacking the NTFS or NFS permission for each users.   This  management  issue  is  a  common  mistake  in  many  networks  where administrators deploy strong security on a backup device such as a filer to pro- tect propriety and confidential information, but then use the weakest protocols to manage the device. From the attacker’s perspective, if the choices of attack vectors  are  to  either  sniff  a  Telnet RSH  session  over  the  network  and  gain access to an admin-level username password or to attack the filer and break the access permissions, the sniffing attack vector is not only a lot easier but has a higher probability for success. In this situation, the attacker would always choose to attack the management method to gain access to data.  To support a higher level of security, it is important to maintain the level of security on a network or on a device with the management methods also. For   164 Chapter 5  example, if a NetApp filer holds the strongest level of CIFS and NTFS security, be sure to use SSH on the filer also, since it will uphold the level of security required for the device. To mitigate this issue and similar issues, NetApp has created a module to support encrypted management for its Data ONTAP soft- ware. The module that supports SSH is called SecureAdmin.  NetApp’s SecureAdmin module supports SSH 1.x for command-line man- agement. Using SecureAdmin, a remote administrator is authenticated with a username password  combination  on  the  filer. After  authentication,  the  ses- sion is initialized on the filer, and host-based authentication is accomplished through RSA public keys. The SSH 1.x daemon is executed with Java and RSA libraries. Supported encryption algorithms are DES and 3DES, with a key-bit range from 384 to 1024.  To set up SecureAdmin SSH on your NetApp filer, log in to the filer and gain access to a valid shell. After getting access to a shell, complete the following steps.  1. To configure the SSH server, enter the following command. This will configure SSH and allow the administrator to set the key strength for the RSA key, ranging from 384 bits to 1024 bits. secureadmin setup –f ssh  2. To enable SSH, enter the following command. This is a persistent com-  mand, so there is no need to re-enter the command after the server is rebooted. secureadmin enable ssh  3. To disable SSH, enter the following command. This is a persistent com-  mand, so there is no need to re-enter the command after the server is rebooted. secureadmin disable ssh  4. To show the status of the SSH session on SecureAdmin, enter the fol-  lowing command. This will show the current status of all SSH servers. secureadmin status  Secure Management  Secure management is essential for an organization to meet an acceptable level of  security.  While  the  devices  mentioned  previously  support  SSH,  not  all devices in a network environment will support the use of SSH. For that reason, you should examine some alternative management methods with SSH, using   other  network-security  tools  to  mitigate  vulnerabilities  introduced  by  not using SSH. The five topics of discussion are as follows:  SSH Management 165    Management servers  Two-factor authentication  SOCKS management SSH—User Restrictions SSH—Network Access Controls  Management Servers Management  servers  are  a  fairly  new  idea  in  network  management  that  is slowly growing to be a standard in many networks. The use of a management server is the restriction of management access to several systems devices from one  or  two  management  servers  only,  which  are  accessible  throughout  the organization. The idea is to limit the broad management-level access to sensi- tive servers, such as database servers, from the entire organization and allow a set number of IP addresses, which would be management servers. Further- more, the idea is to encrypt or secure the connection to these sensitive servers as much as possible.  From the preceding discussion, you know that SSH can be used for man- agement  on  many  network  devices;  however,  what  happens  if  SSH  is  not available on certain management devices? Is the right solution to use Telnet, thus  lowering  the  security  model  of  the  network,  or  to  allow  only  console access, which adds an incredible amount of overhead to managing the system? A good architecture management model is to deploy two to four manage- ment servers throughout the network. These systems can be any flavor of Unix or Windows, as long as they are extremely secure. In fact, no services should be listening on these management servers, and some type of host-based fire- wall should be deployed. Install SSH on the management servers, and require the use of both passwords and public keys for authentication. Restrict access to sensitive systems devices on the network by allowing only the management servers to have access. For example, if Web servers and database servers were considered sensitive and on the 192.168.1.0 network segment, and if the inter- nal network were on the 172.16.1.0 network segment, access would have to be blocked from every server on the 172.16.1.0 network segment to the 192.168.1.0 network  segment.  Furthermore,  access  would  have  to  be  permitted  to  the 192.168.1.0 segment from the management servers that have been deployed in the internal network. Figure 5.3 describes this architecture.                     166 Chapter 5  i  n o i t a c n u m m o C d e t p y r c n E     H S S   h t i  w  k r o w t e N    l a n r e t n  I  s  w o  l l  l  a   y n o   l l  a w e r i F  t n e m e g a n a m   o w  t   e h t  e h t   s s e c c a   o t   s r e v r e s  , k r o w t e n   e v i t i s n e s  f o   t s e r   e h t   g n y n e d  i  k r o w t e n    l a n r e t n  i   e h t  d e t t i  m r e P   H S S  s r e s u   d e z i r o h t u a   m o r f  t n e m e g a n a M  r e v r e S  l l  a w e r i F  r e v r e s b e W  r e v r e s b e W  r e v r e s b e W  r e v r e s b e W  t n e m e g a n a M  r e v r e S  i  d e n e D   s s e c c A    l l  A  s p o t k s e D  s p o t k s e D  s p o t k s e D  s p o t k s e D  e s a b a t a D  r e v r e s  e s a b a t a D  r e v r e s  e s a b a t a D  r e v r e s  e s a b a t a D  r e v r e s  . s r e v r e s   t n e m e g a n a m   h t i  i  w   n o i t a r t s i n m d a   e r u c e S  .  3 5   e r u g i F   SSH Management 167  Two-Factor Authentication A very good security practice is to use two-factor authentication, which is the process of using two methods for authentication for a given entity. Two-factor authentication  provides  an  extra  level  of  security  in  the  case  that  a  single method of authentication such as a password is compromised. If a password is compromised, an additional method of authentication is still required in order to gain access to the entity. Also, since many passwords are very poor and can be compromised with a variety of attacks, the use of two-factor authentication mitigates many problems with using passwords.  SSH fully supports the use of two-factor authentication in any type of envi- ronment.  While  SSH  can  support  two-factor  authentication  in  a  variety  of ways, concentrate now on deploying two-factor authentication with the use of passwords and public-key files. As discussed in Chapter 4, public keys can be generated on a per-user basis and used for authentication. In addition to pro- viding the current key for authentication, a username password combination may  be  required  on  the  remote  SSH  server.  Therefore,  once  the  user  has authenticated to the SSH server with his her public key, he or she is prompted for a password on the SSH server that correlates to the username that he she is attempting to log in with. This model enforces two-factor authentication by requiring both public keys and passwords.  While the use of SSH on many network devices, described in the first half of this chapter, is a great practice for device management, several SSH installa- tions do not support two-factor SSH authentication but just require an SSH username and SSH password to log in. While the session is still encrypted, the loss of an SSH password may leave the network device vulnerable. For exam- ple, in many network environments passwords are shared between accounts. A user may have an SSH password that is used to log in to the Cisco router, but may also use the same password to FTP files back and forth to the FTP server in the internal network. While the SSH session would be fully encrypted, the FTP session would not be. If the FTP session were sniffed by an unauthorized employee,  the  FTP password  could  be  obtained  and  then  attempted  on  the SSH service on the router. If the user had used the same password, the router would now be compromised, despite the use of SSH.   168 Chapter 5  The use of management servers with two-factor authentication can mitigate this  vulnerability.  The  use  of  management  servers  would  already  prevent direct  access  to  the  router  by  stopping  the  unauthorized  employee  from directly  accessing  the  SSH-enabled  router.  Furthermore,  if  the  management server were enforcing two-factor authentication and a user’s FTP password is the same as his or her SSH password, which had been compromised, access to the router would still be prevented, since the unauthorized employee would not have the correct public key file to access the management server. The SSH management  server  would  recognize  the  correct  password  for  the  specific account but would then reject the session, since the user would not be able to provide the correct public key that correlates to the account being accessed. Figure 5.4 shows how two-factor authentication can provide an added layer of security with SSH management servers.

SSH Management 169  SOCKS Management  SOCKS is an Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  standard used as a generic proxy protocol for TCP IP applications. SOCKS servers provide the ability to accept  requests  from  SOCKS  clients  and  forward  them  to  the  appropriate application server on behalf of the SOCKS client. The primary purpose of the protocol is to enable nodes on one side of the SOCKS server to gain access to hosts on the other side of the SOCKS server, allowing direct access from the SOCKS clients to the application server.  In the example configuration in Figures 5.3 and 5.4, you examined a method of  using  SSH  and  firewall  rules  to  allow  secure  access  to  remote  machines. SOCKS uses a similar configuration; however, with the use of a SOCKS server, the transitions between the clients on the right and the sensitive servers on the left is more streamlined and less cumbersome than in the configurations in the previous examples. In the architectural example with the management server and two-factor authentication, a client first needs to authenticate to the SSH server  and  gain  a  shell  or  command  prompt  on  that  device.  After  the shell command prompt has been attained, the client needs to make another connection  to  the  desired  sensitive  server  in  order  to  manage  it.  While  this process is straightforward and relatively easy, the use of a SOCKS proxy server could cut the process in half by requiring only a connection from the client to the SOCKS server. The SOCKS server would then be authorized to forward that connection to the desired device and return the shell command prompt to the client. Figure 5.5 shows architecture similar to that in Figures 5.3 and 5.4 but with a SOCKS implementation. Notice that the architecture is very similar, if not the same, but that access for the end-user is limited to one-step instead of two or three steps for architecture in Figures 5.3 or 5.4.  There are two current installations of SOCKS: version 4 and version 5. Most SSH clients support both versions. If a SOCKS server has been deployed in a network environment, using any SSH client such as SecureCRT is very simple.  For  more  detail  about  SSH  and  SOCKS,  see  Chapter  9.   See  Figure  5.6  for SecureCRT SOCKS setup.   170 Chapter 5  k r o w t e N    l a n r e t n  I  s p o t k s e D  s p o t k s e D  s p o t k s e D  s p o t k s e D  S K C O S  r e v r e s b e W  r e v r e s b e W  r e v r e s b e W  r e v r e s b e W  0 0 1  .  1  .  8 6 1  .  2 9 1  S K C O S  r e v r e S  1 . 1 . 6 1 . 2 7 1  l l  a w e r i F  i  d e n e D   s s e c c A    l l  A  s  w o  l l  l  a   y n o   l l  a w e r i F  o t   r e v r e s   S K C O S   e h t  e v i t i s n e s   e h t   s s e c c a  e h t   g n y n e d  i    , k r o w t e n  l  a n r e t n  i   e h t   f o   t s e r  k r o w t e n  e s a b a t a D  r e v r e s  e s a b a t a D  r e v r e s  e s a b a t a D  r e v r e s  e s a b a t a D  r e v r e s  .  n o i t a t n e m e p m  l  i   S K C O S   e p m a s   A  l  .  5 5   e r u g i F   SSH Management 171  Figure 5.6 SecureCRT SOCKS configuration.  As shown in Figure 5.6, an SSH client needs to be configured in order to communicate with the SOCKS proxy  namely, 172.16.1.1, from Figure 5.5 . The parameters to enter are quite simple, such as Hostname and or IP address and the port number with which to connect to the SOCKS server. After the appro- priate SOCKS server has been selected in the Type drop-down box—in this case, SOCKS version 5  username password —select OK. To enable Secure- CRT to use the SOCKS server, select the “Use firewall to connect” checkbox from the Quick Connect menu. This will enable SecureCRT to use the SOCKS firewall  settings  that  were  just  configured.  Figure  5.7  shows  the  specific  configuration.  Figure 5.7 SecureCRT client using SOCKS firewall setting.   172 Chapter 5  Notice  that  not  only  is  the  “Use  firewall  to  connect”  option  selected;  the hostname of the real server you would like to access, in the Hostname field, is selected as well. Referring to Figure 5.5, the desktops on the right-hand side are  the  machines  using  the  SecureCRT  application.  The  SOCKSv5  server  is 172.16.1.1, which has been set up in your SecureCRT global option menu  see Figure  5.6 .  Lastly,  when  an  SSH  session  on  the  Web  server,  which  is 192.168.1.100,  is  desired,  the  SecureCRT  SSH  client  would  connect  to  the SOCKS  server  first,  using  the  “Use  firewall  to  connect”  checkbox  shown  in Figure 5.7, and then have the SOCKS server complete the connection on your behalf and return the shell to your SecureCRT client.  The use of SOCKS and SSH for secure-management access reduces the num- ber of authentication steps and streamlines the process for the end-user; how- ever, the level of security and authentication methods required are not reduced or affected in any way. This architecture not only maintains the level of secu- rity described in Figures 5.3 and 5.4, but also adds a level of usability for the end-user.  SSH: User Restrictions Although  managing  SSH  on  remote  devices  and  systems  is  important  for secure access, you might not want to allow full management access to each employee who needs to manage another device and or system. For example, for  a  given  system,  a  variety  of  users  may  need  SSH  access  to  the  system, including backup operators, system administrators, and application develop- ers. Also, if management servers are being used, even more employees may need access to the system, including network administrators, router switch administrators, and firewall administrators. Adding all the personnel in these groups may make the SSH user base for a given device or system well over 10 percent of the user population—and possibly more, depending on the size of the  organization.  The  fact  that  10  percent  of  the  user  population  needs  to access an SSH management server is not an issue; however, if there is a possi- bility  of  limiting  the  backup  administrator  to  backup  activities,  the  firewall administrator  to  the  firewall,  and  the  router switch  administrator  to  the routers and switches, system security can be further escalated. The best meth- ods to implement this type of security with SSH are SSH Chroot, user access controls, and user restrictions.  Chroot  Chroot is a Unix-only system call that restricts users to files, folders, and bina- ries only in a specified directory. The best way to think of Chroot is as a virtual sandbox, often called a chroot jail, where an application or user may operate.   SSH Management 173  The  SSH  application process  can  be  chrooted  to  prevent  SSH  users  from breaking  out  of  an  SFTP specific  directory,  such  as  a  firewall-management directory.  Furthermore,  the  specific  SSH  users  can  be  chrooted,  limiting  the SSH shell to a specific directory also. To chroot an SSH user using SSH Com- munications’ Unix SSH server, complete the following steps.  1. Open the sshd2_config file in  etc ssh2. 2. Edit the ChRootUsers line by uncommenting it  remove the  symbol  and adding all the SSH users that will need a chroot shell. The follow- ing is an example: ChrootUsers          SSHUser1,SSHUser2,kusum,rohan,shreya  3. If necessary, edit the ChRootGroups line by uncommenting it and  adding all the groups that will need a chroot shell. The following is an example: ChrootGroups         FirewallAdmins,BackupAdmins,RouterAdmins  4. Uncomment the sftp-server subsystem entry, which allows SSH to ini-  tialize internal sftp-server. The following is an example: Subsystem-sftp       internal:  sftp-server  5. Edit the  etc passwd file, changing the SSH users shells to  bin ssh-  dummy-shell. The following is an example: SSHUser1:x:500:10:SSHUser1: home SSHuser1: bin ssh-dummy-shell SSHUser2:x:500:10:SSHUser2: home SSHuser2: bin ssh-dummy-shell Kusum:x:500:10:Kusum: home Kusum: bin ssh-dummy-shell Shreya:x:500:10:Shreya: home Shreya: bin ssh-dummy-shell Rohan:x:500:10:Rohan: home Rohan: bin ssh-dummy-shell  6. Restart the SSH2 daemon.  User Access Controls  User access controls are available on VanDyke Software’s VShell SSH server. Unlike Chroot, user access controls are a simple access-control list applied to the specified users that attempt to access SSH services. They are not a type of jail; they limit the type of access the user or group will be able to perform. To view the User Access Control screen in VShell SSH server, complete the fol- lowing steps:  1. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell. 2. Highlight the Access Controls section on the left-hand pane.    174 Chapter 5  Figure 5.8 User Access Control screen of VShell’s SSH server.  The VShell User Access Control screen  see Figure 5.8  shows two separate sections: the Name section and the Permissions section. The Name section is the section where the user names the operating system that needs to be set. The  Permissions  section  sets  the  different  types  of  permission  that  will  be allowed to each user, including Logon, Shell, Remote Execution, SFTP, Port Forwarding, and Remote Port Forwarding.  Let’s say you want to grant access to the SSH server for the Backup group, to back up files on the SSH server. The Backup group is called Backup Opera- tors and will need SFTP access but will not need shell access to the SSH server  as shown in Figure 5.9 . Complete the following steps to add the appropriate connection filters:  1. Select the Add button. 2. Scroll down on the Windows Select User or Group menu and choose  the Backup Operations group.  3. Select the checkbox in the Allow column for the SFTP row. 4. Select the checkbox in the Allow column for the Remote Execution row. 5. Select the checkbox in the Deny column for the Shell row. 6. Now the Backup Operators group has full SFTP access to the SSH  server but does not have shell access to the server.   SSH Management 175  Figure 5.9 Access control permission for the Backup Operators group.  SSH User Restrictions  User  restrictions  are  available  with  SSH  Communications’  Windows  SSH server. SSH user restrictions are very similar to VShell’s user access controls. Both  are  simple  access-control  lists  applied  to  the  usernames  on  the  SSH server.  To  view  the  User  Restrictions  screen  in  SSH  Communications’  SSH server, complete the following steps:  1. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Highlight the User Restrictions section.   SSH Secure Shell Server ➪ Configuration.  The SSH Communications’ User Restrictions screen  see Figure 5.10  shows two separate sections, the Allow login for users and the Deny login for users.   176 Chapter 5  Figure 5.10 Host Restrictions screen of SSH Communications’ SSH.  Let’s say you want to grant access to the SSH server for the Backup Opera- tor account, known as BackupAdmin, to back up files on the SSH server. The backup operator will need SFTP access but will not need shell access to the SSH server. Also, besides allowing access to the Backup Operator account, you want to make sure the backup operator does not use a personal account to log in to the SSH server, which is called Sudhanshu. Complete the following steps to add the appropriate connection filters:  1. Move the mouse inside of the Allow login from hosts.  2. Type BackupAdmin. 3. Move the mouse inside of the Deny login from hosts. 4. Type Sudhanshu. 5. Select the no option for the Permit User Terminal option. 6. Select Apply. 7. Now the Backup Operator account is allowed to make an SFTP  connection to the SSH server, but is not permitted to use the SSH  terminal session. Also, the backup operator’s personal account,  Sudhanshu, is fully restricted.  Note the use of patterns in Figure 5.11. For example, to permit any user with admin in front of his or her username, such as adminSANFRAN, the following syntax can be used: admin.*. Furthermore, to deny any user with test in front of his or her username, such as test1234, test.* can be used as a pattern-matching utility.   SSH Management 177  Figure 5.11 The new set of user restrictions.  SSH: Network Access Controls Installing an SSH management server adds tremendous flexibility and secu- rity to any network environment. The use of SOCKS and Chroot helps further streamline  and  secure  management  access  to  sensitive  servers  and  devices. Another method to help secure the SSH management server is the use of TCP wrappers  on  Unix  SSH  servers  and  connection  filters  on  Windows  SSH servers.  SSH TCP wrappers   TCP Wrappers is a Unix utility that permits or denies network access to a par- ticular  port  to  a  specified  set  of  IP addresses.  TCP wrappers  functions  by replacing the network service with the TCP wrapper service before the com- munication can be completed. The IP addresses for TCP wrappers are located in the hosts.allow and hosts.deny. For example, before any IP address can con- nect to a particular service port on a system using TCP wrappers, the TCP wrappers utility first checks to see if the requesting IP address is approved to access the service port. If TCP wrappers deems that the IP address is allowed, by checking the hosts.allow and hosts.deny files, the requesting IP address is allowed to continue to access the service and port. Note that even though the IP address is allowed to access the service port, the IP address will still need to carry out any authentication requirements for the service. Figure 5.12 shows the TCP-wrappers process.   178 Chapter 5  Without TCP Wrappers  SSH Client  With TCP Wrappers  SSH Client  SSH Service  SSH Session  TCP Wrapper  SSH Service  SSH Session  Figure 5.12 TCP wrappers with SSH.  A good way to think of TCP wrappers is simply as a set of access-control lists applied to specific TCP ports on a Unix operating system. For example, once  an  SSH  management  server  is  set  up  to  administer  sensitive  servers and or devices, there may be a need to secure the access to the SSH server to only the firewall admin group’s subnet, or the backup operator’s subnet, or any machine located in the management network. Furthermore, if the admin- level subnets or IP addresses are known on a network, there is no limitation or reason not to place TCP wrappers on SSH servers. TCP wrappers will prevent unauthorized  internal  and  external  employees  from  simple  brute-force  SSH attacks  by  complexly  eliminating  any  possibility  of  the  unauthorized  IP addresses to connect to the SSH management server.   The SSH application process can use TCP wrappers to prevent unautho- rized users from connecting to the SSH server, while permitting valid groups, such as firewall-management groups. To use TCP wrappers on an SSH server using SSH Communications’ Unix SSH server, complete the following steps:  1. Change directories to your SSH2 configuration folder using the follow-  2. Configure and make the SSH server with the libwrap binary using the  ing syntax: cd  usr local bin ssh-3.2.3  following syntax: . configure –with-libwrap make make install  3. Once the SSH server has compiled correctly, change directories to the   etc directory using the following syntax: cd  etc   SSH Management 179  4. Edit the two TCP wrapper files, called hosts.allow and hosts.deny. The  TCP wrappers daemon always reads IP addresses or hostnames in hosts.allow first. If it sees a match in hosts.allow, it will permit the IP address or hostname. If it does not see a match in hosts.allow, it will read the hosts.deny. This being the case, you want to put a “deny all rules” in hosts.deny. If neither the hosts.allow nor hosts.deny file con- tains information, all IP addresses and hostnames will be allowed. The following is the format required for the hosts.allow and hosts.deny files, as well as examples of each: Format    .   daemon : IP.address or hostname Hosts.allow sshd2: 10.1.0.  Hosts.deny sshd2:ALL   5. The hosts.allow file would allow access to any IP address coming from  10.1.0.0 to 10.1.0.254. The hosts.deny file would deny access to every other IP address.  SSH Connection Filters  Connection filters are available with VanDyke Software’s VShell SSH server. Unlike Unix TCP wrappers, connection filters are a simple access-control list applied to the TCP IP interface that the SSH service is listening on. It is not a separate  process,  nor  does  it  in  any  way  intercept  the  SSH  client  request; rather,  it  accepts  or  rejects  SSH  connections  based  on  the  source  IP address located  in  the  TCP header  of  an  IP packet.  To  view  the  Connection  Filters screen in the VShell SSH server, complete the following steps:  1. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell. 2. Highlight the Connection Filters section.   The VShell Connection Filters screen  see Figure 5.13  shows two separate sections: the Filter entries section and the Test filter section. The Filter entries section is where the filters would actually be set. Notice the default filter to allow access to all IP addresses, denoted by 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0. The Test filter sec- tion tests the connection to any IP address specified.    180 Chapter 5  Figure 5.13 The Connection Filters screen of VShell’s SSH server.  Let’s say you want to deny access to the SSH server from the users’ network  172.16.1.0 24  but permit access to the SSH server from the management net- work  10.1.0.0 24 . Complete the following steps to add the appropriate con- nection filters:  1. Select the Add button. 2. Select Netmask for the Filter type. 3. Enter 172.16.1.0 for the Network. 4. Enter 255.255.255.0 for the Mask. 5. Enter Users’ network for the comment. 6. Select the Deny radio button under the Action section on the left side. 7. Select OK. 8. Select the Add button. 9. Select Netmask for the Filter type. 10. Enter 10.1.0.0 for the Network. 11. Enter 255.255.255.0 for the Mask. 12. Enter Management network for the comment. 13. Select the Allow radio button under the Action section on the left side. 14. Select OK.   SSH Management 181  15. Highlight the default filter, Allow 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0, which allows  all IP addresses to connect, and move the filter to the bottom using the downward arrow key on the right-hand side. The filters are read from top to bottom. When a client attempts to connect, the top filter will be read first. If a match is identified, the other filters are not read and the matched filter is executed. When placing several filters on the VShell SSH server, it is probably good practice to make a final Deny filter that denies any IP address that does not match any of the filters before it.   You’re  done.  Now  any  IP address  on  the  172.16.1.0 24  network  will  be restricted, and all addresses on the 10.1.0.0 24 network will be permitted  as shown in Figure 5.14 .  SSH Host Restrictions  Host  restrictions  are  available  with  SSH  Communications’  Windows  SSH server.  SSH  host  restrictions  are  very  similar  to  VShell’s  connection  filters. Both are a simple access-control list applied to the TCP IP interface on which the SSH service is listening. To view the Host Restrictions screen in SSH Com- munications’ SSH server, complete the following steps:  1. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Highlight the Host Restrictions section.   SSH Secure Shell Server ➪ Configuration.  Figure 5.14 The new set of access filters.   182 Chapter 5  The SSH Communications’ Host Restrictions screen  see Figure 5.15  shows two separate sections: the Allow login from hosts and the Deny login from hosts.  Let’s say you want to deny access to the SSH server from the users’ network  172.16.1.0 24 , but permit access to the SSH server from the management net- work  10.1.0.0 24 . Both Allow and Deny fields use special syntax, denoted with the \ symbol, to include variables, so each IP address does not need to be entered. Complete the following steps to add the appropriate connection filters:  1. Move the mouse inside the Allow login from hosts.  2. Type 10\.1\.0\..*. 3. Move the mouse inside the Deny login from hosts. 4. Type 172\.16\.1\.. 5. Select Apply.  You’re  done.  Now  any  IP address  on  the  172.16.1.0 24  network  will  be restricted and all addresses on the 10.1.0.0 24 network will be permitted  as shown in Figure 5.16 .

Summary  In this chapter, I introduce several options that SSH can provide to deploy and maintain secure-management processes and procedures. Management meth- ods are often targeted by attackers as an attack vector, creating a false sense of security for many administrators who overlook management processes and procedures.  Secure management involves sure-management networks, but also secure management services on devices. I cover the use of SSH services in atypical environments such as network devices network hardware. Various types of devices, including routers, switches, load balancers, storage appliances, VPN servers, and firewalls, can provide SSH services on their respective network hardware,  eliminating  the  need  for  insecure  protocols  such  as  Telnet  and greatly  improving  the  management  of  these  devices.  For  example,  a  VPN server  that  controls  access  to  the  internal  network  for  external  users  and  is managed remotely with HTTP or Telnet negates many of the security issues of the VPN server itself  encryption . Furthermore, storage devices that hold and protect critical company data may use a clear-text protocol for management, making admin-level access to the machine more vulnerable.   184 Chapter 5  This chapter demonstrates how SSH can secure both network devices and management methods with the use of native SSH services on network devices and the integration of SSH with other operating-system tools such as Chroot and  TCP Wrappers.  The  next  chapter  covers  port  forwarding  and  how  an  SSH  can  be  utilized  as  a  remote-access  solution  rather  than  just  a  secure- management solution. The next chapter expounds upon the definition of SSH and how it can be utilized in so many ways.    PA R T  Two  Remote Access Solutions    C H A P T E R6  SSH Port Forwarding  We have discussed several features, utilities, and benefits that SSH provides with a single service or subsystem, but one of the most useful and powerful features is port forwarding. Since port forwarding is such a strong feature of SSH, two chapters are dedicated to it. This chapter addresses the basics of port forwarding, such as what it is, how to set it up, and some of its basic require- ments.  The  next  chapter  discusses  the  advanced  usages  of  port  forwarding and how to use it in network architecture in order to optimize it.  Port forwarding is the ability of an SSH client to connect to an SSH server and then forward other ports within the established SSH connection. Port for- warding is also referred to as SSH tunneling, where alternative TCP traffic is sent over an encrypted SSH tunnel. The great part about port forwarding is that it requires few to no changes on the SSH server, besides being enabled, and it is fully functional on most default SSH2 installations.   For example, if an SSH connection is established between an SSH server and an SSH client, another protocol port, such as IMAP  port 143 , could be tun- neled within the SSH connection over port 22. Since port forwarding uses only the existing SSH tunneling for communication, usually on port 22, only one firewall rule is required to permit an unlimited number of ports to be tunneled through the existing SSH session. SSH port forwarding not only requires fewer firewall rules, which reduces the required number of ports allowed into the internal network; it allows several insecure protocols to be secured, such as mail  IMAP, POP3, and SMTP , file transfer  SMB, FTP, CIFS, and NFS , and management  Telnet, VNC, and pcAnywhere . Figure 6.1 shows an example of the tunneling process.  187   188 Chapter 6  IMAP  Established SSH Session  IMAP  Mail Server  SSH Client  SSH Server  Figure 6.1 An established SSH connection with the IMAP protocol tunneled.  Before discussing port forwarding, let’s examine two of the three types of port forwarding: local and remote, also referred to as outgoing and incoming, respectively.   NOTE Dynamic port forwarding is discussed in Chapter 9, under the “Dynamic Port Forwarding and SOCKS” section.  Local port forwarding is when an SSH client makes any type of connection to a local port on its localhost, presumably the loopback interface  127.0.0.1 , and the connection is tunneled outbound through the established SSH con- nection to another computer  either the SSH server or a computer that the SSH server can make a connection to .  Remote port forwarding does the opposite of local port forwarding. It for- wards communication coming from a remote port on a remote server, such as the SSH server, to a local port on the SSH client  or a machine that the SSH client has access to .   A good example of local port forwarding is the use of internal Web intranet pages.  Let’s  say  that  business  travelers  need  to  access  the  internal  intranet page at least three times a day. The business travelers are usually connecting from inside customer networks and or hotel dial-up connections. The use of a VPN device does not satisfy the business travelers’ needs. IPSec VPNs cannot traverse firewall devices over Network Address Translation  NAT . Further- more, remote access is required from other customer networks and hotel envi- ronments, where networking configuration will always be an unknown. Let’s say the corporate network contains only three servers and an unlimited num- ber  of  business  travelers.  The  network  contains  a  firewall,  protecting  the perimeter of the network; an SSH server, for established SSH connections; and   SSH Port Forwarding 189  an internal intranet Web server, which holds the intranet Web page. The fol- lowing five simple steps are the only ones required in order to allow business travelers secure access to the intranet from all different types of networks:  1. Install an SSH server listening on port 22. 2. Install a single rule on the firewall that allows connections on port 22 to  reach the SSH server.  3. Set up the SSH client to locally port forward port 80 to the intranet Web server when a connection has been requested on its lookback interface  127.0.0.1 .  4. Connect to the SSH server with the SSH client, with the port-forward  rules enabled.  5. Open a Web browser and enter the lookback IP address  127.0.0.1 ; the  intranet Web site should be displayed.   Figure 6.2 shows the example architecture.   SSH Client  Internet  11.17.73.1  Firewall  172.16.1.1  Step 1: Firewall Firewall rule allows Port 22 from anywhere to SSH Server  11.17.73.2   Step 2: SSH client Connection: 11.17.73.2 Local Port Forward: Port 80:172.16.1.100  Final Result SSH client connects to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 with their web browser and receives the intranet web server application  Figure 6.2 SSH local port-forward architecture.  Intranet Web Server   172.16.1.100   11.17.73.2  172.16.1.2  SSH Server  Internal Network   190 Chapter 6  A good example of remote port forwarding is the use of public FTP servers. Although using FTP and port forwarding is a very tricky procedure, due to the use of active FTP, it still can be done. Let’s say that both internal employees and  external  customers  need  to  get  files  from  an  organization’s  public  FTP server. While the FTP server contains public information for the customers to download, it also contains private information for employees to use. The net- work  contains  an  FTP server,  an  SSH  server,  and  an  unlimited  number  of employees and customers who need to access the FTP server. The use of SFTP is a good alternative by the organization, but the organization does not want to make its customers use SFTP, since SFTP clients do not come on most oper- ating systems by default  it would be really nice if they did . The only require- ment  is  that  internal  employees  cannot  use  clear-text  protocols  to  access sensitive company information. To prevent the private information from being sent over the Internet in clear-text, a remote port-forwarding session can be set up. The following five simple steps are the only ones required in order to allow customers to download information with FTP as well as to allow internal users to download information with the use of encryption  shown in Figure 6.3 :  1. Install an SSH server that listens on port 22. 2. Install an SSH client on the FTP server. 3. Set up the SSH client on the FTP server for a remote port-forwarding  session. Set up the session so that when the SSH client  the FTP server  establishes a connection to the SSH server, a remote port-forwarding session will be established that will make the SSH server listen on port 21 and redirect any connections to port 21  on the SSH server  to port 21 on the FTP server.  4. Internal employees should FTP to the SSH server on port 21, which will  be forwarding to the FTP server on port 21 over the established SSH session.  5. External public customers should make a regular FTP connection to the  FTP server on port 21, which will not be encrypted with SSH.

The theory behind port forwarding is much like the process of simple TCP relaying. A TCP relay is the ability to accept connections on a particular port and redirect them somewhere else.  For  example,  every  connection  on  port  80  on  a  machine’s  loopback address  127.0.0.1  is relayed to port 80 on 172.16.1.100. The only difference with  SSH  port  forwarding  is  that  the  connection  is  redirected  through  an established SSH session first and then replayed to the remote machine. Some basic requirements must be met in order for port forwarding to work, such as a valid connection from the SSH server to the remote server  the server receiv- ing the relayed connection ; however, that is not a separate configuration step but an assumed requirement.   A key  point  to  keep  in  mind  regarding  port  forwarding  is  that  protocols such  as  IMAP,  SMTP,  and  POP3  being  tunneled  are  terminated  at  the  SSH server. For example, if a client is connecting to an SSH server and then port for- warding SMTP and IMAP over SSH to receive e-mail securely, the mail proto- cols  will  be  tunneled  from  the  SSH  client  to  the  SSH  server;  then  the  mail protocols will be sent over their native protocols from the SSH server to the mail server. The communication from the SSH server to the mail server will not be under an SSH session. Figure 6.4 shows further details.   Notice in Figure 6.4 that the IMAP and SMTP protocols are protected from the  SSH  client  to  the  SSH  server  by  the  port-forwarding  tunneling  process; then they communicate with their native protocols without any tunnels from the SSH server to the mail server.   This chapter examines some of the basics of SSH port forwarding, specifi-  cally the following topics:    Networking basics of port forwarding for clients   Networking basics of port forwarding for servers  SSH  communication  No SSH  communication  IMAP, SMTP  Established SSH Session  SMTP  IMAP  SSH Client Figure 6.4 Where an SSH session would be terminated.   SSH Server  Mail Server       SSH Port Forwarding 193  Also, configuring local and remote SSH port forwarding on the following  SSH clients is explored:  SSH command-line client  OpenSSH and commercial versions  SSH Communications’ SSH client SecureCRT SSH client  Lastly,  enabling  SSH  port  forwarding  on  the  following  SSH  servers  is   examined:    OpenSSH  Unix and Windows   SSH Communications’ SSH server  Unix and Windows  VanDyke’s Software SSH server  Windows   Networking Basics of Port Forwarding for Clients  Before  discussing  how  to  configure  port  forwarding  on  clients,  you  should understand the basic networking concepts of port forwarding, especially in terms of what it is, how it works, and what is happening behind the scenes. A deep understanding of the core concepts of port forwarding will eliminate a lot of confusion later in the advanced sections.   The first basic concept is the established SSH session. Each SSH client and SSH server will have an authenticated and established SSH session. The actual session can be used for terminal access, SFTP SCP access, or no access, if both the terminal session and SFTP SCP are restricted.  NOTE An SSH session can still be established if terminal or SFTP SCP access is not granted.   The restriction of terminal and SFTP access usually means that the user has the right to use the SSH session for port forwarding through the SSH server but not for gaining access to the SSH server. Once the SSH session is estab- lished, any port-forwarding options on the SSH client will be applied; how- ever, any port-forwarding rules need to be configured before the SSH session has been established. If port-forwarding options are configured during or after the SSH session has been established, the options will not be effective until the session is fully re-established.   The second major concept of port forwarding is that most, if not all, config- uration of port forwarding is conducted on the client, not on the server. For example,  if  port  forwarding  is  required  between  an  SSH  client  and  an  SSH server, the configuration for the incoming or outgoing SSH rules will be on the                         194 Chapter 6  client. In the port-forwarding architecture, the server needs to allow port for- warding, but no specific configuration is required on the server.   NOTE Many SSH server installations allow port forwarding by default, requiring no configuration at all after a default installation of the SSH server.   The port-forwarding rules applied to the SSH client will vary, depending on whether the rules are local  outgoing  or remote  incoming  on the SSH client. The use of local  outgoing  rules provides a practical and more advantageous option than remote port forwarding. So you will probably use local port for- warding more often than remote port forwarding.   Local  port-forwarding  rules  redirect  connections  on  local  ports—that  is, ports local to the operating system that the SSH client is running on—to a spec- ified  port  and  server  on  the  other  side  of  the  SSH  established  connection, which can be the SSH server itself or a machine that the SSH server can access.  When  configuring  local  port  forwarding,  the  user  is  given  the  option  to specify the IP address to use for local forwarding as well as the port number. For example, if the SSH client is installed on a machine that has an IP address of  172.16.10.21,  the  options  for  the  local  IP address  will  be  172.16.10.21  or 127.0.0.1,  which  is  the  loopback  interface  of  the  computer.  A loopback  is  basically  an  IP address  that  identifies  the  local  machine  using  TCP IP.  In  most cases, you will want to use the loopback address, 127.0.0.1, for local port  forwarding.   Furthermore, using the real IP address, such as 172.16.10.21, is a security risk, since other machines could connect to your IP address  172.16.10.21  and use  your  established  SSH  connection  to  tunnel  communication.  That  being said, that may be your intended usage, so proceed with caution.   Once you have chosen the loopback address, 127.0.0.1, for the IP address to use for local port forwarding, you will have to choose which port you would like to connect to. You can choose any port you like, as long as the operating system allows you to access that port.  Some operating systems do not allow sharing of services on a single port, such as port 445 on Windows.  The best option for a port is to use the standard port for the protocol that will be for- warding. For example, if Web communication will be forwarded, which uses HTTP and HTTPS, you will probably want to use ports 80 and 443 with the lookback interface. Keep in mind that if you use a port that is not standard, such as port 1173, you will have to tell your client application, such as your Web  browser,  to  use  port  1173  instead  of  port  80  or  443   for  example, http:  127.0.0.1:1173 .   Now that you have chosen your local IP address and local port, you need to choose  which  remote  server  you  want  to  redirect  any  connections  made  to your specified local address and port. For example, if the remote server is the   SSH Port Forwarding 195  internal Web server for an organization, which holds the company’s intranet application, you need to choose the IP address of the internal Web server. Keep in mind that the SSH server must be able to communicate with this machine natively, without any firewall, router ACLs, or networks preventing it from communicating with the remote machine. If the IP address of the internal Web server is 192.168.12.15, that will be the IP address of the remote server. After the  IP address  of  the  remote  server  is  specified,  the  remote  port  has  to  be selected also. Unlike the local-port option, the remote-port option is dictated by the remote server. For example, if the intranet Web application uses HTTP, which is port 80, you must specify port 80 and the remote port. Furthermore, if the remote server is a mail server and you are forwarding mail protocols, you have to choose SMTP and POP3, which are ports 25 and 110.   Now that you have your local IP address  127.0.0.1 , local port  80 , remote server IP address  192.168.12.15 , and remote port  80 , selected for your local port-forwarding rule, you are ready to forward the HTTP protocol through the SSH connection. The following steps walk you through the process of using the  local  port-forwarding  session  by  using  an  SSH  server  with  two  IP addresses: one that faces externally to the Internet, 12.15.10.21, and one that faces internally to the internal network, 192.168.12.1:  1. Having established your local port-forwarding rules, establish an SSH  connection to the SSH server on its external IP address  12.15.10.21  using the required authentication options  see Figure 6.5 .  Figure 6.5 Local port-forwarding rules in an SSH client.   196 Chapter 6  2. The SSH session is now established with the local port-forwarding rules enabled.  To confirm, you can type netstat –an on a command shell, and your lookback IP address, 127.0.0.1, should be listening on port 80.  Next, open your Web browser. In the URL section of your Web browser, type 127.0.0.1  see Figure 6.6 .  3. Once your Web browser attempts a connection to your lookback  address, 127.0.0.1, on port 80  by default, Web browsers connect on port 80 , your port-forwarding rules will be triggered. The rules will dictate that all connections to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 should be redirected through the established SSH connection to 192.168.12.15 on port 80.   4. Assuming your SSH server can communicate with 192.168.12.15,   the connection is forwarded beyond your SSH server to the internal Web server, on port 80. The internal Web server sends the results,  probably the intranet’s home page, to the SSH client’s Web browser.  See Figure 6.7.  Note that the local port-forwarding connection from your SSH client to the SSH  server  is  fully  encrypted  with  SSH,  but  the  connection  from  the  SSH server  to  the  local  intranet  server  uses  its  native  protocol,  which  would  be HTTP. For an example of how this works, see Figure 6.8.   Figure 6.6 A Web browser pointing to a loopback address  127.0.0.1 .

Remote port forward- ing redirects remote connections on the SSH server to local ports on the SSH client, that is, the operating system that the SSH client is running on, over an SSH established connection. When configuring remote port forwarding, the SSH client is given the option to specify the port to have the remote SSH server listen on. For example, if the SSH client chooses port 21, the SSH server will begin to listen on port 21 automatically once the SSH connection is established. Once the SSH client has chosen the port number for the SSH server and has established an SSH connection, any machine connecting to port 21 on the SSH server will be redirected to the SSH client over an encrypted SSH tunnel. The port number that is redirected from the SSH server to the SSH client is also determined by the SSH client. Unlike the SSH server, the SSH client’s machine will not automatically start listening on that port; rather it is assumed that a service,  such  as  FTP,  is  already  running  on  that  port,  which  would  be  the whole reason to set up the remote port-forwarding rule.   Now that the SSH client has chosen the remote port for the SSH server to  listen  on   port  21 ,  the  remote  port-forwarding  rule  can  be  initialized.  The  following  steps  walk  you  through  the  process  of  using  the  remote  port- forwarding session by using an SSH server with two IP addresses: one that faces externally to the Internet, 12.15.10.21, and one that faces internally to the internal network, 192.168.12.1:  1. Execute the remote port-forwarding rules, an established SSH connec- tion to the SSH server on its external IP address  12.15.10.21 , and the required authentication options. See Figure 6.9.  2. Now that the SSH session is established, the remote port-forwarding rules should be enabled.  To confirm, you can type netstat –an on the SSH server, and port 21 should be listening.   3. Once an FTP client connects to the SSH server on FTP, the connection will be redirected to the SSH client on port 21, over the encrypted SSH session.   Note that the remote port-forwarding connection from the SSH client to the SSH server is fully encrypted with SSH but that the connection from the SSH server to the FTP client uses the native protocol, which would be FTP. For an example of how this operates, see Figure 6.10.    SSH Port Forwarding 199  Figure 6.9 Remote port-forwarding rules in an SSH client.

FTP Client   200 Chapter 6  Networking Basics of Port Forwarding for Servers  Unlike the networking concepts of port forwarding for SSH clients, the net- working basics of port forwarding for SSH servers is quite simple. Port for- warding  in  SSH  server  environments  does  not  require  any  type  of  special configuration for the client to use the specific feature. The only major require- ment for the SSH servers is that the port forwarding feature be either enabled  allowed  for the clients or, if it is not desired, disabled  disallowed .   As with SSH clients, the first basic concept of networking for SSH servers is the  established  SSH  session.  Each  SSH  client  and  SSH  server  will  have  an authenticated and established SSH session. The SSH server can permit access to  a  terminal  shell,  SFTP SCP access,  or  neither,  thereby  allowing  only  an established  authenticated  session. Once the SSH session is established and authenticated by the SSH server, any port-forwarding option can be applied that has been configured on the SSH client. Note that while many SSH servers allow port forwarding by default, port forwarding can be disabled by some SSH servers and can also be limited, restricting or permitting port forwarding on a designated set of servers or specified users and groups. This restriction or permission  of  port  forwarding,  port-forwarding  ports,  and  port-forwarded servers is configured on the SSH server. If an SSH client attempts to port for- ward a port or attempts to port forward to a server that is restricted by the SSH server, the client will be denied access.   The port-forwarding rules applied on the SSH clients can either be outgoing  local  or incoming  remote . The type of port forwarding on the SSH client will determine the type of networking enabled on the SSH server.   If outgoing  local  port forwarding is being used on the SSH client, no spe- cific networking changes are generated on the SSH server. For example, if an SSH client is port forwarding port 143  IMAP  to an e-mail server that the SSH server is connected to, the SSH server will not change its networking configu- ration but will act as a conduit for the SSH connection between the SSH client and the e-mail server. In this architecture, the SSH client sends packets to the SSH server destined for the e-mail server on port 143. Once the SSH server receives the incoming packets from the authenticated SSH client on the estab- lished SSH session, the SSH server redirects or routes the packets to the e-mail server on port 143 on behalf of the remote SSH client. In this example, the SSH server is acting more as a router between the authenticated and established SSH client and the desired server; however, no networking changes or services are modified on the SSH server itself.    SSH Port Forwarding 201  Similarly,  if  the  SSH  client  is  port  forwarding  to  the  SSH  server,  not  to another server that the SSH server may be connected to, the SSH server still has no specific networking changes generated. For example, if the SSH server is also acting as an FTP server on port 21 and an SSH client port forwards FTP to the SSH server, there are no networking changes on the SSH server. Since the SSH client is port forwarding to an existing service  port  on the SSH FTP server, the SSH server’s networking configuration does not change but rather continues to act as an SSH server as well as an FTP server.   If incoming  remote  port forwarding is being used on the SSH client, net- working changes on the remote SSH server are generated. For example, if an SSH client is using remote port forwarding on port 21  FTP , the authenticated and established SSH session will generate and start a service on port 21 on the selected networking interfaces on the SSH server. In this architecture, the SSH client waits for redirect packets from the SSH server. In this example, a remote FTP client connects to the generated FTP service on the SSH server. Once the SSH server receives the incoming packets from the FTP client, the SSH server redirects and relays the packets to the SSH client’s FTP service on port 21 on behalf of the FTP client. Slightly different from the preceding example, the SSH server is acting as a redirector on port 21 between the authenticated and estab- lished SSH client and the remote FTP client.   SSH Port Forwarding  Now that you have looked at some of the basic concepts of port forwarding, turn your attention to how to configure port forwarding in several SSH clients and SSH servers. The discussion in the paragraphs that follow provides the foundation  for  the  material  in  the  next  chapter,  which  addresses  advanced SSH port forwarding.   In the following discussion on SSH clients and servers, a common architec- ture will be used for each of the configuration examples. That common archi- tecture is illustrated in Figure 6.11. The common architecture shows how to configure  port  forwarding  for  both  SSH  clients  and  SSH  servers  on  their respective applications and systems.  Before proceeding to your exploration of the various configuration options, examine the individual components of the common architecture. Table 6.1 lists the  different  devices  of  the  common  architecture  shown  in  Figure  6.11  and describes what they do.   202 Chapter 6  3 4 4 0 8  .  r e v r e s b e W  .  .    7 1 1 1 6 1 2 7 1    .  2 2  t n e  i l     C b e W    l a n r e t n  I  r e v r e S   H S S    1 2 . 1 1 . 0 3 . 1 1    3 4 1  b u H  l l  a w e r i F  1 . 1 1 . 6 1 . 2 7 1  1 . 1 1 . 0 3 . 1 1  t e n r e t n  I  r e v r e S   l i  a M  .  .    8 1 1 6 1 2 7 1    .  9 8 3 3  s  w o d n W  i  .  .  r e v r e S   l a n m r e T    2 7 1 1 6 1 2 7 1    .  i  .  i  l  g n d r a w r o f   t r o p   f o   s n o i t a r u g i f n o c   e p m a x e   e h t   r o f   d e s u   e r u t c e t i h c r a   n o m m o c   e h T  .  1 1 6   e r u g i F  5 2  l  y a e R   l i  a M    0 1 . 0 . 8 6 1 . 2 9 1    X X  t r o P   e c v r e S  i  k r o w t e N Z M D     k r o w t e N    l a n r e t n  I    t e n r e t n I     k r o w t e N    l a n r e t x E  1    t n e  i l     C H S S  r e v r e S   b e W    l a n r e t x E  m o c .  j  1 n 4 m u j .  b e w  0 8   SSH Port Forwarding 203  Table 6.1 Devices of the Common Architecture  DEVICE  SSH Client 1  DESCRIPTION  External Web Server SSH Client 2  This device represents the exact parameters of SSH Client 1;  however, it is also running a Web server on port 80.   This device represents any stand-alone operating system with any SSH client loaded on the machine. This client can be connecting to the Internet from a DSL, Cable, T1, T3, or dial-up  modem  connection. Also, this client can either be using a NAT’d  RFC 1918  address, such as 10.0.0.172, or a publicly routable address, such as 203.28.38.44. Lastly, the client can be connecting from a residence, office, hotel, airport wireless, or business-partner location.   This is the information superhighway.  The SSH server that listens only on port 22 and with an IP address of 11.30.11.21, which is a publicly routable address.  The firewall restricts all incoming traffic from the outside Internet to all destinations, except for any requests to the SSH server on port 22. A rough example of the firewall rules looks like the following: Allow  Pass  any connection from the internal network outbound. Allow  Pass  any connection from the outside  Internet  to the SSH server on port 22. Deny  Block  any connection from the outside  Internet  to the internal network or the DMZ network on any port. Allow  pass  any connection from the SSH server to the DMZ or internal network.  These rules will restrict any type of traffic coming from the outside Internet, except for SSH connections to the SSH server. I will demonstrate how allowing only port 22 through the firewall will still allow services such as e-mail, intranet Web pages, and remote management to be provided in a secure manner.  The firewall’s external IP address is 11.30.11.1 and does not listen to any ports on its external interfaces.   This device represents a mail-relay server. A mail-relay server is responsible for sending e-mail for individual e-mail clients. This server has an internal IP address of 192.168.0.10 and is using SMTP for the sending of e-mail, which listens on port 25.   This device represents a hub. It is used to connect the internal servers to the internal network. It does not have an IP address, nor does it listen on any port.    continued   Internet  SSH Server  Firewall  Mail Relay  Hub   204 Chapter 6  Table 6.1  continued   DEVICE  DESCRIPTION  Internal Web Client  Web Server  Mail Server  Windows Terminal  Server  This device represents any operating system with a Web client. Since most operating systems contain a Web client by default, this device can represent every operating system on the internal network.   This device represents the internal Web server of the organization. This server holds the organization’s intranet Web page, which is used to manage many of the applications and systems that are internal to the network, such as time-entry applications, expense applications, internal bulletin-board pages, and so on. This server has an internal IP address of 172.16.11.17 and is listening on port 80  HTTP  and port 443  HTTPS .   This device represents the mail server for the organization. The mail server is used to receive incoming e-mail for individual e-mail clients. This e-mail server has an internal IP address of 172.16.11.8 and is using IMAP for incoming e-mail, which is listening on port 143.   This device represents the internal management server for  the organization. It is used to manage internal operating systems and network devices. This is a Windows 2000 server with terminal services enabled. The server has an internal IP address 172.16.11.17 and is listening on port 3389.   Now  that  the  common  architecture  has  been  described  and  defined,  let’s explore how to individually configure the SSH clients and SSH servers for port forwarding. The following SSH servers and SSH clients will be discussed:  Command-line clients   OpenSSH client  SSH Communications’     VanDyke Software SSH Communications’ GUI SSH client SecureCRT SSH client PuTTY    OpenSSH server  Unix and Windows   SSH Communications’ SSH server  Unix  SSH Communications’ SSH server  Windows  VanDyke’s Software SSH server  Windows                                          SSH Port Forwarding 205  Local Port Forwarding for SSH Clients  The paragraphs that follow describe basic configuration steps for SSH clients, according to the parameters in Figure 6.11.  Configuration for Command-Line Clients OpenSSH,  SSH  Communications’,  and  VanDyke  Software  provide  a  com- mand-line client for SSH connections, as described in Chapter 3. OpenSSH’s command line-client is called ssh. SSH Communications’ SSH client is called ssh2. Lastly, VanDyke Software’s SSH client is called vsh. We will be using the three terms, ssh, ssh2, and vsh, to represent the respective SSH clients.   Using SSH Client 1 as your starting point, use the -L switch to configure local  outgoing  port-forwarding options. The syntax for the local  outgoing  port-forwarding options is as follows:  -L listen-port:host:port  OpenSSH and SSH Communications’  -local localport:remotehost:remoteport  VanDyke Software   The listen-port or localport option designates the port to have the local oper- ating system listen on. The host or remotehost option is the IP address of the remote  server  that  the  SSH  server  is  connected  to.  The  port  or  remoteport option is the port that the remote server is listening on. The specific -L options to  use,  according  to  Figure  6.11,  are  the  following  for  OpenSSH  and  SSH  Communications:   The specific -local options to use, according to Figure 6.11, are the following  –L 25:192.168.0.10:25  –L 80:172.16.1.117:80  –L 443:172.16.1.117:443 –L 143:172.16.11.8:143  –L 3389:172.16.11.72:3389  for VanDyke Software:  –local 25:192.168.0.10:25  –local 80:172.16.1.117:80  –local 443:172.16.1.117:443 –local 143:172.16.11.8:143  –local 3389:172.16.11.72:3389   206 Chapter 6  NOTE Do not confuse the listen-port option with the port option. The listen- port option is the port that the SSH client’s operating system will listen on, with the loopback  127.0.0.1  interface, in order to relay the connection. The port option is the port number on the remote server, which cannot be changed by the SSH client.   The listen-port option can be any port on the SSH client’s operating system. For example, instead of using listen-port 80 for the local relay to the remote Web server, the SSH client can use port 79. The remote connection will still be on port 80, but the local forward will connect on port 79. In order to make the connection, the Web browser has to point to port 79 instead of the default 80, which is quite easy  for example, http:  127.0.0.1:79 . This flexibility works well if multiple remote Web servers will be locally port forwarded, since only one local port can be forwarded to one remote IP address. On the other hand, the flexibility of the listen-port option is available only if the connecting client application, such as a Web-browser client, is able to connect using a nonstan- dard port, such as 79. In some cases, such as with the Terminal Services client, the client application cannot be configured to use a different connection port; therefore, the local-port option must remain 3389 in order for the connection to work correctly.   To connect to your SSH server in Figure 6.11 and forward all the local ports,  the following syntax should be used:  OPENSSH  ssh 11.30.11.21 –l jum4nj1 –p 22 –L 25:192.168.0.10:25 –L 80:172.16.11.17:80 –L 443:172.16.11.17:443 –L 143:172.16.11.8:143 –L 3389:172.16.11.72:3389  SSH COMMUNICATIONS  ssh2 11.30.11.21 –l jum4nj1 –p 22 –L 25:192.168.0.10:25 –L 80:172.16.11.17:80 –L 443:172.16.11.17:443 –L 143:172.16.11.8:143 –L 3389:172.16.11.72:3389  VANDYKE SOFTWARE  vsh 11.30.11.21 –l jum4nj1 –p 22 –local 25:192.168.0.10:25 –local 80:172.16.11.17:80 –local 443:172.16.11.17:443 –local 143:172.16.11.8:143 –local 3389:172.16.11.72:3389  The  first  part  of  the  syntax  connects  the  SSH  client  to  the  SSH  server  11.30.11.21   on  port  22,  designated  by  the  -p  option,  with  the  username  of jum4nj1, designated by the -l option. Once the SSH server’s IP address and   SSH Port Forwarding 207  port number have been designated, the local port-forwarding options need to be set. As you can see, the syntax can be quite long if several port-forwarding options are used. Different configuration files are ideal when more than one port-forwarding option is required to be set.  Refer to the Unix Setup section in Chapter  3,  “Secure  Shell  Clients,”  on  how  to  set  up  different  configuration files.  Once the SSH client is authenticated and the SSH session is established, the port-forwarding options will automatically be enabled. To confirm, type netstat -an  more and the port-forwarded ports should be listening on the loopback interface  127.0.0.1 .   Once you have confirmed that the port-forwarded sessions are enabled, use your client application to connect to your port-forwarded session. For exam- ple, to use the Windows Terminal Services port-forwarding session, execute the terminal services client and enter 127.0.0.1 for the server IP address. Since 127.0.0.1 is listening on the SSH client’s machine on port 3389, it will accept this  connection  request  from  the  client  application  and  forward  it  to 172.16.11.72 via the SSH connection and the SSH server. Similarly, other clients, such as mail clients and Web clients, will need to use the loopback interface  127.0.0.1  to connect to the remote server via the SSH session.   Configuration for SSH Communications’ GUI SSH Client SSH Communications also creates a GUI SSH client for Windows operating systems. Using SSH Client 1 from Figure 6.11 as the starting point, we can con- figure the local port-forwarding options quite easily using the following steps:  SSH Client.  SSH Secure Shell ➪  1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Click Profiles ➪ Add Profile. 3. Name the profile SSH server or anything you wish. 4. Click Profiles ➪ Edit Profile ➪ 5. Select the Tunneling tab. 6.

Leave the Type drop-down menu to TCP. 9. Enter 25 for Listen Port. 10. Enter 192.168.0.10 for Destination Host. 11. Enter 25 for Destination Port. 12. Select the OK button.  The  final  result  should  look  similar  to  Figure  6.12,  which  shows  the  SSH  client’s outgoing tunnel configuration.    208 Chapter 6  Figure 6.12 SSH Communications’ GUI for local port-forwarding options.  Continue to enter the rest of the local port-forwarding options by repeating  steps 7 through 11. Make sure the result looks like Figure 6.13.  Once all the outgoing tunnels have been entered, select OK. The outgoing port-forwarding  tunnels  for  SSH  Communications  have  now  been  entered. Once the connection is established, the local port-forwarding tunnels will be available.   Figure 6.13 The complete list of local port-forwarding options.   SSH Port Forwarding 209  Configuration for VanDyke Software’s Secure CRT  VanDyke Software creates a GUI SSH client for Windows operating systems. Using SSH Client 1 from Figure 6.11 as the starting point, you can configure the local port-forwarding options quite easily using the following steps:  SecureCRT ➪  SecureCRT.   1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. File ➪ Connect ➪ Highlight a saved SSH connection. 3. Right-click the select SSH connection and select Properties. 4. Highlight the Port Forwarding section. 5. Select the Add button. At this point, you can add the specific local port-  forwarding information.  6. Under the Name section, enter Mail Relay. 7. Under the Local section, leave the Manually Select Local IP Address on Which to Allow Connections unchecked. Use the loopback interface IP address, 127.0.01, which is the default. If the “real” IP address of the SSH client is desired, such as 172.16.1.100 or 206.13.11.17, select this checkbox and enter the IP address. Again, for your purposes at this time, you will use the loopback interface, so leave the box unchecked.  8. Under the Local section in the Port textbox, enter 25, since you will be connecting to your local port 25 to forward SMTP, which uses port 25.   9. Under the Remote section, check the box labeled Destination Host Is Different from the SSH Server, since your remote server is the mail- relay server, not the SSH server itself. If the remote port were on the SSH server, you could leave this box unchecked; however, in this case, it is not.   10. Under the Remote section in the Port textbox, enter 25, since the remote  mail server uses SMTP, which uses port 25.  11. Under the Application section, do not put anything. This section can be configured to automatically bring up an application, such as an e-mail client, once the SSH session has been established. Although this option is very useful, you will not be using it here. It is recommended, how- ever, to use this option as needed to eliminate steps for the novice end- user. For example, if you were to locate the e-mail client’s executable, such as Microsoft Outlook or Netscape Mail, once SecureCRT is used to authenticate the SSH session, the e-mail client would automatically start. To novice end-users, this process simplifies the steps for gaining access to e-mail, which is the single step of establishing the SSH connec- tion. In addition, since so many novice users are used to one-step e-mail access, this option proves to be really useful.   12. Select the OK button at the bottom of the window.   210 Chapter 6  Figure 6.14 SecureCRT SSH client for local port-forwarding options.  Figure 6.14 shows the final result of the local port-forwarding options from  the preceding steps.  Continue to enter the rest of the local port-forwarding options by repeating  steps 6 through 12. Make sure the result looks like Figure 6.15.  Figure 6.15 The complete list of local port-forwarding options on SecureCRT.

Once the con- nection is established, the local port-forwarding tunnels will be available.  Configuration for PuTTY PuTTY is a freeware SSH client for Windows operating systems. Using SSH Client 1 from Figure 6.11 as the starting point, you can configure the local port- forwarding options quite easily using the following steps:  1. Double-click “putty.exe.” 2. Browse to Connection ➪ 3. Highlight Tunnels. 4. Skip the X11 forwarding section, since this area does not apply to your  SSH ➪ Tunnels.  example. If you wanted to forward X11 sessions from an X11 server, this would be the option to select.   5. Under the Port Forwarding section, leave Local Ports Accept Connec-  tions from Other Hosts unchecked. This option mandates the listen ports to be accepted only from the local machine. If you need to have other hosts connect to the SSH client machine to forward ports, check the checkbox.   6. Under the Port Forwarding section, leave Remove Ports Do the Same  unchecked. This option is for remote  incoming  port forwarding, which allows other hosts to connect to the remote port on the SSH server.   7. Under the Port Forwarding section, enter 25 for the Source port textbox.  8. Under the Port Forwarding section, enter 192.168.0.10:25 for the Desti- nation textbox. Be sure to enter the option with the following format: IPAddress:port.   9. Under the Port Forwarding section, select the Local radio button. 10. Under the Port Forwarding section, select Add.   Figure 6.16 shows the final PuTTY configuration from the preceding steps.    212 Chapter 6  Figure 6.16 PuTTY with the local port-forwarding option.

Once the connec- tion is established, the local port-forwarding tunnels will be available.  Figure 6.17 The complete list of local port-forwarding options on PuTTY.   SSH Port Forwarding 213  Remote Port Forwarding for SSH Clients  Thus far, the discussion has examined only local  outgoing  port forwarding to and from the SSH clients. In the paragraphs that follow, the discussion will explore  the  use  of  remote   incoming   port  forwarding  in  accordance  with  Figure 6.11.  As discussed earlier, remote port forwarding is the opposite of local port for- warding, allowing remote ports on the SSH server to be forwarded to local ports on the SSH client or even other ports servers via the SSH client. In the example illustrated in Figure 6.11, web.jum4nj1.com is a Web server that also contains an SSH client. In order to allow the internal Web client in Figure 6.11 to  connect  to  the  remote  Web  server  using  the  SSH  client,  remote  port  for- warding  needs  to  be  enabled.  In  order  to  accomplish  this,  the  Web  server  web.jum4nj1.com  needs to use an SSH client and set up a remote forward to the SSH server. The remote forward can be configured to have the SSH server listen on port 80 and redirect any connections on port 80  on the SSH server  to the SSH client on port 80, over an encrypted SSH tunnel. This will allow the internal Web client to connect to the SSH server on port 80 and gain encrypted access to web.jum4nj1.com. The following sections demonstrate how to con- figure remote port forwarding on web.jum4nju1.com, according to the preced- ing example and Figure 6.11.  Configuration for OpenSSH Client  Unix and Windows  The  Web  server  in  Figure  6.11,  web.jum4nj1.com,  can  have  a  routable  IP address  206.13.7.1  or a nonroutable IP address  172.16.7.1  in order to set up remote port forwarding. The fact that both internal and external addresses can be used with remote port forwarding makes remote port forwarding the per- fect utility to side-step firewalls. I highly recommend not using remote port forwarding  to  side-step  firewalls,  but  I  should  state  that  using  internal  IP addresses with SSH clients can allow outbound connections on ports not usu- ally allowed through the firewall rules  discussed more in the next chapter . Using OpenSSH, the following command should be issued on web.jum4nj1 .com to enable remote port forwarding:  ssh 11.30.11.21 –R 80:localhost:80  Once the SSH connection is made with the remote port-forwarding settings, the internal Web client should open his or her favorite Web browser and point to the following URL: http:  11.30.11.21:80. Also, on the SSH server itself, the following URL can be used: http:  127.0.0.1:80. This will display the Web site on web.jum4nj1.com to both the internal Web client and the SSH server on the encrypted SSH connection.   214 Chapter 6  Configuration for SSH Communications’  Command-Line Client  Unix and Windows  As with OpenSSH commands, SSH Communications’ command-line clients can be used for remote forwarding sessions. To connect to the Web server in Figure 6.11 with SSH Communications’ SSH, the following command should be issued on web.jum4nj1.com:  ssh2 11.30.11.21 –R 80:localhost:80  Once the SSH connection is made with the remote port-forwarding settings, the internal Web client should open the Web browser and point to the follow- ing URL: http:  11.30.11.21:80. Also, on the SSH server itself, the following URL can  be  used:  http:  127.0.0.1:80.  This  will  display  the  Web  site  on web.jum4nj1.com to both the internal Web client and the SSH server on the encrypted SSH connection.  Configuration for SSH Communications’  GUI SSH Client  Windows  SSH Communications’ GUI clients can also be used for remote forwarding ses- sions. To connect to the Web server in Figure 6.11 using SSH Communications’ SSH GUI client, the following steps should be issued on web.jum4nj1.com:  SSH Secure Shell ➪  Secure Shell Client.  1. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Choose Profiles ➪ Edit Profiles. 3. Select the appropriate profile for the remote SSH server  11.30.11.21 . 4. Click the Tunneling tab. 5. Select the Incoming tab. 6.

Enter localhost for Destination Host. 11. Enter 80 for Destination Port.  This is the port that the SSH client  machine will be accepting connections on.   12. Select OK.   Figure 6.18 shows the result of the preceding steps.   SSH Port Forwarding 215  Figure 6.18 The Remote port-forwarding configuration.   Once the SSH connection is made with the remote port-forwarding settings, the internal Web client should open the Web browser and point to the follow- ing URL: http:  11.30.11.21:80. Also, on the SSH server itself, the following URL can  be  used:  http:  127.0.0.1:80.

Configuration for VanDyke Software’s SecureCRT VanDyke Software’s SecureCRT SSH client can also be used for remote for- warding sessions. To connect to the Web server in Figure 6.11 using SSH Com- munications’  SSH  GUI  client,  the  following  steps  should  be  issued  on web.jum4nj1.com:  1. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2.

Also, on the SSH server itself, the following URL can  be  used:  http:  127.0.0.1:80.  This  will  display  the  Web  site  on web.jum4nj1.com to both the internal Web client and the SSH server on the encrypted SSH connection.  Figure 6.19 The Remote port-forwarding configuration with SecureCRT.   SSH Port Forwarding 217  Port Forwarding for SSH Servers  The  paragraphs  that  follow  describe  the  basic  configuration  steps  for  SSH servers, according to the parameters in Figure 6.11. Unlike SSH clients, SSH servers require no special configuration or changes when the port-forwarding feature is used. Keep in mind, however, that while no special configuration is required,  no  restrictions  are  enabled  by  default,  which  allows  all  users,  all ports, and all accessible internal servers to be potentially forwarded to. While the use of port forwarding is a very strong feature of SSH2 servers, allowing full port-forwarding access to all SSH users may not be desired. For example, since the SSH service is very flexible, the SSH server may be a remote-access solution  with port forwarding  for several users, a secure file server  SFTP  for other users, and or shell access for other users. The ability to have all SSH accounts use the port-forwarding feature and access internal systems, such as the  Windows  Terminal  server,  may  not  be  desired  and  could  be  a  security issue. The following sections describe the use of port forwarding on the SSH server and any extra features the different implementations provide, such as port-forwarding filters.   Configuration for OpenSSH Server  Unix and Windows  The SSH server in Figure 6.11, 11.30.11.21, has a routable IP address that can be accessible  from  both  internal  networks  and  external  networks,  such  as  the Internet. By default, port forwarding is enabled on many, if not all, SSH ver- sion 2 servers, including OpenSSH. Unfortunately, OpenSSH does not provide a native utility to restrict port forwarding to only authorized ports, servers, and or  accounts.  If  OpenSSH  is  being  used,  other  methods  can  be  used  to restrict ports and servers, such as the firewall rules on 11.30.11.1 in Figure 6.11 or custom scripts. For example, using a firewall to restrict the SSH server to only authorized ports and servers and placing a “Deny” rule for all other inter- nal servers is probably the best way to allow authorized access while denying access to the rest of the internal network.   Configuration for SSH Communications’ SSH Server  Unix  SSH Communications provides an SSH Server for Unix systems. The Unix SSH server  is  configured  using  the  sshd2_config  file  located  in   etc ssh2,  as described earlier in the SSH Communications’ SSH server section in Chapter 2.  The SSH server in Figure 6.11, 11.30.11.21, has a routable IP address that can be accessible from both internal networks and external networks, such as the Internet. By default, port forwarding is enabled on SSH Communications’ SSH server,  so  there  is  no  special  configuration  needed  on  the  SSH  server  after   218 Chapter 6  installation has been completed.  See Chapter 1 for details on how to install an SSH  server.   SSH  Communications  provides  the  ability  to  restrict  or  permit port forwarding, also known as tunneling, on the SSH server. For example, if port forwarding is not desired, the tunneling settings can restrict access while still  allowing  terminal  and or  SFTP access.  In  addition  to  permitting  or restricting  port  forwarding,  the  ability  to  allow  port  forwarding  for  only  a specified set of users and denying everyone else is possible. Furthermore, the ability to deny port forwarding for a set number of users and allow everyone else  is  possible.  Lastly,  in  addition  to  allowing  and  denying  specific  users and or groups, the SSH server can restrict port forwarding using ACLs based on  IP addresses  and  port  numbers.  For  example,  if  port  forwarding  is  not desired to all internal machines but rather to a selected few, port forwarding ACLs can be set to allow only certain IP addresses on certain ports to be acces- sible to port forwarding SSH clients. To view the tunnel configuration options and configure these options on SSH Communications’ SSH server, perform the following steps:  1. Change directories to  etc sshd2:  cd  etc sshd2  2. View the sshd2_config file, specifically, the tunneling section:  more sshd2_config  3. The tunneling section of the sshd2_config is as follows:   Tunneling     AllowX11Forwarding             yes     AllowTcpForwarding             yes     AllowTcpForwardingForUsers     sjl, cowboyneal@slashdot\.org     DenyTcpForwardingForUsers      2[[:digit:]]*4,peelo     AllowTcpForwardingForGroups    privileged_tcp_forwarders     DenyTcpForwardingForGroups     coming_from_outside   Local port forwardings to host 10.1.0.25 ports 143 and 25 are   allowed for all users in group users.  Note that forwardings using the name of this host will be allowed   if it can be resolved from the DNS .      ForwardACL allow local .*%users \i10\.1\.0\.25% 14325    Local port forwardings requested exactly to host proxy.company.com  port 8080 are allowed for users that have ‘s’ as first character  and belong to the group with group id 10:    ForwardACL allow local s.*%10 proxy\.company\.com%8080   SSH Port Forwarding 219    Remote port forwarding is denied for all users to all hosts:   ForwardACL deny remote .* .*  4. Uncomment the AllowTcpForwarding line by deleting the  symbol. 5. Uncomment the AllowTcpForwardingForUsers line by deleting the   6. On the same line, delete the default entries  sjl, cowboyneal@  symbol.  slashdot\.org .  7. Enter the following accounts to allow port forwarding: root, admin, and  system@Aum-sshserver.com: AllowTcpForwarding           yes AllowTcpForwardingForUsers   root, admin, system@Aum-sshserver\.com Notice that the \ is required before the .com. A \ is mandatory when using a symbol.   8. Continue to enter values, deny access to the backup, and test accounts  while allowing the RemoteAccess group: AllowTcpForwarding          yes AllowTcpForwardingForUsers  root, admin, system@Aum-sshserver\.com DenyTcpForwardingForUsers   backup, test AllowTcpForwardingForGroups RemoteAccess  9. At this point, port-forwarding restrictions based on users have been  applied.  In addition to restricting port forwarding to users and or groups, specific IP address and ports can be granted denied access from port-forwarded rules. This feature is very important in terms of security, since you may not want to allow port-forwarding access from the outside to every server on the inside or every server that the SSH server has access to. These filters can specifically state which servers should be accessible and automatically deny everything else. To set port- forwarding filters according to Figure 6.11, the following set- tings should be set in the sshd2_config file:  ForwardACL   allow   local.*%users \i192.\.168\.0\.10% 25  ForwardACL   allow   local.*%users \i172.\.16\.11\.17% 80443  ForwardACL   allow   local.*%users \i172.\.16\.11\.8% 143  ForwardACL   allow   local.*%users \i172.\.16\.11\.72% 3389   These rules allow all users and groups to only port forward to 192.168.0.10  port 25 , 172.16.11.17  port 80 and 443 , 172.16.11.8  port 143 , and 172.16.11.72  port 3389 , while denying access to all other servers. Notice the syntax used   220 Chapter 6  for the port forwarding ACLs. A \i is required before the first octet of the IP address, and a \ is required before every following octet. The complete syntax is as follows:  ForwardACL argument  users   \iIP\.Address\.of\.server% portportport   DNS names can also be used for ForwardACL statements. For example, if Aum.terminalserver.com is the destination server, on port 3389, the following syntax can be used:  ForwardACL Allow .*%users Aum\.terminalserver\.com%3389   Note that once Allow rules are applied on the SSH server, all other servers and or devices will not be granted port-forwarding access. For example, only the servers specifically allowed will be accessible by the SSH clients who are port forwarding. All other servers will be denied by default unless otherwise stated.  This denial makes any Deny rules redundant, since everything else besides the server that has been allowed is denied automatically.  Furthermore, any  server  port-forwarding  filtering  overrides  any  client  port-forwarding rules on the SSH clients themselves.   Configuration for SSH Communications’  SSH Server  Windows  SSH Communications provides an SSH server for Windows as well as Unix. Unlike  the  Unix  version,  the  Windows  version  is  configured  and  enabled using a GUI, as described earlier in the “SSH Communications’ SSH server” section of Chapter 2.   The SSH server in Figure 6.11, 11.30.11.21, has a routable IP address that can be accessible from both internal networks and external networks, such as the Internet. By default, SSH Communications’ SSH server enables port forward- ing, so there is no special configuration required on the SSH server after instal- lation has been completed.  See Chapter 1 for how to install an SSH server.  SSH Communications provides the ability to permit or deny port forwarding, also known as tunneling, on the SSH server. For example, if port forwarding is not desired, tunnel settings can be denied completely while still allowing ter- minal and or SFTP access. In addition to permitting or restricting port for- warding, SSH Communications’ allows port forwarding for only a specified set of users and denial for everyone else. Furthermore, the ability to deny port forwarding for a set number of users and allow everyone else is possible. To view  the  tunnel  configuration  options  and  configure  these  options  on  SSH Communications’ SSH server, perform the following steps:   SSH Port Forwarding 221  Figure 6.20 SSH Communications’ Tunneling options.  1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Under SSH Server Settings, browse to Tunneling. As shown in Figure  SSH Secure Shell Server ➪ Configuration.  6.20, SSH Communications’ Tunneling menu can allow or deny tunnels.  3. Check the Allow TCP Tunneling checkbox. 4. In the Allow TCP Tunneling for Users textbox, enter the usernames you  would like to permit port forwarding to, such as the administrator account and other admin-level accounts  separated by a comma .  5. In the Deny TCP Tunneling for Users textbox, enter the usernames you would like to restrict port forwarding to, such as the guest account and other nonauthorized accounts  separated by a comma .   6. Select the Apply button. 7. Tunneling  port forwarding  restrictions have now been applied. As  shown in Figure 6.21, tunneling restrictions and permissions are easy  to apply.  The  SSH  server  has  now  been  configured  with  Terminal,  SFTP SCP,  and port forwarding; port forwarding, however, is restricted to the administrator, chandradhar,  and  prabha  accounts  and  is  specifically  denied  to  the  guest, IUSR_SSH, and backup accounts.    222 Chapter 6  Figure 6.21 SSH Communications’ Tunneling configuration options.  Configuration for VanDyke Software’s VShell SSH Server VanDyke  Software  provides  an  SSH  server  for  Windows  called  VShell.  The Windows version is configured and enabled using a GUI, as described earlier in the “VShell SSH Server” section of Chapter 2.   The SSH server in Figure 6.11, 11.30.11.21, also has a routable IP address that can be accessible from both internal networks and external networks, such as the Internet. Port forwarding is also enabled by default on the VShell server, so there is no special configuration needed on the SSH server after installation has been completed  see Chapter 1 for installing an SSH server . Similar to SSH Communications’  SSH  server,  VShell  also  provides  the  ability  to  restrict  or permit port-forwarding access, but it places the permissions and or restric- tions on the port-forwarded servers instead of on the users. For example, in Figure 6.11, port forwarding would be filtered by allowing the tunneling to the mail  relay,  mail  server,  Web  server,  and  windows  terminal  server  but  then restricted to the other IP addresses on the internal network. In addition to per- mitting or restricting port forwarding by IP address, the ability to allow port forwarding for a specified hostname, network subnet  netmask , or domain can  also  be  set.  For  example,  if  all  servers  in  the  192.168.0.0  network  were allowed  to  be  port  forwarded  to,  the  entire  network  subnet  could  be  set, instead  of  adding  several  hundred  machines.  Similarly,  if  all  servers  in  the internal  network  are  off  limits  and  have  the  IP address  range  of 172.16.1.0-172.16.1.254, the entire subnet can be restricted. To view the filter- configuration options and configure these options on the VShell SSH server, perform the following steps:   SSH Port Forwarding 223  Figure 6.22 The VShell filtering options.  1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell. 2. Browse to the Port-Forward Filters section  see Figure 6.22 . In order to configure the port-forwarding options according to Figure 6.11,  use the following steps.   1. Notice the default rule that allows port forwarding to all machines.  Delete this rule by highlighting the rule and selecting Delete.  2. Select Add to add filtering entries. 3. Select the drop-down box next to Filter Type to view the type options,  including IP address, Hostname, Netmask, and Domain  see Figure 6.23 .  Figure 6.23 VShell’s Filter Type options for port-forwarding filters.   224 Chapter 6  4. In the Allow section, select the Allow radio button. 5. For the Filter type, select IP address. 6. In the IP address field, type 192.168.0.10. 7. In the Port section, select the Port radio button and type 25 in the text  box.  8. In the Comment field, type Mail Relay. 9. Select OK. 10. Repeat steps 7 through 11 for the other three servers. The final result  should look like Figure 6.24.  Once Allow  rules  are  applied  on  the  VShell  SSH  server,  only  the  servers specifically allowed will be accessible via port forwarding, all other servers and or devices will not be accessible. This makes any Deny rules redundant, since everything else is denied automatically besides the server that has been allowed. Furthermore, any server port-forwarding filters override any client port-forwarding rules on the SSH clients themselves.   If the entire network were allowed to port forward, except for a few speci- fied servers, both Allow filters and Deny filters would be required. For exam- ple, if the internal network had an IP range of 172.16.1.1-172.16.1.254 and the only  server  restricted  was  172.16.1.100,  the  VShell  port-forwarding  filtering would need to look like Figure 6.25, where the 172.16.1.0 network is permitted and the 172.16.1.100 server is specifically denied.   Figure 6.24 VShell’s filtering rules for port-forwarding according to Figure 6.11.   SSH Port Forwarding 225  Figure 6.25 Access to the internal network, except for one server.  Make sure the Deny filter comes before the Allow filter, since filters are read  from top to bottom and are executed immediately once there is a match.  Advantages to SSH Port Forwarding  The strong benefits of port forwarding involve its advanced usage, with little to no added complexity. While many organizations spend thousands of dol- lars  and  architectural  resources  to  deploy  IPSec  VPNs,  restrictions  on  the IPSec,  such  as  NAT-enabled  networks,  often  limit  the  type  of  access  that remote users may utilize. While SSH port forwarding also has its limitations, the use of port forwarding, combined with its ease of use, its low overhead for setup,  and  its  simplicity,  makes  port  forwarding  a  very  attractive  remote- access solution.  You also probably notice that unlike other client server architectures, most of the configuration of port forwarding is required on the SSH client, not on the  SSH  server.  Most,  if  not  all,  SSH2  servers  have  SSH  port  forwarding enabled by default. This allows any client to take full advantage of the features after  a  basic  default  install  of  any  SSH  server.  No  special  configuration  or options  are  required  after  the  initial  installation  of  the  SSH  server  is  com- pleted; however, additional configuration options can be enabled on certain SSH servers after installation. As stated before, the SSH client requires most, if not all, the configuration attention. In order to forward ports from the client to a remote server or vice-versa, the options need to be configured on the SSH   226 Chapter 6  client and enabled before the SSH connection has been established. While this effort is relatively low and usually required only once, many new users are not accustomed to the fact that no server-side configuration is required, only client- side configuration. The concept, while being relatively simple, confuses many new SSH users, thinking that in addition to client-side configuration, some mag- ical tricks need to be configured on the SSH server also, which could not be far- ther from the truth. Once the port-forwarding configuration has been enabled on the SSH client, the port-forwarding tunnels should be fully functional.  The use of different SSH clients with port forwarding are also described in this chapter. While many of the SSH clients provide similar, if not the same, fea- tures as one another, there are some subtle differences that should be reviewed in order to select the best SSH client for your situation or organization.  While  providing  different  functionality  and  usage,  both  local  and  remote port forwarding offer benefits to the entire SSH architecture. The fact that most TCP ports can be tunneled over an encrypted SSH session gives port forward- ing and SSH a whole new identification. Instead of SSH being a solution for only encrypted Telnet, SSH now becomes a viable solution for any insecure TCP ports, especially mail protocols, such as POP3, IMAP, SMTP, intranet pro- tocols, such as HTTP, and remote-management protocols, such as VNC, Win- dows Terminal server, X11, and pcAnywhere. Also, the most popular usage of SSH, which is encrypted terminal access, becomes a completely secondary fea- ture. SSH is often deployed only for its port-forwarding capabilities, ignoring any terminal or SFTP access it may provide. Lastly, with its completely flexible architecture, combined with its fully encrypted communication, SSH port for- warding provides the ability to access almost any machine over any hostile or untrusted  network  with  the  full  assurance  of  the  safety  and  security  of  the remote session. The fact that the SSH session is fully encrypted, provides two- factor  authentication  options,  and  still  grants  virtually  full  access  to  the desired remote server or network makes SSH more flexible than other stan- dard encryption applications.  Summary  This chapter discusses some of the networking basics of one of the more pow- erful features of SSH. Details on the port-forwarding architecture from both an SSH-client and an SSH-server perspective are introduced and demonstrated. From the initial discussion in the early sections of this chapter, you learn that not only does port forwarding allow SSH to secure weak protocols, such as mail protocols, file transfer protocols, and remote management protocols, but that it also provides the same functionality that end-users are accustomed to. Both remote and local port forwarding give SSH and SSH users an abundance   SSH Port Forwarding 227  of flexibility in current network architectures, due to their ability to adapt and co-exist with existing technologies, devices, and applications.  Once  a  framework  is  established  regarding  what  port  forwarding  is,  the chapter  focuses  on  how  to  use  it.  The  chapter  discusses  the  configuration details of port-forwarding options on three SSH clients: OpenSSH, SSH Com- munications’,  and  SecureCRT. Also,  the  chapter  discusses  the  configuration details  of  three  SSH  servers:  OpenSSH,  SSH  Communications’,  and  VShell. Now that you know what port forwarding is and how to use it, how to opti- mize  it  with  its  basic  and  advanced  features  can  be  addressed.  In  the  next chapter, the focus shifts from the theory, setup, and basic installation of port forwarding on clients and servers to the advanced uses of port forwarding, such as remote-access solutions. Many of the concepts discussed in this chap- ter are fully utilized in the next one, but with an added demonstration of their full flexibility and optimal usage. When deploying a remote-access solution for an organization or a backup VPN solution for a particular department  entity, it is important to understand the many uses of resources, such as port forwarding.    C H A P T E R7  Secure Remote Access  Remote access solutions in various organizations need to meet strict require- ments in order to satisfy the needs of their end-users, which can range from road warriors working from hotel rooms to technical administrators working from home. While remote access solutions need to be available, functional, and flexible,  security  concerns  often  get  overlooked.  For  example,  how  many remote users in your network use the following items to get access to company resources?  SMTP and POP IMAP to retrieve e-mail    Dialup modems when inside Network Address Translated  NAT’d   Local Area Networks SMB or NFS for remote file access PPTP, VNC, or pcAnywhere for remote management  If  your  organization  does  have  several  people  who  do  access  internal resources with any of these items, especially with the second option, you prob- ably could use SSH as a partial or full remote access solution. I cannot discuss the topic of remote access solutions without bringing up IPSec as the standard remote access solution. While IPSec might be the favorable solution for many remote access architectures, it might have limitations that may not make it the best solution for you. For example, its cost requirements, its setbacks in NAT’d  229                 230 Chapter 7  networks,  and  its  significantly  larger  deployment  requirements  might  not make it the optimal solution for you.  Following  up  from  the  previous  chapter,  in  this  chapter  I  examine  the advanced usage of port forwarding in the context of remote access, specifically:  Secure e-mail with SSH Secure File Transfer  SMBand NFS  with SSH Secure management  pcAnywhere, VNC, Terminal Services  with SSH Secure VPN with SSH  PPP over SSH   Secure E-mail with SSH  The use of common e-mail protocols, such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP, greatly increases the security exposures in an organization’s e-mail architecture. Nev- ertheless, while there may be the availability of SSL-enabled POP3 and IMAP, the use of SMTP still allows outgoing e-mail exchanges to go over clear-text. While  the  use  of  clear-text  protocols  for  any  type  of  application,  including e-mail, management, and file transfer, is just a bad idea, the use of clear-text protocols on the Internet is an even worse idea. The use of SSH can help miti- gate some of the issues with clear-text e-mail protocols by using port forward- ing with an SSH server to tunnel the SMTP and POP3 IMAP protocols over the Internet inside an SSH tunnel. This not only prevents unauthorized users from sniffing and reading other people’s e-mail but also offers the ability to enforce two-factor authentication with the SSH connection, thus increasing the overall security of the e-mail architecture.   In this section, I demonstrate how to implement an SSH architecture with port forwarding to support secure e-mail. The architecture I will be using is shown in Figure 7.1.   Figure 7.1 shows an SSH server, listening on port 22  SSH , and a mail-relay server, listening on port 25  SMTP , in the Internet DMZ off the perimeter fire- wall. The corporate e-mail server is located inside the internal network, which is listening on port 110  POP3 .   The first example will assume that the SSH server is a Unix machine run- ning OpenSSH, that the SSH client is SecureCRT running on a Windows plat- form for the road warriors, and that the e-mail client is Outlook Express. The mail relay and the e-mail servers can be any application, since no changes are required on either of these devices.   NOTE Any SSH server, SSH client, or e-mail client can be used for the secure e-mail architecture. My example is a random selection from the different SSH applications I have discussed thus far.

The service will automatically port forward all connections to and from the SSH server. That being said, some specific rules need to be on the adjacent firewall to ensure that port-forwarding communications will be allowed. First, the fire- wall’s external interface  the interface that faces the Internet  must allow con- nections from the outside Internet to the SSH server, specifically port 22 on IP address 11.30.11.21. Second, on the firewall’s DMZ interface  the interface that connects to the SSH server and mail relay , connections from the SSH server must be allowed to the internal mail server, specifically allowing IP address 11.30.11.21 on any source port to port 110 on IP address 172.16.1.100. Lastly, connections from the SSH server to the mail relay inside the DMZ network need to be allowed, specifically from 11.30.11.21 on any source port to port 25 on IP address 11.30.11.22.  After the SSH server has been completely installed and the firewall rules are  in place, the SSH server is ready for the secure e-mail architecture.  Setting Up the SSH Client Once the SSH server has been set up, the SSH client on the road-warrior laptops should be configured. Using SecureCRT 4.0 or above, configure as follows:  SecureCRT.  SecureCRT ➪  1. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Choose File ➪ Quick Connect. 3. Select SSH2 as the Protocol field. 4. Enter 11.30.11.21 for the Hostname field. 5. Enter 22 to the Port field.  6. Enter the correct username, such as Kusum, in the Username field. 7. Make sure the “Save session” box is checked. 8. Select “Connect” and log in to the SSH server with the appropriate  9. After the session has been established, disconnect the session, File ➪  password.  Disconnect.  10. Select File ➪ Connect and highlight the 11.30.11.21 option. 11. Right-click 11.30.11.21 and the select properties. 12. Highlight the Port Forwarding section.   Secure Remote Access 233  Now  that  the  setup  is  complete,  you  can  add  the  local  port-forwarding  options:  13. Select Add to display the Port Forwarding options.  14. Enter Mail Relay for the Name field. 15. In the Local subsection, make sure “Manually select local IP address on  which to allow connections” is unchecked.  16. In the Local subsection, enter 25 for the Port field. 17. In the Remote subsection, make sure “Destination host is different from  the SSH server” is checked.  18. Enter 11.30.11.22 for the Hostname field. 19. In the Remote subsection, enter port 25 for the Port field. 20. Do not enter anything for the Application subsection. 21. Select OK.  Now that the Mail Relay local port-forwarding option is set up, the Mail  Server local port-forwarding option can be set:  22. Select Add to display the Port Forwarding options. 23. Enter Mail Server for the Name field. 24. In the Local subsection, make sure “Manually select local IP address on  which to allow connections” is unchecked.  25. In the Local subsection, enter 110 for the Port field. 26. In the Remote subsection, make sure “Destination host is different from  the SSH server” is checked. a. Enter 11.30.11.22 for the Hostname field.  27. In the Remote subsection, enter port 110 for the Port field. 28. In the Application subsection, enter the path for Outlook Express. Once  the SSH session has been established, this option will open Outlook Express automatically, requiring no interaction from the end-user. While this option may seem trivial, requiring one fewer step for novice end-users is significant. This option virtually allows one-step execution for secure e-mail.  a. “c:\Program Files\Outlook Express\msimn.exe”  29. Select OK.  The result should look like Figure 7.2.   234 Chapter 7  Figure 7.2 Local port-forwarding settings.  After the SSH client has been completely installed, the e-mail client is ready  for the secure e-mail architecture.   Setting Up the E-mail Client Once the SSH client has been set up, the e-mail client on the road-warrior lap- tops should be configured. Using Microsoft Outlook Express 4.0 or above, con- figure as follows:  1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ Outlook Express. 2. Select Tools from the menu bar and select Accounts. 3. Select the Mail tab. 4. Select the Add button and choose mail option. 5. For Display name, enter the name you would like to have displayed for  your e-mail account, such as Mohandas Gandhi. Select Next.  6. For E-mail address, enter your e-mail address given to you by your  e-mail administrator, such as gandhi@bharat.com. Select Next.  7. The next screen should be the E-mail Server Names. There are four  steps to complete here: a. If you are using POP3, select POP3 for your incoming mail server  if you are using IMAP, make sure IMAP is selected for your incoming server .    Secure Remote Access 235  b. For the Incoming mail server, enter 127.0.0.1. Remember, you have already set up your our port-forwarding steps in the prior section. Once the SSH session has been established, local ports will listen on port 25 and 110. When Outlook Express attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1 on 110, it will be redirected by the SSH client to the e-mail server of the SSH tunnel.  c. For the Outgoing mail server, enter 127.0.0.1.  d. Select Next.  8. Enter your account name given to you by your e-mail administrator,  such as Gandhi.  9. Enter your password, if you would like; however, I recommend you  leave this blank and allow the application to prompt you for authenti- cation every time you log in. Select Next.  10. Click Finish. The e-mail client for secure e-mail has been completed. 11. To verify, highlight 127.0.0.1 in the account field and choose the Proper- ties button on the right. Figures 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 show how the General, Servers, and Advanced tabs should look on your e-mail client.  Figure 7.3 General tab of Outlook Express.   236 Chapter 7  Figure 7.4 Servers tab of Outlook Express.  Figure 7.5 Advanced tab of Outlook Express.  Once you have verified your setting, select OK and Close. You have com-  pleted the e-mail client setup for SSH.   Secure Remote Access 237  Figure 7.6 Connection to the SSH server.  Executing Secure E-mail At this point, you have completed the necessary steps for secure e-mail. You have configured your SSH server and appropriate firewall rules, configured your SSH client for port forwarding, and configured your e-mail client to use your loopback address.  In order to start using the secure e-mail architecture, open SecureCRT and  connect to the SSH server, as shown in Figure 7.6.  To  verify  the  port-forwarding  tunnels,  type  netstat  –an on  the  command line,  and  both  port  25  and  port  110  should  be  listening  on  the  IP address 0.0.0.0, as shown in Figure 7.7.   Figure 7.7 Local port-forwarding connections listening on ports 25 and 110.   238 Chapter 7  Figure 7.8 Outlook Express.  Once the SSH server has been established, Outlook Express should auto- matically open. You should automatically be prompted to log in with your cor- rect password, as shown in Figure 7.8.  Once you have authenticated, your e-mail should be downloaded from the  e-mail server over the encrypted SSH tunnel.   Note that the e-mail communication will be going through its native proto- cols, such as SMTP and POP3, to and from the SSH server on the internal net- work; however, the e-mail communication will be encrypted in the SSH tunnel from the SSH server, over the Internet, to the e-mail client.   Congratulations!  You  have  just  implemented  a  secure  e-mail  architecture  over the Internet.   Secure File Transfer  SMB and NFS  with SSH  Common file transfer protocols such as SMB  Server Message Block , and NFS  Network File System  are often used in many network environments to share files to and from file servers. For example, Windows networking relies heavily   Secure Remote Access 239  on  NetBIOS  with  SMB  for  file  transfers  to  and  from  Windows  servers  and clients. While the need for SMB is quite important, the attack threats of SMB and NetBIOS greatly increase the security exposures in many Windows net- works. While use of NetBIOS with SMB may be appropriate for internal net- works,  exposure  of  SMB  file  sharing  to  remote  users  and  hostile  networks, such as the Internet, is not. Nevertheless, although SMB over the Internet is not appropriate, remote users still need access to corporate file servers, including Windows  file  servers.  Secure  remote  access  is  where  SSH  can  be  used  for secure file access.  In addition to SMB, NFS  over TCP  also is exposed to many security threats in an organization. NFS is a clear-text protocol. Authentication information, as well as payload information, can be sniffed from this protocol. Also, as with SMB, NFS is dangerous to use in hostile networks such as the Internet. NFS vulnerability attacks are abundant; therefore, any use of this protocol can sig- nificantly increase the security risk of your organization. Nevertheless, as with SMB,  the  security  vulnerabilities  with  NFS  do  not  make  the  desire  to  gain remote file access over hostile networks any less demanding. While the secu- rity threats may be high with this protocol, the demand for remote file access needs to be met. This is also where SSH can be used for secure file access.   The  use  of  SSH  can  help  mitigate  some  of  the  issues  with  vulnerable  or clear-text file transfer protocols by using port forwarding with an SSH server to tunnel the SMB and NFS protocols over the Internet inside an SSH tunnel. This not only protects against security attacks and unauthorized sniffing but also offers the ability to enforce two-factor authentication with the SSH con- nection, thus increasing the overall security of the file transfer architecture.  In this section, I will demonstrate how to implement an SSH architecture with port forwarding to support secure file transfer. The architecture I will be using is shown in Figure 7.9.  Figure 7.9 shows an SSH server, listening on port 22  SSH , and two internal file servers. The two file servers include a Windows 2000 file server, listening on port 445  SMB over TCP , a Sun Solaris NFS file server, listening on port 2049  NFS over TCP  and port 1026  mountd . The SSH server is located in Internet DMZ off the perimeter firewall, segmented from the internal network. The corporate file servers are located inside the internal network, fully acces- sible to internal employees for file access.  The second example will assume that the SSH server is a Windows machine running  VanDyke  Software’s  VShell  SSH  server,  that  the  SSH  client  is  SSH Communications’ SSH2 client running on a Unix platform for the road war- riors, and that the file transfer clients are smbclients for SMB and mount for NFS. Any  SSH  server  or  SSH  client  can  be  used.  The  example  is  a  random selection from the different SSH applications I have discussed thus far.   240 Chapter 7  22  r e v r e S   H S S  1 2 . 1 1 . 0 3 . 1 1  1026 2049   445  l  s i r a o S   n u S  r e v r e S   e  l i  F   S F N  .  .  0 5 1 1 6 1 2 7 1  .  0 0 0 2   s  w o d n W  i  r e v r e S   e  l i  F  0 0 1 . 1 . 6 1 . 2 7 1  .  e r u t c e t i h c r a   g n i r a h s - e  l i f   e r u c e S  .  9 7   e r u g i F  e m o h @    s r o t a r t s i n m d A  i  l  a n r e t n  I  k r o w t e N  l l  a w e r i F  r e t u o R  t e n r e t n  I  t a   s r o i r r a W d a o R     s l e t o h   r o     s  N A L     s e t i s   t n e  i l  c   Secure Remote Access 241  Table 7.1 Firewall Rules That Need to Be Enabled  RULE NUMBER  1  2  3  4  SOURCE  DESTINATION  SERVICE  ACTION  Any  SSH-Server  Port 22  SSH server  Windows File Server  Port 445  SSH server  Solaris NFS file server Port 2049 Port 1026  Any  Any  Any  Allow  Allow  Allow  Deny  Setting Up the SSH Server Since I am using the VShell SSH server on a Windows platform, no special changes are required. The service will automatically port forward all connec- tions to and from the SSH server. Nevertheless, similar to the first example, there needs to be some specific rules on the adjacent firewall to ensure that port forwarding communications will be allowed. First, on the firewall’s exter- nal  interface   the  interface  that  faces  the  Internet ,  connections  must  be allowed from the outside Internet to the SSH server, specifically port 22 on IP address  11.30.11.21.  Second,  the  firewall’s  DMZ  interface   the  interface  that connects to the SSH server , needs to allow connections from the SSH server to the internal file servers. Specifically, the rules need to allow the SSH server  11.30.11.21   on  any  source  port  to  port  445  on  the  Windows  file  server  172.16.1.100  and allow the SSH server  11.30.11.21  on any source port to port 2049 and 1026 on the Solaris NFS file server  172.16.1.150 . Table 7.1 shows an example of the firewall rules.  After the SSH server has been completely installed and the firewall rules are  in place, the SSH server is ready for the secure file transfer architecture.   Setting Up the SSH Client Once the SSH server has been set up, the SSH client on the road-warrior Unix laptops should be configured. Using SSH Communications’ SSH server ver- sion 3.0 or above, configure as follows:   1. Change directories to your home directory. 2. Since you would like to connect to both file servers, you will have local port-forwarding options for each of them with the use of the –L option   242 Chapter 7  on a single command. You need to have three local port-forwarding options to set, specifically 445 for SMB and 2049 and 1026 for NFS Mountd.: -L 445:172.16.1.100:445 -L 2049:172.16.1.150:2049  -L 1026:172.16.1.150:1026  3. Type the appropriate SSH command with local port forwarding: ssh 11.30.11.21 –p 22 –l   –L 445:172.16.1.100:445 –L 2049:172.16.1.150:2049 –L 1026:172.16.1.150:1026   4. Since typing that very long command will become tedious over time,  create a configuration file for your local port-forwarding options: a. Open a blank file  using Vi or Emacs, whichever you like. I recom-  mend Vi, but you Emac lovers are outnumbering us Vi lovers .  b. Enter the following lines into the file. These lines specify the local  port-forwarding options:  LocalForward         “445:172.16.1.100:445” LocalForward         “2049:172.16.1.150:2049” LocalForward         “1026:172.16.1.150:1026” c. Save the file in your home directory as Config.  5. Type the appropriate SSH command, referencing the new config file:  ssh 11.30.11.21 –p 22 –l   -F Config  That’s it! To verify that the SSH connection has executed the port forwards, type netstat –an on port 445, 2049, and 1026 should be listening on the local interface, as shown in Figure 7.10.  Figure 7.10 Ports 445, 2049, and 1026 listening on the road warrior’s Unix system.   Secure Remote Access 243  After the SSH client has been completely configured, the file server clients  are ready for the secure file server architecture.  Setting Up the File Server Clients As with the SSH server, no special configuration is required for the file trans- fer  clients.  Each  client,  including  smbclient  and  mount,  is  a  stand-alone  command-line client that can be used seamlessly with SSH. As with the e-mail client in the first example, all connections, instead of directing things to the real  servers,  will  be  directed  locally  to  the  loopback  interface,  specifically 127.0.0.1, to connect to the local port forwards set up by the SSH connection, which will then take those connections and forward them to the appropriate servers over the SSH connection.  Executing Secure File Transfer At this point, you have completed the necessary steps for secure file transfer. You have configured your SSH server and appropriate firewall rules, config- ured your SSH client for port forwarding, and configured your file transfer client to use your loopback address.   In order to start using the secure file transfer architecture, execute SSH Com- munications’  SSH  client  and  connect  and  authenticate  to  the  VShell  SSH server, as shown in Figure 7.11.  After authenticating, verify the port-forwarding tunnels on the SSH connec- tion  by  typing  netstat  –an on  the  command  line.  Ports  445,  2049,  and  1026 should be listening on the loopback address.  See Figure 7.12.   Figure 7.11 Connection to the SSH server.   244 Chapter 7  Figure 7.12 Local port-forwarding connections listening on ports 445, 2049, and 1026.  Secure File Sharing with SMB and SSH  Once the SSH connection has been established, you can attempt to log in to the Windows SMB file server. To transfer files to and from the c share on the Win- dows file server, type the following command on the Unix SSH client:  smbclient  \\\\127.0.0.1\\c -U   -p 445  smbclient has very simple syntax: -U is for the username; -p is for the port number. This command will connect to the local port on 445 and then be for- warded  by  the  SSH  session. After  the  connection  reaches  the  Windows  file server, you should be prompted for a password. Use your Windows file server password given to you by your Windows administrator and log in. After you have entered the correct password, you will now be able to upload and down- load files from the Windows file server using simple Get and Put commands. The results should look like Figure 7.13.  Figure 7.13 The results of file sharing with SSH with SMB and smbclient.   Secure Remote Access 245  Notice a couple of things about Figure 7.13. First, observe that the connec- tion is to the loopback interface. Second, check out the password prompt by the remote Windows file server, which is still over the SSH tunnel.  This solves problems of NTLM weaknesses also, which will not be discussed here.  Lastly, mark the get file.txt command, which downloads the file called file.txt from the remote Windows file server to the local Unix laptop, all over the encrypted SSH session.   NOTE An SSH client on Windows will not be able to forward local connections on port 445, since Windows networking does not allow SMB over TCP and another service to share port 445; thus, the SSH forward will be denied access to that local port.  This scenario allows you to use SMB over an encrypted SSH tunnel over the  Internet.  Secure File Sharing with NFS and SSH  To use SSH with NFS, one additional step needs to be completed on the NFS server. The  etc exports file, the file that holds the lists of authorized clients, needs to add the SSH server’s IP address to this file. Since SSH clients will be using the SSH server to access the NFS server, it must be authorized to do so. Edit the  etc exports file in the NFS server to the following:   home 11.30.11.21  rw, root_squash   Once the change has been made and the services have been restarted, estab- lish the session with the SSH server. Once the session has been established, you can attempt to log in to the Solaris NFS file server. To transfer files to and from the  home NFS share on the Solaris NFS file server, type the following command:  mount –t nfs –o tcp,port=2049 ,mountport=1026 127.0.0.1: home  nfsmount  Mount is the actual protocol to access the NFS server, using port 1026 in this example. The mount command has very simple syntax, where the IP address of the NFS server is separated by a colon to the NFS share, followed by the local path to mount the remote NFS share, such as  nfsmount in this example. This command will connect to the local port on 2049 and 1026 and then be for- warded by the SSH session. After the connection reaches the Solaris NFS file server,  the  NFS  server  will  verify  that  you  are  allowed  to  mount  this  NFS share. After it verifies you, the remote NFS share should be mounted to  nfs- mount on your local Unix operating system.   246 Chapter 7  Internet.  This scenario allows you to use NFS over an encrypted SSH tunnel over the  NOTE All file sharing in the preceding examples, including SMB and NFS, will use the native protocols from the SSH server to the file servers; however, the file transfer protocols  SMB and NFS  will be encrypted in an SSH tunnel over the Internet.  Congratulations! You have just implemented a secure file transfer architec-  ture over the Internet.  Secure Management with SSH  The use of common management protocols, such as VNC, pcAnywhere, and Windows terminal services, which uses the RDP protocol, greatly increases the security  exposures  in  an  organization’s  remote  management  architecture. While the security exposures of the preceding applications vary, all four pop- ular remote management applications have had security vulnerabilities asso- ciated  with  the  application,  the  encryption  used  for  the  communication between the server and client, or the authentication process itself. The use of the common remote management protocols may be the attack vector for an unauthorized user or attacker to compromise an internal system from the out- side. If the remote management applications are deployed in a secure, fully patched  fashion,  many  of  them  only  require  a  username  and  password  to authenticate. As a general rule of thumb, your internal networks and servers should never be accessible with just a single username and password, whether it is a VPN  PPTP  password or a terminal services password.  The use of SSH can help mitigate some of the issues with remote manage- ment applications, poor encryption algorithms used with management proto- cols,  and  single  username password  requirements.  SSH  can  use  port forwarding with an SSH server to tunnel the management protocols over the Internet inside an SSH tunnel. Doing so not only protects unauthorized users from attacking the management applications and protocols but also offers the ability  to  enforce  two-factor  authentication  with  the  SSH  connection,  thus increasing the overall security of the management architecture.  In this section, I will investigate how to implement an SSH architecture with port  forwarding  to  support  secure  management.  The  architecture  I  will  be using is shown in Figure 7.14.  Figure 7.14 shows an SSH server, listening on port 22  SSH  in the Internet DMZ off the perimeter firewall. Inside the internal network are three manage- ment  servers,  including  a  Windows  Terminal  server,  listening  on  port  3389  RDP , a Linux VNC server, listening on port 5901, and a pcAnywhere server, listening on ports 5631 and 5632.

NOTE Any SSH server and SSH client can be used; my example is a random selection from the different SSH applications I have discussed thus far.  Setting Up the SSH Server Since I am using the SSH Communications’ SSH server on a Unix platform, no special changes are required. The service will automatically port forward all connections to from the SSH server. Nevertheless, as with the first example, some specific rules need to be implemented on the adjacent firewall to ensure that  port-forwarding  communications  will  be  allowed.  First,  the  firewall’s external interface  the interface that faces the Internet  must allow connections from the outside Internet to the SSH server, specifically port 22 on IP address 11.30.11.21. Second, the firewall’s DMZ interface  the interface that connects to the SSH server  needs to allow connections from the SSH server to the internal management  servers.  Specifically,  the  rules  need  to  allow  the  SSH  server  11.30.11.21  on any source port to port 3389 on the Windows Terminal server  10.1.0.100 , allow the SSH server  11.30.11.21  on any source port to port 5901 on the Linux VNC server  10.1.0.150 , and allow the SSH server  11.30.11.21  on any source port to port 5631 and 5632 on the pcAnywhere server 10.1.0.200 . Table 7.2 shows an example of the firewall rules.  After the SSH server has been completely installed and the firewall rules are  in place, the SSH server is ready for the secure management architecture.

The result should look like Figure 7.15. After the SSH client has been completely installed, the management clients  are ready for the secure management architecture.   Figure 7.15 Local port-forwarding settings.   252 Chapter 7  Setting Up the Management Clients As with the SSH server, no special configuration is required on the manage- ment  clients.  Each  client,  including  the  Terminal  Services  client,  the VNCviewer, and the pcAnywhere client, is a standalone command-line client that can be used seamlessly with SSH. As with the e-mail client in the first example, instead of directing things to the real servers, all connections will be directed locally to the loopback interface, specifically 127.0.0.1, to connect to the  local  port  forwards  established  by  the  SSH  connection,  which  will  then take those connections and forward them to the appropriate servers over the SSH connection.  Executing Secure Management At this point, you have completed the necessary steps for secure management. You have configured your SSH server and appropriate firewall rules, config- ured your SSH client for port forwarding, and configured your management clients to use your loopback address.   To start using the secure management architecture, execute SecureCRT and connect and authenticate to the SSH Communications’ SSH server, as shown in Figure 7.16.  After authenticating, verify the port-forwarding tunnels on the SSH connec- tion by typing netstat –an on the command line. Ports 3389, 5631, 5632, and 5901 should be listening on the loopback address, as shown in Figure 7.17.  Figure 7.16 The connection to the SSH server.   Secure Remote Access 253  Figure 7.17 Local port-forwarding connections listening on port 3389, 5631, 5632, and 5901.  Secure Management with Windows Terminal Services and SSH  Once the SSH server has been established, you can attempt to log in to the Windows terminal server. To log in to the Windows terminal server, enter the following commands:  1. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ Terminal Services Client. 2. Enter 127.0.0.1 for the Server. 3. Select Connect.  Once the Terminal Services client connects to the loopback address on port 3389, the SSH connection will forward that request to the Windows terminal server over the encryption SSH tunnel. After the connection reaches the Win- dows terminal server, you should see the login display and be prompted for your password, as shown in Figure 7.18.   Notice that the loopback interface is holding the connection by the designa- tion of 127.0.0.1 in the upper left-hand corner in Figure 7.18. In order to log in, use your Windows terminal server or domain password given to you by your Windows administrator. After you have entered the correct password, you will view the desktop and have access to the operating system as if you were in front  of  the  computer  itself.  You  should  load  extra  copy-and-paste  utilities from Microsoft at the following Web address:  www.microsoft.com windows2000 techinfo reskit tools hotfixes   rdpclip-o.asp   254 Chapter 7  Once the utilities are loaded, you will be able to drag and drop files from the terminal services session to your local machine over the SSH tunnel, making remote management and file transfer available with just one shot. The results should look like Figure 7.19.  Notice  the  127.0.0.1  address  in  the  upper  left-hand  corner  in  Figure  7.19. Also, notice the results of the ‘ipconfig’ command, which show the internal address of the Windows terminal server. At this point, any usage of the oper- ating system can be done, including managing other operating systems, from this terminal, which occurs over a secure and encrypted SSH tunnel.  This scenario allows you to use Windows terminal services over an encrypted  SSH tunnel over the Internet.   Figure 7.18 Windows terminal session over an SSH tunnel.   Secure Remote Access 255  Figure 7.19 Results of Windows terminal services with SSH.  Secure Management with VNC and SSH  Once the SSH server has been established, you can attempt to log in to the Linux  VNC  server.  To  log  in  to  the  Linux  VNC  server,  enter  the  following  commands:  1. Change directories to the VNCviewer program  vncviewer.exe .  2. Type the following command:  vncviewer localhost:1 This command connects the vncviewer client on port 5901 to the local- host.  3. Select OK.  Once  vncviewer  connects  to  the  loopback  address  on  port  5901,  the  SSH connection will forward that request to the Linux VNC server over the encryp- tion  SSH  tunnel.  After  the  connection  reaches  the  Linux  VNC  server,  you should see the login display and be prompted for your session password, as shown in Figure 7.20.   256 Chapter 7  Figure 7.20 The vncviewer VNC client.  Notice that the loopback interface is used in Figure 7.20. In order to log in, you need to use your VNC server password given to you by your VNC administra- tor, shown at the bottom of Figure 7.20. After you have entered the correct pass- word, you will view the desktop and have access to the operating system as if you were in front of the computer itself. The results should look like Figure 7.21.  Figure 7.21 The results of the Linux VNC server with SSH.    Secure Remote Access 257  Again, notice the localhost.localdomain:1 in the upper left-hand corner in Figure  7.21,  designating  that  the  connection  is  on  the  loopback  interface  127.0.0.1 . Also, notice the results of the ‘ifconfig -a’ command, which shows the internal address of the Linux VNC server. At this point, any usage of the operating system can be done, including managing other operating systems, from this terminal over a secure and encrypted SSH tunnel.  This scenario allows anyone to use a Linux VNC server over an encrypted  SSH tunnel over the Internet.   Secure Management with pcAnywhere and SSH  Once the SSH server has been established, you can attempt to log in to the pcAnywhere server. The process to log in to the pcAnywhere Server is similar to the one used in the other two examples; however, a couple of changes need to be made on the pcAnywhere server. Since pcAnywhere uses TCP ports 5631 and 5632, there is no problem port forwarding both of those ports in one SSH session. Also,  pcAnywhere  uses  UDP port  5632,  which  cannot  be  tunneled over the SSH session. Therefore, you must disable the use of UDP 5632 on the pcAnywhere  server.  To  turn  off  UDP port  5632  on  the  pcAnywhere  server, enter  the  following  commands  on  the  pcAnywhere  server  and  the pcAnywhere client:  1. Open regedit, and select Start ➪ Run ➪ 2. Browse to the following registry key:  regedit.exe.    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Symantec\pcANYWHERE\  CurrentVersion\System  3. Add a DWORD value with the following contents:    Value Name: TCPIPConnectIfUnknown   Value Data: 1  4. After making the registry changes on both the pcAnywhere server and  pcAnywhere client, reboot both machines.   5. On the pcAnywhere client machine, open pcAnywhere. Enter Start ➪  Programs ➪ pcAnywhere. 6. Select the Remotes button. 7. Enter File ➪ New. 8. Select the Setting tab. 9. Enter 127.0.0.1 for the “Network host PC to control or IP address:”  option, as shown in Figure 7.22.         258 Chapter 7  Figure 7.22 “Network host PC to control or IP address” option.  10. Select OK. 11. Name the session pcAnywhere Server. 12. Double-click the new pcAnywhere icon, and you should now be dis-  playing the pcAnywhere connection over the secure SSH session.  Once the pcAnywhere client connects to the loopback address on ports 5631 and 5632, the SSH connection will forward that request to the pcAnywhere server  over  the  encryption  SSH  tunnel.  After  the  connection  reaches  the pcAnywhere  server,  you  should  see  the  login  display  and  be  prompted  for your  password.  In  order  to  log  in,  use  your  pcAnywhere  server  password given to you by your pcAnywhere administrator. After you have entered the correct password, you will view the desktop and have access to the operating system as if you were in front of the computer itself. The results should look like Figure 7.23.  Again,  notice  the  results  of  the  ipconfig  command,  which  should  be  the internal  address  of  the  pcAnywhere  server. At  this  point,  any  usage  of  the operating system can be done, including managing other operating systems, from this terminal over a secure and encrypted SSH tunnel.  This scenario allows us to use a pcAnywhere server over an encrypted SSH  tunnel over the Internet.    Secure Remote Access 259  Figure 7.23 The results of the pcAnywhere server with SSH.  Secure VPN with SSH  PPP over SSH   This section discusses the ability to use PPP  Point-to-Point Protocol  over an SSH connection as a fully functional virtual private networking  VPN  solu- tion. If you look at traditional VPN implementations, such as IPSec implemen- tations, PPP over SSH offers almost everything that other implementations do. For  example,  SSH  offers  strong  encryption  with  3DES,  Point-to-Point   PPP  access, and the ability to provide multiple tunnels between two different net- works. Furthermore, unlike other VPN solutions, PPP over SSH as a VPN solu- tion does not require a significant cost for hardware appliances or software licensing, does not require significant support requirements, and has the abil- ity  to  adapt  to  your  existing  network  without  any  major  re-architectural requirements. The advantages just mentioned, as well as many others, make PPP over  SSH  an  ideal  VPN  solution  for  many  small  to  mid-tier  types  of  networks.   PPP over SSH does not involve port forwarding but instead uses simple PPP  scripts. Figure 7.24 shows a typical PPP architecture with an SSH server.   260 Chapter 7  SSH PPP Client  72.12.8.15  SSH PPP Server  11.30.11.21   ssh.ppp.server.com   2 2  Internet  Router  Firewall  Figure 7.24 The SSH PPP server architecture.  Internal Network  In  the  architecture  shown  in  Figure  7.24,  the  SSH  server  is  also  the  PPP server, which is a Linux RedHat 8.0 server running OpenSSH. Furthermore, the client in the example is a regular RedHat 8.0 client machine, with no ser- vices  installed  or  running.  No  special  changes  are  required  on  the  firewall, except a rule that allows connections on port 22 to the SSH PPP server. Once an SSH PPP client makes that connection, it will have a VPN inside the inter- nal network.   PPP Daemon on the Server First, you must ensure the PPP daemon  pppd  is loaded and functional on your SSH server. If you are using Linux Redhat 8.0 or higher, the PPP daemon should work just fine out of the box. To confirm, type the following commands on the server:  cd  usr sbin pppd  If you see something similar to the following on the server, you know that the PPP daemon is working correctly. The PPP daemon spits out information to the screen that is not readable to end-users, but actually confirms that the PPP daemon is running correctly. The following is just an excerpt from the out- put of the PPP daemon:  ~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } }%}&}”-1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } }%}&}”-1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} }} } }%}&}”-1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } }%}&}” 1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } }%}&}”-1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!}    Secure Remote Access 261  VPN User and Sudo Next, you must configure a user to run the pppd service. Many users choose to create a separate user account other than root, such as vpnmonkey, to execute the PPP daemon. The use of sudo ensures that remote VPN users will not have full root access to the PPP SSH server, which would decrease the security pos- ture of the remote access solution. If this is the route you are taking also, make sure you allow the vpnmonkey account to execute the pppd service by editing the sudoers file. Also, make sure you have set up the appropriate public-key authentication requirements for the vpnmonkey account, discussed in Chap- ter 4. However, to quickly refresh, make sure the public-key file  identity.pub  for  the  vpnmonkey  account  is  in  the  authorized  key  file  on  the  SSH PPP server    home vpnmonkey .ssh authorized_keys .  Furthermore,  edit  the sudoers file on the SSH PPP server   etc sudoers  and allow vpnmonkey to start the PPP daemon. The contents of the sudoers file on the server should look like this:  To verify that su and sudo work correctly and have been configured appro-  priately, type the following commands on the server:  Cmnd_Alias VPN= usr sbin pppd vpnmonkey ALL=NOPASSWD: VPN  su vpnmonkey sudo  usr sbin pppd noauth  If things are working correctly under sudo, you should see the following on the server, which is the PPP daemon spitting out information to the screen that is not readable to end-users, but actually confirms that the PPP daemon is run- ning correctly. The following is just an excerpt of the output of the PPP daemon:  ~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } }%}&}”-1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } }%}&}”-1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} }} } }%}&}”-1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } }%}&}” 1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!} }4}”}&} } } } }%}&}”-1L}’}”} }”e”~~ }_!}!}!}  Client Script  Next, you must configure a script on the VPN client to use SSH for the PPP connection.  This  script  was  originally  created  on  www.linuxorg.org  by authors of that site.   Before editing the script, you must define the variables that will need to be customized  according  to  the  architecture.  According  to  Figure  7.24,  your server  hostname  will  be  ssh.ppp.server.com,  your  server  username  will  be   262 Chapter 7  vpnmonkey,  your  server  IP address  will  be  11.30.11.21,  and  your  client  IP address will be 72.12.8.l5. The specific entries to modify are SERVER_HOST- NAME, SERVER_USERNAME, SERVER_IFIPADDR, and CLIENT_IFIPADDR. Now that you have established the variables, you can use these variables in  the script, as the following script shows in bold:  ! bin sh   usr local bin vpn-pppssh   This script initiates a ppp-ssh vpn connection.  see the VPN PPP-SSH HOWTO on http:  www.linuxdoc.org for more information.   revision history:  1.6 11-Nov-1996 miquels@cistron.nl  1.7 20-Dec-1999 bart@jukie.net  2.0 16-May-2001 bronson@trestle.com    You will need to change these variables...    The host name or IP address of the SSH server that we are  sending the connection request to: SERVER_HOSTNAME=ssh.ppp.server.com   The username on the VPN server that will run the tunnel.  For security reasons, this should NOT be root.  Any user  that can use PPP can intitiate the connection on the client  SERVER_USERNAME=vpnmonkey   The VPN network interface on the server should use this address: SERVER_IFIPADDR=11.30.11.21   ...and on the client, this address: CLIENT_IFIPADDR=72.12.8.15   This tells ssh to use unprivileged high ports, even though it’s  running as root. This way, you don’t have to punch custom holes  through your firewall. LOCAL_SSH_OPTS=”-P”    The rest of this file should not need to be changed.

After  the  script  is  executable,  enter  the  following command on the client to use the wee-pee-en script and access the SSH VPN server over a trusted VPN connection:  wee-pee-en start  If all goes well, you should see the following on the client:  Using interface ppp1 Connect: ppp1    dev pts 1 local IP address 11.30.11.21 remote IP address 72.12.8.15  To disable the VPN, type the following on the client:  wee-pee-en stop  That’s it! This scenario allows anyone to use a PPP over an encrypted SSH  connection to create a secure VPN session over the Internet.  Summary  Using some of the basic techniques discussed in the last chapter, combined with some advanced techniques described in this chapter, has allowed us to use SSH as a fully fledged remote access solution that can support popular remote access demands, such as e-mail, file transfer, and management. While the configurations of each of these remote access demands slightly differ, the basic principles of port forwarding apply to each of them.  Port forwarding is a powerful and very useful feature of SSH that almost overshadows the terminal access that it provides. In fact, many SSH solutions deployed in networks today are being deployed more for their port-forwarding capabilities than for their remote terminal access capabilities. Furthermore, the flexibility of SSH, which allows it to be used from both NAT’d networks and non-NAT’d networks, makes it a very attractive remote access solution that can support end-user security in any type of network environment, whether it is from a hotel room, a home office, a customer site, a data center, or even a wireless network at your local coffee shop.  The use of other applications, such as Outlook Express, Netscape Messen- ger, and Eudora, with SSH allows SSH to mitigate and solve security concerns in other entities. In addition to securing other applications, the use of SSH with existing, required, or standard protocols, such as SMB and NFSallow, allow it to interoperate with existing networks quite easily with little to no effect on the   Secure Remote Access 265  end-user. Lastly, its ability to support GUI applications allows SSH to provide a truly secure remote management solution for the remote administrator.   Basic port forwarding and advance techniques allow SSH to be a fully func- tional  and  very  inexpensive  remote  access  solution  that  cannot  be  matched with  any  other  service,  device,  or  protocol.  Now  that  you  fully  understand port forwarding, I will shift gears to other uses of SSH, such as general proto- col replacement. In the next chapter, I will discuss how SSH should be used instead of various other dangerous protocols, such as insecure “R” protocols.    PA R T  Three  Protocol Replacement    C H A P T E R8  SSH Versatility  SSH is a very versatile utility. Aside from all the uses I have discussed thus far, SSH also provides the following functionality in a secure manner:  Terminal access File transfer  SFTP  Secure chat Secure backups  This chapter discusses many of the versatilities of SSH. Some of the utilities previously  listed  are  basic  and  come  installed  with  a  default  installation  of SSH, such as terminal access and file sharing with the Secure File Transfer Pro- tocol  SFTP . SSH can be used in conjunction with other utilities listed previ- ously  that  are  common  in  many  network  architectures  but  not  necessarily secure, such as chat and backups.  This chapter demonstrates how SSH can be used to replace several other protocols, many of which are insecure protocols that greatly decrease the secu- rity  posture  of  a  network  environment.  For  example,  SSH  can  be  used  to replace the dangerous protocols listed in Table 8.1.  269                   270 Chapter 8  Table 8.1 Protocols That SSH Can Replace for Stronger Security  SSH UTILITY  PROTOCOL  SSH  Terminal Access   RSH, Rlogin, Rexec  SFTP  SSH with Chat  SSH with Backups  FTP, SMB, NFS, RCP  IRC  RSync  Terminal Access  One of the most basic uses of SSH that I have only implied thus far is SSH ter- minal access. One of the primary reasons to install SSH is to provide secure ter- minal access. In order to replace the dangerous Berkeley R-protocols such as RSH and Rlogin, SSH needs to be used. Furthermore, if other terminal emula- tors such as Telnet are used in addition to the Berkeley R-protocols, the level of security across a network environment will be greatly reduced. SSH not only provides the same level of access that RSH, Rlogin, and Telnet do, but it does so in a secure manner through two-factor authentication, advanced authoriza- tion, and strong encryption.  SSH is often deployed for its secure terminal access, aside from the other features such as port forwarding and SFTP discussed in the next section. When dealing with remote management issues across the Internet or even insecure internal networks, Telnet, RSH, rexec, and Rlogin can and will cripple an orga- nization’s security infrastructure by allowing any passive user from gaining access  to  sensitive  information,  such  as  usernames,  passwords,  directory structures, and so on.  For example, RSH, Rlogin, and Rexec are clear-text protocols that provide some type of remote terminal emulation or remote execution service. All three of  these  protocols  can  be  sniffed  with  any  traffic  analyzer  that  can  reveal authentication  and  authorization  information  to  an  unauthorized  user.  This can potentially allow unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive authenti- cation  information  and  either  log  in  to  systems  and or  devices  or  execute remote commands in an unauthorized fashion.   SSH Versatility 271  The following examples show a traffic analyzer program that will sniff the connections among four protocols: RSH, Rlogin, Rexec, and finally the SSH connection. The examples show how the use of three insecure protocols basi- cally provides no security and how the use of SSH not only brings a great deal of security, but also provides the same level of functionality. The architecture for the example is shown in Figure 8.1.  Compromising a System with Remote Shell  RSH  The first example will address RSH  Remote Shell . This section will not go into the specifics of RSH, because you will never use it after reading this sec- tion,  but  some  basics  need  to  be  covered.  RSH  is  the  client  end  of  a  client- server relationship, which works with an RSH server  rshd , usually listening on port 514. RSH executes a remote command on a remote RSH server as if the command came from the machine itself. The RSH client uses a username and password that he or she must have on the server running the RSH server. For example,  all  usernames  and  passwords  in  the  Unix  password  file,  etc passwd  or   etc shadow,  will  be  allowed  to  authenticate  to  the  RSH server with their system credentials. This issue with RSH, as I have already discussed, is that the RSH protocol is clear-text, so anyone sniffing the wire can obtain username and password information of the user’s account on the sys- tem. Once an unauthorized user obtains the information, the system is virtu- ally compromised. See Figure 8.2 for a sniffer program that captures the RSH connection.  RSH  RLOGIN  REXEC  SSH  Client  Server  Figure 8.1 Sample architecture for terminal access with RSH, Rlogin, Telnet, and SSH.   272 Chapter 8  Figure 8.2 Sniffer capturing an RSH connection.  Compromising a System with Remote Login  Rlogin  Remote Login  Rlogin  is also a client server technology wherein the client, Rlogin, connects to an Rlogin server  Rlogind , usually listening on port 513. Rlogin starts a remote terminal session on a system, usually an operating sys- tem or device, running the rlogin server. Rlogin also uses the username and password information from the Unix password file, such as  etc passwd or  etc shadow. In addition to using the password file, Rlogin uses the rhosts file, which has a list of IP addresses that are authorized to log in to the server. As with RSH, Rlogin has connections that are in clear-text, which allows a pas- sive attacker to sniff the connection and access the username, password, and IP address in order to make a valid connection. Once an unauthorized user obtains the information, the system is virtually compromised. See Figure 8.3 for a sniffer program that captures the Rlogin connection.   SSH Versatility 273  Figure 8.3 Sniffer capturing an Rlogin connection.  Compromising a System with Remote Execution  Rexec  Remote  Execution   Rexec   is  also  a  client server  technology  wherein  the client, Rexec, connects to a rexec server  Rexecd , usually listening on port 512. Rexec executes a remote command on a remote Rexec server as if the com- mand came from the machine itself. Rexec also uses the username and pass- word  information  from  the  Unix  password  file,  such  as   etc passwd  or  etc shadow. As with RSH, Rexec has connections that are in clear-text, which allows a passive attacker to sniff the connection and access the username and password  information  on  the  remote  operating  system  or  device.  Once  an unauthorized  user  obtains  the  information,  the  system  is  virtually  compro- mised.

Why Access via SSH Is Better After learning about the insecurities of RSH, Rlogin, and Rexec, you should now  understand  why  utilities  such  as  SSH  were  developed  and  widely adopted.  The  use  of  RSH,  Rlogin,  and  Rexec  in  any  hostile  environment, whether  it  be  the  Internet,  an  internal  network,  a  DMZ  environment,  an extranet, or even a local network, will cause a lot of security issues for a given network. In order to protect against the basic flaws of the protocols mentioned previously, SSH should be used. While RSH, Rlogin, and Rexec provide mod- erately different functions, all three of the utilities’ primary functions is to pro- vide the execution of a command on a remote server, either through a local terminal session or a remote execution service. SSH can eliminate the need for all three of these utilities by providing the same, if not better, remote execution service or terminal sessions with an encrypted and secure connection. Unlike RSH, Rlogin, and Rexec, SSH is not a clear-text protocol, so if passive attackers were sniffing the network, they would not be able to gain or view any useful   SSH Versatility 275  information, such as username and passwords. The connection is completely encrypted,  from  the  time  the  user  is  authenticated  to  the  time  the  session  is closed. See Figure 8.5 to view a sniffer program that captures an SSH connection. Notice how Figure 8.5 is quite different from Figures 8.4, 8.3, and even 8.2. While all four utilities  RSH, Rlogin, Rexec, and SSH  offer the same type of access, the protocols they use are quite different. Furthermore, the end result of all four utilities is a remote execution. There are no added advantages to using Rlogin over SSH, aside from the fact that some end-users may be used to the older  insecure  protocol.  Furthermore,  if  a  remote  terminal  session  is  not desired, just remote execution, both RSH and Rexec can be used with SSH in order  to  secure  the  connection.  The  use  of  remote  commands  instead  of  a remote terminal session may be required for night backup processes; there- fore, Rexec with SSH, which will be discussed later in this chapter, is also a stronger alternative than Rexec alone.

Standard protocols such as FTP  File Transfer Protocol , Microsoft’s SMB  Server Message Block , and NFS  Network File System  are probably the most popular methods of transferring files within most organi- zations. Despite the popularity of these three protocols, all have many security problems.  FTP and  NFS  are  clear-text  protocols  that  have  several  security issues,  including  clear-text  transmission  of  authentication   username pass- word  information.  Unlike the last section, this section will not discuss the issues with FTP, NFS, or SMB, but rather discuss how to use SSH’s file transfer subsystem  Secure File Transfer  and a secure file-sharing method. I assume that you are some- what aware of the security problems with FTP, NFS, and SMB and proceed with how to develop a secure solution.  Secure File Transfer Protocol  SFTP  is a subsystem used with SSH. SFTP is very similar to FTP; however, it offers the ability to transfer files to and from an SFTP server  SSH server  to or from an SFTP client over a secure encryption connection. SFTP and FTP both use client server architecture, but SFTP carries with  it  a  performance  penalty  that  you  will  endure,  as  the  packets  are encrypted before they are sent over the wire. Often, however, this performance penalty may be negligible, especially when the extra security gained in using SFTP is factored in.  Each  installation  of  SSH  version  2  has  the  SFTP subsystem  available  and functioning by default. There are no extra steps required on the SSH server in order to start the SFTP subsystem after a default installation; the SFTP subsys- tem is built right into the service and will respond on the selected port chosen for SSH, such as port 22. Despite the fact that all three major providers of SSH, including  OpenSSH,  SSH  Communications,  and  VanDyke  Software,  enable the SFTP subsystem by default, there are different features of each installation that may affect your decision-making process. The following section discusses the  different  SFTP installations,  as  well  as  the  specific  features  of  each  in regard to four main uses of SFTP:    General setup and use of SFTP SFTP for management purposes SFTP for corporate file-sharing  file access controls  SFTP for authorized system users  user access controls                  SSH Versatility 277  This overview will allow you to understand the general uses of SFTP and also  allow  your  decision-making  process  to  be  as  informed  as  possible, depending on your business and security requirements for SFTP.  SFTP with the OpenSSH SFTP Server The OpenSSH SFTP subsystem is a great solution when requiring the secure transfer of file and folders from one machine to the next. As stated earlier, the use of the SFTP subsystem is enabled by default on the OpenSSH server; no special or additional steps are required. To ensure that the SFTP subsystem has been enabled, open the sshd_config file on the SSH server and scroll all the way to the bottom of the file. The SFTP subsystem information should be at the very end. Enter the following command to view the SFTP subsystem informa- tion in OpenSSH’s configuration file:  cd  etc ssh  more sshd_config  The following syntax should be at the end of the sshd_config file:   override default of no subsystems Subsystem    sftp    usr libexec openssh sftp-server  If the SFTP is not desired and only the use of the SSH service  shell or port forwarding access  is desired, the SFTP subsystem can be easily disabled by commenting out the “Subsystem SFTP” line. For example, in order to disable the  SFTP subsystem  in  OpenSSH,  make  sure  the  last  two  lines  of  your sshd_config file look like the following:   override default of no subsystems  Subsystem sftp     usr libexec openssh sftp-server  Since you want to use the SFTP subsystem, make sure it is enabled  uncom- mented  in your  etc ssh sshd_config file. Now that you understand how to enable disable the SFTP subsystem, examine the different ways you can use it with OpenSSH.  Using OpenSSH for Management Purposes  First, I will discuss OpenSSH in terms of management purposes. Using any SFTP client,  such  as  the  command-line  version  that  comes  with  OpenSSH  sftp , you can make a connection to an SFTP server to download files in a secure fashion. For example, if you want to copy the file called Commodore- Vic20.txt from the SFTP server, which has an IP address of 172.16.11.17, enter the following commands with your OpenSSH SFTP client:   278 Chapter 8  sftp 172.16.11.17 –p 22 –l   get CommodoreVic20.txt exit  Similarly, to upload a file to the SSH server, such as a file called Pitfall.txt,  enter the following commands:  sftp 172.16.11.17 –p 22 –l   put Pitfall.txt exit  As with FTP, the command-line SFTP client will download or upload files to and  from  the  clients’  local  directory;  however,  it  will  be  conducted  over  an encrypted session. In this case, OpenSSH is a very strong alternative for gen- eral  management  purposes  for  most  organizations.  Root-level  users  cannot only log in to an OpenSSH server for command-line access, but they can use the SFTP subsystem to transfer important and sensitive files and directories in a secure and easy fashion.  Using OpenSSH for File Sharing  To provide the use of the SFTP subsystem in a complementary fashion to SSH, valid  accounts  have  to  be  made  on  the  operating  system,  since  SSH  uses  operating-system accounts, not their own specific SSH accounts. That being the case, having an account on the operating system means the account has the right to the system’s files also, such as  etc ,  usr sbin,  var, and so on. Even if the purpose of the account is to transfer files securely to from  tmp share, the account, because it is an operating-system account, has inherent rights to the operating system itself.   In a file-server situation, you may not want to expose the operating system directories  or  the  entire  directory  architecture  for  SFTP access,  but  rather  a folder  or  two  for  general  organization-wide  file  sharing.  For  example,  you may  not  want  all  users  to  download  a  copy  of   etc passwd  but  only  files  in  a  specified  directory,  such  as  their  home  directory  or  a  directory  called  tmp share. In this case, the use of file access controls should be used.   By default, there are no access control permissions on the SFTP subsystem; all file access permission relies on the native operation system permission. In the Unix world, all access control permissions for SFTP will be controlled by the  Read Write Execute  values  placed  by  the  files  and  folders  themselves.  In the Windows world, the file access permissions for SFTP will be controlled by the NTFS access controls.   You need to place appropriate access control permission on the operating system, not just rely on the SFTP subsystem. If proper access controls are not   SSH Versatility 279  placed on either operating system, an SFTP client might be capable of travers- ing outside the desired SFTP folder through the use of symbolic links on the system or just plainly having those rights inertly form the operating system itself.   No matter whether SSH is used for management purposes or for file-sharing purposes, file access controls should be in place to restrict users to only their home directory or a defined SFTP folder. To place appropriate file access con- trols, you need to use operating-system utilities as opposed to SSH utilities. Tools such as chmod for Unix and Cacls.exe for Windows can be used to place permission on individual files and folders. As you may have already guessed, this endeavor can be an exhaustive challenge, since all the sensitive files for an entire operating system need to be protected. Furthermore, some files, such as  etc passwd, need to be readable to all accounts on the system, whether they are  root-level  accounts  or  just  regular  user  accounts,  which  may  not  be  the ideal situation.  Since there is no function with OpenSSH to restrict SFTP access to a limited number of files, aside from the operating system’s access control, OpenSSH is a  very  moderate  solution  for  general  file  sharing  for  low-level  or  non- root non-admin  level  users.  Since  file-sharing  servers  will  need  to  provide access to several users and protect the operating system itself from these users, using OpenSSH’s SFTP subsystem will be a cumbersome process.  Authorizing Users with OpenSSH  Lastly,  I  will  discuss  OpenSSH  in  terms  of  authorized  system  users.  In  all OpenSSH installations, all users on the operating system, such as the list of users in the  etc passwd file, will be allowed to log in to the service, unless specifically denied. With OpenSSH, specific accounts can be allowed to log in or  they  may  simply  be  denied  access,  despite  having  an  account  in  etc passwd. This limitation allows the OpenSSH architecture to restrict the users who have SSH SFTP access to a specific list of accounts. This list can include all accounts in  etc passwd, which is the default, or just a subset of the accounts.   For example, if there are 500 accounts that have access to a machine running OpenSSH, possibly by using an NIS architecture, but only 80 of those accounts need  access  to  the  operating  system  itself,  OpenSSH  can  allow  or  deny SSH SFTP access by specifying account names and or account variables that are authorized to log in.   If the purpose of the SFTP subsystem is to allow all users in the Engineering Department to access, upload, and download files to and from the operating system, adding the group ‘Engineering’ as the only group that can use SSH or SFTP is  a  relatively  easy  process.  Furthermore,  if  the  Engineering  accounts   280 Chapter 8  only need access to their home directory, without using the SFTP subsystem  as  a  file  server  but  rather  as  a  complementary  tool  to  SSH  terminal  access, OpenSSH is a strong alternative.   For  example,  say  the  Engineering  Department  regularly  needs  to  transfer files, such as compiled binaries, source code, or configuration files, to and from the home directory. If they are using SSH for secure terminal access, transferring files with NFS, FTP, or even remote copy  RCP  would be counterproductive. The security they would gain from the encrypted SSH connection would be can- celled out by the insecurity of the NFS, FTP, and RCP sessions. In this scenario, the  OpenSSH  SFTP subsystem  is  a  great  alternative  to  NFS,  FTP,  and  RCP. Unlike the SFTP file-server model, SFTP does not add insecurity to the operating system, since all the accounts on the system are using the operating system itself, which  includes  all  the  directories,  binaries,  and  configuration  files,  not  just accounts that should have access to one folder on the system, which is more dif- ficult  to  restrict.  In  other  words,  all  these  accounts  are  authorized  to  roam around the operating system according to their account type, which includes viewing files from the command line or transferring files from SFTP.  OpenSSH on Windows and Cygdrive  Using OpenSSH on Windows is similar to, if not the same as, using OpenSSH on Unix. OpenSSH with Windows carries the same general recommendations as  OpenSSH  with  Unix,  specifically  a  strong  solution  for  management  pur- poses  and  authorized  system-user  purposes.  But  transferring  files  on OpenSSH for Windows is not a good idea, because of permission issues of sen- sitive  operating  system  files  and or  directories.  That  being  said,  one  item  I need to mention is the use of cygdrive as an SFTP root directory. In order to specify a directory that is not the default for the root of the SSH or SFTP sub- system, the use of the term cygdrive is required. For example, if the root direc- tory e:\ is desired on a Windows operating system that has a C, D, and an E drive, your passwd file in your Program Files\OpenSSH\bin will look like the following:  Administrator:: cygdrive e::  While all SFTP users are redirected to the e:\ volume, which may be the core SFTP directory, they are not restricted to e:\. This means that while the users’ SFTP shell will begin at e:\, if they specify that they would like to access c:\ with their SFTP client, they will be allowed access to c:\, given that they have the NTFS permissions to do so. This reason, among several others, is why the author of the OpenSSH port to Windows stresses the fact that it should only be used for administrative purposes, since file-system security is enforced not by the  OpenSSH  SFTP subsystem  but  by  the  native  NTFS  permissions  on  the operating system.   SSH Versatility 281  SFTP with VanDyke Software VShell VanDyke’s VShell SSH server is an excellent solution when requiring the use of the SFTP subsystem. As with OpenSSH’s SFTP subsystem, no extra steps are required to enable the SFTP subsystem on the VShell SSH server. Unlike with OpenSSH,  with  Vshell  there  is  no  direct  on off  switch  for  the  SFTP server; instead, two methods are used to enable or disable it. By default, the SFTP sub- system is enabled and allows everyone unrestricted access. In order to disable it, two items must be configured: access control and SFTP options. You can dis- able SFTP access for specific users on access control and you can limit access to SFTP folders with SFTP options. Both options don’t really disable the SFTP subsystem, but restrict it to specific users. These options provide more granu- larity when configuring VShell’s SFTP subsystem. To verify that VShell’s SFTP subsystem has been enabled, complete the following steps:  1. Go to Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell. 2. Highlight the Access Control section. 3. Select the Allow checkbox in the SFTP row for the appropriate  account s .   4. Select Apply. 5. Highlight the SFTP section. 6. Ensure the appropriate users are enabled to have access to appropriate accounts. The default is to allow everyone to have full access to all files and directories.   7. Select Apply.  Now that the SFTP subsystem has been enabled, examine VShell in terms of  management, file transfer, and authorized user access.  Using VShell for Management Purposes  First, I will discuss VShell in terms of management purposes. Using any SFTP client, such as VanDyke Software’s SecureFX or SSH Communications’ SSH client, you can make a connection to an SFTP server to download files in a secure  fashion.  For  example,  if  you  want  to  copy  the  file  called  Neeraja.txt from the SFTP server, which has an IP address of 172.16.6.12, you will com- plete the following commands with your SSH Communications’ SSH client:   SSH Communications ➪  1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Select Quick Connect. 3. Type 172.16.6.12 for the Host Name. 4. Type the name of the appropriate account for the User Name field.  Secure File Transfer Client.   282 Chapter 8  5. Specify the port number in the Port Number field; the default is 22. 6. Select Password for the Authentication Method. 7. Select Connect. 8. Enter the correct password when prompted by the SFTP client.  9. That’s it! You can now drag and drop files to from the SFTP server  with a Windows Explorer type of client. All files transferred from the SFTP client to the SFTP server, using drag and drop, copy and paste, or the option in the menu bar, are all encrypted.  Similarly, to upload a file to the SSH server, you can use the drag-and-drop,  copy-and-paste, or the menu bar options.  As with FTP GUI clients, the GUI SFTP client can download or upload files to  and  from  the  clients’  local  directory  to  and  from  the  SSH  server  using  a encrypted session. In this case, VShell’s SFTP server is a very good solution for general  management  purposes  for  most  organizations.  Administrator-level users can log in to an SSH server for command-line access and also use the SFTP subsystem to transfer important and sensitive files and directories in a secure and easy fashion.  Using VShell for File Sharing  Next, I will discuss VShell in terms of file sharing. As with OpenSSH, operat- ing system accounts are used with VShell to provide the use of the SFTP sub- system  in  a  complementary  fashion  to  SSH.  Having  an  account  on  the operating system, even if the account is only going to be used for SFTP, means that the account may have the right to access, modify, or read sensitive files on the  operating  system  according  to  the  NTFS  permissions,  such  as  \winnt, \winnt\system32, and \winnt\repair.  If  the  purpose  of  the  VShell  SFTP server  is  file  sharing  only,  all  VShell accounts will still have rights to other parts of the operating system because they are operating-system accounts. In a file-server situation, you might not want to expose the operating system directories or the entire directory archi- tecture for SFTP access; instead, you might want to expose just a root folder for general organization-wide file sharing. For example, you might not want all users  to  download  a  copy  of  \winnt\repair\sam;  instead,  you  might  want them to download only files in a specified directory such as d:\share. In this   SSH Versatility 283  case, the SFTP access control features of VShell should be used. In order to allow access to only the d:\share folder, which can be the root directory on the corporate  file  server,  to  all  accounts  on  the  system,  complete  the  following steps:  1. Go to Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell. 2. Highlight the SFTP section. 3. Under SFTP options, select Add. 4. For the SFTP root field, type d:\share or simply browse to it using the  ... button.  5. Type CorpFileServer for Alias. 6. Select Add on the right hand section. 7. Add the Everyone group. 8. Choose OK. 9. Select Apply.  Now all accounts on the operating system, or the domain, can have SFTP access to the D:\share directory. In order to ensure that access to the rest of the operating system is denied, complete the following steps:  1. Highlight the   option in the SFTP section and select Edit. 2. Remove all accounts, including Everyone and any other accounts that  exist.  4. Select Apply.  3. Enter any accounts, such as the administrator account, that you would like to provide full SFTP access to the system. If no accounts need to be added, select OK.  Now  no  accounts,  or  only  the  administrator  account,  have  unrestricted access. Furthermore, every other account on the system or domain only has access to D:\share, despite whatever NTFS permissions that account has. The VShell access control lists override the NTFS permissions on the VShell server when using SSH or SFTP subsystem. Figures 8.6 and 8.7 show the final result.   284 Chapter 8  Figure 8.6 VShell SFTP file-server permission for the Everyone group.  Figure 8.7 VShell SFTP file-server permission for the Administrators group.  In addition to restricting access to certain directories without the need for any  operating  system  access  control  lists   ACLs ,  VShell  can  also  permit  restrict access to the SFTP subsystem to specific accounts. For example, if you   SSH Versatility 285  want to allow everyone to have access to the SSH server as a corporate file server only,  using  the  SFTP subsystem,  but  no  command-line  or  port-forwarding access, this can be easily set with VShell by performing the following steps:  1. Choose the Access Control section. 2. Click Add. 3. Select the Everyone group and select OK. 4. Keep the Everyone group highlighted, and select Logon and SFTP for  the Allow permissions.  5. Keep the Everyone group highlighted, and select Shell, Remote Execu-  tion, Port Forwarding, and Remote Port Forwarding under the Deny permissions. 6. Select Apply.  Now all accounts on the operating system or domain can access only the SFTP subsystem, with no access to the command prompt or port forwarding. Figure 8.8 shows the configuration settings.  As with the SFTP section, you can still allow the administrator account to have access to everything, if you want it to. Figure 8.9 shows the administrator account configuration settings.  Figure 8.8 Access Control settings for the Everyone group.   286 Chapter 8  Figure 8.9 Access Control settings for the administrator account.  Using  the  preceding  configuration,  all  users  on  the  operating  system  or domain  will  only  be  able  to  securely  transfer  files  with  the  corporate  file server, while the administrator, or any equivalent accounts, will still have full access to the VShell server and underlying operating system.   Since VShell offers the ability to restrict operating-system accounts to only specific directories using SFTP, without the need for NTFS permissions, VShell is a very excellent alternative for general file sharing for all users or corporate file servers. In fact, using VShell’s SSH server as a corporate file server is an excellent solution, because it offers the ability to conduct the following:  FTP Windows Explorer type of GUI access    Drag-and-drop and copy-and-paste capabilities  Easy file system security maintenance     No NTFS permissions required, ensuring full security to the operating  system and other directories Encryption Security  Since file-sharing servers need to provide access to several hundred accounts while not allowing any access to the operating system itself, use of VanDyke Software’s SFTP subsystem offers a simple, straightforward, and very flexible solution. For more information on secure file servers, see Chapter 10.                       SSH Versatility 287  Authorizing Users with VShell  Lastly,  I  will  discuss  VShell  in  terms  of  authorized  system  users.  Typically, VShell installations allow all users on the operating system to log in to the ser- vice,  which  is  the  default.  With  VShell,  however,  specific  accounts  can  be denied SSH SFTP access, despite their having an account on the system, as shown in the previous example. A specific list of users who have access can include all accounts, which is the default, or a subset of the accounts.   To illustrate, suppose 500 accounts have access to a machine running VShell, possibly by using a domain architecture, but only 72 of those accounts need access  to  the  operating  system  itself.  VShell  can  allow  or  deny  SSH SFTP access by specifying account names and or account variables that are autho- rized to log in. If the purpose of the SFTP subsystem is to allow all users in the Engineering Department to access, upload, and download files to and from the operating system, adding the group Engineering as the only one that can use SSH or SFTP is a relatively easy process. Furthermore, if the Engineering accounts only need access to the d:\share directory, VShell is a good solution. For example, say the Engineering Department needs to transfer files, such as compiled binaries, source code, or configuration files, to and from the d:\share directory. If they are using SSH for secure terminal access, using SMB or FTP for file transfer would be counterproductive. The security they gain from the encrypted SSH connection is cancelled out by the insecurity of the SMB or FTP sessions.   SFTP with SSH Communications’ SSH Server SSH Communications’ SSH Server is also a great solution when requiring the use of the SFTP subsystem. No additional or extra steps are required to enable the SFTP subsystem on the SSH Communications’ SSH server. By default, the SFTP subsystem is enabled. In order to verify that the SSH Communications’ SFTP subsystem has been enabled, complete the following steps:   1. Go to Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Highlight the SFTP server. 3. Ensure the appropriate directories are enabled, such as the users’ home  SSH Secure Shell Server ➪ Configuration.  directory.   4. Select Apply.  Now that you have ensured that the SFTP subsystem is enabled, consider SSH Communications’ SSH server in terms of management, file transfer, and authorized user access.   288 Chapter 8  Using SSH Communications’ SSH Server for  Management Purposes  First, I will examine how SSH Communications’ SSH server is used for man- agement  purposes.  Using  any  SFTP client,  such  as  VanDyke  Software’s SecureFX or SSH Communications’ SSH client, a connection can be made to an SFTP server to download files in a secure fashion. For example, if you want to copy the file called Belwa.txt from the SFTP server, which has an IP address of 172.16.19.47, complete the following commands with your SSH Communica- tions’ SSH client:  1. Go to Start ➪ Programs ➪  SSH Communications ➪  Secure File Transfer  Client.  2. Select Quick Connect. 3. Type 172.16.1.19.47 for the Host Name. 4. Type the name of the appropriate account for the User Name field. 5. Specify the port number for the Port Number field, the default is 22. 6. Select Password for the Authentication Method. 7. Select Connect. 8. Enter the correct password when prompted by the SFTP client.   That’s it! You can now drag and drop files to and from the SFTP server with a Windows Explorer type of client. All files that are transferred from the SFTP client to the SFTP server, using drag and drop, copy and paste, or the option in the menu bar, are encrypted. Similarly, to upload a file to the SSH server, you can use the drag-and-drop, copy-and-paste, or the menu bar options.  As with FTP GUI clients, the GUI SFTP client with the SSH Communica- tions’ SSH server can download or upload files to and from the clients’ local directory to and from the SSH server using an encrypted session. In this case, SSH  Communications’  SFTP server  is  a  very  strong  alternative  for  general management purposes for most organizations. Administrator-level users can- not only log in to an SSH server for command-line access; they can also use the SFTP subsystem to transfer important and sensitive files and directories in a secure and easy fashion.    SSH Versatility 289  Using SSH Communications’ SSH Server for File Sharing  As with OpenSSH, with SSH, in order to provide the use of the SFTP subsys- tem in a complementary fashion to SSH, valid accounts have to be made on the operating system. They need to be made, as SSH Communications’ SSH server also uses operating system accounts, not their own specific SSH accounts. That being the case, having an account on the operating system means the account has rights to all files on the operating system that NTFS permissions allow, such as \winnt, \winnt\system32, and \winnt\repair. If the purpose of the SFTP server is for file sharing only, all SSH accounts will still have rights to other  parts  of  the  operating  system  because  they  are  operating-system accounts.   In a file-server situation, you may want users to have access to a root folder for general organization-wide file sharing but not want them to have exposure to the operating system directories or the entire directory architecture for SFTP access. For example, you may want users to be able to download files in a spec- ified directory such as d:\share but not want everyone to be able to download a copy of \winnt\repair\sam. In this case, the use of the SFTP access control features  of  SSH  Communications’  SSH  server  should  be  used.  In  order  to allow  access  to  only  the  d:\share  folder,  which  may  be  the  corporate  file server, to all accounts on the system, complete the following steps: SSH Secure Shell Server ➪ Configuration.  1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Highlight the SFTP Server section. 3. Under Accessible directories options, select New  insert  icon. 4. Type CorpFileServer=D:\share  syntax is virtual dir=real dir . 5. Select Apply.  Now all accounts on the operating system, or the domain, can have SFTP access to the d:\share directory. All accounts will not have access to any other part of the operating system except the virtual directory that is listed. Further- more, in addition to the virtual directories, the users’ home directory can also be accessible, listed by the %D variable in the User home directory text box. In this example, the users’ home directory is accessible, in addition to the corpo- rate file server directory, as shown in Figure 8.10.   290 Chapter 8  Figure 8.10 SFTP virtual directory.  Now  all  accounts  only  have  access  to  d:\share  using  SFTP,  despite  their NTFS permissions. The SSH Communications’ SSH server access control lists override the NTFS permissions on the SSH server when using SSH or SFTP subsystem.  In  addition  to  general  user  access,  you  may  want  to  allow  the administrator  account,  or  equivalent  power  users,  more  access  via  SFTP.  In order to provide power users with more access, while still restricting general SFTP users to the stated virtual directory, complete the following steps:  1. Highlight the Power Users section under SFTP server. 2. Select the Insert icon to add directories. 3. Type C:=C: and D:=D:. 4. Select Apply. 5. In the Power Users textbox, type administrator  or any other account  you wish to grant further access .  6. Select Apply.  Now the administrator account has full SFTP access to the SSH server, while general users are still restricted to the d:\share directory, as shown in Figure 8.11.   SSH Versatility 291  Figure 8.11 SFTP file-server permission to the administrator.   Unlike  VShell,  SSH  Communications’  SSH  server  does  not  provide  such specific access to the SFTPsubsystem. For example, if you want to allow all users access to the SFTP subsystem only but no shell access, there is no obvi- ous way to implement that with SSH Communications’ SSH server version 3.2.3. While you can allow or deny user accounts or hosts via the SSH server, it is  an  all-or-nothing  value,  without  specific  options  such  as  SFTP only.  This makes SSH Communications’ SFTP subsystem a little better than OpenSSH, but  it  offers  less  control  than  VShell.  For  example,  using  SSH  Communica- tions’ SSH server, certain directories of the operating system can be exposed to SFTP users, thus restricting access to sensitive directories such as winnt\sys- tem32.  Furthermore,  advanced  power  users  can  have  more  access  than  the general accounts, granting a greater level of directory access. Nevertheless, in a corporate file-server model, command-line or port-forwarding access to the SSH  server  is  highly  undesirable  and  a  security  threat.  Under  the  default installations  of  SSH  Communications’  SSH  server,  there  is  no  easy  way  to restrict certain users to SFTP only while allowing others access to both SFTP and terminal sessions.   SSH  Communications’  SSH  server  offers  the  ability  to  restrict  operating- system accounts to only specific directories using SFTP without the need for NTFS permissions. But it does not offer other restrictions on command-line or port-forwarding  access.  So,  while  it  still  may  be  a  good  solution  for  SFTP,   292 Chapter 8  maybe it is not the best for a file server. Nevertheless, it is a very excellent solu- tion  for  general  file  sharing  for  all  users  or  corporate  file  servers.  For  more information on secure file servers, see Chapter 10.  Authorizing Users with SSH Communications’ SSH Server  In all SSH Communications’ SSH server installations, all users on the operat- ing system will be allowed to log in to the service unless specifically denied. With SSH Communications’ SSH server, specific accounts can be allowed to log in or simply be denied, despite having an account on the system, shown in our last previous example. This allows the SSH Communications’ SSH server architecture to limit the users who have SSH SFTP access to a specific list of accounts. This list can include all accounts, which is the default, or a subset of the  accounts.  For  example,  if  there  are  500  accounts  that  have  access  to  a machine running SSH, possibly by using a domain architecture, but only 88 of those accounts need access to the operating system itself, SSH Communica- tions’ SSH server can allow or deny SSH SFTP access by specifying account names and or account variables that are authorized to log in. If the purpose of the  SFTP subsystem  is  to  allow  all  users  in  the  Engineering  Department  to access, upload, and download files to and from the operating system, adding the group ‘Engineering’ as the only group that can use SSH or SFTP is a rela- tively easy process. Furthermore, if the Engineering accounts only need access to the d:\share directory, SSH Communications’ SSH server is a strong alter- native. For example, say the Engineering Department needs to transfer files, such as compiled binaries, source code, or configuration files to and from the d:\share directory. If they are using SSH for secure terminal access, it would be counter-productive if they were using SMB or FTP for file transfer. The secu- rity they gain from the encrypted SSH connection is cancelled out by the inse- curity of the SMB or FTP sessions. In this scenario, the SSH Communications’ SSH server SFTP subsystem is a great alternative to SMB and FTP.  Comparison of the Three SFTP Solutions Table 8.2 summarizes the three SFTP solutions that have been discussed. The table  holds  the  different  vendors  on  the  x-axis  and  the  list  of  available  fea- tures utilities on the y-axis. As described earlier, despite the fact that all three major  providers  of  SSH,  including  OpenSSH,  SSH  Communications,  and VanDyke Software, enable the SFTP subsystem by default, there are different features of each installation that will affect your decision-making process. This following table summarizes the previous discussion.

Secure Chat  The use of chat is becoming an increasingly popular tool in network environ- ments. While chat was first used for local office gossip with a neighbor, it is now  being  used  to  communicate  legitimate  corporate  information  among employees. Chat offers great flexibility by allowing employees to work with one another in an easy, simple, and, most important, quick fashion to get more work done.    294 Chapter 8  Now that chat is more of a mainstream tool for business operations, the tra- versing of sensitive information between employees over an insecure channel is not acceptable. For example, if a group of engineers is working on a piece of code and participants need to send sample snippets of code to one another using chat, an unauthorized user has the ability to capture that data, because most chat programs use clear-text communication. Furthermore, chat can also be used to transfer account information such as passwords, network informa- tion such as an IP address, and other sensitive information that should not be disclosed to unauthorized users.  To use chat in organizations without affecting the integrity of the data, con- sider  using  SSH  with  chat.  Chat  with  SSH  will  not  be  addressing  popular instant messaging programs such as AOL, MSN, or Yahoo!, since these pro- grams use their own TCP ports that can just be port-forwarded over SSH for security. Just like e-mail, file transfer, and management can be port-forwarded, as  you  see  in  Chapters  6  and  7,  any  protocol,  such  as  that  used  with AOL, MNS, or Yahoo!, can also be port-forwarded in a similar manner. The discus- sion in this section will be limited to the use of chat in internal networks with- out  the  need  for  port  forwarding.  In  the  architecture  for  this  example,  IRC servers run on common Unix shells and use that server as the chat interface. Figure 8.12 shows the example architecture.  Internal Network  2 2  SSH Chat Server  172.16.6.100  Client: Neeraja 172.16.6.12 Figure 8.12 SSH architecture to be used with chat.  Client: Shreya 172.16.6.21  Client: Kusum 172.16.6.17   SSH Versatility 295  Secure chat with SSH uses the SSH server as the chat server also. So when users connect to the SSH server and gain access to a shell, they can execute their IRC client on the SSH shell and be connected to the IRC server, which is running locally on the SSH server. Once the user is connected, he will have a chat  session  under  his  SSH  shell,  which  is  all  encrypted  over  the  network. Complete the following steps to create a secure chat solution with SSH and your favorite IRC server:  1. Install SSH on 172.16.6.100. 2. Install your favorite IRC server on 172.16.6.100. 3. Create accounts for all three users on the chat server, including Kusum,  Shreya, and Neeraja.   NOTE In larger networks, NIS+ can be used instead of creating local accounts for every IRC client.  4. With any of the three user accounts listed previously, connect to the  SSH server using an SSH client.  5. Once authenticated, use an IRC client on the SSH server to connect to  the local IRC services on the system.  Once you have logged in to the IRC server with the IRC client, running on the SSH server via your SSH client, you now have the ability to use IRC secu- rity  with  SSH.  Your  SSH  terminal  will  show  your  IRC  session  with  other accounts.  While this example is short and sweet, it is used to illustrate how an operat- ing  system  running  insecure  services  that  are  command-line-based,  such  as most  IRC  servers,  can  deploy  an  instance  of  SSH  to  make  the  connection secure. While the insecure service will still be available locally to all users, con- nections to and from the service will be allowed only with SSH, thus securing the  connection  over  the  network  but  still  allowing  access  to  the  program locally. Figure 8.13 shows the two architectures.   296 Chapter 8  n o i t c e n n o C C R     I  r e v r e S   t a h C   H S S  .  .  0 0 1 6 6 1 2 7 1  .  e r u c e S  n o i t c e n n o C  r e v r e S   C R  I  0 0 1 . 6 . 6 1 . 2 7 1  e r u c e s n  I  n o i t c e n n o C  l  a n r e t n  I  k r o w t e N  l  a n r e t n  I  k r o w t e N  m u s u K    : t n e  i l  C  .  .  7 1 6 6 1 2 7 1  .  a y e r h S   : t n e  i l  C  1 2 . 6 . 6 1 . 2 7 1  j  a a r e e N    : t n e  i l  C  2 1 . 6 . 6 1 . 2 7 1  m u s u K    : t n e  i l  C  7 1 . 6  .  6 1  .  2 7 1  a y e r h S   : t n e  i l  C  1 2  .  6  .  6 1  .  2 7 1  j  a a r e e N    : t n e  i l  C  2 1  .  6  .  6 1  .  2 7 1  .   t h g i r     H S S   h t i  w   e r u t c e t i h c r a   C R  I   e r u c e s   d n a     t f e l     H S S   t u o h t i  w   e r u t c e t i h c r a   C R  I   e r u c e s n  I  .  3 1 8   e r u g i F   SSH Versatility 297  Secure Backups  Conducting backups in a network environment can be a very tricky item in terms  of  security.  Many  organizations  deploy  encryption  on  data  networks such as SSH, IPSec, or SSL in order to protect sensitive data. The same organi- zations, however, may then conduct their backup architecture over a clear-text protocol. In fact, many organizations forget to realize that backup networks may be more sensitive than data networks, since they are direct repositories for data, without the need to compromise a single server.   A popular method for backing up data in a network environment is Rysnc. Rysnc is a protocol that offers an incremental file transfer and update process  backup  from one entity to the next. Rsync offers the ability to transfer only the differences of files between two entities in a given network, using a check- sum process. These two items, combined with many others, make Rsysnc a very attractive tool in a backup architecture.   While  there  are  many  benefits  to  using  Rsync  in  a  backup  architecture, Rsysnc is a clear-text protocol with limited authentication requirements. An unauthorized  user  can  capture  the  Rsysnc  process  and  gain  access  to  data, account information, or even passwords. Therefore, in order to deploy a secure backup architecture, SSH should be used in combination with Rsync. Rsync with  SSH  will  provide  all  the  efficiencies  and  features  that  make  Rsync  so attractive, but will also provide encryption and public-key authentication, mit- igating two of the top-most security concerns with Rsync, which are clear-text communication and limited authentication. The use of SSH with Rsync will not only encrypt all communication between two entities, eliminating the abil- ity for an unauthorized user to compromise and steal the Rsync communica- tion  process,  but  also  implement  public-key  authentication,  making  it  very difficult  for  an  unauthorized  client  to  compromise  the  weak  authentication requirements  of  Rsync.  The  following  section  discusses  the  procedures  to implement a secure backup solution with Rsync and SSH.  Figure 8.14 shows the Rsysnc SSH architectural example I will be using for this section. The two servers are both Unix machines using OpenSSH. Notice that there are two servers, one used for productions and one used for backups. The production machine will be using Rsync with SSH to transfer files to the backup server, which has an Rsysnc daemon listening on it.    298 Chapter 8  Production Server  Neeraja  192.168.10.21  Backup Server  Kusum  192.168.10.17  Figure 8.14 Backup architecture.  Complete the following steps to set up secure backup with Rsync and SSH:  1. Ensure that OpenSSH and Rsysnc are installed on the backup server.  Ports 22  SSH  and 873  Rsync  should be listening on the backup server, if both daemons have been started.  2. Create a public and private-key pair on your backup server. You will  be using public and private keys to authenticate to the backup server, instead of using usernames and passwords. Because this backup  procedure will be automated, do not enter a passphrase for the private keys. You will be creating a DSA key pair  -t option , using 1024 bits   -b option , with a blank passphrase  -N option : [root@kusum]ssh-keygen –t dsa -b 1024 –N “”  3. When asked to enter the file in which to save the key, enter backup. 4. Once the key has been created, you should have a backup.pub and  backup file.   5. Copy backup.pub from the backup server to the production server,  specifically in the production server’s root directory  the user must be root to do this . Make an .ssh folder and concatenate the contents of the backup.pub file to the authorized keys files.  Chapter 4 discusses in detail public-key authentication with SSH.  The following are the  contents: [root@neeraja]cd  root [root@neeraja]mkdir .ssh [root@neeraja]cat backup.pub > . ssh authorized_keys [root@neeraja]chmod 600 .ssh  6. The basics have now been set up! Now the rsync command can be used  to conduct the backups. The –e option is a flag with Rsync to use SSH as the encryption communication between the two entities. Unlike other SSH usages, you don’t need to use a subsystem or port forward- ing with Rsysnc, but it is actually built in as an optional tool. Be sure to   SSH Versatility 299  preserve the permissions on the files being backed up by using the –p option. To back up from  usr from the production server  neeraja  to the backup server  kusum  using SSH, enter the following command: [root@neeraja]rsync –p -a –e ssh  usr kusum: usr  7. Secure backup has now been implemented with SSH. In order to auto- mate the process, enter a Cron job  automated scheduler  to execute the secure backup procedure: [root@neeraja]crontab –e 10 * * 0  usr bin rsync –p –a –e ssh usr kusum: usr  8. In addition to Rsync, tar can be used to back up files via SSH by using a slightly different format. For example, to back up users’ home directory on the production server  neeraja  to the backup server  kusum  using tar, enter the following command: [root@neeraja]ssh kusum “tar cfz -  home” >  tmp home.tar.gz  Summary  This chapter discusses the versatility of SSH. Whether you are using SSH for secure terminal access, in order to replace RSH or Rlogin, for secure file trans- fer, in order to replace FTP, SMB, or NFS, for secure chat, in conjunction with IRC,  or  as  a  secure  backup  solution,  in  conjunction  with  Rsync,  there  is  no doubt that SSH is a very versatile tool. Consider that other utilities or protocols such as RSH, Rlogin, SMB, FTP, NFS, Rsync, and IRC have very little in com- mon; however, all of those protocols can be replaced with a single installation of SSH.  The versatility of SSH, combined with its strong encryption capabilities, its strong  authentication  capabilities,  and  even  its  strong  authorization  and integrity capabilities, makes it a powerful solution for several items, including terminal  access,  file  transfer,  chat,  and  backups.  This  chapter’s  focus  is  to demonstrate the flexibility of SSH using different vendor implementations, as well as to explore the lesser-known uses of SSH, such as secure chat and secure backup.  The core point to learn from this chapter is that the versatility of SSH can mitigate several of the security issues in your network while providing a solu- tion for many core business functions, all with a single tool. While using a sin- gle version of SSH may not be desired due to capacity requirements, using a single application that serves several purposes can help your complex envi- ronment become simpler and thus more secure. The ability to patch, maintain, and support a single application across several systems is more manageable   300 Chapter 8  than to support several tools utilities across multiple systems. Furthermore, the use of SSH as a backup solution, a file server, or for terminal access make it easier for users to learn, adopt, and optimize on a single solution.  Lastly, despite the fact that SSH has been so widely adopted by former RSH and Rlogin users, not only for its added security but also primarily because it is easy to use, it still has not carried over to other uses such as SFTP, chat, or backups. This chapter not only demonstrates what many users already know, that SSH is a strong alternative for RSH Rlogin, but also that SSH is just as easy to use and deploy for other protocols such as FTP, chat, and backups. The use of SSH as a file server and backup solution is just as easy, if not easier, than its use as a secure terminal session. Either through default installations, which install the SFTP subsystem, or additional features such as Rsync, SSH can be a strong solution across multiple disciplines, not just for secure terminal access.  In the next chapter, I will shift the focus from SSH flexibility to SSH proxies and how to use an SSH proxy server to access several SSH servers, whether they are SSH terminal sessions or SFTP servers. Also, I will cover the uses of other tools, such as SOCKS and HTTP, in conjunction with SSH.   C H A P T E R9  Proxy Technologies in a  Secure Web Environment  The use of proxy servers in any network environment can simplify the operat- ing environment for end-users. A proxy server is an application that places a request on behalf of another entity. Most proxy servers in use today are Web proxies, where a client machine attempts to access a certain Web server but sends its request to the Web proxy server. The Web proxy server then sends the request  to  the  real  Web  server  on  behalf  of  the  client.  Once  the  response  is received from the Web server, the proxy server returns the request to the client. The use of proxy technology can also be adapted to the SSH architecture. This chapter focuses on the use of SSH, as I have discussed it thus far, in com- bination with proxy servers, SOCKS, dynamic port forwarding, wireless net- works,  and  secure  Web  browsing.  These  topics  allow  me  to  demonstrate another aspect of SSH while demonstrating the ability to optimize and utilize its flexibility. As a result of this chapter, the use of SSH will expand beyond a typical  implementation  into  lesser-known  methods  of  deployment,  such  as secure Web browsing and secure wireless networks.  Using SSH in combination with proxy technologies allows networks to opti- mize the strong security features from SSH with multiple devices and operat- ing systems across an organization’s architecture. The use of proxy technology  301   302 Chapter 9  allows normally insecure sessions to be secure, while providing a single repos- itory for SSH communication. The focuses of this chapter are the following:  SSH and SOCKS    Dynamic port forwarding and SOCKS  Secure Web browsing with SSH Securing wireless connections with SSH  SSH and SOCKS  The implementation of SOCKS proxy servers with SSH offers a great solution for network environments. Before I delve into SSH and SOCKS, I’ll quickly examine SOCKS and its primary purposes. SOCKS is a generic proxy protocol able  to  plug  into  other  protocols,  such  as  SSH,  in  order  to  provide  security across networking environments. SOCKS uses the typical client server archi- tecture, where a SOCKS client connects to a SOCKS server. The primary pur- pose of SOCKS is to allow a client on one end of a connection to access one or several hosts on the other end of a connection via the SOCKS server, without the client ever directly connecting to the desired host on the other side. Using this understanding, I will be using SOCKS to allow an SSH client to connect to multiple SSH servers by connecting to a single SOCKS server, which creates a secure communication channel between all clients and servers while reducing the complexity in the network architecture.  The primary purpose of installing a SOCKS proxy server is to allow a single entry point for SSH communication, which is then dispersed throughout the rest of the network. For example, let’s say you have installed SSH on all your Web servers for secure remote management and would like to allow access to these Web servers, via SSH, to all your administrators from remote sites out- side the confines of the internal network. Instead of allowing several SSH con- nections through your firewall, which could be 10 to hundreds of connections, you can set up a SOCKS proxy server that can proxy the SSH request to the SSH servers. Figure 9.1 shows the architecture in detail.                 Proxy Technologies in a Secure Web Environment 303  Internet  Router  Firewall  SOCKS Server  Remote Client  11.17.7.10  11.17.7.12  11.17.7.14  11.17.7.16  11.17.7.1  2 2  2 2  2 2  2 2  Figure 9.1 Use of SOCKS proxy servers with SSH.  Figure 9.1 shows a remote client outside the internal network. To allow a remote client to access multiple servers running SSH for management inside an internal network or DMZ networks, you could create a rule in the firewall that would allow access to every Web server or even to several hundred inter- nal servers. Or you could use a SOCKS server to proxy all the requests from the remote clients to the SSH servers, which requires only a single rule in the firewall that would allow all remote clients to the SOCKS server on port 1080. Figure 9.2 shows how this operates.  Currently,  there  are  many  solutions  for  SOCKS  servers,  from  large  enter- prise SOCKS servers, capable of handling many requests, to very small SOCKS servers, capable of only a limited capacity. For ease of illustration, consider how to install a very simple SOCKS server. The SOCKS server to be demon- strated  is  SOCKServ,  version  2.0,  which  can  be  freely  downloaded  from www.geocities.com SiliconValley Heights 2517 sockserv.htmintro.  This  is a version 4 SOCKS server. To complete the example described in Figure 9.1, a SOCKS server needs to be installed on 11.17.7.1, ensuring that SSH is listening on  all  destination  servers,  including  11.17.7.10,  11.17.7.12,  11.17.7.14,  and 11.17.7.16; then SSH clients need to be configured to use SOCKS.

For the Hostname or IP field, enter the IP address or hostname of the  SOCKS server. In this example, it is 11.17.7.1.  7. For the port field, enter the port number you have selected for the  SOCKS server. The default port is 1080.  8. Select OK.  The options should look like Figure 9.4.  Figure 9.3 Installed SOCKServ utility.   306 Chapter 9  Figure 9.4 SecureCRT SOCKS options.  Now that you have SOCKS set up in your global options, you must config- ure each of your SSH connections to use the SOCKS firewall. Doing so will make your SSH request go to the SOCKS server first and will let the SOCKS server go to the server you requested on your behalf. To configure SSH con- nections to use the SOCKS server, compete the following steps:  1. Open SecureCRT, if it is not already open. Start ➪ Programs ➪  SecureCRT ➪  SecureCRT.  2. For new connections, select File from the menu bar and select Quick  Connect. For hostname, be sure to enter the hostname or IP address of the destination server you wish to reach, not the SOCKS server. For example, according to Figure 9.1, you could enter 11.17.7.10, 11.17.7.12, 11.17.7.14, or 11.17.7.16.  3. Select the checkbox that states Use firewall to connect. 4. For existing saved connections, select File from the menu bar and select  Connect.  5. Highlight the connection you wish to edit; then right-click and select  Properties. Be sure to select the connection of the destination sever you wish to reach, not the SOCKS server. For example, according to Figure 9.1, you could select 11.17.7.10, 11.17.7.12, 11.17.7.14, or 11.17.7.16.  6. The Connection section should have information about your saved   connections.   Proxy Technologies in a Secure Web Environment 307  7. In the right-hand pane, select the checkbox that states Use firewall to  connect.  8. Select OK.  The options should look like Figure 9.5. Again, be sure to keep the IP address and hostname fields to your desired destination  server.  Once  the  checkbox  has  been  selected  to  use  the  firewall option, the SOCKS entry in your global settings will direct your connections to the SOCKS server, which will carry your request to the specified hostname or IP address that you have specified in your connection request. Once the setup has been completed, you should be able to use your SOCKS server, with a sin- gle firewall rule, to access any appropriate SSH enabled server.  To use the SOCKS server for SSH connections with SSH Communications’  SSH client, complete the following steps:  1. Open the SSH Secure Client. Start ➪ Programs ➪  SSH Secure Shell ➪  Secure Shell Client.  Settings.  2. From the menu bar, select Edit ➪ 3. Select the Firewall section. 4. For the Firewall URL field, enter the IP address or hostname of the SOCKS server, in the following format—socks:  host:port. In this example, it is socks:  11.17.7.1:1080.  Figure 9.5 SecureCRT SOCKS options with saved connections.   308 Chapter 9  5. For the SOCKS version field, select SOCKS version 4 or version 5,  depending on what version you have installed, from the drop-down box.  6. Select OK.  The options should look like Figure 9.6. Now that you have SOCKS set up in your global settings, you must config- ure each of your SSH connections to use the SOCKS firewall. Doing so will make your SSH request go to the SOCKS server first and will let the SOCKS server go to the server you requested. To configure SSH connections to use the SOCKS server, complete the following steps:  1. Open the SSH Secure Client, if it is not already open. Start ➪ Programs  SSH Secure Shell ➪  Secure Shell Client.  2. Select File ➪ Profiles from the menu bar; then select Edit Profiles.  3. Highlight the profile you wish to edit. According to the example in Fig-  ure 9.1, it would be the profile for 11.17.7.10, 11.17.7.12, 11.17.7.14, or 11.17.7.16. Be sure to select the connection of the destination server you wish to reach, not the SOCKS server. For example, according to Figure 9.1, you could select 11.17.7.10, 11.17.7.12, 11.17.7.14, or 11.17.7.16.  4. In the right-hand pane, select the checkbox that states Connect through  firewall.  5. Select OK.  Figure 9.6 SSH Communications’ SOCKS options.  ➪  Proxy Technologies in a Secure Web Environment 309  The options should look like Figure 9.7. Now that the SOCKS server is set up on 11.17.7.1 and the SSH clients are configured to use the SOCKS server to access the desired hosts, you can use the SOCKS SSH architecture. Using your SSH client, SecureCRT, or SSH Com- munications’ SSH client, connect to the desired host  11.17.7.16  with the use of the SOCKS server.  First, ensure that the firewall checkbox is selected.  When the  SOCKS  server  receives  the  connection,  it  connects  to  11.17.7.16  on  your behalf and returns the connection to you. Once you have authenticated, you will have an SSH session via the SOCKS server. Furthermore, the connection between you and the SOCKS server and between the SOCKS server and the desired host is encrypted with SSH. After the session is enabled, you should see the connection in your SOCKServ utility, as shown in Figure 9.8.  Figure 9.7 SSH Communications’ SOCKS options under profiles.   310 Chapter 9  Figure 9.8 SOCKS connection with the SOCKServ utility.  Dynamic Port Forwarding and SOCKS  Dynamic  port  forwarding  is  another  powerful  feature  of  SSH  in  the  port- forwarding architecture. Dynamic port forwarding offers the benefit of SOCKS proxy  servers,  described  in  the  previous  section,  on  a  local  port  on  an  SSH client machine. Dynamic port forwarding uses a local port on the loopback address   127.0.0.1   that  mimics  a  SOCKS  server  while  performing  the  func- tions of a regular SOCKS service. For example, if an SSH connection has been established between an SSH client and an SSH server, instead of using the tra- ditional  local  port-forwarding  options,  where  each  specific  local  port  is matched to a specific port on the remote server, dynamic port forwarding can specify a local port to act like a SOCKS server that can be used by local appli- cations, including mail, FTP, and Web clients. Many applications support the use of a SOCKS server; however, instead of specifying a real SOCKS server on a  remote  machine,  you  can  specify  the  local  machine   127.0.0.1   with  the dynamic port-forwarding SOCKS server port, 1080 by default.   To set up dynamic port forwarding with SOCKS on an SSH client machine,  complete the following steps:   1. From the SSH client, connect to the SSH server using the appropriate  command-line client: OpenSSH     ssh   -p   -l   -D 1080 SSH         ssh2   -p   -l   -L socks 1080  2. On the SSH client; configure any relevant applications to use a SOCKS server for outbound connections. Enter the loopback address  127.0.0.1  for the IP address and port number 1080.

NOTE  DNS traffic to and from Web clients is not encrypted, since Web Clients are not SOCKS enabled; instead, they perform DNS lookup themselves over UDP port 53.   Dynamic port forwarding allows the flexibility of a local SOCKS server port to be used with all applications and the SSH client, while gaining the benefit of secure communications on any applications to from the SSH server. Also, this model holds significantly less overhead than traditional local port forwarding by  not  requiring  the  use  of  specific  local  ports  to  match  remote  ports,  but requiring only one local dynamic SOCKS port-forwarding option. Remember, unlike regular port forwarding, where all applications are configured to use the loopback address, dynamic port forwarding uses the real IP address for the desired server, not 127.0.0.1. For example, mail clients use the real IP address of the mail servers but use the SOCKS connection to access the real IP address. Furthermore, when configuring the e-mail client, you still use the real host- name or IP address for the mail server but use the loopback address only for the SOCKS menu. Figure 9.11 shows the dynamic port-forwarding architec- ture with Web browsers.   You may be asking yourself, with all the great uses for SSH and SOCKS, why there is still so much use of local port forwarding or why dynamic port- forwarding  isn’t  more  popular?  These  are  great  questions  that  have  few answers. Many SSH users are well aware of local and remote port forwarding, but dynamic port forwarding still is not widely adopted. The following is a short list of some positives and negatives of dynamic port forwarding with SOCKS:    Dynamic port forwarding can replace several local port-forwarding  rules.   Consider that local port-forwarding options can grow to be 8 to 15  settings when using mail, file transfer, remote management, and Web browsing options. When using dynamic port forwarding, a sin- gle option just needs to be set on the SSH client and all applications need to be SOCKS enabled.   Secure remote access  VPN architecture  becomes more manageable with SSH and the use of dynamic port forwarding. The use of secondary HTTP proxy servers or SOCKS servers is not required.

Most, if not all, Web, FTP, and e-mail applications are SOCKS aware.   Dynamic port forwarding is available by default with most command-  line SSH technologies.  Besides its advantages, dynamic port forwarding has some drawbacks. The following is a list regarding why dynamic port forwarding may not be usable for your particular organization:  Relevant applications must support SOCKS.   Most Web clients and e-mail clients support SOCKS, but several  applications and protocols, such as NFS and SMB, do not have SOCKS-enabled clients.    Dynamic port forwarding requires additional configuration on client-  side applications.  Some SSH clients do not support dynamic port forwarding.  Secure Web Browsing with SSH  One of the most attractive features of SSH is the ability to surf the information superhighway in a secure fashion, despite the network you are sitting on  for example, the Internet , the protocol that the Web server is using  for example, HTTP , or the possibility that malicious users are sniffing your segment  for example, on wireless networks in coffee shops .  Secure Web browsing with SSH requires the use of an HTTP  Web  proxy server. Any proxy server will work, such as Microsoft’s ISA proxy server, or SQUID, the Open Source proxy server. The installation and configuration of HTTP proxy  servers  is  outside  the  scope  of  this  section,  so  I  assume  that  a proxy server has already been set up or can be set up in a relatively easy fash- ion   see  www.squid-cache.org  for  Unix  proxy  servers  and  www.microsoft. com isaserver default.asp for Windows proxy servers . To use SSH’s encryp- tion capabilities with secure Web browsing, you need to implement port for- warding, discussed in Chapter 6, along with proxy servers. The architecture for the method you will be implementing is illustrated in Figure 9.12.

If you use a proxy server for Web browsing in your organiza- tion,  you  probably  have  your  Web  browser  point  to  your  proxy  server  for requests. For example, with Internet Explorer, if you point to Tools ➪ Internet Options ➪ Connections ➪ LAN Settings and ‘Use a proxy server’ has a host- name  or  IP address,  your  Web  browser  is  sending  requests  to  your  HTTP proxy server first, and the proxy server is reaching out to the real Web site on your behalf. With the use of SSH, the connection between the SSH client and the proxy server, which is also an SSH server, is secured, so any Web commu- nication is protected.  The first step is to deploy a proxy server in your internal network. Many organizations have several proxy servers in their internal networks, either in their DMZ network or their internal network itself. Either location is fine, as long as all the internal clients can access the proxy server through firewalls  or router-access control lists. The second step is to install an SSH server on  the proxy server itself or to install an SSH server that has direct access to the proxy  server.  In  your  example,  you  will  be  installing  an  SSH  server  on  the proxy server itself, but be aware that another server could be used solely for the SSH server as well. Once you have installed an SSH server on the proxy server, you should be ready to be setup for secure Web browsing. Assume that your proxy server, with an IP address of 6.12.11.30, is listening on port 8080 for all proxy requests. Also assume that your SSH server, also with an IP address of 6.12.11.30, is listening on port 22 for all SSH connections. Now that you have 6.12.11.30  listening  on  port  8080   HTTP proxy   and  port  22   SSH ,  you  are ready to begin.  The idea behind secure Web browsing is that the client will make a valid connection to the SSH server using any SSH client. The SSH client, however, will  also  be  port-forwarding  port  8080  on  the  SSH  client  to  the  SSH  server. Therefore, any connection made to port 8080 on the local SSH client will be for- warded to the SSH server on port 8080 over the existing SSH tunnel. Since the SSH  server  will  be  listening  for  HTTP proxy  connections  on  port  8080,  any request made on the SSH client on port 8080 will be forwarded to the HTTP proxy server port, which is also port 8080, via SSH. As a result, the client’s Web traffic will be tunneled through SSH from the client to the proxy server, secur- ing your Web communications. In addition to setting up port forwarding, the client’s Web browser will need to be configured to use port 8080 on its own loopback address  127.0.0.1  for any HTTP requests. The client must use itself  127.0.0.1  on port 8080 as its proxy server, which is really the port-forwarding tunnel of SSH. Once port forwarding has been set up for port 8080 and the Web browser has been configured  127.0.0.1  as the proxy server on port 8080, any requests from the Web browser will be sent to the proxy server over SSH as shown in Figure 9.13. Complete the following steps to set up SSH clients and the Web browser with secure Web communication on a Unix client:   Proxy Technologies in a Secure Web Environment 317  Figure 9.13 Proxy settings under Netscape for 127.0.0.1 on port 8080.  1. Connect to the SSH server, port-forwarding port 8080.  ssh 6.12.11.30 –p 22 –L 8080:6.12.11.30:8080  2. Open Netscape. 3. Select Edit from the menu bar and choose Preferences. 4. Expand the Advanced section in the left-hand pane. 5. Select Proxies under the Advanced section. 6. Select the Manual proxy configuration radio button. 7. For the HTTP Proxy: section, enter 127.0.0.1. 8. For the Port: section, enter 8080. 9. Select OK.  Complete the following steps to set up SSH clients and a Web browser with  secure Web communication on a Windows client.  1. Open SecureCRT or SSH Communications’ SSH client. 2. Configure sessions for the SSH server on 6.12.11.30, on port 22. 3. Enter the port-forwarding options to port forward all connections on  port 8080 to 6.12.11.30. See Figures 9.14 and 9.15.   318 Chapter 9  Figure 9.14 SecureCRT port-forwarding options for proxy connections over port 8080.  Figure  9.15 SSH  Communications’  SSH  client’s  port-forwarding  options  for  proxy connections over port 8080.   Proxy Technologies in a Secure Web Environment 319  4. Save the sessions on the respective SSH clients and connect to the SSH  server with the port-forwarding options enabled.  5. Open Internet Explorer. 6. Select Tools from the menu bar; then select Internet Options. 7. Select the Connections tab. 8. Select the LAN Settings button at the bottom of the section. 9. Select the Proxy server checkbox and enter 127.0.0.1 for the Address  and 8080 for the Port.  10. Select OK. See Figure 9.16 for details.  Now that you have connected your SSH client to the SSH server  with your port-forwarding options enabled  and your proxy setting in your Web browser points to your own machine  127.0.0.1  on port 8080, you should be able to securely browse the information superhighway by encrypting all traffic from your client to your HTTP proxy server with SSH. Figure 9.17 shows the com- munication process.

But before you proceed to the next sec- tion, you need to explore the use of SSH clients in existing networks where HTTP proxy servers may be deployed. For example, many organizations do not allow internal employees to have full outbound access to the Internet on all ports, specifically on SSH. Many organizations allow their employees to access only port 80  HTTP  and port 443  HTTPS  to the Internet. Often, these out- bound connections are allowed only through an HTTP proxy server. While the use of proxy servers for HTTP access is useful, this may restrict access to your organization’s SSH server  port 22 . In order to continue to use SSH clients in networks where HTTP proxy servers are deployed and are the only means of accessing the Internet, the HTTP CONNECT command string must be given to the HTTP proxy server on the specific port it is listening on, usually port 80 or 8080, to access the SSH server on the outside.   Using  SecureCRT,  the  following  HTTP command,  CONNECT  %h:%p HTTP 1.0\r\n\r\n, where &h is a variable for host and %p is a variable for port, can allow you to use an SSH client though an HTTP proxy server without the  need  for  any  modification  on  the  HTTP proxy  server  itself.  To  enable SecureCRT to use an HTTP proxy server for outbound access, complete the fol- lowing steps:  SecureCRT.  SecureCRT ➪  1. Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Select Options from the menu bar. 3. Select Global Options. 4. Highlight the Firewall section. 5. Select Generic Proxy for the Type field in the right-hand pane. 6. Enter the hostname or IP address of the HTTP proxy server in the   Hostname or IP field.  7. Enter the port being used for HTTP proxy connections. This will be the same port the client’s Web browser is using to surf the Web. Most likely, the port will be 80 or 8080.  8. Leave the Prompt textbox blank. 9. Enter CONNECT %h:%p HTTP 1.0\r\n\r\n for the Command  textbox.  10. Select OK. Figure 9.18 shows the configuration in SecureCRT.   322 Chapter 9  Figure 9.18 SecureCRT with the HTTP proxy command setting.  As with other settings using the Firewall option in SecureCRT, be sure to check the “Use firewall to connect” option for each SSH session that you will use through the proxy server. See Figure 9.19 for the checkbox location.  Figure 9.19 SecureCRT’s “Use firewall to connection” feature.   Proxy Technologies in a Secure Web Environment 323  Similar to SecureCRT, OpenSSH’s command-line client can be used to use SSH via HTTP proxy servers. Unlike with SecureCRT, you will need to down- load a tool called Corkscrew, written by Pat Padgett, from www.agroman.net  corkscrew. Once you have downloaded the tool to  usr local bin, enter the following  commands  to  enable  Corkscrew,  which  will  help  you  use  SSH through HTTP proxy servers:  Unzip and install the utility. gunzip –c corkscrew-2.0.tar.gz  tar xvf – cd corkscrew-2.0 . configure make make install Edit your ~ .ssh config file and add the following lines, replacing “http.proxy.server” with the hostname or IP address of your HTTP proxy server and “port” with the port, usually 80 or 8080, that your HTTP proxy server is listening on. ProxyCommand  usr local bin corkscrew http.proxy.server port %h %p Use the –F flag to connect to the remote SSH server. ssh –F config ip.ssh.server –p 80  That’s  it!  You  will  now  be  able  to  use  OpenSSH’s  command-line  client  through HTTP proxy servers to reach SSH servers.  Securing Wireless Networks with SSH  Wireless  connections,  specifically  802.11b,  have  been  plagued  with  security issues almost since their introduction. From serious security issues with WEP, to clear-text communication of management beacons, wireless technology is a key target for attackers. Nevertheless, wireless technology is a “must-have” in many organizations. If your organization will not deploy wireless technology due to its security issues, someone who is unauthorized may deploy it for you, which probably won’t be done in a secure fashion. You will be examining how to use your previous SSH and proxy model to secure wireless networks. Keep in mind that you can already secure other protocols, such as mail  POP3 and SMTP  and file transfer  FTP, SMB, NFS , with port forwarding over wireless networks. The following sections discuss how to use port forwarding to secure Web traffic over wireless networks.   324 Chapter 9  Securing Wireless with SSH and HTTP Proxies Implementation  of  secure  Web  communications  over  insecure  wireless  net- works differs little from other means of implementation in other media, seen in  previous  examples. As  an  example,  consider  an  architecture  in  which  an employee is at a coffee shop, using an insecure wireless connection. This archi- tecture is illustrated in Figure 9.20. Guidelines for implementing this type of architecture are as follows:  1. Install an SSH server on 11.17.1.1, listening on port 22. 2. Install a proxy server on 11.17.11, listening on port 8080. 3. Allow port 22 through the perimeter firewalls and routers. 4. Configure an SSH client on “Coffee Shop Client” to port forward port  8080 from the client loopback interface, 127.0.0.1, to the SSH Proxy server, 11.17.1.1, on port 8080.  5. Configure a Web browser on “Coffee Shop Client” to use 127.0.0.1 on  port 8080 for the proxy server.  At this point, “Coffee Shop Client” should be able to use the established SSH connection to make secure connections to the HTTP proxy, giving the client secure  Web  communication  over  the  insecure  wireless  network.  If  port  for- warding has been set up for corporate e-mail and file transfer  see Chapters 6 and  7  for  more  details  on  how  to  do  so ,  the  client  can  perform  e-mail,  file transfer, and Web browsing over a secure connection in an insecure network.

Instead of requiring the use of a proxy server, dynamic port forwarding needs nothing  more  than  an  SSH  server  and  an  SSH  client.  The  second  example, shown in Figure 9.21, demonstrates an architecture where an employee might also be located at a coffee shop, using an insecure wireless connection. Notice the difference between Figures 9.20 and 9.21. Figure 9.20 shows an SSH server and a proxy server on the same machine, whereas Figure 9.21 requires only an SSH server due to the use of dynamic port forwarding.  To implement secure Web communications over insecure wireless networks,  perform the following steps:  1. Install an SSH server on 11.30.6.12, listening on port 22. 2. Allow port 22 through the perimeter firewalls and routers. 3. Configure an SSH client on “Coffee Shop Client” to dynamic port for-  warding using SOCKS on the loopback address, 127.0.0.1, on port 8080. OpenSSH     ssh 11.30.6.12 -p 22 -l root -D 1080 SSH         ssh2 11.30.6.12 -p 22 -l root -L socks 1080  4.

While these solutions may not be relevant for all  wireless  networks  or  requirements,  SSH  does  solve  two  of  the  major requirements for wireless users: secure Web browsing and secure e-mail.  The combination of SSH and proxy technology, whether it be HTTP proxies, a SOCKS server, or dynamic port forwarding, gives SSH even more powerful capabilities. The combination of these two technologies allows SSH to be used very easily in insecure and inflexible networks, such as 802.11b wireless net- works. Also, with the use of Web proxies or SOCKS, protocols that were very difficult to secure unless large investments in security devices were purchased are now easy to set up at a very low cost.   SSH and SOCKS demonstrate how SOCKS servers combined with SSH flex- ibility can simplify an SSH architecture while providing end-to-end SSH secu- rity.  The  ability  to  centralize  SSH  communications  to  a  single  destination, which can then be dispersed to several locations, while providing the use of SSH  encryption  to from  the  entire  connection,  makes  SSH  and  SOCKS  an attractive and simple solution in what could be a complex architecture.   Furthermore,  the  use  of  dynamic  port  forwarding,  which  creates  a  fully functional SOCKS server on the local SSH client, adds an incredible amount of flexibility to SSH. Since the use of dynamic port forwarding allows SSH clients to have the benefit of SOCKS technology, or even proxy technology, without the use of a secondary proxy or SOCKS server, it is a very attractive solution that is not only easy to implement  with the need for just a single flag on a sup- porting SSH client , but easy to support as well  by requiring only a default SSH server without extra configuration or plug-ins . The ability to secure Web, FTP, and mail applications with a single port-forwarding rule without chang- ing  any  aspects  of  the  SSH  server  or  the  architecture  it  resides  in  makes dynamic port forwarding a very strong feature of SSH.   The ability to use HTTP proxies with SSH allows SSH secure Web commu- nication from insecure networks through a relatively easy process. Many orga- nizations have deployed proxy servers probably for other reasons; however, with the use of local port forwarding, the existing proxy servers can be used to port  forward  local  connections  over  secure  tunnels  to  an  existing   or  new  internal  proxy  server.  This  combination  allows  external  employees,  such  as employees who work from home or travel considerably, to use trusted internal servers for sensitive communications, such as financial applications that are only Web enabled.   Proxy Technologies in a Secure Web Environment 327  Lastly,  this  chapter  briefly  describes  how  to  use  SSH  technologies  with HTTP proxies  and  dynamic  port  forwarding  to  secure  802.11b  wireless  net- works.  The  details  learned  from  the  previous  section  of  this  chapter  can  be used not only in traditional wired networks but also in newly emerging net- works with strong security issues, such as wireless ones. While wireless and SSH do have scalability draw-backs, SSH can secure a wireless network with relatively low overhead, low cost, and high performance without the need to redesign any type of network or network segment.  The next chapter provides a discussion of SSH case studies. This chapter provides various real-world examples on how SSH can be used to solve sev- eral critical functionality and security issues within an organization. Further- more, the chapter will discuss many of the key aspects, features, and functions discussed in the previous chapters, while highlighting the most powerful and useful functions.     C H A P T E R10  SSH Case Studies  When  Trinity  needed  to  hack  into  the  Zion  mainframe  in  order  to  save  the world in the motion picture Matrix Reloaded, what utility does she use? That’s right, she uses SSH. If this book has shown you one thing, it should be that not only can SSH be used to save the world; it should be regarded as a gift from the gods. Seriously, while Trinity demonstrates one of the many benefits of SSH, which is secure terminal access to a mainframe system, the most important aim of this book is to demonstrate the flexibility of SSH when properly optimized.  In order to fully demonstrate SSH’s flexibility, let’s examine three case stud- ies  in  this  chapter.  These  are  real-world  situations  in  which  SSH  is  used  to  significantly  improve  the  functionality  and or  the  security  of  a  particular architecture. The following are the three case studies:   Each case study consists of the following four items:   Secure remote access Secure wireless connectivity Secure file servers    A problem   Business requirements Configuration Results checklist  329                             330 Chapter 10  Case Study  1: Secure Remote Access  The following case study involves the Ace Tomato Company. The Ace Tomato Company  is  a  multinational  organization  headquartered  in  Mumbai,  India, that produces and sells dairy milk all over the world. It has sales, professional services, and technical-support divisions that travel to customer sites 90 per- cent  of  the  time,  which  is  either  outside  of  the  country,  primarily  in  the Nashville,  TN,  Columbus,  OH,  Brookings,  SD,  Minneapolis,  MN,  and  San Francisco, CA, or locally around the country, primarily in Belwa, Beneras, and Bangalore.   The Problem Situation The Ace Tomato Company needs a secure remote-access solution for its exter- nal end-users.   Business Requirements The  business  requirements  provided  by  the  Ace  Tomato  Company  are  as  follows:    Must support strong level on encryption  Triple-DES or above    Must be accessible from all types of networks, including NAT’d net-  works, remote offices, hotel rooms, behind internal proxy servers, and organizations that allow only TCP port 80 and 443 outbound    Must support two-factor authentication   Must be able to provide easy access to e-mail and intranet servers from  internal networks, DMZ networks, and extranets   Must be able to provide secure file-sharing access   Must require only a single action from novice end-users for e-mail   Must provide stable and consistent performance  Secure remote access is one of the premier reasons to use SSH, especially with its port-forwarding feature. Despite the fact that port forwarding will be used, the type of SSH solution chosen for this particular architecture is very important, since not all SSH solutions can meet all of the preceding require- ments with the same level of simplicity.                  SSH Case Studies 331  For your solution, you will choose to use the VShell SSH server due to its ability to provide secure file-sharing access without the need for additional file-system  restrictions,  such  as  NTFS  or  Unix  file-system  security.  Since remote  access  to  e-mail,  file  sharing,  and  intranet  Web  pages  are  the  only requirements, VShell also provides the ability to easily restrict command-line access to the SSH server, a feature that must be enabled for all users to secure the SSH server itself. Furthermore, since your remote-access solution requires access behind internal proxy servers, SecureCRT is a great solution, since it can connect  through  proxy  servers  using  a  CONNECT  string,  as  discussed  in Chapter 9. Lastly, SecureCRT also offers the ability to automatically execute other applications, such as e-mail clients, once an SSH connection has been established.  This  will  meet  the  requirement  that  states  that  all  novice  users should have only one step to access e-mail.   In addition to SecureCRT, SSH Communications’ SFTP client will be used to access the SFTP session on the Windows file server, since SecureCRT does not have a built-in SFTP client. This will require an additional step for file-sharing access; however, that does not break any of the preceding requirements. The following list states the utilities that will be used:  VShell for the SSH servers SecureCRT for the SSH client SSH Communications for the SFTP client  The key requirements from an architecture perspective will be the ability to access  e-mail  servers,  file  sharing,  and  intranet  Web  servers  from  the  SSH server.  Also,  since  command-line  access  to  the  SSH  server  is  not  desired,  command-line access will need to be restricted. Furthermore, since the internal file server will need to be accessible remotely, another installation of VShell should be installed on the internal file server for remote SFTP users. Figure 10.1 shows the remote-access architecture.                332 Chapter 10  b e W    t e n a r t n  I  r e v r e S  0 0 2 . 1 . 6 1 . 2 7 1  P T M S   l i  a m - E  l    y a e R     r e v r e S  0 0 1 . 1 . 8 6 1 . 2 9 1  r e v r e S   e  l i F  l l  e h S V  .  .  0 0 1 1 6 1 2 7 1  .  3 P O P   l i  a m - E  r e v r e S  0 5 1 . 1 . 6 1 . 2 7 1  r e v r e S   H S S  l l  e h S V  .  .  2 1 6 7 1 1 1  .  .  1    y d u t s   e s a c   r o f   e r u t c e t i h c r a   H S S  .  1 0 1   e r u g i F  s t n e  i l  C   e t o m e R  K R O W T E N   L A N R E T N  I  l l  a w e r i F  t e n r e t n  I  s t n e  i l  C   e t o m e R   SSH Case Studies 333  All  devices  in  Figure  10.1  are  part  of  the  existing  architecture,  except  for items in italics, which are the VShell SSH server off the perimeter firewall and the installation of VShell on the internal file server. With only the need for two additional items, the architecture for remote access with SSH is quite simple.  In addition to the architecture, the perimeter firewall in Figure 10.1 needs to be modified. The firewall needs to allow external remote clients to access the SSH server on port 443. Why are you choosing port 443 instead of the default port 22? Remember from the requirements lists that the remote-access solu- tions must be accessible in networks that allow only outbound access on TCP ports 80 and 443. Also, remote clients need to connect through proxy servers that almost always listen on ports 80 and 443 and usually do not allow you to proxy any other ports  These restrictions would eliminate other VPN solutions such as IPSec-based VPNs, which needs UDP 500 to be allowed outbound . Next, the firewall has to allow access from the SSH server, located in a DMZ off one leg of the firewall, to port 25 on the SMTP server  mail relay , port 80 on the internal intranet server, port 110 on the mail server, and port 22 on the Win- dows file server. Table 10.1 shows the firewall rules that need to be deployed for the remote-access solution.   Table 10.1 Firewall Rules for Case Study 1  RULE  SOURCE  DESTINATION  PORT  ACTION COMMENT  ANY  SSH server  443  Allow  1  2  3  SSH server  E-mail SMTP  server  Relay   25  Allow  SSH server  E-mail POP3  server  110  Allow  Allow any remote access client to access the SSH server on port 443  Allow the SSH  server to access port 25 on the mail- relay server  Allow the SSH  server to access port 110 on the  E-mail POP3 server   continued    334 Chapter 10  Table 10.1  continued   4  5  RULE  SOURCE  DESTINATION  PORT  ACTION COMMENT  SSH server  Intranet Web  server  80  Allow  SSH server  File server  22  Allow  Allow the SSH  server to access port 80 on the intranet Web server  Allow the SSH server to access port 22  SFTP  on the file server  Rule  1  on  the  firewall  is  the  most  obvious;  external  remote-access  clients need to be able to access the SSH server on port 443. The next four rules are in place for port-forwarding reasons. Since the remote-access SSH clients will be using the SSH server and port forwarding to access the e-mail, file-sharing, and Web servers, the SSH server will need to be allowed to access all of the other servers.   Configuration Now that the product selection and architecture have been set up for SSH, it’s time  to  examine  the  configuration  options,  which  are  the  most  important steps.  SSH Client Configuration  SecureCRT, the SSH client, needs to be configured for two items in order to meet the business requirements previously listed, which are password key- based authentication, in order to meet the two-factor authentication require- ment,  and  port-forwarding  configuration,  in  order  to  access  all  necessary servers. SSH Communications’ SFTP client also needs to be configured, since that is the client that will be used for file-sharing access. In order to create pub- lic  and  private  keys  with  SecureCRT  and  upload  to  the  VShell  SSH  server, complete the following steps  referenced from Chapter 4 .  1. Open the SSH Client: Start ➪ Programs ➪  SecureCRT 4.0 ➪  SecureCRT 4.0.  2. From the Menu bar select, Tools ➪ Create Public Key.   SSH Case Studies 335  3. The Key Generation Wizard should appear. After reading through the  introduction wizard page, select Next.  4. The Key type screen should appear next. This screen gives you the option of selecting a DSA or RSA key type. After selecting your pre- ferred key type, select Next.  5. The Passphrase screen should appear next. This screen allows you to set a passphrase that will protect the private key. The passphrase will need to be entered in order to decrypt the private key. The screen allows you to set a comment, possibly with identification information of the public and private-key pair.  6. The Key length screen should appear next. This screen allows you to   set the key length, anywhere between 512 and 2048. Generally, the higher the key length, the stronger the security; however, it will have  a greater performance penalty.   7. The Generation screen should appear next. This screen initiates the  process of actually creating the key. Move the mouse around in order to create the key. Once the process is completed, select Next.   8. The location screen should appear next. Unless you have a particular area to store the keys, it is recommended to key the keys in the default location  C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\VanDyke\Identity ; however, make sure to place NTFS permis- sions on the folder to restrict access to Guests, Everyone, and other unauthorized groups. After you select the location, click Finish.  9. You should see a pop-up box asking if you would like to use the key as  your global public key. Select No since you may have multiple keys with one single default global key.  10. VanDyke SecureCRT public and private-key pairs have been generated!  After the creation process has been completed, uploading the public key is next. The following section demonstrates how to upload a SecureCRT client public and private-key pair to a VanDyke VShell SSH server. Using a Secure- CRT public and private-key pair on VanDyke Software’s SSH server is quite simple, as the following steps show:  1. Open up SecureCRT  Start ➪ Programs ➪ 2. Make a valid connection to the VShell SSH server using the Quick   Secure CRT ➪  Secure CRT .  Connection option.   336 Chapter 10  3. Once a valid connection has been established, go back to the quick con-  nect menu  File ➪ Quick Connect . Under the authentication section, there should be two drop-down boxes. The Primary method should be Password. For the Secondary methods, choose PublicKey and select the Properties button to the right.  4. The Public Key Properties menu should appear. Make sure the Use  Global Public Key Setting radio button is selected and Use identify file radio button is also selected. After you have confirmed this, select the “...” button and browse to the location of your public key; then select the public-key file.  5. After you have selected your public-key file, select the Upload button  to upload the public key to the VShell SSH server.   6. When SecureCRT has established a connection, it will ask you to  authenticate using your username and password on the VShell SSH server. Enter the valid username and password and select OK.  7. Once the username and password are authenticated, the public key will  be uploaded to the VShell SSH server.   8. You should now be able to use your public key to authenticate. To con- firm, enable only public-key authentication on the VShell SSH server.  a. Select Start ➪ Programs ➪ VShell ➪ VShell. b. Highlight the Authentication section. c. Uncheck Password and check Public key for the required authenti- cation methods. Be sure to uncheck the Allow 3 password attempts checkbox, since the public key is already on the VShell SSH server.  9. On SecureCRT, select PublicKey for the Primary authentication method  and   for the secondary authentication method. Be sure to browse to the correct public key with the Properties button.  10. Select Connect and you will authenticate with your public key and  then receive a VShell SSH session.  Now  that  username password  and  public-key  authentication  have  been configured  on  SecureCRT,  ensure  that  the  VShell  server  is  configured  to require both username password and public-key authentication, as shown in Figure 10.2.   SSH Case Studies 337  Figure 10.2 VShell SSH server requiring both username password and public keys for authentication.  Now that the authentication requirement has been completed, you need to ensure  that  the  proper  port-forwarding  items  have  been  configured.  Figure 10.3 shows the correct port-forwarding options to be used in order to meet  the  requirement  to  access  e-mail,  file  sharing,  and  Web  servers.  Be  sure  to select the appropriate e-mail client for the application setting in the mail port- forwarding option.  Lastly, ensure that the CONNECT string is configured appropriately if any SecureCRT client ever needs to connect via a proxy server, as shown in Figure 10.4. Remember to remind users to check the “Use firewall to connect” option when they need to access the SSH server via a proxy server.  Now that SecureCRT has been configured for both authentication and port- forwarding requirements, SSH Communications’ SFTP client needs to be con- figured in order to support the file-sharing requirement. Since SFTP will be port forwarding via the SSH connection to from the file server’s SSH server, very little configuration needs to be done on the SFTP client, aside from point- ing the IP address to 127.0.0.1 on port 22, as shown in Figure 10.5.   338 Chapter 10  Figure 10.3 SecureCRT port-forwarding options in order to meet the requirements in case- study 1.  Figure 10.4 CONNECT string in SecureCRT.   SSH Case Studies 339  Figure 10.5 SFTP client’s configuration.  SSH Server Configuration  I  will  now  shift  gears  to  the  SSH  servers,  specifically  the  main  VShell  SSH server  11.17.6.12 , which will be used for remote access, and the secondary VShell SSH server on the file server  172.16.1.100 , which will be used only for the SFTP subsystem. On the main VShell SSH server  11.17.6.12 , you need to configure three items: access control, triple-DES or above cipher options, and port-forwarding filters.   First,  set  the  access-control  options  for  the  VShell  server.  Under  VShell’s Access Control section, you need to ensure that everyone has access to connect to the SSH sever, but only for port-forwarding reasons, as shown in Figure 10.6.   340 Chapter 10  Figure 10.6 Access Control section for VShell.  Second, set the cipher options for the VShell server. Under VShell’s General section,  there  is  a  subsection  called  Cipher.  Ensure  that  3DES  has  been checked. This will meet the encryption requirement listed previously.   Lastly, set the port-forwarding filters for the VShell server. Under VShell’s Port Forwarding section, you will need to ensure that only port forwarding can be allowed to the identified e-mail, Web, and file servers. This setting is optional, since the firewall will block any port-forwarding connections by SSH clients that are not allowed; however, this step adds an extra level of security. The port-forwarding filters are shown in Figure 10.7.  The  configuration  on  the  VShell  SSH  server  is  minimal  when  compared with the primary SSH server. Because the VShell SSH server is being used only for its SFTP subsystem on the file server  172.16.1.100 , only access control and SFTP need to be configured.   First, set the access-control options for the VShell server on the file server. Under  VShell’s  Access  Control  section,  you  will  need  to  ensure  that  every- one has access to connect to the SSH server, but only for SFTP, as shown in  Figure 10.8.   SSH Case Studies 341  Figure 10.7 Port-forwarding filters for VShell.  Figure 10.8 Access Control setting on the file server’s VShell service.   342 Chapter 10  Figure 10.9 SFTP settings on the file server’s VShell service.  Next, set the SFTP options for the SFTP subsystem on the file server. The file server’s  root-file  directory  is  called  Common  and  is  located  on  a  separate 500GB hard drive labeled X, which will be the partition  drive  for the SFTP root  directory.  Using  VShell  SFTP will  limit  all  remote-access  clients  to  that directory only and any subdirectories and or files, as shown in Figure 10.9.   The last order of business is to configure the other clients to use the estab- lished SSH connection for communication. While limited space does not allow each step to be described in detail  see Chapter 7 for more detailed steps , the basic idea is to use the loopback interface, 127.0.0.1, for each IP address of the desired server and port, as shown in Table 10.2.  IP ADDRESS  PORT  Table 10.2 Client Specifications  SERVICE  Mail Relay  Mail Server  SFTP  Web  http:  127.0.0.1   127.0.0.1  127.0.0.1  127.0.0.1  127.0.0.1  25  110  22  80   SSH Case Studies 343  Results Checklist After the client setup has been completed, the requirements of case study  1 will have all been met, as described in Table 10.3.  Table 10.3 Business Requirements and Results  BUSINESS REQUIREMENT  RESULTS   Must support strong level on  encryption  Triple-DES or above   The VShell SSH server has been  configured to use 3DES or above.

VShell has been configured to require a username password and a public key for authentication, as shown in Figure 10.2.  SecureCRT and VShell have been  configured to allow port forwarding to  access e-mail and intranet servers. The  perimeter firewall allows communication from the SSH server to the appropriate server.   A separate VShell service has been  installed on the file server, limited only for the SFTP subsystem and disabled for other utilities  remote access, port- forwarding, and remote execution .   The application option has been set on  SecureCRT’s port-forwarding option, which automatically executes the mail client after the SSH session has been established.   Must provide stable and consistent  performance  SSH always provides stable and  consistent performance after implementation.    344 Chapter 10  Case Study 2: Secure Wireless Connectivity  The following case study examines an organization called Virtucon. Virtucon is a domestic corporation headquartered in Fremont, California. Virtucon is a think-tank organization that generates test questions for the Iowa standard- test program. Any leakage of test questions, whether they are notes, e-mails, chat messages, Web pages, or documents, would undermine the integrity of the Iowa test results. While most Virtucon employees work on the Virtucon campus, employees are often encouraged to work anywhere and anytime on the Virtucon grounds, whether it is in a conference room, a neighbor’s cube, or even outside on a box.  The Problem  Virtucon needs to provide secure wireless connectivity for all its internal users. All  buildings  on  the  Virtucon  campus  should  be  equipped  with  wireless  802.11  connectivity for all employees, including conference rooms, outdoor lunch areas, and internal cubes and offices.   Business Requirements The following are the business requirements provided by Virtucon:    Must support strong level on encryption  Triple-DES or above  and  should not expose the internal corporate network to malicious activity    Must provide complete access for two core-computing aspects of the  organization, which are external Web access and internal e-mail External visitors, contractors consultants, and war-drivers should be completely restricted from accessing the wireless network, even for external Web-access purposes    Must require only a single action from novice end-users for e-mail and  external Web access    Must provide stable and consistent performance   Secure wireless connectivity for internal employees is a must in many orga- nizations. Despite the overwhelming number of security exposures in 802.11 wireless  networks,  many  organizations  cannot  afford  to  ignore  wireless  for much longer. This case study focuses on how to use SSH to secure wireless  802.11  networks.               SSH Case Studies 345  In  order  to  implement  secure  wireless  connectivity,  you  need  some  core requirements from the SSH servers and clients. For this case study, you will be using  the  flexibility  of  dynamic  port  forwarding   local  SOCKS  proxy ,  as described in Chapter 9, for the SSH clients. The ability to connect and port for- ward to the SSH servers, while restricting any type of access to the SSH server itself, will be required. With these two requirements for our SSH servers, the following highlights the utilities you will be using in order to satisfy Virtu- con’s business requirements:  SSH Communications’ SSH server    OpenSSH SSH client or SSH Communications’ SSH client   Any SOCKS-enabled e-mail client and Web browser  The key requirements from an architecture perspective will be the ability for the SSH server to access the core Internet connection for Virtucon and the abil- ity to access the e-mail servers. Since command-line access to the SSH server is not  desired,  command-line  access  will  need  to  be  restricted.  Furthermore, since dynamic port forwarding will be used on the SSH clients  port forward- ing via SOCKS , you will need to ensure that all Web and e-mail clients have SOCKS support. Figure 10.10 shows the architecture to fulfill the requirements.  All devices in Figure 10.10 are part of the existing architecture, except for SSH Communications’ SSH server off the perimeter firewall. Notice that the wireless-access  point  is  not  inside  the  internal  network,  but  segments  into another  zone.  This  protects  the  corporate  internal  networks  by  creating  a defense in-depth mode. If any compromise were to occur on the wireless net- work or on the SSH server connected to the wireless network, the internal cor- porate  network  would  still  be  protected.  The  wireless-access  points  in  this architecture  are  used  as  bridges  to  connect  the  wireless  clients  to  the  SSH server. With only the need for one additional item, the architecture for secure wireless access with SSH is quite simple.   In addition to the architecture, the perimeter firewall in Figure 10.10 needs to be slightly modified. The firewall needs to allow the SSH server to access the mail-relay server and the internal e-mail server. The firewall needs to allow the SSH server access to the Internet, since the SSH clients will be using the SSH server to browse the Web. Table 10.4 shows the firewall rules that need to be deployed for the secure wireless solution.           346 Chapter 10  E-mail SMTP Server  Relay  192.168.1.100  Internet  Firewall  INTERNAL NETWORK  E-mail POP3  Server  172.16.1.150  SSH Server 6.12.11.30  Wireless  Access Point  Wireless Clients  Wireless Clients  Figure 10.10 SSH architecture for case study 2.   SSH Case Studies 347  Table 10.4 Firewall Rules for Case Study 2  RULE  SOURCE  DESTINATION  PORT  ACTION  COMMENT  SSH Server  Internet  80,443  Allow  1  2  3  SSH server  E-mail SMTP  server  Relay   25  Allow  SSH server  E-mail POP3  server  110  Allow  Allow the SSH server to access the Internet, using port 80 and 443.  Allow the SSH  server to access port 25 on the mail- relay server.  Allow the SSH  server to access port 110 on the  E-mail POP3 server.  Rule 1 on the firewall is the most obvious; allow the SSH server to access the Internet.  Depending on which firewall you have deployed, make sure you do not allow the SSH server access to the entire network, specifically to the inter- nal network, but full outbound access to the Internet only . The next two rules are in place for port-forwarding reasons. Since the wireless SSH clients will be using the SSH server and port forwarding to access the e-mail, the SSH server will need to be allowed access to all of the other servers.  Configuration Now that the architecture and firewall rules have been set up for SSH, the con- figuration options need to be examined.  SSH Client Configuration  OpenSSH and SSH Communications’ command-line SSH client can both be used in this situation, since they both support dynamic port forwarding. In order to enable dynamic port forwarding to forward e-mail and Web commu- nication via the SSH server, according to Figure 10.10, complete the following steps:   348 Chapter 10  1. For OpenSSH, enter the following command:  ssh 6.12.11.30 –p 22 –l   -D 1080  2. For SSH Communications’ SSH server, enter the following command:  ssh2 6.12.11.30 –p 22 –l   -L socks 1080  3. On the SSH client, configure any relevant applications to use a SOCKS server for outbound connections. Enter the loopback address  127.0.0.1  for the IP address and port number 1080. Figures 10.11 and 10.12 show a sample SOCKS configuration of Internet Explorer and Netscape Mes- senger, respectively.  NOTE Netscape Communicator, Mozilla, Eudora, Outlook, and Outlook Express also support SOCKS.

All  communication  between  the  wireless  SSH  client  to  the  SSH  server, through the wireless-access point, is encrypted with SSH. This allows the flex- ibility of a local SOCKS server port  dynamic port forwarding  to be used with any applications that support SOCKS, while gaining the benefit of secure com- munications on any applications to and from the SSH server.   In addition to setting up SOCKS for Web and e-mail clients, be sure to keep in mind that the basic idea is to use the loopback interface, 127.0.0.1, for the SOCKS address, shown in the preceding example, and to use the server’s real address for the regular client configurations. Table 10.5 shows the configura- tions for SSH clients according to Figure 10.10.

This will allow novice Windows users to double-click the batch file  .bat  and be prompted for a pass- word only for access. Similarly, novice Unix users will have to single-click or simply  execute  the  shell  script  from  the  command  line.  To  create  the  two scripts, copy and paste the preceding SSH syntax and paste it into a blank file. In Windows, save the file as ssh.bat; in Unix, save the file as ssh.sh. Then you are done. Once novice users execute that script, the SSH command will be exe- cuted, and the end-user will be prompted only for a password.  SSH Server Configuration  The next and last focus in this case study will be to configure the SSH server itself. Since dynamic port forwarding requires nothing from the SSH server in order to work, the only items to configure on the SSH server are to ensure that strong encryption is used, from the business requirements, and that terminal access to the SSH server is restricted.   First, set the encryption settings for the SSH Communications’ SSH server. Under the SSH server’s encryption section, which is under the SSH Server Set- tings,  ensure  that  3DES  or AnyStdCipher   any  standard  cipher   is  selected. This will enforce the level of encryption the meets the business requirement previously stated, as shown in Figure 10.13.  Figure 10.13 Encryption section for SSH Communications’ SSH server.   SSH Case Studies 351  Second, set the user settings for the SSH server. Under the SSH server’s User Restrictions section, under User Authentication, ensure that Allow login for users states the domain, a forward slash, and an asterisk, such as Virtucon *  described further in Chapter 2 . This will enable all users that belong to the Virtucon domain to authenticate. Also, ensure that Permit user terminal is set to No or Admin, which will restrict terminal access to all users or allow only admin users to gain terminal access, as shown in Figure 10.14. This will allow wireless clients to port forward with the SSH server but restrict the clients to terminal access.   Results Checklist After the server setup has been completed, the requirements of case study 2 will have all been met, as described in Table 10.6.  Figure 10.14 User Restrictions on SSH Communication’s SSH server.   352 Chapter 10  Table 10.6 Business Requirements and Results  BUSINESS REQUIREMENT  RESULTS   Must support strong level on  encryption  3DES or above  and  should not expose the internal  corporate network to malicious  activity.  Must provide complete access for  two core-computing aspects of the organization, which are external  Web access and internal e-mail.  External visitors, contractors  consultants, and war-drivers  should be completely restricted  from accessing the wireless network,  even for external Web-access  purposes.  Must require only a single action  from novice end-users for e-mail  and external Web access.  Must provide stable and  consistent performance.  The SSH Communications’ SSH server has  been configured to use 3DES or above, as  shown in Figure 10.13. The wireless  network is segmented from the internal  corporate network into its own zone of the permitted firewall, as shown in  Figure 10.10.  All SSH clients have been configured to  use dynamic port forwarding, allowing  e-mail and Web communication to use a  local SOCKS server, running on 127.0.0.1, to port-forward HTTP, SMTP, and POP3 through the SSH server. The SSH server has been granted access to the Internet, mail relay, and mail server.   All users are required to have valid  accounts on the SSH server, or the  domain, or access will be denied to  unauthorized users, including free Web  access. Since all traffic on the wireless  network is encrypted, no Web or e-mail information can be sniffed from passive wireless machines.   The command-line SSH clients can be  easily scripted so that novice end-users,  either on Windows or Unix, need only to execute an SSH script file, which holds the one-line command syntax for the SSH connection, and enter the correct password to log in.  SSH always provides stable and  consistent performance after implementation.   SSH Case Studies 353  Case Study 3: Secure File Servers  The following case study examines an organization called MicroHat. Micro- Hat is a pharmaceutical organization that engineers medicine to help victims of epilepsy. There is a great deal of collaboration among engineers at Micro- Hat; therefore, secure access to file servers, where hundreds of medical docu- ments can be shared among co-workers, is provided to all employees.   The Problem  MicroHat needs to provide secure access to the corporate Microsoft Windows file  server  to  the  engineering  department,  while  using  only  Linux  Red  Hat workstations.   Business Requirements The business requirements provided by MicroHat are as follows:  SSH client must only support Red Hat Linux.    Windows server can only support SMB.   All SMB traffic must be encrypted with 3DES or above.  One of the major advantages of SSH, aside from its port-forwarding options, is its SFTP subsystem. Many, if not all organizations, need, have, and support file  servers.  Many  of  these  file  servers  contain  sensitive  information  used  to support and fuel organizations. This case study focuses on how to use SSH for a secure file server for organizations that use the Windows operating system for file servers and use Unix, or more specifically Linux, for client workstations.  To implement a secure file server, you need one core requirement from the SSH server: to encrypt all file-transfer connections that use SMB. The follow- ing lists the utilities you will be using in order to satisfy MicroHat’s business requirements:    OpenSSH for the SSH server   OpenSSH’s SSH client  smbclient for the SMB client                   354 Chapter 10  The key requirements from an architectural perspective will be quite minor. Since the engineering department belongs in the internal network, where the Windows file server also resides, each client will be able to access the server by default. All clients will require the OpenSSH SFTP client to access the SFTP subsystem on the SSH server or smbclient to access the port-forwarding SMB connections. Figure 10.15 shows the architecture to fulfill the requirements.  All devices in Figure 10.15 are part of the existing architecture, except for the OpenSSH server that has been installed on the Windows file server. All clients are Red Hat Linux and will have access to the SSH servers, which includes the SFTP subsystem, on the Windows file server.   Configuration The paragraphs that follow examine two types of configuration: SSH server configuration and SSH client configuration.  SSH Server Configuration  The first order of business is to configure OpenSSH on the Windows file server.  For more information on the installation process, see Chapter 1.  The Win- dows file server basically has two partitions with two separate disk drives. Partition 1 is for the operating system’s files, including binaries, libraries, and support files, to keep the operating system running. Partition 2 is a separate 100GB disk that is mounted as drive D. After the OpenSSH server has been installed from the Windows file server, you will need to mount the D partition for all SSH clients on the Linux workstations. To mount the D partition, com- plete the following steps:   1. Open the passwd file from c:\Program Files\OpenSSH\etc\. 2. Change the default directory for each user in the passwd file on the Windows file server. Enter  cgydrive d, as shown in the following  syntax: administrator::::administrator-account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe kusum::520::Kusum’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe sudhanshu::521::Sudhanshu’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe neeraja::522::Neeraja’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe kanchan::523::Kanchan’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe jignesh::524::Jignesh’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe anand::525::Anand’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe   SSH Case Studies 355  amiee::526::Amiee’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe amit::527::Amit’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe katie::528::Katie’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe rohan::529::Rohan’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe shreya::530::Shreya’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe shashi::531::Shashi’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe prabha::532::Prabha’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe chandradhar::533::Chandradhar’s-Account: cygdrive d: ssh switch.exe 3. Stop and restart the OpenSSH service using the following commands:  c:\net stop “OpenSSH Server” c:\net start “OpenSSH Server”  Now the Windows file server has an OpenSSH server running on the sys- tem, with all users in the engineering group having access to the D partition.   Linux Clients  Linux Clients  INTERNAL NETWORK  Windows File Server  SSH Server  172.16.1.100  Figure 10.15 SSH architecture for case study 3.   356 Chapter 10  SSH Client Configuration  The  second  order  of  business  is  to  configure  the  smbclient  and  OpenSSH clients  on  the  Red  Hat  Linux  workstations.  Since  both  the  smbclient  and OpenSSH client are included by default on the RedHat Linux 8.0 operating system, no special installation is required. For the Linux clients to access the Windows file server in a secure fashion, two separate methods can be used: SFTP or  SMB  with  port  forwarding.  To  connect  to  the  Windows  file  server using SFTP on the Linux clients, complete the following steps:  1. Change directories to  usr bin, where the SFTP client is located, shown  with the following syntax: cd  usr bin  2. Type the appropriate SFTP command to connect to the SSH server on  port 22. Enter the password when prompted, as shown in the following syntax: sftp administrator@172.16.1.100 administrator@172.16.1.100’s password:  3. After the correct password is entered, you will have SFTP prompt to  upload and download files from the Windows file server over a secure channel, as shown in the following syntax: sftp>  To connect to the Windows file server using smbclient and port forwarding  on the Linux clients, complete the following steps:  1. Change directories to  usr bin, where the SSH client is located, shown  with the following syntax: cd  usr bin  2. Type the appropriate SSH command to connect to the SSH server on  port 22. Be sure to port forward the required SMB ports, which would be port 445 on both the local workstation and remote host  or 139 if NT 4.0 or lower is being used . Enter the password when prompted, as shown in the following syntax: ssh administrator@172.16.1.100 -L 445:172.16.1.100:445 administrator@172.16.1.100’s password:   SSH Case Studies 357  3. After the correct password has been entered, you will have a valid SSH  prompt on the Window file server, which would be the d:\ prompt from the cygdrive entered earlier. Furthermore, you will have a port- forwarding session enabled on your local Linux workstation, using port 445, to the remote Windows file server, also using port 445.   4. After the SSH session and port-forwarding entries have been enabled,  open a different shell on the Linux client. Type the appropriate smb- client syntax that connects to your loopback interface  127.0.0.1 , which will then be port forwarded to the remote SMB service  the Windows file server’s protocol for file transfer  over the encrypted SSH tunnel: smbclient \\\\127.0.0.1\\D -U administrator –p 445  5. After entering in the correct password, you will be given an SMB  prompt to transfer files to and from the Windows file server over an encrypted SSH tunnel, as shown in the following syntax: smb: \>  Now all engineering users can use SSH port forwarding to use smbclient, which  allows  access  to  the  Windows  file  server  in  a  secure  and  encrypted  manner.  Results Checklist After  the  setup  has  been  completed,  the  requirements  of  case  study  3  will have all been met, as described in Table 10.7.  Table 10.7 Business Requirements and Results  BUSINESS REQUIREMENT  RESULTS   All SMB traffic must be encrypted  with 3DES or above.  OpenSSH server and client can always  support 3DES or above encryption.  The SSH client must support only  RedHat Linux.  Windows server can support only SMB.  All RedHat Linux workstations have  OpenSSH installed, which holds utilities such as SSH and SFTP by default. Also, smbclient is available on all RedHat Linux machines.   The Windows file server was not modified, except for the fact that OpenSSH was installed on the file server, which does not affect the SMB networking protocol.    358 Chapter 10  Summary  This chapter presents three case studies that describe several of the key items discussed in this book. The chapter begins with secure remote access, one of the strongest and most powerful uses of SSH. SSH has provided the ability  for  secure  remote  access  since  SSH  version  2  was  developed.  The  chapter  then shifts to a more recent problem that SSH has been able to solve. Insecure wireless   802.11   connectivity  is  a  new  issue  that  many  organizations  are unprepared  for.  Wireless  networks  brought  so  much  ease  and  flexibility  to end-users, but devastated corporate security architecture and policies. Even though SSH was developed long before wireless networks were introduced, due to SSH’s flexibility, secure wireless connectivity with SSH has become rel- atively easy. Lastly, the third case study focuses on a very straightforward fea- ture of SSH, which is providing secure file access among different operating systems. The key idea behind this case study is to demonstrate that SSH is not a Unix-only tool, although most of its history resides in the Unix world, but a utility that can work in both the Windows world and the Unix world. While different operating systems provide different types of file-sharing protocols, such as SMB and NFS, without a lot of security, SSH is not only able to bridge the gap between different systems when it comes to dependable file sharing, but is also able to offer such functionality in a secure manner.    Epilogue  In many types of competitive events, certain groups, teams, and organizations receive awards and recognitions based on their outstanding capabilities and accomplishments. Some of the awards are called All-American, All-state, All- conference,  All-academic,  All-star,  All-first-team,  All-region,  or  All-pro. Because SSH can do so much and can do it all very well, the perfect name for it would be All-everything. SSH can offer secure remote access; secure SOCKS; secure  Telnet;  secure  RSH Rlogin;  secure  backups;  secure  FTP;  secure  file transfer  SMB NFS ; secure authentication; secure management; secure wire- less; secure e-mail; and secure Web browsing. With so much to offer, there is no comparison between SSH and any other utility.   This book has taken a methodical approach toward describing SSH, even though it feels as though I have just hit the tip of the iceberg. I introduce some of the basics of SSH in Chapter 1, describing its features and popular uses. While Chapter 1 discusses why you should use SSH, the focus of the rest of the book is to show you how to use SSH. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss some of the major  SSH  servers  and  clients  to  make  you  aware  of  all  the  basics  of  these products. Then the book turns to the details of how to optimize SSH. Chapter 4 describes the authentication advances of SSH, such as username password, public-key authentication, server-side authentication, and host-based authen- tication. Chapter 4 shows how to implement the various authentication fea- tures  of  SSH,  while  making  the  process  seemly  for  the  end-user.  Chapter  5 shifts gears and shows how SSH can be used with other products for secure  359   360 Epilogue  management. While many organizations secure many aspects of their archi- tecture, some architects forget how important management security becomes, especially  when  considering  that  management  connections  hold  advanced privileges. Chapters 6 and 7 are dedicated to one of the strongest features of SSH: port forwarding. SSH’s ability to port forward any TCP port gives it the ability to provide security to many insecure entities such as mail, file transfer, management, and so on. Chapter 8 shows how to use SSH in some of the typ- ical means, such as an RSH or Rlogin replacement, and then demonstrates how to use it with file transfer and secure backups. Lastly, Chapter 9 discusses the use  of  SSH  and  SOCKS  and  dynamic  port  forwarding.  This  chapter  shows how to use two existing features of SSH and how to make SSH architecture more streamlined with the use of SOCKS or how to apply SSH architecture to new dangerous technologies such as wireless networks.   To  best  summarize  SSH,  I  have  to  refer  to  the  opening  paragraph  of  this book, which states that SSH can be described in many different ways. It can be described as a protocol, an encryption tool, a client server application, or a command interface. Along with its various descriptions, SSH provides various functions with a single package. SSH’s diverse set of services, and the ability to provide those services in a secure manner, have allowed it to become a staple in many enterprise networks.  All in all, I have discussed a lot of faces of SSH in this book, each of which can add, establish, or support functionally and security requirements in any architecture. Whether SSH will be used as a Telnet replacement or as a utility to  secure  90  percent  of  your  network  architecture,  it  has  the  ability  to  be deployed so that it is flexible and optimal to your organization.  Mahatma Gandhi once said, “I have nothing new to teach the world, truth and non-violence are as old as the hills.” Although Gandhi was always ahead of his time, you probably never thought his words would be applied to SSH. Gandhi  showed  the  world  how  an  old  idea  can  be  used  to  overcome  the biggest challenges when it is applied in an optimal way. Similarly, all the core encryption features, flexibility techniques, functionality methods, and security utilities discussed in this book are not new to SSH but have always existed. This book is just a tool to help both novice and expert SSH users familiarize themselves with SSH and to demonstrate the many ways to optimize it.
