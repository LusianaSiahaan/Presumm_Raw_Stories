Unlike  working in graphical environments, it's not entirely clear what commands one must  execute in a terminal to accomplish a given task. Couple this with the fact that the  command line does not prevent you from doing things that might cause irreparable  damage to your system, and it becomes clear why many people never take the time  to learn how to use it.    Despite the hidden dangers and uncertainty faced by new users  known jokingly as  "newbies"  in  the  technology  industry ,  you  shouldn't  fear  the  command  line.  Armed  with  the  information  in  this  book  you  will  acquire  the  skills  necessary  to  become more proficient in the command line  environment. You will discover that  most  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems  share  the  same  core  architecture,  with  only  a  few subtle differences. After learning the basic architecture and commands of Unix,  Linux, and BSD systems you will easily be able to transition between the different  platforms.    To  aid  the  learning  process,  I  recommend  downloading  one  or  more  of  the  free  operating systems listed below to practice the commands in this guide.      Operating System   Ubuntu  Fedora  CentOS   openSUSE  OpenSolaris   FreeBSD   Type  Linux  Linux  Linux  Linux  Unix  BSD   Website  www.ubuntu.com  www.fedoraproject.org  www.centos.org  www.opensuse.org  www.opensolaris.org  www.freebsd.org     It's  a  worthwhile  experience  to  experiment  with  multiple  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  distributions  to  get  a  broader  knowledge  of  the  various  platforms.  This  will  help  expand your knowledge of the various Unix-like operating systems and give you the  skills necessary to work in any command line environment.     Linux  is  the  recommended  starting  point  for  beginners.  It  has  support  for  all  the  latest  hardware and provides a  user-friendly installation process.  The  OpenSolaris       Unix platform is also a good starting point, as it is one of the most newbie-friendly  Unix-based  systems.  BSD  installation  is  a  bit  more  challenging  and  requires  advanced technical knowledge or previous experience with Unix and Linux systems.     Tip   I  highly  recommend  Ubuntu  Server  Edition.  It  provides  an  easy  install  experience  and  an  excellent  command  line  learning  environment.  Visit  www.ubuntu.com  for  more  information  about  the  Ubuntu  Server  Linux  distribution.     If  you  are  a  Microsoft  Windows  user,  you  may  already  have  some  command  line  experience. If you have ever opened a DOS prompt and executed a command such  as ping, nslookup,  or ipconfig then  you  know  these  can  be  immensely  helpful.  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems  offer  similar  commands.  For  example,  the  ping and nslookup commands  work  the  same  on  Unix Linux  as  they  do  in  DOS.  You  should  note,  however,  that  the  DOS  ipconfig  command's  counterpart  in  the  Unix Linux BSD  world  is ifconfig.  If  you're  not  a  DOS  veteran, don't worry - we will cover all of these topics throughout this guide.    Are  you  running  Mac  OS  X?  If  so,  then  you  are  already  running  a  Unix-based  operating system. Behind the shiny graphical user interface of Mac OS X is a solid  Unix  core.  To  access  the  command  line  in  Mac  OS  X  simply  launch  the  Terminal  application   located  in  Applications  >  Utilities  >  Terminal .  From  there  you  will  have access to all the standard Unix command line utilities discussed in this guide.    Brief History of Unix, Linux, and BSD   Unix  was  created  in  1969  at  Bell  Laboratories  which  was,  at  the  time,  a  research  and development  division of  AT&T. Since that  time,  Unix has branched  into  many  different  commercial and open source implementations,  most of which are based  on the original AT&T standard. Modern Unix-based systems are typically classified  into one of the following groups:     Commercial implementations derived from the original AT&T code base  Open source operating system derived from the original Unix code base   Unix  BSD  Linux  Open source Unix compatible clone written from scratch     In the 1970s, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley began developing  BSD   short  for  Berkeley  Software  Distribution .  BSD  was  originally  based  on  the  AT&T  Unix  codebase,  but  has  been  rewritten  over  time  to  remove  AT&T  copyrighted code from the system. This allows BSD to be distributed  with minimal  restrictions.  Since  that  time,  the  BSD  code-base  has  split  to  form  a  number  of    popular operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD. BSD code can  also  be  found  in  proprietary  proprietary  operating  systems  created  by  Microsoft,  Apple, and Sun Microsystems.    Commercial  Unix  systems  began  to  appear  in  the  early  1980s.  These  systems  combined  various  amounts  of  Unix  and  BSD  code  along  with  vendor-specific  enhancements to create new platforms such as AIX, HP-UX, and Sun Solaris. Today,  commercial  Unix  systems  can  be  found  in  data  centers  at  many  large  companies  running mission critical applications.    In 1991, a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland named  Linus Torvalds created the Linux operating system. While Linux shares much of the  core  concepts  of  Unix,  it  contains  no  Unix  code.  This  means  it  can  be  freely  distributed  in  the  same  manner  as  BSD   although  under  a  different  license .  The  first  commercial  Linux  distributions  hit  the  market  in  the  mid  1990s.  Since  then  hundreds  of  Linux  variants  have  been  developed.  The  open  nature  of  the  Linux  operating system has contributed to its success and helped make it one of the most  popular server operating systems in use today.    The Unix platform has been around since long before graphical user interfaces were  invented. The fact that Unix-based systems are still a commanding force in modern  computing is a testament to the industrial design of the platform. With Unix, Linux,  and  BSD  popularity  at  an  all  time  high,  now  is  the  perfect  time  to  explore  these  platforms and join the movement.

The kernel provides  a layer between the computer hardware and user applications. When applications  need to display output  to a  screen or  write files to the disk, the kernel facilitates  these actions. Think of the kernel as the conductor in a symphony; it directs all the  actions of the operating system.      Overview of the Kernel        When you type a command on the keyboard, the computer hardware receives the  signals and transfers them to the kernel. The kernel recognizes the key strokes and  draws them on the display. Once the typed command is executed, the program will  utilize  the  kernel  to  request  processor,  memory,  and  other  resources  in  order  to  perform the requested task.       Popular Versions of Unix, Linux, and BSD   There are many different  Unix, Linux, and BSD distributions.  The tables below  list  the most popular systems in use today.

The  table  below lists the main directories commonly used across all platforms.        Directory   Purpose   Root  top level  directory  Linux kernel and boot loader files   Unix kernel directories   Core binary programs for normal users   Administrative programs primarily used by the root user   Optional add-on third-party software  System configuration files  User home directories  Home directory of the root user  Shared libraries used by various programs   Mounted local and remote file systems   Variable data  such as system logs  that changes often  Temporary files used by various programs  Device files  Virtual device driver files used by the kernel  Virtual  parameter  and  informational  files  used  by  the  kernel    lost+found  Files that have been recovered  after a system failure    Unix, Linux, and BSD directory structure     These directories are organized in a  manner which  separates various  components  of the operating system in an easy to manage file structure. The  home directory  is where users spend most of their time. Files outside of this directory are usually  secured  so  that  only  the  root  user  can  edit  or  delete  them.  This  protects  vital  programs and configuration files and prevents users from accidently damaging the  core  operating  system.  It  also  helps  secure  the  system  by  preventing  malicious  programs from being able to compromise critical files and settings.       Important Files   In addition to sharing a similar directory structure, most systems will also have the  important files listed in following table.     File    etc passwd    etc shadow    etc group    etc fstab    etc mtab    etc inittab    etc exports    etc hosts    etc hostname    etc hosts.allow   Purpose   User account settings  Encrypted passwords for user accounts  Group settings  Local file system settings  Mounted file systems  System startup settings  NFS share settings  Static name resolution file  System host name setting  Network hosts allowed to connect to the  system    etc resolve.conf  DNS settings    etc motd    etc issue    etc issue.net    etc hosts.deny   Network hosts not allowed to connect to the  system  Message displayed at shell login  Remote login message  Message displayed after logging in  Shell environment settings  Valid shells permitted to login  Users allowed to use the su command   discussed on page 91    var log messages  Kernel messages log file    etc profile    etc sudoers    etc shells    var log wtmp    var log lastlog   Current user login log file  User login history log file    var log kern.log  Kernel log file    var log syslog   Syslog messages log file   Important files     This  is  just  a  brief  list  of  the  most  commonly  used  files  shared  across  most  platforms. As a general rule, configuration files are located in the  etc directory  and system logs are stored in  var log. As you become more familiar with Unix,  Linux, and BSD systems you will begin  working with these files to manage system  configuration and troubleshoot problems.     Common Unix, Linux, and BSD File Systems   Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  share  support  for  several  types  of  file  systems.  The  table  below  provides  a  matrix  of  the  most  common  file  systems  and  their  supported  platforms.        EXT2-4  JFS  IBM   HFS+  UFS  VxFS  ZFS   AIX  Partial   Yes   No   No   Yes   No   No   No   No   Yes   Yes   No   HP-UX   Solaris  Partial   BSD  Partial   No   No   Yes   Yes   Yes   No   No   Yes   No   Yes   Linux   Yes   Yes   Partial   Partial   Yes   Yes   File system support matrix       EXT  versions  2  through  4  are  file  systems  used  by  the  Linux  operating  system.   Currently,  ext3  is  the  most  widely  used  file  system  on  Linux  distributions.  The  recently released ext4 file system has many new features and performance benefits  over ext3. It will become the default file system for most Linux systems within the  next few years. Versions before ext3 are considered obsolete and are rarely.    JFS is IBM's journaling file system primarily used on the AIX operating system.    HFS+  is  Apple's  file  system  used  on  their  Unix-based  Mac  OS  X  operating  system.  HFS+ isn't  widely supported by other operating systems but it can be mounted as  read-only on Linux systems.    UFS is a Unix file system used primarily by BSD distributions.    VxFS  is  a  file  system  developed  by  Veritas  Software  Corporation   now  known  as  Symantec  and used on HP-UX systems. It is also supported on  several other Unix  and Linux systems although it is rarely used outside of HP-UX.    ZFS  is  a  new  and  highly  robust  file  system  developed  by  Sun  Microsystems.  It  is  primarily  used  on  the  Solaris  operating  system  but  also  has  limited  support  for  some Linux and BSD systems.         Devices   Every  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  system  has  a  directory  that  is  known  as  dev.  This  directory contains device files  sometime referred to as special files  that represent  hardware installed on the system such as  dev mouse and  dev cdrom.       ls -l  dev    crw-rw----+ 1 root audio  14,  12 2010-04-22 16:30 adsp   crw-------  1 root video  10, 175 2010-04-22 11:30 agpgart   crw-rw----+ 1 root audio  14,   4 2010-04-22 16:30 audio   crw-rw----  1 root root   10,  59 2010-04-22 11:30 binder   drwxr-xr-x  2 root root       700 2010-04-22 16:30 block   drwxr-xr-x  3 root root        60 2010-04-22 11:30 bus   lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root         3 2010-04-22 16:30 cdrom -> sr0   lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root         3 2010-04-22 16:30 cdrw -> sr0   drwxr-xr-x  2 root root      3220 2010-04-22 16:30 char   crw-------  1 root root    5,   1 2010-04-23 07:36 console   lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root        11 2010-04-22 16:30 core ->  proc kcore   crw-rw----  1 root root   10,  58 2010-04-22 11:30 cpu_dma_latency   drwxr-xr-x  6 root root       120 2010-04-22 11:30 disk   drwxr-xr-x  2 root root        80 2010-04-22 11:30 dri   crw-rw----+ 1 root audio  14,   3 2010-04-22 16:30 dsp   lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root         3 2010-04-22 16:30 dvd -> sr0   ...      Example listing of devices in the  dev directory   Within the  dev directory there can be several hundred files. Most of these files  are of little use in everyday activities. As the system administrator of a Unix or Linux  system you will primarily be working with the device files that represent your disk  drive s .  Knowing  the  path  to  your  hard  drive  is  important  when  working  with  commands  related  to  file  systems.  More  on  this  topic  is  covered  in  Section  10  of  this guide.     Note  Device naming conventions used in  dev vary across each distribution.     Within  dev, there are also a few helpful pseudo-devices. Pseudo-devices do not  represent  actual  hardware  and  exist  only  to  perform  a  specific  task.  The  table  below describes the most commonly used pseudo-devices.     File   Purpose    dev zero    dev random    dev null   File that produces a continuous stream of 0-byte characters  Random number generator  Special file that discards any data written to it    The Shell   The command line interpreter, also known as the shell, is  a  program that  accepts  input from a user  typically a command of some sort  and performs the requested  task. Once that task has completed, the program will terminate and return the user  to the shell.    The shell's prompt identifies the type of shell being used. There are two basic types  of shell prompts:      $  Normal user shell   may also be % or > on some systems     Root user shell     Below  is  the  output  of  the whoami  command   discussed  on  page  94   which  highlights  the  difference  between  normal  user  and  root  shell  prompts  on  the  command line.     $ whoami  nick    whoami  root         Normal user shell   Root user shell     Normal users typically have a limited amount of access to the system while the root  user has unrestricted access. Section 5 covers this topic in more detail.     Warning   The  root  user  can  do  anything  on  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems.  It  is  important to know when you are working as root to prevent accidental  damage to your system.     Many  systems  add  customized  information  to  the  shell  prompt.  This  information  can be a handy indicator of things like the current user's login name, system host  name, and the current directory as shown in the next example.     nick@mylaptop: var log $   Example of a customized shell prompt     The  table  below  describes  the  information  displayed  in  the  customized  shell  prompt displayed in the previous example.     nick   @  mylaptop   :    var log   $   User  Name   Spacer   Computer    Spacer   Name   Current  Directory   Shell   Prompt       Types of Shells   There  are  several  different  types  of  shells  for  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems.  Each  shell  has  its  own  set  of  features  and  usage  syntax.  The  next  table  describes  the  most popular shells that are currently available.     Shell  Prompt  sh   $   Name   Notes   bash   csh   tcsh   ksh   $   %  >  $   Borne Shell  Default on some Unix systems   Borne   Again Shell   C Shell  T C Shell  Korn shell   Enhanced replacement for the Borne shell  Default on most Linux and Mac OS X systems  Default on many BSD systems  Enhanced replacement for the C shell  Default on AIX systems  Types of shells     The bash shell is the most popular shell in use today. It is the default shell on all  Linux systems and is also available for most Unix and BSD systems. Other shells like  csh, tcsh, and ksh are typically used by default on non-Linux systems.    Accessing the Shell   When you first boot your system you are presented with a login prompt similar to  the example pictured below.     Ubuntu Linux 9.04   Login: nick   Password: ******         $      After  you  enter  your  username  and  password  the  system  will  authenticate  your  login  credentials  via  the  etc passwd file.  If  the  login  information  is  correct,  the system will start your shell  which is also specified in  etc passwd . The $  shell prompt indicates you are logged in and "ready to go."     Welcome to the world of the command line… Let's get started!      Section 2:   Command Line Basics     Overview   This section covers the  most  essential commands every user should know.  These  basic  commands  cover  topics  like  getting  help,  navigating  directories,  and  listing  files. Before you begin, there are three important rules you need to know about the  command line:     1.  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems  are  case   and  space   sensitive.  This  means  that a file named MyFile is not same as myfile as it would be on a   DOS or Windows system.   2.  There is no "recycle bin" or "trash can" when working in the command line  environment. When files are deleted on the command line, they instantly  disappear forever.   3.  You should always practice new commands on a testing system that is not  used  in  a  production  environment.  This  minimizes  the  chances  of  an  accident that can take down an important system.     Knowing  this,  we  can  now  begin  working  with  basic  Unix,  Linux  and  BSD  commands.     Note   Examples listed in this book were created on various Unix, Linux, and BSD  systems. Many of the commands,  options, and features are the same on  other  platforms;  however,  there  may  be  slight  differences.  You  should  always  consult  the  manual  for  your  specific  platform  to  ensure  compatibility  with  the  examples  provided.  See  page  20  for  more  information on how to access the online manual.          Commands covered in this section:     Command   man   whatis   ls   pwd   cd   tree   find   file   stat   date   cal   locate   whereis   Purpose   Online manual for command line programs.

Viewing the manual page for the ls command     The man command displays the manual   often referred to as the  man page  for  the specified  command.  Each manual page provides detailed information  about a  command's  options  and  usage.  In  the  above  example,  executing  man  ls  displays the manual for the ls command.     The  table  below  describes  the  keys  that  can  be  used  to  navigate  the  manual  program.     Key   Function   Key   Function   Up Arrow  Navigate one line up  Navigate one page up  Page Up  Quit the man program   Q   Down Arrow  Navigate one line down  Navigate one page down  Page Down   [STRING]  Search for a string of text     The man command is your most valuable resource for help on the command line.  Always look to the manual pages for any command if you are unsure of  its proper  usage syntax.    Common usage examples:  man [COMMAND]   Display the manual for the specified command  man -k [KEYWORD]  Search manual pages for the specified keyword       whatis    Purpose: Display a description of the specified command.    Usage syntax: whatis [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]   $ whatis ls   ls  1                - list directory contents   Viewing the manual description of the ls command     whatis displays  a  brief  description  of  the  specified  command.  The  above  example  displays  the  description  of  the ls command  using whatis.  This  can  be used as a helpful reminder of a command's purpose without having to refer to  the man command.    Multiple  commands  can  be  used  with  one  whatis  query  to  display  the  description  of  each  individual  command.  For  example,  typing whatis ls who  rm would display the description of all three commands at once as demonstrated  in the next example.     $ whatis ls who rm   ls  1                - list directory contents   who  1               - show who is logged on   rm  1                - remove files or directories   Viewing the manual description of multiple commands      Note   Some  Unix  systems  may  use  the  apropos  command  in  place  of  whatis.       Common usage examples:  whatis [COMMAND]   whatis -w [WILDCARD]  Search for commands using a wildcard   Display the description of the specified command    ls    Purpose: List the contents of a directory.    Usage syntax: ls [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY FILE]   $ ls   Notes.txt  ShoppingList.txt  ToDoList.txt     Typical output of the ls command     Executing the ls command displays a simple list of files in the current directory,  as  shown  in  the  above  example.  To  see  more  information  about  the  files  in  a  directory  you  can  use  command  line  options  to  activate  additional  features,  as  demonstrated in the next example.     $ ls -l   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick sales 35068 2009-05-19 08:41 Notes.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick sales    23 2009-05-19 08:43 ShoppingList.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick sales    37 2009-05-19 08:43 ToDoList.txt   Using the -l option with the ls command     In this example, the -l option is used to produce a detailed list of files including  the  permissions,  owner,  group,  and  modification  date time.  The  table  below  describes the output of the ls -l command.     Permissions  Number of   Owner &   Size  Modification Date   File or   Links   Group   Directory   -rw-r--r--   nick sales  35068  2009-05-19 08:41  Notes.txt   1  Description of fields displayed with the ls -l command     Most  command  line  programs  have  numerous  options  available.  The  ls  command  is  no  exception.  By  combining  these  options  you  can  activate  multiple  features  at  the  same  time.  For  example,  combining  the -a option  with  -l  produces a detailed file list that includes hidden files  files begin with a dot .     $ ls -l -a   drwxr-xr-x  2 nick sales  4096 2009-05-19 21:14 .   drwxr-xr-x 92 nick sales  4096 2009-05-19 20:46 ..   -rw-r--r--  1 nick sales   168 2009-05-19 21:14 .MyHiddenFile   -rw-r--r--  1 nick sales 35068 2009-05-19 08:41 Notes.txt   -rw-r--r--  1 nick sales    23 2009-05-19 08:43 ShoppingList.txt   -rw-r--r--  1 nick sales    37 2009-05-19 08:43 ToDoList.txt   Using multiple options with the ls command    Continued…        Tip   Most  command  line  options can  be  combined using  shorthand  notation.  For example, ls -l -a can be shortened to ls -la.      Note   Command line options are not universal. Each  command has its own set  of  options  that  are  specific  to  that  program.  Additionally,  each  implementation  of  the  same  command  on  different  platforms  may  use  different options. Refer to the man pages for a complete list of command  line options supported on your system.       Common usage examples:  ls   ls [DIRECTORY]   ls -l   ls -la   ls -lh   ls -R   Display a basic list of files in the current directory  Display a basic list of files in the specified directory  List files with details  List hidden files  List file sizes in "human readable format"  KB, MB, etc.   Recursively list all subdirectories   ls -d [DIRECTORY]  List only the specified directory  not its contents       pwd    Purpose: Display the current working directory.    Usage syntax: pwd   $ pwd    home nick   Using the pwd command the display the current directory     The pwd command   short  for  Print  Working  Directory   displays  your  current  location  within  the  file  system.  In  the  above  example,  executing pwd displays   home nick as the current working directory.     Note   Unix, Linux, and BSD systems use a forward slash  i.e.   home nick  to  separate  directory  names  in  contrast  to  MS-DOS  and  Windows  systems  which use a back slash  i.e. C:\Windows\system32 .       Common usage examples:  pwd  Display the current working directory.       cd    Purpose: Change  navigate  directories.    Usage syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]   $ cd  etc   $ pwd    etc   Using the cd command to navigate to the  etc directory     The cd command  short for Change Directories  changes your location within the  file  system  to  the  specified  path.  In  the  above  example,  executing cd  etc  makes  etc the new working directory.    The cd command  interprets  directory  paths  relative  to  your  current  location  unless  you  manually  specify  a  full  path   such  as cd  etc as  used  in  the  first  example.  The next example demonstrates using cd to change directories relative  to the current location.     $ pwd    home nick   $ cd documents   $ pwd    home nick documents   Using the cd command to navigate to a directory relative to the current location     In this example, the starting directory is  home nick. Typing cd documents  makes   home nick documents the  new  working  directory.  If  you  were  starting  in  a  different  location  you  would  have  to  type  the  full  path   i.e.   cd  home nick documents  to achieve the same results. Since the previous  location was  home nick, typing the full path is not necessary.     Tip   Executing  the cd command  with  no  options  returns  you  to  your  home  directory regardless of your current location.       Common usage examples:  cd [DIRECTORY]  Navigate to the specified directory  cd   cd -   cd ..   Navigate to the user's home directory  Go back to the previous working directory   Navigate up one level in the directory tree    tree    Purpose: Display the contents of a directory in a tree hierarchy format.    Usage syntax: tree [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]   -- cdrom -> media cdrom   $ cd     $ tree -d -L 2   .   -- bin   -- boot      `-- grub   -- dev      -- block      -- bus      -- char      -- disk      -- input   ...   -- etc      -- fd ->  proc self fd      -- ConsoleKit      -- NetworkManager      -- PolicyKit      -- X11      -- acpi      -- alsa      -- alternatives   ...   Tree listing of directory structures     The tree command  displays  a  directory  listing  in  tree  form.  This  is  useful  for  visualizing  the  layout  of  a  directory  structure.  In  the  above  example,  executing   tree -d -L 2 displays  2  directory  levels   relative  to  the  current  location   in  tree form.      Common usage examples:  tree   tree [DIR]   tree -a   tree -d   Display the contents of the current directory in tree form  Display the contents of the specified directory in tree form  Include hidden files in the tree listing  List directories only   tree -L [NUM]  List the specified number of levels deep       find    Purpose: Search for files and directories.    Usage syntax: find [PATH] [OPTIONS] [CRITERIA]    find   -name hosts    etc avahi hosts    etc hosts    usr share hosts   Using the find command to locate files with the word "hosts" in their name     The find command  performs  a  raw  search  on  a  file  system  to  locate  the  specified items. You can search for files using a number of characteristics - the most  common  being  file  name,  owner,  size,  or  modification  time.  The  above  example  displays the  results of a  search  for files that  contain the word  "hosts" in their file  name.     The next example displays the results of a search for files owned by the specified  user located within the  var directory.      find  var -user nick    var mail nick   Locating files owned by a specific user within the  var directory   Note   Since  the  find command  performs  a  raw  search  on  the  file  system,  results can sometimes be slow. It's a good idea to narrow your search to a  specific location instead of the entire file system. This will produce faster  results and not bog down the system while searching.       Common usage examples:  find [PATH] -name [NAME]   find [PATH] -user [USERNAME]  Find files owned by the specified user  find [PATH] -size [FILESIZE]  Find files larger than the specified size  find [PATH] -mtime 0  Find files modified in the last 24 hours   Find files with the specified name            locate    Purpose: Search the locate database for files and directories.    Usage syntax: locate [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY FILE]   $ locate hosts    etc avahi hosts    etc hosts    usr share hosts   Searching the locate database for files that contain the word "hosts" in their name     The locate command  displays  the  location  of  files  that  match  the  specified  name.  While  similar  to  the  find command, locate is  significantly  faster  because it searches a database of indexed filenames rather than performing a raw  search  of the entire file  system. A disadvantage of the  locate command is  the  fact  that  it  lacks  the  ability  to  search  for  advanced  characteristics  such  as  file  owner, size, and modification time.    Most  Linux  and  BSD  systems  have  implemented locate in  order  to  provide  a  quick  method  to  locate  files  by  name  without  affecting  the  performance  of  the  system.     Note   The locate database is updated daily via an automatically scheduled  cron  job   discussed  on  page  121   that  indexes  all  local  file  systems.  By  default, this usually happens once a day. This means that results are not  updated in real-time and newly created or deleted files may not reflect in  the results until the next scheduled update.       Common usage examples:  locate [FILE]   locate -i [FILE]  Ignore case when searching   Locate the specified file       whereis    Purpose: Display the location of binary files, manual pages, and source code for the  specified command.    Usage syntax: whereis [OPTIONS] [COMMAND FILE]   $ whereis ls   ls:  bin ls  usr share man man1 ls.1.gz   Displaying the file locations of the ls program using whereis     whereis displays  the  file  locations  for  the  specified  command.  In  the  above  example, whereis displays the binary file and manual page location for the ls  command.      Note   If  the  source  code  is  available, whereis will  also  display  the  location  of the source files for the specified command. Source code is not installed  by default on most systems.      Tip   The which  command  is  similar  to whereis except  it  only  displays  results for binary commands. This is useful when you only care to see the  path  to  the  binary  file  for  the  specified  command.  For  example,  typing  which ls would  display  the  location  of  binary  the  file  for  the ls  command. See man which for more information.       Common usage examples:  whereis [COMMAND]   Display the location of the specified command   whereis -b [COMMAND]  Display binary programs only  whereis -m [COMMAND]  Display manual pages only  whereis -s [COMMAND]  Display source code only  if available     file    Purpose: Display the file type of the specified file.    Usage syntax: file [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ file  bin bash    bin bash: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1  SYSV ,   dynamically linked  uses shared libs , for GNU Linux 2.6.15, stripped   $ file  etc hosts    etc hosts: ASCII English text  $ file  home nick backup.tgz  backup.tgz: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Tue May 19   22:29:29 2009   $ file  dev cdrom    dev cdrom: symbolic link to 'sr0'   $ file  dev sr0    dev sr0: block special   Using the file command to identify several different types of files     The file command displays information about the contents of the specified file.  Microsoft  Windows  systems  often  use  a  file  extension   such  as .txt, .exe,  .zip,  etc.   to  identify  the  type  of  data  found  in  a  file.  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  files  rarely include an extension which can make identifying their file type a challenge.  The file command is provided to resolve this problem.    The above example displays results for several file types commonly found on Unix,  Linux, and BSD systems. The table below displays more information about these file  types.     Type   Ascii Text Files   Binary Files   Compressed Files   Device Files   Links   Description   Plain text files  Executable  programs  such  as  those  located  in  the  bin  and  usr bin directories  Files  compressed  through  programs  Special virtual files that represent devices  Links  AKA shortcuts  that point to other files or directories   the  compress  or  gzip   Basic file types found on Unix, Linux, and BSD systems       Common usage examples:  file [FILE]  Display the file type for the specified files       stat    Purpose: Display extended information about a file system, file, or directory.    Usage syntax: stat [OPTIONS] [FILE DIRECTORY]   $ stat  etc hosts    File: ' etc hosts'    Size: 266          Device: 805h 2053d   Access:  0644 -rw-r--r--   Uid:      0    root    Gid:      0     root    Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file  Inode: 788         Links: 1   Access: 2009-05-25 20:47:14.916626707 -0500   Modify: 2009-05-25 20:46:57.512623325 -0500   Change: 2009-05-25 20:46:57.512623325 -0500   Displaying information for the  etc hosts file using the stat command     The stat command displays extended information about files. It includes helpful  information  not  available  when  using  the ls command  such  as  the  file's  last  access  time  and  technical  information  about  the  file's  location  within  the  file  system.  The  example  above  displays  the stat output  for  the  etc hosts  file. The next example displays the stat output for the  etc directory itself.     $ stat  etc     File: ' etc'     Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory   Device: 801h 2049d      Inode: 316993      Links: 75   Access:  0755 drwxr-xr-x   Uid:      0    root    Gid:      0     root    Access: 2010-04-01 12:17:44.000000000 -0500   Modify: 2010-03-28 12:47:21.000000000 -0500   Change: 2010-03-28 12:47:21.000000000 -0500   Displaying stat output for a directory     The -f option can be used with stat to  display information for an entire file  system as shown in the next example.     $ stat -f      File: " "      ID: e708bc097a45b919 Namelen: 255     Type: ext2 ext3  Block size: 4096       Fundamental block size: 4096   Blocks: Total: 9965379    Free: 9723316    Available: 9221085   Inodes: Total: 2514944    Free: 2476388   Using the -f option with stat to display information about a file system     Common usage examples:  stat [FILE DIR]   stat -f [FILESYSTEM]  Display information for the specified file system   Display information for the specified file directory    date    Purpose: Display or set the system clock.    Usage syntax: date [OPTIONS] [TIME DATE]   $ date   Wed Jun 10 20:33:27 CDT 2009   Output of the date command     The date command displays the current  time and date for the  local  system, as  shown in the above example.     Note  Unix, Linux, and BSD  systems track time in 24-hour format.     The -s option can be used to set the time date on the system as demonstrated  in the next example.      date -s "07 10 2009 11:30"   Fri Jul 10 11:30:00 CDT 2009   Setting the time and date     When  setting  both  the  time  and  date  you  must  use  "MM DD YYYY HH:MM"  format. To set the time only you can simply use date -s HH:MM.     Note   You  must  login  as  root  or  use  the sudo command   discussed  on  page  91  to set the system clock.       Common usage examples:  date   date -s [HH:MM]   Display the time and date  Set the time   date -s ["MM DD YYYY HH:MM"]  Set the time and date         cal    Purpose: Display a calendar on the command line.    Usage syntax: cal [OPTIONS] [MONTH] [YEAR]   $ cal         May 2009         Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa                   1  2    3  4  5  6  7  8  9   10 11 12 13 14 15 16   17 18 19 20 21 22 23   24 25 26 27 28 29 30  31   $ cal 8 2009      August 2009   Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa                      1    2  3  4  5  6  7  8    9 10 11 12 13 14 15   16 17 18 19 20 21 22   23 24 25 26 27 28 29  30 31       Common usage examples:  cal   cal -m   Displaying a calendar for the current month     The cal command  displays  a  simple  calendar  on  the  command  line.  Executing  cal with no arguments will display a calendar for the current month, as shown in  the above example. Adding a month and year as arguments will display a calendar  for the specified month and year, as shown in the next example.      Displaying a calendar for the specified month   Display a calendar for the current month  Display Monday as the first day of the week   cal [MONTH] [YEAR]  Display a calendar for the specified month and year  cal [YEAR]   Display a calendar for the specified year  Display a calendar for the current year   cal -y    history    Purpose: Display commands that have recently been executed.    Usage syntax: history [OPTIONS]   $ history 10    686  man uptime    687  cat  etc hosts    688  ls -l    689  uptime    690  dmesg    691  iostat    692  vmstat    693  ping google.com    694  tracepath google.com    695  history 10   Display 10 lines of command history     The history command  displays  a  user's  command  line  history.  Executing  the  history command  with  no  arguments  will  display  the  entire  command  line  history  for  the  current  user.  For  a  shorter  list,  a  number  can  be  specified  as  an  argument.  Typing history 10, for example, will display the last 10 commands  executed by the current user as shown in the above example.     Tip   You can execute a previous command using ![NUM] where NUM is the  line number in history you want to recall. For example, executing !687  will rerun  the command listed on line 687 in the above example.     In  Linux,  each  user  has  a  file  called .bash_history in  their  home  directory  that  contains their command line history. Unix  systems typically store history in a  file called .sh_history or .history.     Note   The history  file  may contain sensitive information about  commands  you  have  recently  executed.  Most  systems  will  automatically  overwrite  command  line  history  after  a  certain  period.  To  manually  erase  the  history  file  in  your  home  directory  type >$HOME .*history on  the  command line.     Common usage examples:  history   history [NUM]      historygrep [PATTERN]  Search history for the specified pattern   Display the entire command line history  Display the specified number of history items    clear    Purpose: Clear the contents of the current screen.    Usage syntax: clear   $ ls -la   drwxr-xr-x  2 nick nick  4096 2009-05-19 21:14 .   drwxr-xr-x 92 nick nick  4096 2009-05-19 20:46 ..   -rw-r--r--  1 nick nick 35068 2009-05-19 08:41 Notes.txt   -rw-r--r--  1 nick nick   168 2009-05-19 21:14 .MyHiddenFile   -rw-r--r--  1 nick nick    23 2009-05-19 08:43 ShoppingList.txt   -rw-r--r--  1 nick nick    37 2009-05-19 08:43 ToDoList.txt   $ clear   Screen contents before the clear command is executed        $                     Screen contents after the clear command has been executed     The clear command  clears  the  contents  of  the  terminal  screen.  This  is  useful  for  uncluttering  the  display  after  you  have  executed  several  commands  and  are  preparing to move to the next task.  The example above demonstrates the before  and  after  effects  of  the clear command.  While  clearing  the  screen  after  each  command  isn't  necessary,  it  does  make  it  easier  to  read  the  information  on  the  display.     Tip   CTRL + L is a keyboard shortcut to clear the screen in the Bash shell. See  Appendix A for more information about Bash shortcut keys.     Common usage examples:  clear  Clear the contents of the screen    logout    Purpose: Log out of the system.    Usage syntax: logout   $ logout   Ubuntu 9.04         login:   Results of the logout command     The logout command  logs  your  account  out  of  the  system.  This  will  end  your  terminal session and return to the login screen.    Some  systems  may  have  a  file  called .logout or .bash_logout  in  each  user's  home  directory.  This  file  contains  commands  to  be  run  during  the  logout  process.  It  is  used  to  perform  cleanup  operations  and  clear  the  screen  before  ending the user's session.     Tip   The logout command  is  the  recommended  way  to  exit  the  shell.  For  security purposes, users with administrative access should always logout  of any open terminal sessions when away from their desk.       Common usage examples:  logout   Log out of the system          exit    Purpose: Exit the current shell.    Usage syntax: exit [CODE]   $ exit      login:   Example output of the exit command     The exit command  is  similar  to  the logout command  with  the  exception  that  it  does  not  run  the  logout  script  located  in  the  user's  home  directory.  The  above  example  shows  the  results  of  exiting  the  shell  and  returning  to  the  login  prompt.     Shell scripts typically use the exit command to properly terminate while users  use the logout command to properly log out of a system. The exception to this  rule is when a terminal application is opened from within a graphical environment  on  the  local  system.  The logout command  cannot  be  used  in  this  situation  because terminal session is started as sub shell under the graphical environment.  Most systems will display an error in this case as shown in the next example.     bash: logout: not login shell: use "exit"  Logout error message   $ logout      Tip   CTRL  +  D  is  a  keyboard  shortcut  for  exiting  the  shell. See Appendix  A  for  more information on shortcut keys.       Common usage examples:  exit   Exit the current shell   exit [CODE]  Exit the shell and report an exit code  useful in shell scripting         Section 3:   Advanced Shell Features   and Commands     Overview   This  chapter  discusses  advanced  commands  for  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems.  Advanced  commands  can  be  used  to  perform  tasks  such  as  copying,  moving,  renaming,  and  deleting  files.  It  will  also  cover  advanced  shell  features  like  auto  completion, wildcards, pipes, and redirection.    Commands covered in this section:     Command   Purpose   mv   cp   rm   mkdir   rmdir   touch   lsof   fuser   cksum   md5sum   ln   alias   gzip   gunzip   split   shred   watch   env   Move or rename files and directories.

Checksum  Compression  Interactive  Link  MD5 Sum  Parent Directory  Pipe   Redirection   Variable  Verbose  Wildcards     Auto-Completion  Most shells support command line completion.  Command line completion is used  to  have  the  shell  automatically  complete  commands  or  file  paths.  Command  line  completion  is  activated  using  the  Tab  key  on  most  systems  and  shown  in  the  following example.     $ whe    $ whereis   Using command line completion     In  the  above  example  typing  whe and  pressing  the  Tab  key  automatically  completes the command whereis without having to type the entire command.     Auto-completion  also  works  on  file  paths.  Typing  ls  -l   etc en  and  pressing  the  Tab  key  would  auto-complete  to  the  file  etc environment as  shown in the next example.     $ ls -l  etc en    $ ls -l  etc environment   Command line completion of file names     When more than one match is found, the shell will display all matching results. In  the  next  example,  typing ls -l  etc host and  pressing  Tab  displays  all  matching files in the  etc directory.     $ ls -l  etc host    host.conf    hostname     hosts        hosts.allow  hosts.deny   Displaying multiple matches using file name completion   Tip   In  addition  to  command  line completion,  some  shells  offer  the  ability  to  recall  previously  executed  commands  by  using  the  Up  Arrow  key  on  the  keyboard.            Wildcards   Wildcards are used to pattern match one against one or more text elements. They  are  helpful  on  the  command  line  for  performing  bulk  tasks  such  as  listing  or  removing groups of files. The table below lists the different types of wildcards that  can be used on the command line.      Wildcard   *   ?   [abc]   [a-c]   [!abc]   [!a-c]   Function   Matches 0 or more characters  Matches 1 character  Matches one of the characters listed  Matches one character in the range  Matches any character not listed  Matches any character not listed in the range   {tacos,nachos}  Matches one word in the list   Types of wildcards     The  asterisk   *   is  the  simplest  and  most  helpful  wildcard.  The  example  below  demonstrates using the asterisk wildcard to display all files that match a file name.     $ ls -l  etc host*   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  92 2008-12-23 12:53  etc host.conf   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6 2009-04-23 15:50  etc hostname   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 251 2009-05-22 14:55  etc hosts   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 579 2009-04-20 09:14  etc hosts.allow   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 878 2009-04-20 09:14  etc hosts.deny   Listing files using the asterisk wildcard     Typing ls -l  etc host* lists all the files in the  etc directory that start  with the word host. Other examples of wildcards are demonstrated below.     $ ls -l  etc hosts.{allow,deny}   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 579 2009-04-20 09:14  etc hosts.allow   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 878 2009-04-20 09:14  etc hosts.deny   $ ls -l  etc hosts.[!a]*   $ ls -l  etc host?   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 878 2009-04-20 09:14  etc hosts.deny   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 251 2009-05-22 14:55  etc hosts   Examples of other wildcards     In this example, the first command uses {allow,deny} to display all matches  that  end  with    the  word  allow  or  deny.  The  second  command  uses [!a]*  to  display  matches  that  do  not  begin  with  the  letter  a   after  the  period .  The  third  example uses the ? wildcard to match only a single character.    Pipes   Pipes   also  referred  to  as  pipelines   can  be  used  to  direct  the  output  of  one  command  to  the  input  of  another.  Pipes  are  executed  using  the  key   usually  located above the backslash key  on the keyboard.     $ ls -l  etc  more   total 968   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root     2975 2008-08-18 13:30 adduser.conf   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root       44 2010-04-06 16:59 adjtime   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root       51 2008-08-18 13:49 aliases   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    12288 2009-08-28 13:39 aliases.db   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 2010-04-05 10:59 alternatives   drwxr-xr-x 7 root root     4096 2010-04-05 10:59 apache2   drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     4096 2008-08-18 13:48 apm   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 2009-08-28 13:39 apparmor   drwxr-xr-x 6 root root     4096 2008-08-18 13:47 apparmor.d   drwxr-xr-x 4 root root     4096 2010-01-25 13:44 apt   -rw-r----- 1 root daemon    144 2007-02-20 07:41 at.deny   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root     1733 2008-05-12 13:33 bash.bashrc   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   216529 2008-04-14 20:45 bash_completion   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 2010-04-05 10:59 bash_completion.d   Using pipes on the command line     Using ls -l on the  etc directory would normally rapidly scroll the contents  of  the  directory  across  the  screen.  Piping  the  output  of ls -l to  the more  command   discussed  on  page  71   displays  the  contents  of  the  etc directory  one page at a time.    Another  command  commonly  used  with  pipes  is grep  discussed  on  page  76 .  The grep utility can be used to filter the output of a command or file and display  matching  results.  The  next  example  demonstrates  piping  the  output  of  the ls  command to grep to filter the results and display matches that contain the word  hosts.     $ ls -l  etc  grep host   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root       92 2007-10-20 06:51 host.conf   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root        9 2008-08-19 15:29 hostname   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      300 2009-12-07 09:19 hosts   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      579 2008-08-18 13:30 hosts.allow   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      878 2008-08-18 13:30 hosts.deny   Using a pipe with the grep command to filter a command's output   Note   Pipes are extremely useful when working on the command line. From this  point on they will be appearing frequently in examples.   :          The output of a command can be redirected to other locations such as a text file.  Redirection is initiated by using the > character on the keyboard.     Redirection   $ date > date.txt   $ ls -l date.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 29 2009-06-10 11:37 date.txt   Redirecting the output of the date command to a file     In the above example, the date command's output is redirected to  a file called  date.txt instead of being displayed on the screen. If the specified file does not  exist  it  will  automatically  be  created.  If  it  does  exist,  it  will  be  overwritten.  To  prevent  overwriting a  file  you  can use >> to append to the  file as  shown in the  next example.     $ date >> date.txt   Appending the output of a command to a file     There are two different types of output:     1. Standard output  STDOUT   2. Error output  STDERR      STDOUT and STDERR can be selectively directed to specific files. This is useful when  trying to capture error messages as demonstrated below.     $ ls -l  NonExistantFile 1>ls.txt 2>lserror.txt   $ ls -l ls*   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 61 2009-06-10 11:46 lserror.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick  0 2009-06-10 11:46 ls.txt   Selectively redirecting STDOUT and STDERR     In  this  example,  1> represents  STDOUT  and  2> is  for  STDERR.  Since  the  requested  file  does  not  exist,  an  error  message  is  logged  in  the lserror.txt  file. All non-error output is saved in the ls.txt file.    In  addition  to  STDOUT  and  STDERR  you  can  also  redirect  input  from  another  location  such as a  file  to a  command. This is known as standard input or  STDIN.  The  next  example  demonstrates  using  STDIN  to  feed  the  contents  of  a  file  to  the  mail command  discussed on page 163 .     $ mail grepnick@gmail.com < ShoppingList.txt   Redirecting input from a file to a command    mv    Purpose: Move or rename files and directories.    Usage syntax: mv [OPTIONS] [SOURCE] [DESTINATION]   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick    55 2009-05-20 15:32 MyFile   $ ls -l   $ mv MyFile MyFile.old   $ ls -l   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick    55 2009-05-20 15:32 MyFile.old   Using the mv command to rename a file     The mv command moves or renames files. In the above example, MyFile file is  renamed  to  MyFile.old  using  the  mv  command.  In  the  next  example,  MyFile.old is moved to the  tmp directory.     $ mv MyFile.old  tmp    $ ls -l  tmp    -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick    55 2009-05-20 15:32 MyFile.old   Moving a file to a different directory     The mv command  can  also  be  used  to  move  or  rename  directories.  In  the  example below, the NewFiles directory is renamed to OldFiles.     drwxr-xr-x 2 nick nick 4096 2009-06-28 13:23 NewFiles    $ ls -ld NewFiles    $ mv NewFiles  OldFiles    $ ls -ld OldFiles    drwxr-xr-x 2 nick nick 4096 2009-06-28 13:23 OldFiles    Moving an entire directory   Warning   The  default  behavior  the mv command  will  overwrite  any  existing  file s .  The -i option  overrides  this  behavior  and  prompts  the  user  before overwriting the destination file.       Common usage examples:  mv [SOURCE] [DEST]   Move a file or directory to the specified location   mv -i [SOURCE] [DEST]  Prompt before overwriting the destination file  mv -f [SOURCE] [DEST]  Force overwriting if the destination file exists            cp    Purpose: Copy files and directories.    Usage syntax: cp [OPTIONS] [SOURCE] [DESTINATION]   $ cp MyFile MyFile.copy   $ ls -l   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick    55 2009-05-20 15:32 MyFile   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick    55 2009-05-20 15:32 MyFile.copy   Creating a copy of a file     The cp command copies files and directories. In the above example, MyFile is  copied to create the MyFile.copy file.     The next example demonstrates using cp -r to recursively copy the contents of  a directory.     $ ls -l   $ ls -l   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root      4096 Jul  1 14:06 MyDocuments   $ cp -r MyDocuments  MyDocuments2    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root      4096 Jul  1 14:06 MyDocuments   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root      4096 Jul  1 14:06 MyDocuments2   Using the -r option with cp to recursively copy a directory     After executing the cp -r command an exact copy of the specified directory is  created.     Warning   The  default  behavior  the cp command  will  overwrite  any  existing  file s .  The -i option  overrides  this  behavior  and  prompts  the  user  before overwriting the destination file.       Common usage examples:  cp [SOURCE] [DEST]   Create a copy of the specified file   cp -r [SOURCE] [DEST]  Recursively copy a directory  cp -i [SOURCE] [DEST]  Prompt before overwriting the destination file  cp -f [SOURCE] [DEST]  Force overwriting if the destination file exists  cp -v [SOURCE] [DEST]  Display verbose messages while copying      rm    Purpose: Remove files.    Usage syntax: rm [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ rm MyFile   $ ls -l MyFile   ls: cannot access MyFile: No such file or directory   Using the rm command to remove a file     The rm command  removes  files.  In  the  above  example,  the rm command  is  used  to  remove  MyFile.  After  executing  the  rm  command,  MyFile  is  deleted from the disk and no longer accessible.     Notice  that  no  warning  is  given  when  the  file  is  removed.  This  is  the  default  behavior  of  rm  on  most  systems.  To  change  this,  use  the  -i  option  as  demonstrated in the next example. This will instruct the system to prompt you to  verify you want to remove the file.     $ rm -i MyFile   rm: remove regular file 'MyFile'? y   Using the -i option with the rm command for interactive prompts   Tip   You  can  use  the alias command   see  page  54   to  make rm -i the  default  remove  action.  This  is  highly  recommended  as  it  helps  prevent  accidental disasters when deleting files.       Common usage examples:  rm [FILE]   Remove the specified file   rm -r [DIRECTORY]  Recursively remove all items in the specified directory  rm -i [FILE]   Prompt to confirm the removal of the specified file             mkdir   rmdir    Purpose: Create remove directories.    Usage syntax: mkdir [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]    mkdir test    ls -ld test    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root       4096 Jun  4 09:00 test   Creating a directory with mkdir     The mkdir command  creates  directories.  The  above  example  demonstrates  creating  a  directory  called test.  Notice  the  permissions  section  of  the ls  output contains a d prefix. This indicates that the item is a directory.     Tip   Use  mkdir  "my  directory"  or  mkdir  my\  directory  to  create a directory with a space in its name.     The rmdir command  removes  directories.  In  the  next  example,  the rmdir  command is used to remove the previously created test directory.    Usage syntax: rmdir [DIRECTORY]   $ rmdir test    $ ls -ld test       ls: cannot access test : No such file or directory   Removing a directory using rmdir   Note   rmdir will  only  remove  empty  directories.  To  remove  a  non-empty  directory,  use  rm  -r  [DIRECTORY]  in  place  of  the  rmdir  command.       Common usage examples:  mkdir [DIRECTORY]   mkdir -p [PATH DIRECTORY]  Create parent directories if needed  rmdir [DIRECTORY]   Remove the specified directory   Create the specified directory    touch    Purpose: Update time stamps on a file.    Usage syntax: touch [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ ls -l testfile  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 251 2009-04-21 15:50 testfile  $ touch testfile   $ ls -l testfile   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 251 2009-05-23 14:54 testfile   $ date   Sat May 23 14:54:35 CDT 2009   Using the touch command to update the time stamp on a file     The touch command  updates  the  time  stamps  on  the  specified  file s .  Notice  the  timestamp  on  the  file  in  the  above  example  is  updated  to  match  the  current  time and date after executing the touch command.     If the file does not exist, the touch command will create an empty file with the  specified file name, as demonstrated in the next example.     $ ls -l MyFile   ls: cannot access MyFile: No such file or directory   $ touch MyFile  $ ls -l MyFile  -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 0 2009-05-23 14:54 MyFile   Creating a new empty file with the the touch command       Common usage examples:  touch [FILE]   Update the time stamp on the specified file   touch -a [FILE]  Update the access time stamp on the specified file  touch -m [FILE]  Update the modified time stamp on the specified file         lsof    Purpose: List open files.    Usage syntax: lsof [OPTIONS] [NAME]    lsof  etc hosts   COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE    NODE NAME   tail      12793 nick    3r   REG    8,1  256 1777676  etc hosts   Using the lsof command to display information about an open file     The lsof command displays information about open files. Executing the lsof  command  with  no  arguments  will  display  all  open  files  on  the  system.  Specifying  the name of an open file will display information about who is using the file. In the  example above, lsof displays which user is using the  etc hosts file along  with other helpful information such as the command name and PID number.    The -u option allows you to see all files open by the specified user as displayed in  the next example.      lsof -u nick   COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE    SIZE    NODE NAME   sshd    17899   nick  cwd    DIR    8,1    4096       2     sshd    17899   nick  rtd    DIR    8,1    4096       2     tail    12793   nick    3r   REG    8,1     256 1777676  etc hosts   sshd    17899   nick    0u   CHR    1,3            5818  dev null   sshd    17899   nick    1u   CHR    1,3            5818  dev null   sshd    17899   nick    2u   CHR    1,3            5818  dev null   Using the lsof command to display files opened by a specific user   ...       Common usage examples:  lsof   lsof [FILE]   lsof -u [USERNAME]   lsof -p [PID]   List all open files  List information about a specific file  List files open by the specified user  List open files by the specified PID number   lsof -c [PROCESSNAME]  List open files with the specified process name  lsof -i   List open network ports and sockets       fuser    Purpose: Display information about open files.    Usage syntax: fuser [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY FILE]   $ fuser -v  home nick ShoppingList.txt   28528c nick                         USER        PID  ACCESS  COMMAND   ShoppingList.txt:    nick      14044  ..c..   tail   Displaying information about open files with fuser     fuser is a helpful program for identifying the person or program that is using a  file. In the example above the fuser command displays the user, process id, and  command currently using the ShoppingList.txt file.    The -ki option  can  be  used  with  the fuser command  to  terminate  the  process currently using the specified file as shown in the next example.     $ fuser -ki  home nick ShoppingList.txt   home nick ShoppingList.txt:            14044    Kill process 14044 ?  y N  y   Using the -ki option with fuser to terminate the processes using a file   Note  Section 6 of this guide covers processes in more detail.       Common usage examples:  fuser [FILE]   fuser -v [FILE]   Display processes using the specified file  Display detailed information about the file in use   fuser -ki [FILE]  Kill all processes using the specified file            cksum    Purpose: Display the checksum of a file.    Usage syntax: cksum [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ cksum ubuntu.iso   3212199805 730554368 ubuntu.iso   Displaying the checksum of a large file     The cksum command  displays  the  checksum  of  the  specified  file.  It  is  typically  used to verify the integrity of files transferred across a network connection. In the  above  example,  the  checksum  for  a  downloaded  Ubuntu  Linux  CD  image  is  displayed.  The  resulting  checksum  can  be  compared  to  the  checksum  from  the  original file to ensure it arrived without errors.    The table below describes the output fields of the cksum command.     Checksum   File Size   File Name   3212199805   730554368   ubuntu.iso   Output fields of the cksum command   Tip   Multiple  files  can  be  analyzed  with  one  invocation  of  the  cksum  command  using  the  following  syntax: cksum [FILE1] [FILE2]  [FILE3] [ETC].       Common usage examples:  cksum [FILE]   Display the checksum of the specified file s           md5sum    Purpose: Display the MD5 hash of a file.    Usage syntax: md5sum [OPTIONS] [FILE]  $ md5sum ubuntu.iso  cace6ea9dde8dc158174e345aabe3fae  ubuntu.iso   Displaying the md5 hash of a large file using the md5sum command     The md5sum command  computes  the  MD5  sum   sometimes  referred  to  as  the  hash   of  the  specified  file.  It  is  similar  to  the  previously  discussed cksum  command  except  more  intensive.  MD5  hashes  are  the  equivalent  of  a  digital  fingerprint  and  are  not  likely  to  be  duplicated  or  padded  in  the  same  way  that  cksum hashes  in some rare instances  can.    The  above  example  displays  the  MD5  hash  for  a  Ubuntu  Linux  CD  image  downloaded  from  the  internet.  The  resulting  MD5  hash  can  be  compared  to  the  hash from the download site to ensure it arrived without errors.     Note  The md5 command is used on BSD systems in place of md5sum.       Common usage examples:  md5sum [FILE]   Compute the MD5 sum for the specified file s    md5sum -c [FILE]  Compare the MD5 sum in the specified file          ln    Purpose: Create links  shortcuts  to files or directories.    Usage syntax: ln [OPTIONS] [TARGET] [LINK]   $ ln -s TheSourceFile ThisIsTheLink   $ ls -l   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 14 2009-05-23 10:16 TheSourceFile  lrwxrwxrwx 1 nick nick 13 2009-05-23 10:18 ThisIsTheLink -> TheSourceFile   Creating a link to a file using the ln command   In  the  above  example,  a     The ln command creates links to files or directories. A link is the command line  equivalent  of  a  shortcut.  link  to  a  file  called  TheSourceFile is  created.  Notice  the  link  in  the  above  example  has  an l  prefix in the permissions section. This indicates that the file is a link.    The  default  operation  of  the ln command  on  most  systems  creates  what  is  known as a hard link. Hard links have two major limitations:      1.  Hard links cannot refer to directories  2.  Hard links cannot span multiple file systems disks     Symbolic links are more commonly used today to overcome the shortfalls of hard  links. They are created when using the -s option with the ln command. This is  the  recommended  way  to  create  a  link  as  it  will  not  suffer  from  the  same  limitations of a hard link.     Note   Editing  a  symbolic  link  file  is  the  same  as  editing  the  source  file,  but  deleting the symbolic link does not delete the source file.       Common usage examples:  ln [SOURCE] [TARGET]   ln -s [SOURCE] [TARGET]  Create a symbolic link to the specified target     Create a hard link to the specified target    alias    Purpose: Create command line aliases.    Usage syntax: alias [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]   $ alias rm="rm -i"   $ rm TestFile   rm: remove regular empty file 'TestFile'? y   Creating a command alias     line  aliases.  This  allows  you  to  The  alias  command  creates  command  abbreviate a long command string to something simple. In the above example, the  rm command  is  aliased  to  be rm -i so  that  every  time  the rm command  is  executed the -i option is automatically included  without having to type it .    Executing alias with no arguments will display all currently defined aliases, as  demonstrated in the next example.     $ alias   alias cp='cp -i'   alias l='ls -l'   alias rm='rm -i'   Displaying all defined aliases   Tip   Aliases are lost when you log out. The unalias command can be used  to  delete  aliases  without  having  to  logoff.  To  make  an  alias  permanent  you must add it to  etc profile or .*profile file in the user's  home directory.       Common usage examples:  alias   alias [NAME]="[COMMAND]"  Create an alias for the specified command     Display defined aliases          gzip   gunzip    Purpose: Compress uncompress files.    Usage syntax: gzip [OPTIONS] [FILE]   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3.0M 2010-05-20 14:02 BigFile    ls -lh BigFile    gzip BigFile    ls -lh BigFile.gz   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 433K 2010-05-20 14:02 BigFile.gz   Using gzip to compress a file     gzip is a simple compression utility found on most Linux and BSD systems. In the  above  example gzip is  used  to  reduce  the  size  of  the BigFile file  by  compressing it into a .gz archive.     The  gunzip   or  gzip  -d   command  uncompresses  gzip  archives  as  demonstrated in the next example.      Usage syntax: gunzip [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ gunzip BigFile.gz    ls -lh BigFile   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3.0M 2010-05-20 14:02 BigFile   Uncompressing a file with gunzip   Note   On older Unix systems the compress and uncompress commands  are  used  in  place  of gzip and gunzip.  Compressed  files  on  these  systems will usually have a .Z file extension in place of .gz.       Common usage examples:  gzip [FILE]   Compress the specified file   gzip --fast [FILE]  Compress the specified file using the fastest method  gzip --best [FILE]  Compress the file using the highest compression level  gzip -tv [ARCHIVE]  Test the specified archive for errors  gzip -l [ARCHIVE]   Display information about the specified archive file  Uncompress the specified archive  Uncompress the specified archive   gunzip [ARCHIVE]   gzip -d [ARCHIVE]            split    Purpose: Split large files into multiple pieces.    Usage syntax: split [OPTIONS] [FILE] [OUTPUT]   $ ls -l ubuntu.iso   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 671686656 2009-10-27 12:07 ubuntu-9.10.iso   $ split -d -b 100M ubuntu.iso ubuntu.iso.   $ ls -lh ubuntu*   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 641M 2009-10-27 12:07 ubuntu-9.10.iso   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 100M 2010-04-11 11:44 ubuntu.iso.00   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 100M 2010-04-11 11:44 ubuntu.iso.01   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 100M 2010-04-11 11:44 ubuntu.iso.02   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 100M 2010-04-11 11:44 ubuntu.iso.03   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 100M 2010-04-11 11:44 ubuntu.iso.04   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 100M 2010-04-11 11:44 ubuntu.iso.05   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick  41M 2010-04-11 11:44 ubuntu.iso.06   Using the split command to split a large file into multiple pieces     The split command  splits  large  files  into  multiple  pieces.  The  above  example  demonstrates splitting the large ubuntu.iso file into several 100MB pieces  as  specified  by  the -b 100M parameter .  In  this  example,  the split command  will create the required number of 100MB files with an incrementing extension.     Note  The original file is left in place when creating split files.     The cat command  discussed on page 68  can be used to rejoin the split files as  demonstrated in the next example.     $ cat ubuntu.iso.* > ubuntu-joined.iso   $ ls -lh *.iso   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 641M 2009-10-27 12:07 ubuntu-9.10.iso   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 641M 2010-04-11 11:47 ubuntu-joined.iso   Combining split files using the cat command   Tip   You can use the cksum or md5sum command to verify the joined file  is the same as the original.       Common usage examples:  split -b [SIZE] [FILE] [OUTPUT]   split -d -b [SIZE] [FILE] [OUTPUT]  Use numeric suffixes   Split a file into multiple pieces          shred    Purpose: Securely erase files.    Usage syntax: shred [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY FILE]   $ shred -u SecretPlans.txt   $ ls -l SecretPlans.txt   ls: cannot access SecretPlans.txt: No such file or directory   Using the shred command to securely overwrite a file     The shred command  securely  overwrites   and  optionally  deletes   files.  In  the  above  example,  executing  shred -u securely  overwrites  and  removes  the  SecretPlans.txt file from the disk.    The default operation of the shred command overwrites the specified file with  3 passes of random data. The -n option can be used to specify a custom number  of overwrite iterations as displayed in the next example.     $ shred -n 10 -v SecretPlans.txt   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 1 10  random ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 2 10  ffffff ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 3 10  000000 ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 4 10  333333 ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 5 10  555555 ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 6 10  random ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 7 10  aaaaaa ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 8 10  924924 ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 9 10  492492 ...   shred: SecretPlans.txt: pass 10 10  random ...   Specifying a number of overwrite iterations      Note   The -v option is applied in the above example to verbosely display the  progress of the shred command.       Common usage examples:  shred [FILE]   shred -u [FILE]   shred -zu [FILE]   shred -v [FILE]   Shred the specified file  Shred and delete the specified file  Attempt to hide evidence of file shredding  Display the progress of each pass   shred -n [NUM] [FILE]  Perform the specified number of overwrite passes      watch    Purpose: Periodically execute the specified command.

Common usage examples:  nano [FILE]   nano -v [FILE]  Open the specified file in read only mode   Open the specified file for editing          vi   vim    Purpose: Full featured text editor.    Usage syntax: vi vim [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ vim ShoppingList.txt   Milk   Eggs   Cheese   Tacos   ~   ~   ~   ~   ~   ~   " home nick ShoppingList.txt" 4 lines, 19 characters   Using vi to edit a text file     The vi editor  also known as vim  is a complex and full featured text editor for  Unix, Linux, and BSD systems. Traditional Unix systems typically utilize vi as the  default text editor. Modern Linux and BSD systems use vim which is an enhanced  version of vi.    The vi and vim editors  have  two  basic  modes  of  operation:  command  mode  and editing mode. Pressing  Esc  on the keyboard activates command mode. When  in  command  mode,  command  keys  can  be  used  to  activate  specific  editing  functions.  The  following  table  lists  the  most  common  commands  for vi and  vim.     Key s   :w   :x   :q   i   I   a   Function   Key s    Function   Save  Save and exit  Quit  Insert text before  Insert text after  Append text before   A   r   R   yy   p   Append text after  Replace text before cursor  Replace text after cursor  Copy current line  Paste copied text    [TEXT]  Search for the specified text   Command keys for vi and vim     Common usage examples:  vi [FILE]   Open the specified file for editing in vi   vim [FILE]  Open the specified file for editing in vim  view [FILE]  Open the specified file in read only mode    emacs    Purpose: Robust and extensible text editor.    Usage syntax: emacs [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ emacs ShoppingList.txt  File Edit Options Buffers Tools Help                                              Milk   --u-:%%-F1  ShoppingList.txt  Fundamental --L12--Top-------------------   Buffer is read-only:     Editing a text file with emacs     emacs is one of the oldest text editors still in use today on Unix, Linux, and BSD  systems. Its programmable macros and code syntax highlighting make it a popular  choice  for  software  developers  and  web  programmers.  The  screenshot  above  displays the emacs editor user interface.     Note   emacs is an incredibly powerful editor geared towards advanced users,  software developers, and publishers. New users should focus on learning  the nano and vi editors before attempting to master emacs.       Common usage examples:  emacs [FILE]  Open the specified file for editing.   Eggs   Cheese   Tacos                         sed    Purpose: Complex stream editor.

It  uses  regular  expressions  to  modify  data  streamed to it. Regular expressions are a pattern matching language supported on  all Unix, Linux, and BSD systems.    In  the  above  example,  the  sed  command  reads  the  contents  of  the  ShoppnigList.txt file and uses a regular expression to replace all instances  of  the  word  Tacos  with  Nachos.  The  results  are  output  to  a  new  file  called  NewShoppingList.txt.     Note   Regular  expressions  are  complex  and  can't  be  fully  covered  in  this  book.  Visit  www.DontFearTheCommandLine.com  to  find  resources  for  learning  more about regular expressions syntax.       Common usage examples:  sed [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION] [FILE]  Edit a file using sed      awk    Purpose: Text processing and pattern matching program.    Usage syntax: awk [EXPRESSION]   $ ls -l ShoppingList.*   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 24 2010-04-12 23:10 ShoppingList.old   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 23 2010-04-12 19:33 ShoppingList.txt   $ ls -l ShoppingList.*  awk  -F" " '{ print $1 " " $8 }'   -rw-r--r-- ShoppingList.old   -rw-r--r-- ShoppingList.txt   Modifying the output of the ls command using the awk command     awk is a pattern matching and text processing utility. It treats each line of input as  a series of fields. The fields in each line are grouped into an array and assigned a  variable  related  to  their  position.  In  the  above  example, awk is  used  to  extract  and  print  the  first  and  eighth   $1 and $8   fields  from  the  output  of  the ls  command.    The awk command can also be used to perform batch processing functions such  as renaming multiple files as demonstrated in the next example.     $ ls   $ ls   File1  File3  File5  File7  File9   File2  File4  File6  File8   $ ls  awk '{print "mv "$1" "$1".txt"}'  sh   File1.txt  File3.txt  File5.txt  File7.txt  File9.txt   File2.txt  File4.txt  File6.txt  File8.txt   Batch renaming files using the awk command     In this example the awk command is used to rename the listed files by appending  a .txt extension to them.     Note   awk is a powerful and complex utility that can't be fully covered in this  book.  Visit  www.DontFearTheCommandLine.com  to  find  resources  for  learning more about awk usage syntax.       Common usage examples:  [INPUT]  awk [EXPRESSION]  Process input using the awk command       strings    Purpose: Extract readable characters from binary files.    Usage syntax: strings [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ strings unknown.mp3   TAG Girl You Know It's True   Milli Vanilli   Girl You Know It's True   ...   1989   ...   Using the strings command to extract text from a binary file     The strings command extracts text from binary files. Binary files contain data  that  is  unreadable  using  standard  text  processing  programs.  Examples  of  binary  files include MP3, JPEG, and MPEG to name a few.     In  the  above  example,  readable  text  is  extracted  from  the unknown.mp3 file.  This information can be used to identify the contents of the binary file.     Note   The strings command  displays  results  that  are  a  minimum  of  4  characters  by  default.  You  can  override  the  default  minimum  character  length using the -n option.       Common usage examples:  strings [FILE]   strings -n [NUM] [FILE]  Set the minimum number of characters   Display readable text characters in a binary file    cat    Purpose: Concatenate files and display their contents.    Usage syntax: cat [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ cat ShoppingList.txt   Output of the cat command     The  cat command  concatenates  and  displays  files.  Executing  cat on  the  ShoppingList.txt file displays its contents as shown in the above example.     To  join  two  or  more  files,  simply  provide  the  file  names  to  be  concatenated  separated by a space as demonstrated in the next example.     $ cat ShoppingList.txt NachoIngredients.txt   2 cloves garlic, crushed   6 green onions, sliced, white parts and tops separated   1 cup salsa   1 2  12 ounce  package tortilla chips   1  8 ounce  package shredded Cheddar Monterey Jack cheese blend   1 2 large tomato, diced   Joining two files using the cat command       Common usage examples:  cat [FILE]   Display the contents of the specified file   cat [FILE1] [FILE2] [ETC]  Join the specified files  cat -n [FILE]   Display numbered output for each line  Suppress blank lines   cat -s [FILE]   Milk   Eggs   Cheese   Tacos   Milk   Eggs   Cheese   Tacos       tac    Purpose: Concatenate files in reverse order.    Usage syntax: tac [FILE]   $ cat ShoppingList.txt   $ tac ShoppingList.txt   Milk   Eggs   Cheese   Tacos   Tacos   Cheese   Eggs   Milk   Comparison of the output from the cat and tac commands     The tac command is similar to the previously discussed cat command, except  it displays a file's contents in reverse order. In the above example, the output of the  cat  command  is  compared  to  the  tac  command  to  demonstrate  the  differences between the output generated by these two commands.     Tip   tac is extremely useful when reviewing the contents of log files on Unix,  Linux, BSD systems. The newest entries in log files are always appended to  the  end  of  the  file.  tac allows  you  to  read  these  files  in  reverse  order  displaying the most recent entries first.        Common usage examples:  tac [FILE]  Display the contents of the specified file in reverse order      wc    Purpose: Count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file.    Usage syntax: wc [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ wc  etc hosts   10 28 251  etc hosts   Output of the wc command     The wc command   short  for  Word  Count   displays  the  total  number  of  lines,  words, and characters in the  specified  file.  The above example displays the totals  for the  etc host file. The table below explains the output fields generated by  the wc command.     Lines  10   Words  28   Characters   File   251    etc hosts   Output fields of the wc command       Common usage examples:  wc [FILE]   wc -w [FILE]   wc -l [FILE]   wc -c [FILE]   Display the number of lines, words, and characters in a file  Display the number of words in a file  Display the number of lines in a file  Display the number of characters in a file       more    Purpose: Display the output of a command or text file one page at a time.

Tip   The arrow keys and  Page  Up Down  keys are used to scroll output  using  less. The Q key closes the file without having to scroll to the end.       Common usage examples:  less [FILE]   Display the specified file one page at a time   less +[NUM] [FILE]  Start reading a file at the specified line number  [COMMAND]  less  Display a command's output one page at a time          head    Purpose: Display the first part of a file.    Usage syntax: head [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ head -n 2 ShoppingList.txt   Milk   Eggs   Using the head command to display the first two lines of a file     The head command  displays  the  first  few  lines   known  as  the  head   of  the  specified file. In the above example, the  -n 2 option is used to display only  the  first  two  lines  of  the  specified  file.  If  the head command  is  executed  with  no  options it will display the first 10 lines in the file by default.      Common usage examples:  head [FILE]   Display the first 10 lines of the specified file   head -n [NUM] [FILE]  Display the specified number of lines      tail    Purpose: Display the last part of a file.    Usage syntax: tail [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ tail -n 2 ShoppingList.txt   Cheese   Tacos   Displaying the last two lines in a file with tail     The tail command  displays  the  last  few  lines   known  as  the  tail   of  the  specified file.  In the above example, the -n 2 option is used to display only the  last  two  lines  of  the  specified  file.  If  the tail command  is  executed  with  no  options it will display the last 10 lines in the file by default.     Another useful feature of the tail command is the -f option which is used to  "follow"  a  file  as  it  grows.  This  instructs  the tail command  to  open  the  specified  file  and  display  new  lines  as  they  are  written  to  it.  The  next  example  demonstrates using the tail -f command to monitor new log entries in real- time in the  var log syslog file.      tail -f  var log syslog   May 22 13:41:50 e6400 NetworkManager:     wlan0 : supplicant   connection state:  completed -> group handshake   May 22 13:41:50 e6400 NetworkManager:     wlan0 : supplicant   connection state:  group handshake -> completed   May 22 13:41:51 e6400 wpa_supplicant[848]: WPA: EAPOL-Key Replay   Counter did not increase - dropping packet   May 22 13:41:51 e6400 wpa_supplicant[848]: WPA: Invalid EAPOL-Key MIC -   dropping packet   May 22 13:42:15 e6400 wpa_supplicant[848]: last message repeated 6   May 22 13:45:13 e6400 anacron[1290]: Job 'cron.daily' started   May 22 13:45:13 e6400 anacron[2167]: Updated timestamp for job   'cron.daily' to 2010-05-22   Using the tail command to monitor a growing log file in real time       Common usage examples:  tail [FILE]   tail -n [NUM] [FILE]  Display the specified number of lines  tail -f [FILE]   Follow the file as it grows   Display the last 10 lines of the specified file   times   ...          tee    Purpose: Display the output of a command and write the output to a file.    Usage syntax: tee [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ ls -l  etc   tee etc.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root     2975 2009-02-04 11:12 adduser.conf   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root       46 2010-06-27 16:53 adjtime   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      532 2009-11-30 14:33 aliases   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    12288 2010-07-01 12:23 aliases.db   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 2010-05-04 13:24 alternatives   drwxr-xr-x 4 root root     4096 2009-03-12 14:08 amavis   drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     4096 2009-02-04 12:49 apm   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 2009-08-28 14:45 apparmor   drwxr-xr-x 6 root root     4096 2010-06-27 16:53 apparmor.d   ...   Using the tee command to capture the output of a command     The tee command displays the output of a command and also saves the output  to  a  file.  In  the  above  example,  the tee command  displays  the  output  of  the   ls -l  etc command  while  simultaneously  saving  the  results  to  a  file  called  etc.txt file.  Viewing  the etc.txt file  shows  its  contents  are  the  same  as  the output displayed on the command line, as demonstrated in the next example.     $ more etc.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root     2975 2009-02-04 11:12 adduser.conf   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root       46 2010-06-27 16:53 adjtime   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      532 2009-11-30 14:33 aliases   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    12288 2010-07-01 12:23 aliases.db   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 2010-05-04 13:24 alternatives   drwxr-xr-x 4 root root     4096 2009-03-12 14:08 amavis   drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     4096 2009-02-04 12:49 apm   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 2009-08-28 14:45 apparmor   drwxr-xr-x 6 root root     4096 2010-06-27 16:53 apparmor.d   ...

Using the grep command to filter a file     The grep command filters data from a file or command. In the above example,  grep is  used  to  filter  the  var log syslog file  and  display  matches  that  contain the word failed.      Tip   Unix, Linux, and BSD systems are case sensitive. In the above example, the  -i option is used to overcome this and perform a case insensitive search.     The grep command can also be used to filter the output of a command. In the  next  example  the  output  of  the dmesg command   discussed  on  page  216   is  piped to the grep command to only display results that contain the word error.     $ dmesg  grep -i error   [16074.400692] PM: Device 2-3 failed to resume: error -19   [20792.424537] npviewer.bin[20044]: segfault at ff9bea2c ip   00000000ff9bea2c sp 00000000ffca507c error 14   [21301.607988] npviewer.bin[24229]: segfault at ff9bea2c ip   00000000ff9bea2c sp 00000000ff83a40c error 14   ...

Usage syntax: zcat [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ file ShoppingList.txt.gz   ShoppingList.txt.gz: gzip compressed data, was "ShoppingList.txt", from   Unix, last modified: Mon Apr 12 19:33:38 2010   $ zcat ShoppingList.txt.gz   Milk   Eggs   Cheese   Tacos   Viewing the contents of a compressed text file with the zcat command     The zcat command  allows  you  to  read  the  contents  of  a  compressed  text  file  without  having  to  manually  uncompress  it  first.  In  the  above  example  the  ShoppingList.txt.gz  file  is  a  compressed  gzip  archive.  Using  the  traditional cat command would produce unreadable output in this scenario. The  zcat command,  however,  allows  you  to  view  the  contents  of  the  file  without  having to first uncompress it.      Common usage examples:  zcat [FILE]  Read the contents of a compressed file         diff    Purpose: Compare files.    Usage syntax: diff [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ diff ShoppingList.txt ShoppingList.old   4c4   < Tacos   ---  > Nachos   Default output of the diff command     The diff command allows you to compare two text files line by line and display  the  differences  between  them.  The diff command  provides  two  types  of  output:     1.  Single column  default   2.  Two column side-by-side comparison  activated with the -y option      In  the  above  example  the diff command  displays  the  default  single  column  output which only shows the differences between the two files. Indicators are used  to mark the differing lines:     <  >   Indicates the text in the first file   Indicates the text in the second file     The -y option can be used to display two column side-by-side output. The next  example demonstrates the output generated with this option.     $ diff -y ShoppingList.txt ShoppingList.old   Milk                                        Milk   Eggs                                        Eggs   Cheese                                      Cheese  Tacos                                      Nachos   Comparing two files with the diff command       Common usage examples:  diff [FILE1] [FILE2]   Compare files and display differences   diff -y [FILE1] [FILE2]  Compare files side by side  diff -i [FILE1] [FILE2]  Ignore case when comparing files      dos2unix   unix2dos    Purpose: Convert file formats between Windows MS-DOS and Unix Linux systems.    Usage syntax: dos2unix   unix2dos [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ cat ShoppingList.txt   Tacos  $ dos2unix ShoppingList.txt  $ cat ShoppingList.txt   Milk^M   Eggs^M   Cheese^M   Milk   Eggs   Cheese   Tacos   Converting a Windows-formatted text file to a Unix-formatted file     Text files created in Windows and MS-DOS are formatted with line feed characters  that  are  not  compatible  with  Unix Linux  systems.  The dos2unix command  reformats the specified file so that is will display properly on Unix Linux systems. In  the  above  example,  the  line  feed  characters  in  the ShoppingList.txt file  are converted so they will display properly on Unix-based systems.    Similar  to  the dos2unix command,  unix2dos formats  text  files  created  on  Unix Linux  systems  so  they  can  be  displayed  properly  when  transferred  to  Windows systems.     Tip   Conversions are done directly to the specified file. Use the -b option to  create a backup of the file before converting.       Common usage examples:  dos2unix [FILE]   Convert a Windows text file to a Unix-formatted file   dos2unix -b [FILE]  Create a backup before converting  unix2dos [FILE]   Convert a Unix text file to a Windows-formatted file   unix2dos -b [FILE]  Create a backup before converting the file           Section 5:   Users, Groups, and Security   This  chapter  covers  the  most  common  commands  related  to  users,  groups,  and  security. It will also discuss topics like account creation deletion, file and directory  permissions, and other user security related commands.    Commands covered in this section:     Purpose   Change file and directory permissions.  Change the owner of a file or directory.  Change the group of files and directories.  Display set a user's default file creation mask.  Switch user accounts.  Run a single command as a different user.  Display information about a user's identity.

Glossary of terms used in this section:    GID   Group   Mode  Octal Notation   Permissions  Profile  Symbolic Notation   UID   User Account    Group  IDentifier   A  numerical  value  assigned  to  a  group in  the  etc group file.  A  grouping  of  user  accounts  used  to  simplify  security  and  access control.  Indicator of permissions for files and directories.  A  numerical  value  used  to  apply  permissions  to  files  and  directories.  Settings used to control access to a file or directory.  Collection of settings assigned to a user.  A  user  friendly  way  to  display  or  apply  permissions  to  files  and directories.   User  IDentifier   A  numerical  value  assigned  to  a  user  account in the  etc passwd file.  An account assigned to each person with login access to the  local system.       Types of Accounts   There are several types of user accounts used on Unix, Linux, and BSD systems. The  graphic below illustrates the user security model used on most systems.     Unix Linux BSD user security model         By default, normal users and the programs they execute are given the least amount  of privileges on the  system. System accounts have  slightly  elevated privileges and  are used to run system services  like a web server or FTP server . The root account  has unrestricted administrative access to the entire system.    Groups   Groups  are  used  to  simplify  the  management  of  system  security.  Users  can  be  a  member of one or more groups. All users are part of at least one group by default;  this group is known as the user's primary group.     File and Directory Permissions   File  and  directory  permissions  are  managed  using  a  set  of  nine  "flags".  The  following example describes permissions found on a typical file.     - rwx  r-x  r-x      File  Type   1      2      3   User    Owner    4      5      6   Group    7      8      9   Other     Everyone      Within these nine flags, three sets of permissions are specified:     User  AKA owner  permissions    Group permissions    Other  i.e. everyone else     There are four types of permissions that can be used to control access to a file or  directory. The following table describes each permission.     Symbolic   Meaning   r   w   Read  Write  Execute  No access  Example of directory permissions   -   x     In most cases, the owner of a file will always have full read write access to that file.  Execute  permission  is  a  special  flag  used  for  programs,  scripts,  and  directories  to  indicate they are executable.     The example below displays basic file permissions.     $ ls -l ShoppingList.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick users 254 2009-06-01 15:35 ShoppingList.txt   Output of the ls -l command displaying file permissions   User   rw-   Group   r--   Other   r--   Read & Write   Read only   Read only   Symbolic  Meaning   Example of file permissions     The next example demonstrates directory permissions. Directory permissions work  the same as file permissions except they are used to control access to directories.      $ ls -ld finance    drwxr-x--- 2 root finance 4096 2009-06-12 09:48 finance    Output of the ls -ld command displaying directory permissions   Symbolic   Meaning   User   rwx   Group   r-x   Read, Write,  Execute  & Execute  Example of directory permissions   Read only &   Other   ---   No Access     Each file and directory has its own set of permissions. Permissions are not inherited  from  the  parent  directory.  Additionally,  directories  require  execute  permission  in  order to be accessible, as shown in the previous example.                   chmod    Purpose: Change file and directory permissions.    Usage syntax: chmod [OPTIONS] [MODE] [DIRECTORY FILE]    chmod 664 ShoppingList.txt    ls -l ShoppingList.txt   -rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 23 2009-05-27 22:31 ShoppingList.txt   Using the chmod command to change file permissions     The chmod command  sets  permissions  on  files  and  directories.  By  default,  permissions are specified in numerical  octal  format such as 664 as shown in the  above example. In octal form, three digits are used to represent owner, group, and  everyone else's permissions. The first number represents the owner's permissions,  the  second  number  is  the  group's  permissions,  and  the  third  number  is  for  everyone else.     The table below provides a cross reference of symbolic and octal permissions.     Permission   Symbolic   Octal   Read  Write  Execute  None   r   w   x   -      Permissions cross reference   4  2  1  0   The sum of the octal  permissions becomes what is known as the  mode. The  valid  modes are described in the following table.     Mode   Symbolic   Octal  4+2+1   7   6   5   4  0   4+2   4+1   4   0   Effective Permission  Read Write Execute  Read Write  Read Execute  Read  None   rwx   rw-   r-x   r--   ---   Mode cross reference     The  combination  of  3  modes  determines  the  permissions  for  the  file.  A  mode  of  664 would create rw-rw-r-- permissions giving read write access to the user  and group, and read only to everyone else.    Continued…     The concept of permissions on Unix, Linux, and BSD systems can be hard to grasp  as first. Several additional examples are provided below to help clarify this topic.    Example  1:  A  mode  of  660  would  provide  read write  access  to  the  owner  and  group and no access to everyone else.      chmod 660 MyFile    ls -l MyFile   -rw-rw---- 1 root sales 23 2009-05-27 22:31 MyFile   Result of a 660 mode     Example  2:  A  mode  of  755  would  provide  full  access  to  the  owner  and  read execute access for the group and everyone else.      chmod 755 MyProgram.sh    ls -l MyProgram.sh   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root sales 23 2009-05-27 22:31 MyProgram.sh   Result of a 755 mode     Example 3: A mode of 600 would provide read write access to the owner and no  access to everyone else.      chmod 600 MyFile    ls -l MyFile   -rw------- 1 root sales 23 2009-05-27 22:31 MyFile   Result of a 600 mode     Example 4: A mode of 775 applied to a directory would provide read write execute  access to the owner and group and read only access to everyone else.     drwxrwxr-x 2 root sales 4096 2009-05-27 16:04 MyDirectory   Result of a 775 mode applied to a directory   $ chmod 775 MyDirectory   $ ls -ld test       Common usage examples:  chmod [MODE] [FILE]   chmod [MODE] -R [DIR]  Recursively change the permissions on all files     Change the permissions on the specified file       chown    Purpose: Change the owner of a file or directory.    Usage syntax: chown [OPTIONS] [USER:GROUP] [DIRECTORY FILE]   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick nick 23 2009-05-27 22:31 ShoppingList.txt    ls -l ShoppingList.txt    chown root ShoppingList.txt    ls -l ShoppingList.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 root nick 23 2009-05-27 22:31 ShoppingList.txt   Using the chown command to change the owner of a file     The chown command  changes  the  owner  of  a  file  or  directory.  In  the  above  example,  the  owner  of  the ShoppingList.txt file  is  changed  from  nick  to  root.     The next example demonstrates changing both the owner and group of a file using  the chown command.      ls -l ShoppingList.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 root nick 23 2009-05-27 22:31 ShoppingList.txt    chown nick:sales ShoppingList.txt    ls -l ShoppingList.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 nick sales 23 2009-05-27 22:31 ShoppingList.txt   Using the chown command to change the owner and group of a file     After  executing  the  chown nick:sales ShoppingList.txt  command,  the ShoppingList.txt file is updated with the owner of nick and the group  of sales.     Tip   You  can  use  the chgrp command   discussed  on  page  88   if  you  only  need to change the group of a file.       Common usage examples:  chown [USER] [FILE]   chown [USER]:[GROUP] [FILE]  Change the owner and group of a file  chown -R [USER] [DIR]   Recursively change the owner on all  files in the specified directory   Change the owner of a file       chgrp    Purpose: Change the group of files and directories.    Usage syntax: chgrp [OPTIONS] [GROUP] [DIRECTORY FILE]   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  23 2009-05-27 22:31 ShoppingList.txt    ls -l ShoppingList.txt    chgrp sales ShoppingList.txt    ls -l ShoppingList.txt   -rw-r--r-- 1 root sales 23 2009-05-27 22:31 ShoppingList.txt   Using the chgrp command to change the group of a file     The chgrp command  changes  the  group  of  a  file  or  directory.  In  the  above  example the chgrp command is used to change the group from root to sales on  the ShoppingList.txt file.      Common usage examples:  chgrp [GROUP] [FILE]  Change a file's group to the specified group  chgrp -R [DIR]   Recursively change the group on all files          umask    Purpose: Display set a user's default file creation mask.    Usage syntax: umask [OPTIONS] [MODE]   $ umask   022   Displaying the current user's umask     umask  controls  a  user's  default  file  creation  mask.  This  determines  the  permissions  that  will  be  assigned  to  newly  created  files  and  directories.  To  determine the file directory creation mode the umask value is subtracted from 777  for directories and 666 for files. For example, a umask of 022 would create effective  permissions of 644  rw-r--r--  for files and 755  rwxr-xr-x  for directories.     On  some  systems  the -S option  can  be  used  to  display  a  more  user  friendly  symbolic output of the umask value, as shown in the next example.     $ umask -S   u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx   Displaying the umask in symbolic notation     The umask command can also be used to change the umask  value as displayed  in the next example.     $ umask 077   Setting the umask value     In  this  example,  a  umask  value  of  077  would  create  effective  permissions  of  600   rw-------  for files and 700  rwx------  for directories.     Note   A umask value specified on the command line is reset when you log out.  To make the umask permanent you must add it to the .*profile file  in the user's home directory or  etc profile  for all users .       Common usage examples:  umask   umask -S   Display the umask in octal format  Display the umask in symbolic format  umask [MODE]  Set the umask to the specified value    su    Purpose: Switch user accounts.    Usage syntax: su [OPTIONS] [USER]   $ whoami   nick   $ su    whoami   root   Password: ******   Using the su command to switch from a normal user to the root user     The su command   short  for  Switch  User   allows  you  to  login  as  another  user  without having to first log out of the system. In the above example su is used by  a  normal  user  to  switch  to  the  root  user  account.  Notice  that  when  you  become  the root user your shell prompt  changes from $ to .  As the root  user you can  now run commands that require elevated privileges.     Tip   You  should  always  limit  the  amount  of  time  you  spend  logged  in  as  the  root user. This is a good practice that can help reduce accidents.     By default, executing su with no arguments switches to the root user account. A  user name can be specified with su to become a different user as shown in the  next example.     $ whoami   nick   $ su steve   $ whoami   steve   Password: ******       Common usage examples:  su   su -      Using su to switch to another user   Switch to the root user account  Switch to the root user account and load root's profile   su [USERNAME]  Switch to the specified username      sudo    Purpose: Run a single command as a different user.    Usage syntax: sudo [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]   $ whoami   nick   $ sudo whoami   root   $ whoami   nick   [sudo] password for nick: *******   Using sudo to run a command as the root user     The sudo command  allows  you  to  run  a  single  command  as  another  user.  It  is  most  commonly  used  to  execute  commands  that  require  root  privileges.  In  this  example whoami is executed as root via the sudo command.     Using  the sudo command  is  the  recommended  way  to  run  commands  that  require  elevated  privileges  as  it  limits  the  amount  of  time  spent  with  root  privileges.  This  greatly  helps  prevent  disasters  such  as  accidental  deletion  of  important system files.     Note   User   or  group   accounts  must  be  listed  in  the  etc sudoers file  in  order to execute commands as root with sudo.     Common usage examples:  sudo [COMMAND]   sudo -u [USER] [COMMAND]  Run a command as the specified user  sudo !!   Run the last command as root   Run the specified command as root       id    Purpose: Display information about a user's identity.    Usage syntax: id [OPTIONS] [USER]    id   uid=0 root  gid=0 root  groups=0 root    Displaying user and group information for the current user     The id command  displays  user  and  group  information  for  the  specified  user.  Executing id with no options displays the current user's information as displayed  in the above example. The next example demonstrates using the id command to  display information about a specific user.      id nick   uid=1000 nick  gid=1000 nick  groups=4 adm , 20 dialout ,24 cdrom ,   46 plugdev , 106 lpadmin , 121 admin , 122 sambashare , 1000 nick    Displaying user and group information for a specific user   Note   Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems  assign  a  numerical  UID   User  ID   and  GID   Group ID  for each user and group on the system. A user friendly name is  also assigned to each UID and GID which is displayed in parenthesis next  to  each  ID  number.  This  information  is  stored  in  etc passwd for  users and  etc group for groups.     Common usage examples:  id   Display the current user's ID information   id [USER]  Display user and group information for the specified user          groups    Purpose: Display which groups a user belongs to.    Usage syntax: groups [OPTIONS] [USER]    groups   root   Displaying group information for the current user     The groups command displays a user's group membership.  Executing  groups  with no options displays the current user's groups, as shown in the above example.  A  user  name  can  be  used  with  the groups command  to  display  the  specified  user's group membership as shown in the next example.      groups nick   nick adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin admin sambashare   Displaying group information for the specified user       Common usage examples:  groups   groups [USER]   Display the current user's group membership  Display group membership for the specified user    who   whoami    Purpose: Display who is logged into the system.    Usage syntax: who [OPTIONS]   $ who   root     tty2         2010-05-17 11:32   nick     tty1         2010-05-17 11:31   nick     pts 0        2010-05-17 08:40  10.10.1.251    dave     pts 1        2010-05-17 12:32  10.10.1.188    mike     pts 2        2010-05-17 14:28  10.10.1.167    lisa     pts 3        2010-05-17 14:50  10.10.1.204    nick     pts 4        2010-05-17 15:33  10.10.1.251    Output of the who command     The who command  displays  information  about  users  currently  logged  in  to  the  system. The default output of the who command displays the username, terminal  ID, and date time the user logged in as shown in the above example.     Note   Users logged in via telnet or SSH sessions will also display the IP address  of the remote client in parentheses.      The whoami command displays the username of the current user. This is helpful  to  verify  which  user's  environment  and  security  privileges  are  available  when  switching between different accounts.    Usage syntax: whoami   Using whoami to display the name of the current user   $ whoami   nick       Common usage examples:  who   who -b   who -r   whoami   Display who is currently logged into the system  Display the last system boot time  Display the current run level  Display the name of the current user       w    Purpose: Display detailed information about users logged in to the system.    Usage syntax: w [OPTIONS] [USER]   $ w    15:39:12 up 4 days,  6:09,  5 users,  load average: 0.06, 0.05, 0.01   USER    TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT   nick    pts 0    10.10.1.251      08:40    1:10    0.18s  0.15s -bash   dave    pts 1    10.10.1.188      12:32    0.00s   0.14s  0.14s vim   mike    pts 2    10.10.1.167      14:28    0.00s   0.12s  0.12s tail   lisa    pts 3    10.10.1.204      14:50    9.00s   0.14s  0.14s -bash   nick    pts 4    10.10.1.251      15:33    0.00s   0.15s  0.01s w   Output of the w command     The w command shows detailed information about users logged into the system.  It  is  similar  to  the  previously  discussed  who  command  except  it  provides  additional information such as the user's last login time, how long they have been  idle, and what program they are currently running.     The w command  also  displays  a  system  summary  line  that  shows  the  host's  uptime, number of connected users, and samples of  system load averages for the  past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.     Tip   The information displayed on the first  line is the same output  generated  by  the uptime command.  See  page  215  for  more  information  about  system uptime and load averages.     Common usage examples:  w   Display detailed information about users currently logged in to the system    last   lastb    Purpose: Display the last successful failed user logins.    Usage syntax: last [OPTIONS] [USER]   $ last   nick     pts 1        192.168.1.50  Sat May 22 13:42   still logged in   nick     pts 0        192.168.1.50  Sat May 22 13:40   still logged in   nick     tty7         :0            Sat May 22 13:40   still logged in   reboot   system boot  2.6.32-21-ge  Sat May 22 13:40 - 14:02   00:21    nick     pts 0        :0.0          Thu May 20 21:33 - 21:36   00:03    nick     pts 0        :0.0          Thu May 20 21:30 - 21:33   00:02    root     pts 0        :0.0          Thu May 20 21:27 - 21:30   00:03    nick     tty7         :0            Thu May 20 21:25 - crash  1+16:14    ...   Output of the last command     The last command  displays  the  login  and  logout  times  for  each  user  on  the  system. It also shows information about system shutdowns and restarts as shown  in the above example.    The lastb command  displays  failed  login  attempts  and  shown  in  the  next  example.    Usage syntax: lastb [OPTIONS] [USER]   $ lastb   nick     tty1                      Sat May 22 13:59 - 13:59   00:00    nick     tty1                      Thu May 20 21:27 - 21:27   00:00    root     tty1                      Thu May 20 15:27 - 15:27   00:00    btmp begins Sat May 20 13:59:28 2010   Output of the lastb command   Note   User login logout activity is stored in the  var log wtmp file.

Usage syntax: lastlog [OPTIONS]   $ lastlog  more   Username         Port     From          Latest   root             tty2                   Sat May 30 11:32:33 -0500 2009   dave             tty3                   Sat May 30 10:22:51 -0500 2009   nick             pts 0    10.10.1.251   Sat May 30 11:31:51 -0500 2009   steve                                   **Never logged in**   bin                                     **Never logged in**   sync                                    **Never logged in**   lp                                      **Never logged in**   ...   Output of the lastlog command     The lastlog command displays the most  recent  user login  time and dates for  every user on the system.  Executing lastlog with no  options displays the last  login  information  for  all  users,  as  shown  in  the  above  example.  This  output  is  similar to the last command except lastlog only displays the most current  login activity where last displays all available login events.     The -u option  can  be  used  to  display  the  last  login  for  a  specific  user  as  demonstrated in the next example.     $ lastlog -u nick   Username         Port     From          Latest   nick             pts 0    10.10.1.251   Sat May 30 11:31:51 -0500 2009   Displaying the last login for a specific user       Common usage examples:  lastlog   lastlog -u [USER]  Display the last login information for the specified user   Display the last login information for all users    finger    Purpose: Display information about a user account.    Usage syntax: finger [OPTIONS] [USER]   $ finger nick   Login: nick                  Name: Nick Marsh   Directory:  home nick                 Shell:  bin bash   On since Sat May 30 11:32  CDT  on tty2   10 minutes 32 seconds idle   New mail received Mon May 17 16:08 2010  CDT         Unread since Tue Apr 13 08:43 2010  CDT    No Plan.   Using the finger command to display information about a user account     The finger command  displays  information  about  user  accounts.  It  shows  details about  the user's  shell, home directory, and other helpful information.  The  example  above  demonstrates  the  typical  user  information  displayed  when  using  the finger command.     Tip   The finger command  looks  for  a  file  called .plan in  the  specified  user's home directory. This file can be edited by the user to contain a note  about  their  status  and  is  displayed  whenever  they  are  queried  with  the  finger command.  If  this  file  does  not  exist,  the finger command  will display "No Plan" for the user.       Common usage examples:  finger [USER]  Display information about the specified user       passwd    Purpose: Change passwords.    Usage syntax: passwd [OPTIONS] [USER]   $ passwd   Enter new UNIX password: ******   Retype new UNIX password: ******   passwd: password updated successfully   Changing the current user's password     The passwd command changes a user's password. Executing passwd with no  arguments  changes  the  password  for  the  current  user  as  shown  in  the  above  example.     The  root  user  can  change  other  user's  passwords  by  specifying  a  username  as  demonstrated in the next example.      passwd nick   Enter new UNIX password: ******   Retype new UNIX password: ******   passwd: password updated successfully   Changing a specific user's password       Common usage examples:  passwd   passwd [USER]   Set the password for the current user  Set the password for the specified user   passwd -e [USER]  Force a user to change their password at the next login  passwd -l [USER]  Lock the specified user account  passwd -u [USER]  Unlock the specified user account  passwd -S [USER]  Display the status of the specified user account      useradd   userdel    Purpose: Create delete user accounts.    Usage syntax: useradd [OPTIONS] [USER]    useradd -m steve    passwd steve   Enter new UNIX password: ******   Retype new UNIX password: ******   passwd: password updated successfully   Adding a user account to the system  and setting their password      The useradd command  creates  new  user  accounts.  In  the  above  example,  executing useradd -m steve creates  a  basic  login  account  for  a  user.  The   -m option is used to automatically create a home directory for the specified user   recommended .  The  password  is  then  set  for  the  new  user  using  the  previously  discussed passwd command.     Note   You  must  set  the  password  for  the  new  user  using  the  passwd  command before they can login.     The userdel command  deletes  user  accounts  from  the  system.  The  next  example demonstrates using userdel to remove an account. The optional -r  option is used to have the  system automatically  delete the  specified user's home  directory after removing their account.    Usage syntax: userdel [OPTIONS] [USER]    userdel -r steve   Removing a user account   Note   The rmuser command may be used on some Unix and BSD systems in  place of userdel.       Common usage examples:  useradd [USER]   Create the specified user account   useradd -m [USER]  Automatically create a home directory for the user  userdel [USER]   Delete the specified user account   userdel -r [USER]  Delete a user's account and their home directory            adduser   deluser    Purpose: Create delete user accounts on Linux systems.    Usage syntax: adduser [OPTIONS] [USER]    adduser mike   Adding user 'mike' ...   Adding new group 'mike'  1002  ...   Adding new user 'mike'  1002  with group 'mike' ...   Creating home directory ' home mike' ...   Copying files from ' etc skel' ...   Enter new UNIX password: ******   Retype new UNIX password: ******   passwd: password updated successfully   Changing the user information for mike           Full Name []: Mike Smith           Room Number []: Computer Room           Work Phone []: 555-1212           Home Phone []:   Is the information correct? [y N] y   Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default   Creating a user with the adduser command     The adduser command is a user-friendly frontend for the  previously discussed  useradd command. It simplifies the creation of user accounts on Linux systems  by  prompting  for  necessary  information  when  creating  accounts   rather  than  having  to  specify  a  number  of  command  line  options .  The  above  example  demonstrates the typical usage of the adduser command.     The deluser command deletes user accounts as shown in the next example.    Usage syntax: deluser [OPTIONS] [USER]    deluser mike   Removing user 'mike' ...   Warning: Removing group 'mike', since no other user is part of it.   Done.      Removing a user with the deluser command   Note   Default  settings  for  the  adduser  and  deluser  commands  are  stored in  etc adduser.conf and  etc deluser.conf.     Common usage examples:  adduser [USER]  Create a user account  deluser [USER]  Remove a user account    groupadd   groupdel    Purpose: Add remove a group.    Usage syntax: groupadd [GROUP]    groupadd accounting   Creating a new group with groupadd     The groupadd command  creates  new  group  accounts.  Groups  are  helpful  in  managing access to files and directories in a  multiuser environment. In the above  example a new group called accounting is created. The resulting group entry in the   etc group file is displayed below.      grep accounting  etc group   accounting:x:1002:   Displaying a group entry in the  etc group file     The groupdel command  deletes  groups  from  the  system.  The  next  example  demonstrates using the groupdel command to remove the  previously created  accounting group from the system    Usage syntax: groupdel [GROUP]    groupdel accounting   Deleting a group using groupdel        Common usage examples:  groupadd [GROUP]  Create a new group  groupdel [GROUP]  Delete a group       usermod   groupmod    Purpose: Modify user and group account settings.    Usage syntax: usermod [OPTIONS] [USER]    usermod -aG sales nick   Changing a user's group membership using the usermod command     The usermod command  modifies  user  account  settings.  In  the  above  example,  the -aG option is used to add the user nick to the sales group. You can also use  the usermod command  to  change  a  user's  home  directory  location  using  the   -d option or default shell using -s.    The groupmod command  modifies  groups.  Its  primary  purpose  is  to  rename  a  group.  In  the  next  example  the  accounting  group  is  renamed  to  finance  using  groupmod -n.    Usage syntax: groupmod [OPTIONS] [GROUP]    groupmod accounting -n finance    grep finance  etc group   finance:x:1002:   Renaming a group using the groupmod command       Common usage examples:  usermod -s [SHELL] [USER]  Change a user's default shell  usermod -d [DIR] [USER]   Change a user's home directory location   usermod -aG [GROUP] [USER]  Add a user to the specified group  groupmod [OLD] -n [NEW]   Rename the specified group       wall    Purpose: Broadcast a message to all users on the system.    Usage syntax: wall [FILE]   Anyone want some tacos?    wall          Using the wall command to send a message to all users logged into the system     The wall command  sends  a  message  to  all  users  currently  logged  into  the  system.  The  text  entered  in  the  above  example  will  display  on  all  local  terminals  and remote sessions currently logged into the system.      Note  Pressing CTRL + D ends the message editor and sends the message.     The  next  example  displays  a  sample  of  the wall message  output  as  seen  by  other users on the system.     Broadcast Message from root@e6400   dev pts 0  at 11:56 ...                                                    Anyone want some tacos?   Output of the wall message displayed on all terminals     In place of manually entering a message, a text file with a prewritten message can  be used with the wall command, as shown in the next example.       wall  home nick message.txt   Using a text file to send a message with the wall command       Common usage examples:  wall   wall [FILE]   Send a message to all users  Send the message in the specified file to all users   $           ulimit    Purpose: Display set system resource limits.    Usage syntax: ulimit [OPTIONS] [LIMIT]   $ ulimit -a   core file size           blocks, -c  0   data seg size            kbytes, -d  unlimited   scheduling priority              -e  20   file size                blocks, -f  unlimited   pending signals                  -i  16382   max locked memory        kbytes, -l  64   max memory size          kbytes, -m  unlimited   open files                       -n  1024   pipe size             512 bytes, -p  8   POSIX message queues      bytes, -q  819200   real-time priority               -r  0   stack size               kbytes, -s  8192   cpu time                seconds, -t  unlimited   max user processes               -u  unlimited   virtual memory           kbytes, -v  unlimited   file locks                       -x  unlimited   Displaying defined resource limits using the ulimit command     The ulimit command  displays  and  sets  system  resource  limits.  These  limits  control the maximum amount of system resources available to programs. It can be  used to control the maximum amount of memory, CPU time, and file sizes available  to each program launched by a user.     Tip   Ulimit  configuration  is  typically  stored  in  etc limits.conf or   etc security limits.conf on most systems.       Common usage examples:  ulimit -a   ulimit [OPTION] [LIMIT]  Set ulimit values     Display all defined resource limits      Section 6:  Process Control and Scheduling      Overview   Every  program  that  runs  on  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems  is  considered  to  be  a  process.  Processes  are  assigned  a  unique  identifier  which  it  used  to  monitor  and  control the process.  This process identifier  PID  can be used to control processes  using the command line utilities discussed in this section.    Commands covered in this section:     Command   ps   pgrep   pstree   kill   killall   nice   renice   &   bg   fg   jobs   nohup   batch   at   atq   atrm   crontab   Purpose   Display running processes.  Find processes by name.  Display all running processes in a tree view.  Terminate a process.  Terminate all processes with the specified name.  Execute programs at the specified CPU priority level.  Alter the priority of a running process.  Start a process in the background.   Move a process to the background foreground.   Display background and suspended jobs.  Run a process immune to hang-up signals.  Schedule programs to run during low CPU load.  Schedule programs to run at the specified time.  Display queued at jobs.  Remove scheduled at jobs from the queue.  Schedule programs to run at the specified time s .          Glossary of terms used in this section:    Cron   A  scheduling  system  used  to  execute  programs  at  specific  time  intervals.  A  program  that  has  been  scheduled,  suspended,  or  is  currently  running using the at or batch scheduling programs.  A numerical indicator assigned to processes to indicate and control  their CPU scheduling priority.   Process  IDentifier   A  unique  numeric  value  assigned  to  each  process executed on a system.   Parent  Process  IDentifier   The  PID  of  the  parent  process  that  started a child process.  Synonym for Nice Value.  Any program that has been executed.   Job   Nice Value   PID   PPID   Priority  Process    ps    Purpose: Display running processes.    Usage syntax: ps [OPTIONS]   $ ps    PID TTY          TIME CMD   4958 pts 0    00:00:00 bash   9596 pts 0    00:00:00 ps   Example output of the ps command     The ps command  displays  running  process  on  the  system.  Executing  the ps  command with no options will display all processes owned by the current user as  shown  in  the  above  example.  For  a  complete  listing  of  processes,  use  the  -e  option as demonstrated in the next example.     $ ps -e     PID TTY          TIME CMD       1 ?        00:00:01 init       2 ?        00:00:00 kthreadd       3 ?        00:00:00 migration 0       4 ?        00:00:00 ksoftirqd 0      5 ?        00:00:00 watchdog 0  ...   Using the -e option with the ps command     The -ef option can be used to display  detailed information about  all processes  on the  system. This includes the user ID, process ID, parent process ID, and other  helpful information, as shown in the next example.     $ ps -ef   UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD   root         1     0  0 Jun24 ?        00:00:02  sbin init   root         2     0  0 Jun24 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]   root         3     2  0 Jun24 ?        00:00:00 [migration 0]   root         4     2  0 Jun24 ?        00:00:00 [ksoftirqd 0]   root         5     2  0 Jun24 ?        00:00:00 [watchdog 0]   Output of the ps -ef command   ...     Common usage examples:  ps   ps -e   ps -ef      Display the current user's processes  Display all processes running on the system  Display detailed information about running processes   ps -u [USER]  Display processes owned by the specified user    pgrep    Purpose: Find processes by name.    Usage syntax: pgrep [OPTIONS] [NAME]   $ pgrep apache   3952   4075   4076   4077   4078   4079   Displaying PIDs with the name of apache using the pgrep command     The pgrep command displays all processes matching the specified name. In the  above  example  the  PIDs  for  the  apache  web  server  are  displayed.  This  is  the  equivalent  of  typing  ps -egrep apache  and  is  provided  as  a  shortcut  to  produce the same results.     The -l option  can  be  used  with pgrep to  display  the  full  process  name  for  each PID as demonstrated in the next example.     $ pgrep -l apache   3952 apache2   4075 apache2   4076 apache2   4077 apache2   4078 apache2   4079 apache2          Common usage examples:  pgrep [NAME]   Using the -l option with pgrep to display the full name of each process   Note   Some  systems  may  use  the pidof command  in  place  of  the pgrep  command.   Display PIDs matching the specified name   pgrep -l [NAME]  Display the process name in addition to the PID  pgrep -P [PPID]  Display all child processes of the specified PPID  pgrep -c [NAME]  Display the total number of matching processes      pstree    Purpose: Display all running processes in a tree view.    Usage syntax: pstree [OPTIONS]   init─┬─NetworkManager─┬─dhclient        │                └─{NetworkManager}        ├─apache2───5*[apache2]   $ pstree        ├─acpid        ├─atd        ├─cron        ├─cupsd        ├─dbus-launch        ├─dd        ├─fast-user-switc        ├─gconfd-2        ├─6*[getty]        ├─gnome-keyring-d        ├─gnome-power-man───{gnome-power-man}        ├─gnome-screensav        ├─gnome-settings-───{gnome-settings-}        ├─gnome-terminal─┬─bash───pstree        │                ├─gnome-pty-helpe        │                └─{gnome-terminal}        │        ├─gvfsd        ├─gvfsd-burn   ...   Displaying a process tree using the pstree command     The pstree command  draws  a  process  tree  for  all  processes  currently  running  on the system, as shown in the above example. The output of pstree makes it  easy to see the relationship between parent and child processes.      Common usage examples:  pstree   pstree -a   pstree -p   Display a basic process tree listing  Include PID numbers in the tree listing  Include command line options for each process  pstree [USER]  Display processes owned by the specified user  pstree [PID]   Display child processes of the specified PID          kill    Purpose: Terminate a process.    Usage syntax: kill [OPTIONS] [PID]    pgrep -l mysqld   5540 mysqld    kill 5540   Using the kill command to terminate a process     The kill command  terminates  the  specified  PID.  In  the  above  example,  the  mysqld process with a PID of 5540 is terminated using kill.     The  default  behavior  of  the kill command  requests  the  process  to  gracefully  exit. If a process fails to properly terminate, optional kill signals can be sent to force  the  process  to  end.  The  most  commonly  used  kill  signal  in  this  situation  is -9  which forcefully terminates the specified PID as displayed in the next example.     Using the -9 option to kill a hung process   It  is  recommended  to  only  use  the  kill  -9  command  in  rare  situations where a hung process refuses to gracefully exit. The -9 signal  is only used in these extreme situations, as it can cause undesired results  such as system instability and "zombie" child processes.    pgrep -l mysqld  5545 mysqld    kill -9 5545      Note       Common usage examples:  kill [PID]   Terminate the specified process   kill -9 [PID]  Force an unresponsive process to terminate      killall    Purpose: Terminate all processes with the specified name.    Usage syntax: killall [OPTIONS] [NAME]    pgrep -l apache2   3952 apache2   4075 apache2   4076 apache2   4077 apache2   4078 apache2   4079 apache2    killall apache2   Terminating processes by name using the killall command     The killall command terminates all processes that match the specified name.  This  can  be  helpful  if  you  have  several  processes  with  the  same  name  that  you  need  to  kill.  In  the  above  example,  multiple  processes  related  to  the  apache2  service are terminated using killall.     Tip   The  -i  parameter  can  be  used  with  killall  to  prompt  for  confirmation before terminating each process. This is recommended as it  helps prevent killing the wrong process due to typos.       Common usage examples:  killall [NAME]   Terminate all processes with the specified name  killall -i [NAME]  Prompt for confirmation before killing processes         nice    Purpose: Execute programs at the specified CPU priority level.    Usage syntax: nice [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]    nice -n 19 LowPriority.sh    nice -n -20 HighPriority.sh   Changing the priority of a process using the nice command     The nice command  allows  programs  to  be  started  at  a  lower  or  higher  than  normal  scheduling  priority.  This  allows  you  to  control  which  processes  the  kernel  should  favor  when  dividing  processor  time  among  running  programs.  Processes  with  the  lowest nice number  are  executed  with  the  highest  priority  and  vice  versa.  The  example  above  demonstrates  using nice to  start  programs  with  modified scheduling priority.    On most systems, priority levels for normal users range from 0 to 19, with 0 being  the  highest  priority  and  19  being  the  lowest  priority.  The  root  user  can  create  processes with a range of -20  highest  to 19  lowest .      Unix Linux BSD scheduling priority         Most  programs  start  with  a  nice  level  of  0  by  default.  Critical  system  services  usually  have  a  negative  nice  level  so  that  they  are  always  given  preference  over  user programs.     Note   Some Unix systems may use a range of 0 to 39 with 0 being the highest  priority  and  39  being  the  lowest.  For  more  information  see man nice  on your local system.       Common usage examples:  nice -n [NUM] [COMMAND]  Start a program with the specified priority    renice    Purpose: Alter the priority of a running process.    Usage syntax: renice [OPTIONS] [PID]    renice +5 -p 7279   7279: old priority 0, new priority 5   Changing the priority of a process     The renice command  adjusts  the  priority  of  a  running  process.  In  the  above  example  PID  7279  is  adjusted  to  have  a  +5  priority.  This  effectively  lowers  the  priority of the process since the previous priority was 0.      Common usage examples:  renice + -[NUM] -p [PID]  Change the specified PID's priority         &    Purpose: Start a process in the background.    Usage syntax: [COMMAND] &   $ . SomeProgram.sh &   [1] 10717   $ ps   PID TTY          TIME CMD  10696 pts 0    00:00:00 bash   10717 pts 0    00:00:03 SomeProgram.sh   10721 pts 0    00:00:00 ps   Executing a program in the background with the & command line operator     & is  a  command  line  operator  that  instructs  the  shell  to  start  the  specified  program  in  the  background.  This  allows  you  to  have  more  than  one  program  running at the same time without having to start multiple terminal sessions. In the  above  example,  a  shell  script  called  SomeProgram.sh  is  started  as  a  background process. Executing the ps command shows the requested program is  now running in the background.     Tip   Output from background programs will still be displayed in the shell. You  can  redirect  this  output  to  a  file  by  using  the  following  syntax:  SomeProgram.sh  >  output.log  &  This  will  redirect  all  the  output of the background program to a file called output.log in the  current directory.       Common usage examples:  [COMMAND] &   Execute the specified command in the background  [COMMAND] > [FILE] &  Redirect  the  output  of  the  background  command      to a file    bg   fg    Purpose: Move a process to the background foreground.    Usage syntax: bg [JOBID]   $ . SomeProgram.sh       $ bg 1   $ jobs   [1]+  Stopped                SomeProgram.sh   [1]-  Running                 SomeProgram.sh   Suspending a running program and then resuming it in the background     The  bg command  sends  a  process  to  the  background.  This  allows  you  to  multitask several programs within a single terminal session.  In the above example  the  shell  script SomeProgram.sh is  suspended   by  pressing  CTRL  +  Z  on  the  keyboard  and then resumed as a background process using bg.      Note   The jobs command  see page  117  can be used to verify the program  is now running in the background.     The fg command  moves  background  processes  to  the  foreground.  In  the  next  example the fg command is used to bring the specified job ID to the foreground.    Usage syntax: fg [JOBID]   [1]-  Running                 SomeProgram.sh   $ jobs   $ fg 1   ...   SomeProgram.sh   Moving a background job to the foreground       Common usage examples:  bg [JOBID]  Send the specified job to the background  fg [JOBID]  Move the specified job to the foreground         jobs    Purpose: Display background and suspended jobs.    Usage syntax: jobs [OPTIONS]   $ jobs   [1]-  Running                 SomeProgram.sh   [2]+  Stopped                 AnotherProgram.sh   [3]   Stopped                 Test.sh   Displaying background programs using the jobs command     The jobs command displays the status of background programs and suspended  processes.  In  the  above  example,  three  background  jobs  are  displayed.  The  previously  mentioned  fg  and  bg  commands  can  be  used  to  move  the  processes to the foreground and background respectively.    The following table describes the output fields of the jobs command.     Job ID  [1]-   [2]+   [3].   Status   Program   Running   SomeProgram.sh   Stopped   AnotherProgram.sh   Stopped   Test.sh   Output fields of the jobs command      Note   The plus sign is used to indicate what job is considered to be the  default  job  for use with the bg and fg commands . The minus sign indicates  the job that will become the default if the current default job terminates.  There  can  be  only  one  +  and  -  at  any  given  time.  All  other  jobs  will  not  have any indicators.       Common usage examples:  jobs   Display all jobs   jobs -l  Display all jobs and their PID      nohup    Purpose: Run a process immune to hang-up signals.    Usage syntax: nohup [COMMAND] &   $ nohup SomeProgram.sh &   nohup: ignoring input and appending output to 'nohup.out'   $ exit   Using the nohup command to launch a background program     The nohup command  makes  processes  immune  to  hang-up  signals.  A  hang-up  signal  is  used  to  inform  child  processes  of  a  shell  that  the  parent  process  is  terminating.  This  would  normally  cause  all  child  processes  to  terminate.  Using  nohup allows a program to continue running after you log out, as demonstrated  in the above example.     Tip   Output  from  the  program  is  stored  in  a  file  called nohup.out in  the  directory where the nohup command was executed.     Common usage examples:  nohup [COMMAND ] &  Execute a program immune to hang-up signals       at   atq   atrm    Purpose: Schedule a program to run at the specified time.    Usage syntax: at [OPTIONS] [TIMEDATE]    $ at 1am   at> MyProgram.sh   at>     job 1 at Sat May 30 01:00:00 2009   Scheduling a process using the at command   the  at  command     The at command schedules programs to run at the specified time. In the above  example,  launch  a  shell  script  called  MyProgram.sh.  The  launch  time  in  this  example  is  specified  as 1am on  the  command line. You can also  use more traditional  Unix time specifications  such as  01:00 or any other HH:MM combination.     is  used   to   Tip   The at command  has  a  special  command  line  argument  called  now.  This  can  be  used  as  a  shortcut  to  save  time  when  scheduling  jobs.  For  example  typing at now + 15 minutes would  schedule  the  job  to  launch 15 minutes from the current time.     The atq command displays information about queued at jobs as shown in the  next example.    Usage syntax: atq   $ atq   1   Sat May 30 01:00:00 2009 MyProgram.sh nick   Using the atq command to display the job queue     The atrm command deletes a scheduled job as shown in the next example.    Usage syntax: atrm [JOBID]   Removing a scheduled job using the atrm command   $ atrm 1       Common usage examples:  at [TIME]   atq   Schedule a program to run at the specified time  Display the at job queue   atrm [JOBID]  Remove a scheduled job from the at queue    batch    Purpose: Schedule programs to run during low CPU load.    Usage syntax: batch [OPTIONS]   $ batch   at> BigProgram.sh   at>     job 1 at Fri May 29 20:01:00 200   Scheduling a batch process     The batch command schedules a program to run when the system CPU load is  low.  This  is  useful  for  running  resource-intensive  programs  that  would  normally  interfere with system performance.    In this example the batch program is used to schedule the BigProgram.sh  script to run when the system CPU load is low.      Note   Each  platform  has  its  own  definition  of  low  load.  See man batch for  more information about your system's batch command usage.       Common usage examples:  batch  Launch the batch scheduling shell       crontab    Purpose: Schedule programs to run at the specified time s .    Usage syntax: crontab [OPTIONS]    crontab -l   30 12 * * 1-5  root SomeProgram.sh   Displaying configured cron jobs     The crontab command  manages  a  user's  scheduled  cron  jobs.  Cron  is  a  subsystem found on most Unix, Linux, and BSD systems that schedules programs to  run  at  a  specific  interval.  It  differs  from  the  previously  discussed at command  because cron jobs run at reoccurring intervals  where at jobs run only once .      Note   The  name  cron  comes  from  the  Greek  word  "chronos"  which  means  "time".     In the above example, the -l option is used to display the current user's crontab.  The table below describes the fields found in the crontab file.     Minute  Hour  Day of   Month   30   12   *   Month  Day of  Week  1-5   *   Crontab fields   Program    root SomeProgram.sh     In  this  example SomeProgram.sh is  run  every  Monday-Friday  at  12:30  PM.  The day of week is symbolized as 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc. An asterisk   *  is a wild card that represents all valid values.    crontab -e is  used  to  edit  the  current  user's  crontab  as  demonstrated  in  the  next example.      crontab -e    30   12   *    *    1-5    root SomeProgram.sh   Editing the crontab     Common usage examples:  crontab -l  List the current user's crontab  crontab -e  Edit the current user's crontab  crontab -r  Delete the current user's crontab       Section 7:   Startup and Shutdown     Overview   This chapter covers commands used to startup and shutdown Unix, Linux, and BSD  systems.  It  also  provides  an  overview  of  platform  specific  service  control  commands for popular platforms.    Commands covered in this section:     Purpose   Shut down the system.  Power off the system.  Reboot the system.  Halt the system.  Change the runlevel.  Display the previous and current runlevel.  Manage services on a Linux system.   sysv-rc-conf  Display and edit Linux runlevel configuration.   Display  and  edit  runlevel  configuration  on  Red  Hat  Linux- based systems.  Display  and  edit  runlevel  configuration  on  Gentoo  Linux  systems.  Display the status of services on Gentoo Linux systems.   Stop start services on AIX systems.

A  set  of  profiles  used  by  the  init  program  that  defines  the  programs  and  services  to  load  during  system  startup   or  when  called  by  the  telinit command .  A system program that provides a service as a web server, DNS server,  email  server,  etc.  Services  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  Daemons  or  Service Daemons.    shutdown    Purpose: Shut down the system.    Usage syntax: shutdown [OPTIONS] [TIME] [MESSAGE]    shutdown now   BROADCAST MESSAGE FROM ROOT:   The system is going down for shutdown now!   * Stopping services                                        [ OK ]   * Terminating processes                                    [ OK ]   ...   The system will now halt.   Example output from the shutdown command     The shutdown command  is  used  to  shutdown  the  local  system.  There  are  several  different  types  of  shutdowns  that  can  be  performed:  halt,  poweroff,  and  reboot.     Note   Usage  of  the shutdown command  varies  between  the  various  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  platforms.  Examples  on  this  page  are  intended  for  Linux  systems.  For  usage  examples  specific  to  your  environment,  type man  shutdown on your local system.     When the shutdown command is executed, a  warning is broadcast to all users  logged in to the local system. An optional message can be specified following the  time argument as shown in the next example.      shutdown 2 Save your work and log off ASAP!   BROADCAST MESSAGE FROM ROOT:    The system is going down for shutdown in 2 minutes!   Save your work and log off ASAP!   Example output from the shutdown command's broadcast message       Common usage examples:  shutdown now   shutdown [MIN]   Shutdown the system immediately   Wait the specified number of minutes before shutting  down   shutdown [HH:MM]  Shutdown at the specified time  24-hour format   shutdown -r now   shutdown -H now   shutdown -P now   Restart the system  Halt the system  Power off the system       poweroff    Purpose: Power off the system.    Usage syntax: poweroff    poweroff   BROADCAST MESSAGE FROM ROOT:    The system is going down for power off now!   * Stopping services                                        [ OK ]   * Terminating processes                                    [ OK ]   ...   The system will now power off.   Example output of the poweroff command     The poweroff command will immediately shutdown and power off the system.  It is essentially  a  shortcut  for shutdown -P now. The poweroff command  is found on all Linux distributions and some BSD and Unix systems.      Note   To  see  if  the poweroff command  is  supported  on  your  system,  type  whereis poweroff.      Warning   The poweroff command  does  not  offer  a  grace  period  and  will  immediately bring down the system when executed.       Common usage examples:  poweroff   Shutdown and poweroff the system    reboot    Purpose: Reboot the system.    Usage syntax: reboot    reboot   BROADCAST MESSAGE FROM ROOT: The system is going down for reboot now!   * Stopping services                                        [ OK ]   * Terminating processes                                    [ OK ]      ...   The system will now reboot.   Example output of the reboot command     The reboot command is used to gracefully reboot the system. It is essentially a  shortcut  for shutdown -r now.  Executing reboot on  the  command  line  will immediately reboot the system as demonstrated in the above example.     Warning   The  reboot command  does  not  offer  a  grace  period  and  will  immediately reboot the system when executed.       Common usage examples:  reboot   Gracefully reboot the system       halt    Purpose: Halt the system.    Usage syntax: halt    halt      ...   BROADCAST MESSAGE FROM ROOT: The system is going down for halt now!   * Stopping services                                        [ OK ]   * Terminating processes                                    [ OK ]   The system will now halt.   Example output of the halt command     The halt command  will  halt  an  online  system.  A  halt  is  a  special  type  of  shutdown which gracefully shuts down the operating system without powering off  the system.      Note   Some  commercial  Unix  systems  will  enter  maintenance  mode  when  halted.  This  can  be  used  to  access  a  pre-boot  configuration diagnostic  environment.       Common usage examples:  halt  Halt the system    telinit    Purpose: Change the runlevel.    Usage syntax: telinit [RUNLEVEL]   *** Switching to run level 1 ***    telinit 1    runlevel   3 1   Using telinit to change the system's runlevel     telinit tells  the  system's  init  process  to  stop  and  start  the  necessary  services  configured  for  the  specified  runlevel.  In  the  above  example  the  telinit  command is used to change the system to runlevel 1. The runlevel command   see page 129  is then executed to display the current and previous runlevels.    Each system's runlevel configuration is specific to the distribution being used  and  can be customized to fit your needs. Most Unix, Linux, and BSD systems will have a  runlevel configuration similar to the one described in the following table.     Runlevel   Purpose   0  1  2  3  4  5  6   Shutdown or special administrative mode  Single user mode  Multiuser mode  Multiuser mode  Multiuser mode  Distribution specific  Reboot  Typical Unix, Linux, and BSD runlevels       Common usage examples:  telinit [RUNLEVEL]  Tell the init process to load the specified runlevel         runlevel    Purpose: Display the previous and current runlevel.    Usage syntax: runlevel   $ runlevel   3 1   Output of the runlevel command     The  runlevel  command  displays  the  current  and  previous  runlevel.  The  runlevel  is  an  initialization  sequence  called  by  the  init  process  and  defines  procedures for system startup and shutdown. In the above example, runlevel  is  used  to  display  the  current  runlevel  information.  The  first  number  displayed  is  the previous runlevel and the second number is the current runlevel.

The output of ifconfig displays information such as IP address, MAC address,  and interface statistical counters, as shown in the above example.     The  most  common  type  of  network  interface  is  a  standard  ethernet  card.  This  interface  is  usually  designated  as eth0  or en0.  Systems  with  multiple  network  cards will have eth0, eth1, eth2, etc.     Note   The loopback interface  lo  is present on all Unix, Linux, and BSD systems.  It  is  critical  for  normal  system  operations  and  should  not  be  disabled  or  modified. This interface will always have an IP address of 127.0.0.1.       Common usage examples:  ifconfig   ifconfig -a   Display enabled network interfaces   Display all network interfaces   ifconfig [INTERFACE]  Display the specified network interface         ifup   ifdown    Purpose: Enable disable network interfaces.    Usage syntax: ifup [OPTIONS] [INTERFACE]    ifup eth0   Enabling a network interface using the ifup command     ifup enables a network interface. In the above example the interface eth0 is  enabled.  After  executing  the ifup command,  the eth0 interface  is  activated  and available for use.    ifdown disables network interfaces. This takes the specified interface offline and  makes  it  unavailable  for  use.  The  next  example  demonstrates  using ifdown to  shutdown the eth0 interface.    Usage syntax: ifdown [OPTIONS] [INTERFACE]    ifdown eth0   Disabling a network interface using the ifdown command   Note   Some  systems  may  designate  ethernet  interfaces  as en0 instead  of  eth0.       Common usage examples:  ifup [INTERFACE]   ifup -a   Enable the specified network interface  Enable all network interfaces   ifdown [INTERFACE]  Disable the specified network interface  ifdown -a   Disable all network interfaces          iwconfig    Purpose: Display wireless network interfaces.

Common usage examples:  nmap [HOST]   Display open ports on the specified host   nmap -PN [HOST]  Do not ping the target before scanning  nmap -O [HOST]   Display the operating system of the target system  Perform an aggressive scan   nmap -A [HOST]             telnet    Purpose: Client for connecting to remote servers via the telnet protocol.    Usage syntax: telnet [OPTIONS] [HOST]   $ telnet myserver   login: nick   password: ******   $   Connecting to a remote system using the telnet command     The telnet command  is  used  to  connect  to  remote  systems  via  the  telnet  protocol.  The  above  example  demonstrates  connecting  to  a  remote  system  using  telnet. Once connected to the remote system you can execute commands as if  you were logged into the system locally.     Note   Telnet is an insecure legacy protocol and has largely been replaced by SSH  for  security  reasons.  Usernames,  passwords,  and  other  sensitive  information  transmitted  via  telnet  are  sent  in  plain  text  making  it  very  easy  for  hackers  to  capture.  Avoid  using  telnet  whenever  possible,  especially  when  communicating  over  untrusted  networks  such  as  the  internet.       Common usage examples:  telnet [HOST]  Start a telnet session to a remote system       ssh    Purpose: Client for connecting to remote servers via the SSH protocol.    Usage syntax: ssh [OPTIONS] [HOST]   $ ssh myserver   nick@myserver's password: ******   $   Using the ssh command to connect to a remote system     The ssh command  is  used  to  connect  to  remote  systems  via  the  SSH  protocol.  SSH creates an encrypted connection between two systems and provides a secure  channel for communication. This helps prevent  "man in the middle" hackers from  being  able  to  capture  sensitive  information   such  as  usernames  and  passwords   when connecting to remote systems.     Tip   PuTTY,  a  free  SSH  and  telnet  client  for  Windows,  can  be  downloaded at  www.chiark.greenend.org.uk ~sgtatham putty .

In  the  above example, the mkfs command is used on a Linux system to format the first  partition of the  dev sdb disk drive.     Warning  The mkfs command will destroy all data on the target device.            Note   Usage syntax and supported options for mkfs vary across the different  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  platforms.  The  above  example  was  created  on  a  Linux system. See man mkfs to find the correct usage  syntax for your  system.       Common usage examples:  mkfs -t [FSTYPE] [DEVICE]  Create a file system on the specified drive  mkfs -ct [FSTYPE] [DEVICE]  Check for bad blocks before formatting    fsck    Purpose: Check and repair file systems.

Using the fsck command to check a file system     fsck checks the specified file systems for errors and repairs them if necessary. In  the  above  example,  for  errors.  The  -n option  is  used  to  instruct fsck to  check  but  not  repair  the  specified  file  system. This is necessary since, in this case, the   file system is a live  mounted   file system and cannot be repaired unless first unmounted.     the     file  system   is  checked   Warning   The fsck command  should  never  be  used  to  repair  a  mounted  file  system  as  it  will  cause  data  corruption.  In  Linux,  you  can  safely  run  fsck at  the  next  reboot  by  typing sudo touch  forcefsck  on  the  command  line.  Other  systems  may  require  booting  recovery  media  in  order  to  use fsck.  See man fsck for  more  information  about usage on your system.       Common usage examples:  fsck [FILESYSTEM]   Check and repair the specified file system   fsck -n [FILESYSTEM]  Check the specified file system without repairing it         badblocks    Purpose: Check a disk drive for bad blocks.    Usage syntax: badblocks [OPTIONS] [DEVICE]    badblocks -v  dev sda   Checking blocks 0 to 8388607   Checking for bad blocks  read-only test : done   Pass completed, 0 bad blocks found.   Checking a device for bad blocks using the badblocks command     The badblocks command is a  Linux utility used to search a  disk  drive for bad  blocks.  In  the  above  example,  the badblocks command  is  used  to  check   dev sda for  bad  blocks.  The -v option  is  included  to  display  verbose  status  information during the scan.    A disk drive that is healthy should have no bad blocks. If bad blocks are found, the  drive should be replaced immediately to avoid data loss.      Warning   The  default badblocks test  is  read-only  and  generally  safe  to  use  on  a  live  file  system.  Specifying  the  -w  option  will  perform  a  read write test and will destroy all data on the specified disk. It should  only be used to test a disk that does not contain critical data, as it will  be completely overwritten.       Common usage examples:  badblocks [DEVICE]   Check the specified device for bad blocks  badblocks -v [DEVICE]  Display verbose messages when checking  badblocks -w [DEVICE]  Perform a read write test on the disk      tune2fs    Purpose: Adjust Linux file system parameters.

Displaying a file system's parameters using the tune2fs command     The tune2fs command displays and edits file system settings on Linux systems.  It  supports  the  ext2,  ext3,  and  ext4  file  systems.  In  the  above  example,  the -l  parameter is used to display detailed information about the specified file system.    tune2fs is most commonly used to adjust the fsck intervals for a file system.  This is the interval in which the system will automatically run an fsck on the file  system. The next example displays the variables that control this.      tune2fs -l  dev sda5  grep -Ei 'checkmax'   Maximum mount count:      32   Last checked:             Wed Mar 24 14:14:20 2010   Check interval:           15552000  6 months    Next check after:         Mon Sep 20 14:14:20 2010   Displaying a file system's fsck parameters       Common usage examples:  tune2fs -l [device]   tune2fs -c [count] \   [device]   [device]   tune2fs -i [interval] \      Display  information  about  the  specified  file  system  Force the fsck command to check the file  system after the specified number of mounts  Force the fsck command to check the file  system  at  the  specified  interval  in  days,  weeks, or months    mount   umount    Purpose: Mount local and remote file systems.    Usage syntax: mount [OPTIONS] [SOURCE] [TARGET]    mount  dev sb1  mnt Seagate   Mounting a local file system     The mount command  mounts  file  systems.  In  the  above  example,  the  device   dev sdb1  is  mounted  under  the   mnt Seagate  directory.  This  is  an  example of mounting a local file system.     Tip   Local file systems can be configured to mount automatically at boot using  the  etc fstab file.     mount can  also  be  used  to mount  remote  file  systems  via  NFS,  as  shown  in  the  next example.      mount 10.10.1.48: home nick  mnt nick   Mounting an NFS file system     In this example,  home nick on the remote machine  10.10.1.48  is shared via  NFS and mounted locally in  mnt nick.      Note   NFS must  be properly configured on the remote system for this to work.  NFS settings are managed via the  etc exports file.     The umount command unmounts file systems as shown in the next example.    Usage syntax: umount [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]   Unmounting a file system    umount  mnt Seagate       Common usage examples:  mount   mount [DEVICE] [DIR]   mount [IP]:[REMOTE] [LOCAL]  Mount the specified NFS share  umount [PATH]   Unmount a file system   Display all mounted file systems  Mount the specified device    mkswap    Purpose: Create swap space storage.    Usage syntax: mkswap [OPTIONS] [DEVICE]    mkswap  dev sdb1   Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 522076 KiB   no label, UUID=cc35b16c-985f-4723-a5c4-e4dd2377aad   Creating swap storage using the mkswap command     The mkswap command  creates  swap  space  on  Linux  systems.  Swap  storage  is  used to store data in memory that is rarely accessed. This frees up RAM for active  programs.  In the above example, the mkswap command is used to create swap  storage on the  dev sdb1 partition.      Tip   Swap  utilization  has  a  significant  impact  on  system  performance.  If  a  system  is  utilizing  swap  space  heavily,  it  should  be  upgraded  with  additional  memory  to  increase  performance.  Additionally,  creating  swap  storage  on  its  own  dedicated  disk  is  a  good  practice  that  is  used  to  prevent degraded performance.     mkswap is a Linux command. Similar commands exist on other platforms and are  detailed in the following cross-reference table.     AIX  mkps   BSD   swapctl   HP-UX   Linux   lvcreate   mkswap   Solaris  swap   Swap command cross reference       Common usage examples:  mkswap [DEVICE]   Create swap space on the specified device   mkswap -c [DEVICE]  Check the device for bad blocks before formatting         swapon   swapoff    Purpose: Activate deactivate swap space.    Usage syntax: swapon [OPTIONS] [DEVICE]    swapon  dev sdb1   Activating swap storage     The  swapon  command  activates  demonstrates activating a newly created swap space using swapon.      swap   storage.  The  above  example   Note   Newly created swap space does not become usable by the system until it  is  activated  using  the swapon command.  Most  systems  have  at  least  one  swap  space  that  is  activated  at  boot  by  default.  Additional  swap  devices  created  after  installation  must  be  added  to  the  etc fstab  file to be automatically activated at boot.     The  swapoff  command  deactivates  swap  storage.  The  next  example  demonstrates using swapoff to deactivate the  dev sdb1 swap device.    Usage syntax: swapoff [OPTIONS] [DEVICE]    swapoff  dev sdb1   Deactivating swap storage     Swap storage must be deactivated with the swapoff command before it can be  changed or removed.     Note   Solaris  systems  use  the  swap command  in  pace  of swapon and  swapoff.       Common usage examples:  swapon -a   swapon [DEVICE]   swapon -s   swapoff -a   Enable all swap spaces  Enable the specified swap space  Display swap usage by device  Disable all active swap spaces   swapoff [DEVICE]  Disable the specified swap space      swapinfo    Purpose: Display swap space information.     Usage syntax: swapinfo [OPTIONS]    swapinfo                Kb     Kb      Kb PCT  START      Kb   TYPE      AVAIL   USED    FREE USED LIMIT RESERVE PRI NAME   dev      524288      0  524288    0%     0      -      dev vg00 lvol2   reserve       - 111696 -111696   memory   389816 143784  246032   37%   Output of the swapinfo command on HP-UX     swapinfo  displays  details  about  active  swap  storage.  The  above  example  displays the output of the swapinfo command on an HP-UX system. It includes  information  about  the  size  and  location  of  swap  storage  and  the  amount  of  memory and swap utilization.     swapinfo is  available  on  BSD  and  HP-UX  systems.  Other  platforms  use  the  commands  listed  in  the  cross-reference  below  to  display  information  about  swap  utilization.

Usage syntax: sync    sync   Flushing the file system buffer with the sync command     The sync command flushes the file system buffer. Unix, Linux, and BSD systems  pool  disk  activity  to  increase  performance.  When  this  happens,  pending  write  operations  are  buffered  in  memory  and  processed  at  an  opportune  time.  The  sync command  forces  the  buffer  to  flush,  which  completes  all  pending  write  operations.     While the sync command is rarely used, it can be helpful in situations where the  system must  be rebooted in  an abnormal manner, such as unplugging  the system  or pressing the reset button. Executing sync before powering off a system in this  manner  can  help  prevent  file  system  corruption  by  ensuring  all  disk  buffers  are  completely flushed.     Tip   Executing the sync command twice is a common practice to ensure all  file  system  buffers  have  been  flushed.  The  can  be  done  with  one  command by executing sync;sync on the command line.       Common usage examples:  sync   Flush the file system buffer   sync ; sync  Really flush the file system buffer        Section 11:   Backup and Restore Commands     Overview   This  section  covers  utilities  used  to  backup  and  restore  files.  Creating  a  good  backup  is  very  important  for  recovering  from  system  failure  or  natural  disaster.  Most  systems  have  a  number  of  built-in  backup  programs.  These  programs  can  create full, partial, and incremental backups and should be incorporated into your  disaster recovery plan.    Commands covered in this section:     Command   restore   tar   dump   dd   cpio   mt   mksysb   Purpose   Create extract archive files.  Create incremental backups.  Restore files from dump archives.  Create raw copies of data devices.  Create extract cpio archives.  Control tape devices.  Create a backup image of an AIX system.     Glossary of terms used in this section:    Full Backup  Incremental Backup  A  backup  that  includes  only  files  that  have  changed  since   A backup that includes all files on the local system.   the last full backup.       tar    Purpose: Create extract archive files.    Usage syntax: tar [OPTIONS] [OUTPUT] [INPUT]    tar -cvf backup.tar  etc *    etc acpi     etc acpi stopbtn.sh    etc acpi videobtn.sh    etc acpi ibm-wireless.sh    etc acpi hibernate.sh    etc acpi resume.d     etc acpi resume.d 15-video-post.sh    etc acpi resume.d 62-ifup.sh    etc acpi resume.d 10-thinkpad-standby-led.sh   ...   Creating a backup archive of the  etc directory using the tar command     The tar command  creates  and  extracts  tar  archives.  It  is  the  most  commonly  used  utility  for  creating  backups  on  Unix,  Linux,  and  BSD  systems.  In  the  above  example,  the -cvf option  is  used  to  create  a  backup  archive  of  the  etc  directory called backup.tar.     In the next example, the -xvf option is used to extract the  etc hosts file  from the archive created in the first example.      tar -xvf backup.tar etc hosts   etc hosts   Extracting files from a tar archive   Note   The default operation of the tar command strips the leading   from  the  file  path.  This  means  that  files  restored  from tar archives  will  be  placed in a location relative to the current directory. The -P option can  be specified to override this behavior.       Common usage examples:  tar -cvf [FILE] [ITEM]  Backup the specified item s   tar -czvf [FILE] [ITEM]  Compress the archive to save space  tar -xvf [FILE] [ITEM]  Restore the specified item s   tar -tf [FILE]   List all files in the specified archive          dump    Purpose: Create incremental backups.    Usage syntax: dump [OPTIONS] [OUTPUT] [INPUT]    dump -0 -uf backup.dump     Creating a full backup using the dump command     dump is an archive utility that creates incremental backups. In the above example,  the -0 option  indicates  a  full  backup  of  the   file  system  to  a  file  called  backup.dump.     Subsequent  incremental  backups  are  specified  as  -1,  -2,  -3,  etc.  The  subsequent  backups  will  only  archive  files  that  have  changed  since  the  last  full  backup.  This  can  save  time  and  storage  space  when  creating  backups,  but  it  will  take longer to restore since the incremental backups must be restored in layers.     Note   Information about backed up files is stored in a file called dumpdates.  On Unix  systems, this  file  is usually found in  etc dumpdates. Linux  systems store this information in  var lib dumpdates.       Common usage examples:  dump -0 -uf [OUTPUT] [INPUT]   dump -[NUM] -uf [OUTPUT] [INPUT]  Create an incremental backup     Create a full backup       restore    Purpose: Restore files from dump archives.    Usage syntax: restore [OPTIONS] [FILE]    restore -if backup.dump   restore > pwd       restore > cd etc   restore > add hosts   restore > extract   ...   Restoring files from a dump archive     The restore command  restores  files  from  archives  created  with  the dump  command.  The  above  example  demonstrates  starting  the interactive  restore  shell to extract files from a dump archive.    The following table describes the basic restore shell commands.     Command  ls [PATH]   cd [PATH]   pwd   add [PATH]   Function   List the contents of the current or specified directory  Navigate the dump archive  Display the current working directory  Add  the  current  directory   or  specified  item   to  the  restore list   delete [PATH]  Delete the current  directory   or specified item  from   extract   help   quit   the restore list  Extract all files on the restore list  Display the help menu  Exit the restore shell   Restore shell commands       Common usage examples:  restore -if [FILE]  Open the specified archive in the restore shell  restore -rf [FILE]  Restore an entire file system from a dump archive  restore -tf [FILE]  List all items in the specified dump archive      dd    Purpose: Create raw copies of data devices.    Usage syntax: dd if=[SOURCE] of=[TARGET] [OPTIONS]    dd if= dev sdb of= dev sdc   Creating a copy of a disk using the dd command     The dd command  performs  raw   bit  for  bit   copies  of  data  devices.  The if  parameter  specifies  the  input  file  or  device  to  be  read.  The of parameter  specifies  the  output  location.  In  the  above  example,  the  entire  hard  drive   dev sdb is copied to  dev sdc.     dd  can  also  be  used  to  create  image  files  of  a  disk.  The  next  example  demonstrates using dd to create an ISO image file from a CD-ROM.      dd if= dev cdrom of= tmp image.iso   Converting a CD-ROM into an ISO file using the dd command   Warning   The dd command is often referred to as the "data destroyer" because  it can be very destructive if used incorrectly. Always use caution when  experimenting with dd.       Common usage examples:  dd if=[SOURCE] of=[TARGET]  Create a raw copy of the specified device            cpio    Purpose: Create or extract cpio archives.    Usage syntax: [INPUT]  cpio [OPTIONS] > [OUTPUT]    ls  cpio -ov >  tmp backup.cpio    cd  etc   adduser.conf   adjtime   aliases   alternatives   ...   Creating a backup with the cpio command     The  cpio  utility  creates  simple  backups.  -ov option creates a cpio backup of the  etc directory.     The next example demonstrates restoring  files from the backup.cpio archive  using the -idv option.     In  the  above  example,  the     cpio -idv <  tmp backup.cpio    cd  etc   adduser.conf   adjtime   aliases   alternatives   ...   Extracting files from a cpio archive         Note   cpio is  a  legacy  program  that  is  rarely  used  for  backup  on  modern  systems.  Use  tar and dump in  place  of cpio as  they  offer  a  more  complete and user-friendly backup solution.       Common usage examples:  ls  cpio -ov > backup.cpio  Backup the specified item s   cpio -idv < backup.cpio  Restore the specified item s   List all items in the specified archive   cpio --list < backup.cpio    mt    Purpose: Control tape devices.    Usage syntax: mt -f [DEVICE] [OPERATION]    mt -f  dev rmt0 rewind   Rewinding a tape using the mt command     The mt command controls removable tape devices. It can be used to display the  status  of  the  drive  and  manage  its  removable  media.  The  example  above  demonstrates  using  the mt command  to  rewind  the  tape  in  the  dev rmt0  drive.    The following table lists the most common operations used with the mt utility.     Operation  rewind   retension   erase   status   offline   Function   Rewind the tape device  Retension the tape  Erase the tape  Display the tape device status  Rewind and eject the tape   Common mt operations       Common usage examples:  mt -f [DEVICE] [OPERATION]   Execute the specified operation on a   tape drive            mksysb    Purpose: Create a backup image of an AIX system.    Usage syntax: mksysb [OPTIONS] [DEVICE FILE]    mksysb -i  dev rmt0               Creating information file   image.data  for rootvg.   Creating list of files to back up.

Creating a mksysb backup on AIX     The mksysb command creates a backup image of an AIX system. This image can  be used to restore the base operating system in the event of system failure.    In  the  above  example  a mksysb system  image  is  written  to  the  dev rmt0  tape device.     Note   mksysb is not a substitute for a traditional backup as is does not include  files outside of the base operating system. Databases, 3rd party software,  etc. are not backed up in a mksysb image. These files should be backed  up separately using another method  such as the tar command.        Common usage examples:  mksysb -i [DEVICE FILE]  Create a system image backup      Section 12:   Monitoring and Troubleshooting     Overview   This section covers commands used to monitor and troubleshoot Unix, Linux, and  BSD  systems.

The resulting output displays the size, used space, and available space for  each file system.     On  some  systems, df will  also  display  information  about  pseudo  file  systems.  These  file  systems  typically  do  not  contain  real  files  and  exist  only  in  memory  to  provide  access  to  kernel  facilities.  In  the  above  example,  the  first  two  lines  are  actual file systems and the remaining entries are pseudo file systems.     Tip   Some systems may support the use of the -h parameter as shown in the  above  example.  This  option  displays  "human  readable"  output  in  kilobytes,  megabytes,  and  gigabytes  as  opposed  to  the  default  unit  of  measure  which is usually 1k or 512k blocks . See man df to verify the  unit of measure used by default on your local system.       Common usage examples:  df   Display file system usage information   df -h  Display sizes in human readable format  i.e., megabytes and gigabytes          du    Purpose: Display disk usage.    Usage syntax: du [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY FILE]   $ du -hs  usr   523M     usr   Using the du command to display the size of a directory     The du command displays information about disk usage. It can display the size of  a  specific  directory  or  group  of  files.  The  above  example  demonstrates  using  the  du command  to  display  the  size  of  the   usr directory.  The  -hs option  instructs du to show summarized results in "human readable" form. Omitting the  -s  option  will  recursively  display  the  size  of  each  file  under   usr,  as  demonstrated below.     $ du -h  usr    4.0K     usr local etc   1.4M     usr local bin   4.0K     usr local games   4.0K     usr local src   4.0K     usr local sbin   224K     usr local share man man1   228K     usr local share man   Displaying the size of files using the du command     Some  systems  may  not  support  the  -h  parameter.  In  this  case,  the  du  command  will  display  file  sizes  in  blocks  rather  than  a  "human  readable"  unit  of  measure, as shown in the next example.     Output of the du command on older Unix systems   $ du -s  usr   534884   usr       Common usage examples:  du -hs   Display the size of the current directory   du -hs [DIRECTORY]  Display the size of the specified directory  du -h [DIRECTORY]   Display the size of each file in the specified directory       uname    Purpose: Display information about the operating system.    Usage syntax: uname [OPTIONS]    uname -a   Linux mylaptop 2.6.28-11-generic x86_64 GNU Linux   Output of the uname command on Linux systems     uname displays information and the hardware and software versions installed on  the system.  This includes information such as processor type, kernel version, and  hardware platform for the local system.    The above example displays uname output on a Linux system. The next example  displays the output on an HP-UX system.      uname -a   HP-UX server1 B.10.20 C 9000 861 32-user license   Output of the uname command on HP-UX systems   Version   mylaptop  server1     The output of the uname varies across platforms. The table below describes the  typical information displayed when executing uname -a.    Platform  Hostname  Linux  HP-UX      Common usage examples:  uname -a  Display all information  uname -r  Display the kernel version number     2.6.28-11-generic  B.10.20 C   Hardware  x86_64  9000 861   GNU Linux  32-user license   Other       uptime    Purpose: Display how long the system has been online.    Usage syntax: uptime   $ uptime   19:15:55 up 2 days 40 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.13, 1.15, 1.24   Output of the uptime command     The uptime command displays how long a system has been online since the last  shutdown or restart. It also displays the number of users currently logged into the  system and the CPU load average.     The load average information displays three numeric fields. These represent three  samples  of  system  load  taken  over  the  last  1,  5,  and  15  minutes.  The  lower  the  number, the lower the system load is.  For example, on a single CPU system, a .13  load average correlates to a 13% load. A 1.15 load average would be a 115% load  meaning that the system is 15% overloaded because processes have to wait 15% of  the time for system resources  such as CPU and disk I O .     Note   The  load  average  is  displayed  for  informational  purposes  only.  It  is  not  meant to be used as an accurate performance gauge, as it can be affected  by various factors.       Common usage examples:  uptime  Display system uptime and load average information    dmesg    Purpose: Display kernel log messages.    Usage syntax: dmesg [OPTIONS]    dmesg  less   [0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset   [0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpu   [0.000000] Linux version 2.6.24-27-server  buildd@palmer   gcc version   4.2.4  Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu3   1 SMP Fri Mar 12 01:45:06 UTC 2010    Ubuntu 2.6.24-27.68-server    [0.000000] BIOS-provided physical RAM map:   [0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009f800  usable    [0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 000000000009f800 - 00000000000a0000  reserved    [0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000000ca000 - 00000000000cc000  reserved    [0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000000dc000 - 0000000000100000  reserved    ...   Displaying kernel messages using dmesg     The dmesg command displays the kernel message log. This is the first place you  should  check  when  troubleshooting  a  problem.  Executing dmesg displays  all  messages in the kernel log buffer, as demonstrated in the above example.    dmesg output  can be very lengthy. Using grep with the demsg command is  helpful  to  search  for  a  specific  message.  The  next  example  demonstrates  filtering  dmesg using grep to search for the word fail.     $ demsg  grep fail   [39176.231722] usb-storage: probe of 2-2:1.0 failed with error -5   [41421.627352] PM: Device 2-2 failed to resume: error -19   [41429.152942] usb-storage: probe of 2-3:1.0 failed with error -5   [46938.994016] usb-storage: probe of 2-3:1.0 failed with error -5   [49869.891317] usb-storage: probe of 2-3:1.0 failed with error -5   [57103.036672] PM: Device 2-3 failed to resume: error -19   ...

Displaying kernel parameters     The sysctl command displays and edits tunable kernel parameters. This allows  you to fine tune various aspects of the operating system.      Warning   You  should  not  change  these  values  unless  you  fully  understand  the  impact of the parameter you are setting.     Kernel parameters are typically stored in the  etc sysctl.conf file. Settings  changed on the command line via sysctl will be lost at reboot unless they are  added to the sysctl.conf file.     Note   HP-UX and Solaris use the sysdef command in place of sysctl. AIX  systems use the tunchange command.       Common usage examples:  sysctl -a   Display all kernel parameters   sysctl -w [SETTING]=[VALUE]  Set the specified kernel parameter            Section 13:   Printing Commands     Overview   Commands in this section cover the basics of printer management on Unix, Linux,  and  BSD  systems.  The  Unix  printing  subsystem  is  known  as  LPD   Line  Printer  Daemon . Linux uses a newer printing system called CUPS  Common Unix Printing  System . Although these two printing services are very different at their core, they  share mostly interchangeable commands.    Commands covered in this section:     Command   lp   lpstat   lpq   cancel   enable   disable   lpadmin   Purpose   Print files.  Display printer and print job status information.  Display print queue status.  Cancel and delete queued print jobs.   Enable disable printers.   Administer printers.   Glossary of terms used in this section:    CUPS    Common  Unix  Printing  System   A  modern  printing  system  for  Unix,  Linux, and BSD systems.  A file that has been submitted for printing.   Line Printer Daemon  Printing system used primarily on Unix and BSD  systems.  A spooling system for print jobs waiting to be printed.   Print Job  LPD   Queue          lp    Purpose: Print files.    Usage syntax: lp [OPTIONS] [FILE]   $ lp -d HP-4350  etc hosts   request id is HP-4350-4  1 file s     Printing a file using the lp command     The  lp  command  submits  files  for  printing.  In  the  above  example,  the   etc hosts file is printed on the specified destination printer. The system will  display a job summary after executing the command. Included in the job summary  is the print job's ID number. On most systems, the ID number consists of the printer  name with the job ID for the specified printer appended to it  4 in this case .     Note   If  no  destination  is  specified,  the  file  will  print  on  the  default  system  printer.       Common usage examples:  lp [FILE]   lp –d [PRINTER] [FILE]   Print a file to the default printer  Print to the specified printer  lp -n [NUM] -d [PRINTER] [FILE]  Print the specified number of   copies       lpstat    Purpose: Display printer and print job status information.

It  is  similar  to  the  lpstat command  except  it  provides  more  user-friendly  output.  Unlike  the  lpstat command,  the lpq command  only  supports  a  limited  number  of  command line options.     In the above example, executing lpq -a displays all queued print jobs. The next  example  demonstrates  using  the -P option  to  display  the  status  of  a  specific  printer.     $ lpq -P HP-4350   HP-4350 is not ready   Rank    Owner   Job     File s                          Total Size   1st     nick    2       hosts                           1024 bytes   2nd     nick    3       hosts                           1024 bytes   3rd     nick    4       hosts                           1024 bytes   4th     nick    5       hosts                           1024 bytes   Displaying the status of a specific printer using the lpq command       Common usage examples:  lpq -a   Display the status of all queued print jobs  lpq -P [PRINTER]  Display the status of the specified printer      cancel    Purpose: Cancel and delete queued print jobs.

In  the  above  example,  cancel is  used  to  remove  an  individual  job  by  specifying  the  job's  ID  number.  The  next  example  demonstrates  using  the -a parameter  to  remove  all  queued  print jobs from the specified printer.     $ lpq -P HP-4350   HP-4350 is not ready   Rank    Owner   Job     File s                          Total Size   1st     nick    6       hosts                           1024 bytes   2nd     nick    7       hosts                           1024 bytes   3rd     nick    8       hosts                           1024 bytes   4th     nick    9       hosts                           1024 bytes    $ cancel -a HP-4350   $ lpq -P HP-4350   HP-4350 is not ready   no entries   Using the cancel command to cancel all queued print jobs on a printer   Note  Some UNIX systems may use the lprm command in place of cancel.       Common usage examples:  cancel [JOB]   cancel -a   cancel -a [PRINTER]  Cancel all jobs on the specified printer   Cancel the specified print job  Cancel all print jobs on all printers          enable   disable    Purpose: Enable disable printers.    Usage syntax: enable [OPTIONS] [PRINTER]    enable HP-4350    lpq   HP-4350 is ready   Enabling a printer using the enable command     The enable command enables printers which makes them available for printing.  In  the  above  example,  the  specified  printer  is  enabled  and  made  available  for  printing after executing the enable command.    The disable command  takes  printers  offline  and  disables  them  from  printing,  as demonstrated in the next example.    Usage syntax: disable [OPTIONS] [PRINTER]    disable HP-4350    lpq   HP-4350 is not ready   Disabling a printer using the disable command     Most systems will continue to accept print requests when a printer is disabled. The  jobs will remain in the queue until the printer is enabled.     Note   Systems  with  CUPS   Common  Unix  Printing  System   will  use  the  cupsenable and cupsdisable commands  in  place  of enable  and disable.       Common usage examples:  enable [PRINTER]   disable [PRINTER]   Enable the specified printer  Disable the specified printer   disable -c [PRINTER]  Disable a printer and cancel all queued jobs      lpadmin    Purpose: Administer printers.

Installing the nmap program using the rpm command     rpm is the traditional package manager for Red Hat Linux-based systems. It can be  found  on  Red  Hat  Enterprise  Linux  and  Fedora  as  well  as  a  host  of  other  Linux  distributions built on the Red Hat Fedora core.     Using rpm you  can  install  or  remove  programs  created  specifically  for  Red  Hat  and Fedora-based systems. These packages typically have a .rpm file extension.  The  above  example  demonstrates  using  the rpm command  to  install  an  RPM  package.     Note   Most  Red  Hat-based  systems  now  utilize  a  program  called yum to  perform  software  installation  tasks.  Directly  installing  packages  using  rpm is  rarely  done  given  that yum will  automatically  download  and  install the requested package s  and  all required dependencies. See page  236 for more information.       Common usage examples:  rpm -i [PACKAGE]  Install the specified package  rpm -U [PACKAGE]  Upgrade the specified package  rpm -e [PACKAGE]  Remove the specified package  rpm -qa   List all installed packages         yum    Purpose: Automated package manager for Red Hat Linux-based systems.

Installing the uptime utility on Gentoo Linux using the emerge program     emerge is  a  front-end  for  Gentoo's  Portage  software  manager.  It  provides  automatic software compilation, installation, and dependency fulfillment similar to  the previously discussed aptitude and yum commands.    Portage  is  a  unique  package  manager  in  the  fact  that  it  compiles  software  from  source  code.  This  is  different  than  most  other  Linux  systems  which  utilize  precompiled  binaries  when  installing  software.  Compiling  software  from  source  code  creates  a  platform-optimized  installation  that  has  been  shown  to  provide  better  performance  when  compared  to  precompiled  packages.  Portage's  disadvantage, however, is that it takes much longer to install software for source.     Tip   To  learn  more  about  the  Portage  software  manager,  see  the  official  Gentoo documentation online at www.gentoo.org doc .

Manually compiling software from source code using make     The make command  compiles  and  installs  programs  from  source  code.  Source  code compatible with the make command is distributed with what is known as a  Makefile. The Makefile is a script used to build and install the source code  using the make command.     In  the  above  example,  the  make  and  make  install  commands  are  combined to build the source code of a program and install it.     Note   Most  users will never have to compile  software from source since major  distributions  provide  prebuilt  packages  for  nearly  every  program  available.  Additionally,  Linux  tools  such  as yum, apt,  and emerge  greatly simplify software installation and dependency fulfillment.       Common usage examples:  make   Compile source code   make install  Install compiled source code           Section 15:  System Administration Utilities     Overview   This  section  coverers  two  very  helpful  system  administration  utilities  for  commercial Unix systems:           SMIT: System Management Interface Tool for AIX  SAM: System Administration Manager for HP-UX     SMIT and SAM are menu-driven applications that can be used to simplify complex  administration  tasks  such  as  managing  hardware,  software,  users groups,  etc.  While  every  task  that  can  be  performed  in  SMIT  or  SAM  can  be  executed  on  the  command line, running the same task within these utilities is generally much easier  and  faster.  They  also  provide  an  added  layer  of  protection  from  mistakes  by  ensuring that the requested task is executed with the correct parameters.
