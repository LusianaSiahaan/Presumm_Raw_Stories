About the Reviewer  David Bowles in his twenty-eight years has worked with computers since the  age of four and has been involved with computers in support, administration,  development, and gaming. Although he wasn't very fond of programming and  developing software early in his college career, the fact that he was programming  in BASIC on his VIC-20 at five along with some help from the BYTE magazine,  foreshadowed his life to come in software development. Although he grew up in the  small towns of Albany and Moultrie in southern Georgia, he was blessed to have  access to computers through his father's employers and was ultimately able to afford  them later in life.  David got involved with Dynamics AX during his employment with NAPA Rayloc,  shortly after coming on board. The executive suite decided to migrate from a legacy  COBOL-based accounting system to Dynamics AX. David was presented with a  Virtual PC image of the software and given a couple of weeks to get familiar with  it. After three months of working and developing the software on a trial basis, the  implementation process began. After a twelve month implementation period, during  which he was the only a full-time developer on the project, many long days and  nights of coding, a wedding, and a couple of 48-hour plus days, Rayloc was fully  implemented with AX. During the implementation and learning process, David  was awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional award in Dynamics AX.  The award was mainly based on his contributions to the user community in forums,  his blog, and feedback to Microsoft Support on his research on the newly added  Application Integration Framework in version 4.0. Prior to NAPA Rayloc, David was  employed in technical and programming positions with AOL, SurfSouth, CallTech  Communications, and Kodak.  Currently David is married to his quintessential bride, Courtney, and they reside in  western suburban Atlanta, Georgia. Besides his job, he attends the Mercer University  in Atlanta, to complete his bachelors' of science in Business Administration. When  he's not at work or school, he likes to spend his free time in a round of golf, tennis,  paintball, and occasionally an XBox game.   As with anything I do in life, I'm always supported to the utmost  degree by my family. Courtney and I were both elated to find out  that I was chosen to review this book and it has been my pleasure  to have done so. I thank Courtney for allowing me to spend some  of my home time on digging into the text. I thank my father, Rick  Bowles, for introducing me to computers because without that  exposure I wouldn't be where I am today. I thank my mother, Kathy  Levins, for instilling work ethics in me. Last, but not least, I thank  God for all which he has done in my life, in opening the doors that  he's allowed me to walk through.

This ERP system not only provides  additional flexibilities but also has some other unique features such as its layered  customization approach, separation of language elements from code, feature keys,  etc. All these features add great value allowing implementation of solutions in  a flexible, cost-effective, risk-free, and timely manner but these things may add  challenges in Quality Assurance of these solutions.  This book discusses the methodology to ensure quality standards in Dynamics AX  customization projects and IBI-compliant ISV application development. Dynamics  AX customization is not equivalent to fresh application developmentl; however,  Dynamics is so flexible in customization that it allows customization in almost all  areas, which poses greater challenges for correctness, accuracy, and trustworthiness  of customized Dynamics AX-based ERP solutions.  This book discusses the quality expectations from the Dynamics AX-based ERP  solutions, what best practices need to be followed to meet the quality expectations,  and what are the strategies to test a customized Dynamics AX ERP application.   What This Book Covers Chapter 1 discusses the challenges of businesses that are solved by ERP, key quality  expectations from an ERP, and what makes Dynamics AX an ideal ERP system. Chapter 2 is the foundation to understand IBI standards, as this chapter is all about  quality definition in the context of Dynamics AX's unique challenges. It also   explains why we should preserve and maintain the quality of Dynamics AX-based  ERP applications.   Preface  Chapter 3 explains the Dynamics Ax customization best practices from a technical  perspective. Adopting these best practices will enhance the quality of Dynamics   AX-based ERP solutions. Chapter 4 discusses the best practices for the Graphical User Interface to achieve  excellence and consistency in user experience. Chapter 5 discusses how to achieve trustworthiness by achieving security, privacy,  and reliability. This chapter discusses threat modeling and various other activities in  various stages of the security development life cycle. Chapter 6 discusses the testing strategy for the verification of the quality  characteristics achieved through best practices discussed in Chapter 3 to Chapter 5. Chapter 7 discusses the testing life cycle specially tuned for the Dynamics AX to  ensure effective and efficient testing with least efforts. Chapter 8 discusses the defect management system and key characteristics expected  in defect management tools used to manage Dynamics AX customization defect  records. It also discusses how to handle security-related issues or defects. Chapter 9 discusses various testing tool available in Dynamics AX and how we can  unleash maximum benefits from these tools.

[ 4 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX  Today's business environment is a very competitive, dynamic, and turbulent place  where the key for business survival is being closer to the customer and delivering  value-added products and services in the shortest possible time.   Therefore, the following things should be eliminated:                           Unknown or inaccurate job costs Inventories that do not meet or far exceed production requirements Duplication of effort to capture vital data that impacts employee efficiency Commonly setting inaccurate customer expectations Missing promised delivery dates regularly Operations performance not being achieved to an economical level Little or no ability to forecast and plan production requirements with any  degree of accuracy  This in turn demands:  Coherent working of various organs of a business  Enhanced operating efficiency by calculating and forecasting various  business parameters Efficient resource utilizations through better planning  Better customer relations, meeting deadlines, resolving issues promptly, and  meeting quality standards with reasonable cost  Information technology empowers businesses to meet the above challenges through  Enterprise Resource Planning  ERP  solutions.    Introduction to Dynamics AX  Dynamics AX is an ERP solution from Microsoft, which is becoming very popular  due to its characteristics. We will discuss the key characteristics of an ERP solution  and Dynamics AX. During customization all these characteristics should be retained,  hence we will also discuss how we can preserve these qualities during customization  by studying the various best practices related to Graphical User Interface, technical  design, trustworthy computing, and defect management. These also consist of most of  the IBI specifications related to quality control in Dynamics AX IBI-compliant projects.  We will also discuss verifying different kind of characteristics through various kinds  of testing. Lastly, we will discuss some Dynamic AX built-in tools that could be  useful for testing activities.  In this chapter we will discuss:            Key characteristics of an ERP solution Advantages and disadvantages of an ERP solution Dynamics AX as an ideal ERP system An overview of Dynamics AX customization, IDE, files system, and   layer system  Introduction to ERP An ERP system is a strategic tool, which can help businesses to achieve the  previously listed goals. It is a collection of various business processes in an  integrated fashion, which simulates the real-world business functions and provides  seamless integrated information at all the required places in an appropriate form.  It helps the enterprise link, utilize, and allocate its resources in the best possible  manner, and control them on a real-time basis. It enables the enterprise to achieve  world-class performance by streamlining its processes, optimizing the resources, and  taking quick, accurate, and consistent decisions.  Now it is obvious that an ERP solution should have one essential characteristic— ability to integrate various business functions. However, there are greater  expectations from a usable ERP system. The following list summarizes the business  needs and expected characteristics of an ERP solution.     Total Cost of Ownership  TCO : An ERP solution is not just a tool; it is an  organization-wide synchronization of business processes and hence is a very  large size software application, which could take several years to implement.  The TCO does not only consist of ERP product cost and customization cost,  it also includes the cost to bring about cultural changes in the organization   training, etc. . In such a large size project, TCO is one of the critical   decision criteria.  [ 6 ]   Chapter 1                    Flexibility: An ERP solution may have to be modified  both in configuration  and coding  as per the needs of the business organization, which may change  with time due to changes in business size, strategy, or legal system. It should  be able to run on different hardware and databases to use the company's  heterogeneous collection of systems. The ERP should be customizable so that  ERP business processes can be modified as per the unique business processes  of the organization. Usability: The solution must be useful to the end user to fulfill his or her  mission, and enable "Joy of Work" at the same time. This can be turned into  reality by adopting known standards, consistency, and intuitive UI design. Coherence of business processes: The advantages of an ERP solution  can be unleashed only when it offers coherence of business processes, i.e.  information is available at all required places, it is not necessary to enter the  same data twice, and the existing information is reused wherever relevant   and possible. Modular: An ERP system should have open system architecture. This means  that any module should have the capability to be interfaced or detached  whenever required without affecting the other modules. Integration: Enterprises may already be using some IT infrastructure and  might not want the complete infrastructure to change for some reason  such  as cost, strategic reasons, etc. . It should be easy to integrate new modules or  external applications to the existing solutions.  Trustworthiness: An ERP system should be trustworthy i.e. it should have  the following attributes:           Security: To ensure that information and data are safe and  confidential. Privacy: Information security is essential else competitors  could reap the benefits of business-critical data as well as the  methodology for various business processes. Hence privacy is  a critical element. Reliability: In today's extremely complex IT applications such  as ERP solutions, end-to-end reliability is a key challenge  for meeting customers' expectations and making an ERP  application trustworthy.     Responsiveness: An ERP system should not only handle normal load  conditions but also abnormal conditions, such as heavy workloads at the end  of financial year due to closing reports and projection reports.  [ 7 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX              Internationalization: If an ERP system is being implemented or used  in multiple geographic locations, the ERP solution must be properly  internationalized with:        Different languages and character sets. Ability to present data in a format used in each locale.  Localization: Whenever an ERP system is implemented, the major cost of  customization occurs for two things, localization as per local needs and  adaptation as per industry or sector-specific needs. The following need to be  considered to localize an ERP system:                   Governmental, legal, and market requirements: e.g. social  medical benefits in payroll, weekdays for a business  as they  are different in different parts of the world . Cultures: e.g. in some places the name of a person may  consists of two parts—the first and last—while in other parts  of the world, it may be composed of five parts. Standards: e.g. financial reporting standards. Formats: e.g. date, time. Currencies. Time zones. Users.  Scalability: Business sizes change with time and hence a small ERP  solution—few modules, few features enabled, few users, and only a few  transactions—should be able  and is expected!  to grow. Code documentation: Once an ERP system is implemented, it may be used  for several years and hence may be maintained by several developers or  companies. During its life span it may require modification due to changes in  the business needs and hence it is necessary to understand the code written  by various developers in order to modify it. Hence code documentation is  needed. Code should be well documented from different perspectives such  as code changes, features related to code changes, etc.  Advantages of an ERP System The benefits of ERP systems can be categorized into the following categories:         Operational control Management control Strategic planning  [ 8 ]   Now we will discuss all the benefits of these categories.  Operational Control The critical advantage of an ERP system is improved operational control and hence  the following benefits are offered:  Chapter 1  Reduced operating costs by better planning  and hence improved   resource utilization   Lower inventory control cost due to better visibility and efficiency  Cost savings due to reduction in duplicated efforts Reduction in non-value added activities  lean processing  Improved capacity utilization due to efficient operations Lower CRM cost due to better customer expectation management i.e.  meeting timeline and cost savings due to improved operational control Adherence to defined process  Management Control Another critical advantage of an ERP system is improved management control.   ERP systems offer better accessibility to data so that management can have   up-to-the-minute access to information for decision making and managerial   control. An ERP system helps track actual costs of activities and performs   activity-based costing.  A few benefits in this category are as follows:  Improvement in decision making through more accurate and real-time data  as well as historic data Availability of instant information to all concerned organs of the business Data standardization and accuracy across the enterprise as it allows Single  Point of Entry  i.e. at the source of that data , and hence single source   of truth  Reduced Lead and Cycle Times and hence ease in meeting customer  expectations regarding timelines                              [ 9 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX Strategic Planning An ERP system enables top management for strategic planning i.e. planning future  goals and objectives and formulating strategies to achieve those goals and objectives  keeping historical data in consideration.  Improved planning and forecasting due to availability of historical data and  analysis data Better financial control through extended capabilities for financial  estimations, analysis of cash flow, and monitoring of various transactions  Disadvantages of an ERP System Though we have discussed a lot about the benefits of ERP, there are two sides to  every coin and an ERP system is not an exception. Here are a few disadvantages of  ERP systems:  Customization is limited in many situations: Many of the ERP solutions  don't allow customization in other than reporting i.e. the information  contained in a report and presentation of information. It poses serious  limitations on the advantages of an ERP system, since businesses differ from  one another for sure. No two businesses are exactly the same. So a true well  designed global ERP system should readily allow partners and customers to  customize and get the most out of the system to realize their full potential.  Unfortunately, except Dynamics AX, almost all other ERP solutions have too  many limitations on customization. The need to reengineer business processes: As mentioned earlier almost  all ERP solutions don't allow much customization, and hence businesses are  compelled to adopt the business processes suggested by that ERP system,  which may involve risk. Businesses may not be willing to reengineer their  business processes as they are using time-proven processes suitable for their  custom needs and conditions. Since Dynamics AX allows customization in  almost all areas, this risk is not involved as there is minimal need for business  process reengineering. Rigidity: ERP solutions may be too rigid for specific organizations that are  either new or want to move in a new direction in the near future.                  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  Introduction to Dynamics AX Microsoft Dynamics AX is an integrated, adaptable business management solution  that offers great flexibility and easily adapts itself to ever-changing business needs.  In other words it offers competitive advantage by delivering a complete easy-to-use,  scalable enterprise resource planning  ERP  package to automate and streamline  processes across your financials, customer relationships, business services, human  resources, and supply chain.  Traditional ERP vendors appealed customers not to customize the software for  ease of upgrade, etc. As we discussed earlier, every business has some uniqueness,  which gives that business organization a leading edge. Such unique features  can only be implemented in an ERP system by customizing it. If an ERP system  prevents businesses from following unique business processes that provide them a  competitive advantage, nobody will be interested in deploying such a system. Hence  an ERP system should be easily customizable. It will definitely enable businesses to  get most out of the system to realize their full potential.  Microsoft Dynamics AX is an adaptable business management solution useful  especially if you're in the manufacturing distribution, e-business, wholesale, or  service industry. It offers manufacturers a broad functionality that supports build- to-order, engineer-to-order, and build-to-forecast supply chain models across both  discrete and batch-process manufacturing modes.   Dynamics AX also delivers a range of financial capabilities including the ability to  consolidate accounts with subsidiaries or distribution centers and give employees  access to accounting, reporting, and extensive analysis tools at levels appropriate to  their positions. Dynamics AX gives you everything you need for fast and reliable  data intake and processing, and enables you to make informed decisions and achieve  business goals.  Microsoft Dynamics AX will allow us to efficiently and effectively manage our  business going forward. It allows us to continue to develop an environment  that is cost effective without the functional limitations we had to contend with  previously.—Pascal Kouknas, IT Director Dynamics AX and Asia Pacific,  Esselte  http:  www.esselte.com   Source: http:  www.microsoft.com  casestudies casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=1000003878 .  Dynamics AX as an Ideal ERP System We have discussed the qualities of an ideal ERP system, now we will discuss the  qualities that Dynamics AX possesses.   [ 11 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX  Total Cost of Ownership  TCO  In any business organization, cost is the primary concern for any new initiative;  an ERP system is no exception to that. Dynamics AX offers cost advantages due to  following unique features:  Dynamics AX provides the same version of code for Web and Microsoft  Windows clients, which leads to simpler, less expensive development and  IT costs, and provides a great degree of ease for businesses that are either  distributed or have a mobile workforce. Separate layers for industry-specific verticals and country-specific  localization not only offer cost savings but also reduce efforts required to  implement the Dynamics AX. Due to the layered technology of Microsoft Dynamics AX, customizations  can be easier to build and maintain. You can customize one layer without  affecting the functionality of the other layers. This means that you can adapt  and upgrade your solution over time with less disruption to business, risk,  and expense. Because of feature keys, any functionality can be enabled or disabled for an  individual user or user group. This not only gives flexibility but also reduces  the total cost of ownership.  Since Dynamics AX is an ERP application based on common Microsoft  standards, which end users are generally aware of, less effort are required to  train the end user.   Flexibility  Flexibility is another important aspect in an ERP solution, but unfortunately most  of the current ERP solutions lack it. For example, with an ERP package like SAP,  you have to adhere to SAP's ideas about your business, what they think about  uniqueness of your business and strategy. Dynamics AX has an edge due to the  following features:  Customization flexibility: Dynamics AX allows changing anything you  need. Businesses see this as a wonderful feature. This is the key for the ERP  you implement, to grow as your business grows. Going with an ERP package  like SAP, you have to adhere to SAP's thoughts about your business, how  they think it is best for your business run. With Dynamics AX, you are in  control, and, granted best business practices should be sought after, those  best practices can be applied to your custom needs. This helps businesses to  reduce the total cost of ownership.                    [ 12 ]               Chapter 1  Layered programming: Microsoft Dynamics AX offers a layered technology  of customizations to facilitate building and maintenance. You can customize  one layer without affecting the functionality of other layers. This means that  you can adapt and upgrade your solution over time with less disruption to  business, risk, and expense. Feature key: Feature key code is a wonderful system. Using feature keys,  features can be disabled or enabled for an individual or a user group.  Microsoft Dynamics AX combines rich out-of-the-box functionality with added  flexibility, giving The Systems Depot the ability to adjust capabilities to meet its  exact business needs.—Jan Sorensen, Senior Managing Consultant, BKD  Technologies  http:  www.sdepot.com .  Source: http:  www.microsoft. com casestudies casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=1000003831.   Usability Any software or ERP package can be considered successful only if the end user can  use it productively. Dynamics AX is considered to be a highly usable ERP package  for the following reasons:  Microsoft Product: Dynamics AX is owned and developed by Microsoft.  Currently Dynamics AX 4.0 is highly integrated with the different product  lines of Microsoft, and with the release of Vista, DotNet 3.0, Commerce  Server 2007, SharePoint Server 2007, Exchange 2007, and Office 2007, all these  product lines will become even more tightly integrated into the Dynamics  AX product. This means that you will be able to work from SharePoint Excel  Services, and create a Spreadsheet that could work directly with Dynamics  AX ERP data; and it could all be centrally managed in a decentralized  controlled fashion by an information worker. Besides this Microsoft has a  long-term vision for integrating various Microsoft products, for example,  Microsoft is planning to support full integration of Microsoft Office  PerformancePoint server and Dynamics CRM will support full integration  with Dynamics AX 5.0. Familiarity with Microsoft: The best way to make a company productive is  to make the people in it more productive. To accomplish this goal, people  need business software tools like Microsoft Dynamics that enable them to  work the way they like. When you implement Microsoft Dynamics, you  support and enhance the work your people do, and the way they do it.  Microsoft Dynamics AX works like familiar Microsoft software such as  Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft SharePoint products and technologies, and  Microsoft Office products, which means a reduced learning curve for your  employees, so that they can focus on their jobs.  [ 13 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX  We also wanted the system to provide our business users with the information they  needed, in an intuitive, easy-to-use environment. That's what Microsoft Dynamics  AX has given us.—Tomasz Gesiarz, Director of Finance and IT, Lantmännen  Unibake Poland.  http:  www.lantmannen.com   Source: http:  www. microsoft.com casestudies casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=1000003869               Performance Dynamics AX 4.0 has some advanced concepts to optimize its performance. A few  are listed below:  Data Compression: This ensures minimum time for data traveling through  the network and hence performance is improved and added security is   a bonus. Axapta Object Server  AOS  Thread Pooling: This allows AOS to have a  lower number of threads  less than the number of logged in users  and hence  performance is improved.  Coherence of Business Processes Software applications like Payroll, Accounting, Purchase management, etc. have  been available for a long time, but these individual applications could not be  integrated with each other and hence communication between various business  processes departments was manual, which put serious limitations on the benefits of  information technology. An ERP system offers coherent working of various business  processes and hence is the solution to this integration problem.   Dynamics AX 4.0 also includes roles-based features so that users can   gain easy access to the business data relevant to their position within   an organization.  With comprehensive features that help to automate and streamline financials,  customer relationships, business services, human resource management, and  supply chain processes, Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0 brings together people,  processes, and technologies located worldwide. In this way, Microsoft  Dynamics AX 4.0 helps to increase the productivity and effectiveness of   your business.   Through sales and purchase procedures we have minimized multiple data input and  optimized workflow between the offices. Now, fewer people need to be involved in  these processes.—Alexander Sharafutdinov, Chief Information Officer, UCC  Shchekinoazot  http:  www.n-azot.ru   Source: http:  www.microsoft. com casestudies casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=200916.   [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  Easy to Integrate In an organization there may be a need to preserve old investment in different  software application or some specialized software needs to work with an ERP  system. In such cases it is necessary that an ERP system offers various   industry-standard methods of integration. Microsoft has a long-term strategy to  integrate various applications such as MS Office, Microsoft Office PerformancePoint  server, etc. Dynamics AX can be integrated using the following technologies:                     Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0 includes the Application Integration Framework   AIF , which lets organizations extend the solution by easily inserting  business logic from other vendors' applications with no dependencies created  within the core solution. In addition, AIF acts as a web services toolbox by  exposing all the application components and gives developers a head start by  publishing an extensive set of web services for core business processes such  as receiving and fulfilling orders. Biztalk is a compatible integration adapter for Dynamics AX, which  offers many advantages such as real-time visibility across the extended  organization, flexibility, ease of deployment, and improved ROI.  Dynamics AX can be connected with external data sources using web  services as well as industry-standard technologies such as Microsoft BizTalk  Server, Component Object Model  COM  integration, Microsoft Message  Queuing  MSMQ , Simple Object Access Protocol  SOAP , Microsoft .NET  Framework, XBRL, and XML.  Microsoft Dynamics AX is designed with common standards shared with  other Microsoft applications; it enables tighter integration and more seamless  connectivity with products such as Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office  programs, and Microsoft SQL Server 2005. Dynamics AX supports different Microsoft-developed document formats  used by Microsoft Office Outlook messaging and collaboration client,  Microsoft Office Word, and Microsoft Office Excel spreadsheet software and  interoperability can be assured. Unlike some business management systems that force you to use specialized  tool sets, Microsoft Dynamics AX uses standard adapters based on  SQL Server Reporting Services and the Microsoft Visual Studio. NET  development system. This instantly enables you to access a wide variety of  industry-standard integration protocols and trained integration partners  that you can use to connect to the business management solutions of your  business partners.  [ 15 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX  We chose Microsoft Business Solutions Dynamics AX because of the possibility of  integrating it with office software suites, flexible reporting, the ability to display  information in two currencies, the multilingual user interface and the functionality  of the Project Module, all giving us an advanced project management system.— Agnieszka Burak, Chief Accountant ZWIK.  http:  www.zwik.lodz.pl     Source: http:  www.microsoft.com casestudies casestudy.aspx?ca sestudyid=200554.                  Internationalization  Internationalization is very much necessary when the scope of business is more   than one country. The following features make Dynamics AX a true internationalized  ERP solution:  Dynamic AX is Unicode compliant. Today Unicode is the largest industry  standard character set; compliance to Unicode means that you can access  new regions and transport data through many different systems with least  risk of data corruption. Unicode compliance enables you to integrate with  subsidiaries where the language might use a multi-bit character set such as  China, Japan, and other East Asian countries.  Dynamics AX supports the linkage of date currency format with locales,  which enables Dynamics AX to automatically change the date format as per  the standards of the locale. Dynamics AX supports multiple languages and  multiple currencies  more than 36 languages and 40 currencies .  Localization The business processes cannot be identical in different countries as there may be  differences in the regulatory system, tax structure, language, currency, and locale.  IntelliMorph is a feature that provides the capability to Dynamics AX to realign its  Graphical User Interface according to difference in business processes. Besides that,  the following features are very helpful to localize the Dynamics AX ERP package.  Microsoft Dynamics AX is featured to support built-in multi-site, multi- language, and multi-currency capabilities in 36 countries and 40 languages. One can get local tax, regulatory, and market requirements from the  localization layer of Dynamics AX. The label file system is a powerful feature in Dynamics AX, which enables  Dynamics AX to automatically change labels as per the locale settings.  Because of the multi-language tool in Microsoft Dynamics AX, our employees  can work more productively in their local language.—Patrik Dannehall, IT  Director, Haldex Europe.  http:  www.haldex.com   Source: http:  www. microsoft.com casestudies casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=200926.   [ 16 ]   Scalable Businesses grow with time; a small business may turn to a multimillion dollar  business tomorrow. In such cases it is necessary that an ERP solution is highly  scalable, i.e. it should be able to change according to the growing business needs. The  following features make Dynamics AX a highly scalable solution:   Chapter 1              Dynamics AX is truly modular in structure and various modules can be  added or removed easily if the core of Dynamics AX is not touched. You can  use the functions you need now and unlock additional capabilities as needs  arise. Dynamics AX is modular up to the second degree i.e. it is not only  modular up to department level but it goes further; e.g. HR has HR 1,   HR 2, HR 3. With the MorphX development environment, developers can design, edit,  compile, and view the changes within minutes using a single screen. Microsoft Dynamics AX can easily adapt to market changes, which helps  your people and business follow the market and work more effectively.  Furthermore, you can extend the already powerful core solution by adding  industry-specific solutions provided by a wide variety of partners and  independent software vendors. Dynamics AX supports the three-tier, object-oriented architecture of  Microsoft. Dynamics AX integrates with other Microsoft technologies such as  Microsoft SQL Server, offering you high-speed server-side performance and  the capability to scale your IT infrastructure easily, so the solution can grow  with the company.  Microsoft Dynamics AX is a scalable, flexible solution that is capable of supporting  our technology requirements, both now and in the future.—Sébastien Batt,  Manager of Microsoft Dynamics AX E-Commerce and Back-Office Systems,  Stock Fenêtre.  http:  www.stock-fenetre.com   Source: http:  www. microsoft.com casestudies casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=  1000003854.   Code Documentation During the life span of an ERP system, other developers might need to   understand the code written by the developer, and hence it is necessary that any  modification made to the standard Dynamics AX is documented. Dynamics AX  facilitates documenting why and what customizations were made by various  developers, which would help a new developer to understand and customize   new functionalities.  [ 17 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX  Comprehensive Functionality Last but not least, an ERP system should be functionally rich to accommodate  business processes with minimal changes in the standard ERP package. This not only  enables rapid implementation, but also reduces the total cost of ownership.            Dynamics AX offers a wide range of industry-specific verticals developed  in compliance with Microsoft Industry Builder Initiative  IBI  specifications.  Compliance with IBI specifications not only ensures the quality in these  verticals, but also goes beyond that  such as prompt support services, etc. .  The high adaptability of Dynamics AX ensures that it can be implemented  as a feature-rich ERP where all business processes are customized as per the  custom need. Microsoft Dynamics AX is designed to provide your customers vendors  security-enhanced access to the business information they want over the  Internet. Secured Internet access helps your customers vendors enter sales  orders and find shipment status, account balances, inventory stock levels,  and purchase order status—24 hours a day, 7 days a week—from anywhere  in the world. Built-in business models are the true power of Dynamics AX. It supports a  wide types of functionality, e.g. it not only supports the various supply chain  models such as build-to-order, engineer-to-order, and build-to-forecast, but  also works well in mixed-mode environments.  It is now possible for us to get the data we need to react to changes and effectively  manage the business in a timely fashion. The system allows us to track an  individual item by group or by its specific part number. This gives us the visibility  we need over the global operations,—Joe Horvath, Vice President of the Apollo  Program Office, Esselte.  http:  www.esselte.com   Source: http:  www. microsoft.com casestudies casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=  1000003878.   Customization of Dynamics AX Virtually all business owners strive to do something to stand out from their  competitors; the same cannot always be said for their choice of off-the-shelf software.  As a result, the unique aspects of a business are often lost in a "plain vanilla"  integrated enterprise application. However, the Dynamics AX solution allows  businesses to integrate their unique terminology, formulas, processes, and   business strategy totally and seamlessly into the software. Now we will briefly  discuss some of the useful features in Dynamics AX, which are very useful for  Dynamics AX customization.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 1  MorphX Microsoft Dynamics AX provides an integrated development environment called  MorphX. It is very intuitive and enables developers to graphically design, develop,  and report for both types of interfaces, i.e. Windows client and web browser  interfaces. The MorphX development tools are available at the Tools  Development  tools menu. This tool helps developers extensively by offering designing, editing,  and compiling through a single screen. Once the changes are compiled, all changes  will be reflected by the application.   The MorphX development suite is a collection of a wide range of features. which  enables fast pace customization, with affordable cost, without affecting the  reliability, integrity, and security of the original solution, i.e. with minimal risk  involved. Another useful tool, which provides the wonderful capability to align the  GUI as per the context of location, language, currency, regulatory requirements, etc.  is IntelliMorph. We will discuss it in the following section.  IntelliMorph  Usually the major concern for the solution designers or developers is that a GUI  entity  form, report, etc.  works well in all the languages supported. It is easy to  translate different labels by using label file systems. However, the length may vary  greatly, which could spoil the entire GUI design and the usability of such systems  would be compromised.  In different countries, functionality may be used in a different way or some of   the fields may be hidden or extra ones required. This may also be the case with   different companies.   Consider a scenario where some business processes may not be implemented, and  hence all connections from other business processes to this business process have to  be removed. Therefore, some fields may need to be added and some removed from  all the relevant business processes. Due to such addition or deletion of fields the GUI  may change, which will be highly inconvenient for the user.   MorphX has a solution for the above mentioned scenarios, i.e. IntelliMorph  technology. The IntelliMorph technology allows forms and reports to automatically  resize the display widths to accommodate the word length, and hence the GUI  remains in a presentable or useable shape.   [ 19 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX Feature Keys In any ERP solution we can classify three kinds of features:          Standard features that fit the need of the customer Standard extra features that are not to be used in an implementation Customization to fit the ERP to a business scenario  Isolation of unwanted features, i.e. making a subset of standard functionality by  disabling a few features, can be easily done by enabling or disabling feature key  codes. Using feature keys, one can create a subset of the standard functionality for an  installation. The feature key system can work for a single user or a user group. This  feature is another tool that makes Dynamics AX a highly adaptable ERP.  Feature keys not only work on tables, forms, reports, queries, and menus, but also  beyond that, i.e. on individual classes or methods. X++ Programming Language The language that is used for development and writing classes and methods in  Microsoft Dynamics AX's integrated development environment is an Object-Oriented  language similar to Sun Microsystems JAVA and C++. It is based on JAVA with  SQL embedded into the code. The language has extensive checking system for object  references both at the time of compiling and also at run time. If any object in the  system is found without reference then its storage is reclaimed.  The X++ language follows OOPS concepts and the concept of inheritance is valid  as in any other Object-Oriented language. It offers a great advantage as the changes  made in the properties at one place in Microsoft Dynamics AX should be reflected  inherited at all the places where that object is being used within Microsoft Dynamics  AX. If, for example, the display property of a database field is changed from a length  of 10 to a length 15 characters then it gets changed in all the forms where this field is  shown or used.  A statement written in any language may be syntactically correct but it is not  an assurance that it is as per the recommended best practices of programming.  Dynamics AX has a built-in tool known as Dynamics AX Best Practice Check Tool.  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1  Dynamics AX Best Practice Check Tool Reviewing code is very time consuming as it requires reviewing each statement  against a large number of checkpoints. Manual reviewing of code against such  a large number of quality checkpoints is almost impossible due to cost reasons.  Dynamics AX has an inbuilt tool for code scanning. It is named Dynamics AX Best  Practices Check tool or ABC tool. It validates the code against over 200 checkpoints.  Application Component Management All the objects in Microsoft Dynamics IDE can be effectively managed by  automatically attaching identification of the developer who modifies any object with  a date and time stamp.  The components are locked and checked out of the system when they are being  worked upon. After the developer has finished working, the components are  unlocked and checked into the system.  Dynamics AX Layer System Dynamics AX offers complete flexibility to customize every aspect of it  functionality  and Graphical User Interface, etc.  and elegantly preserve the various changes made  by different parties in its own containers i.e. layers.   The Dynamics AX application layers are a hierarchy of levels in the Dynamics AX  application source code, which ensures that you can make modifications and additions  without interfering with the application objects on the level below your own.   Microsoft Dynamics AX customizations are easier to build and maintain due to  the layered technology, which facilitates customizations by different partners in  different layers. You can customize the features coded in one without affecting the  features coded in other layers. This means that you can adapt and upgrade your  solution over time with less disruption to business, risk, and expense  i.e. less risk,  high adaptability, and lower TCO . For example you could choose to add a field to a  standard form. The addition would be saved in your current level; the revised form  would replace the standard form, but you would always be able to go back to the  original one on the level below your own by simply removing the new form, and  hence you can work with minimal risk of business disruption as you can always  work with already working functionality.  [ 21 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX  The Dynamics AX application layer hierarchy consists of sixteen layers, which  are divided into groups with two layers in each group, i.e. eight different layer  categories. Each of them has a patch layer also, which is for handling patches, minor  updates, service packs, hot fixes, and additional functionality. This layer design is  a clear indication that Dynamics AX is built to accommodate changes by multiple  parties elegantly and encourages customization. The Dynamics AX layers are  designed for different Dynamics AX groups as well as for use in different types of  customization, as described in following table. Layers are mentioned in the order  from bottom to top:  Layer SYS   System   User Groups Microsoft  Characteristics                         The inner-most layer. The layer used to implement  standard Dynamics AX  applications. The application objects in this  layer can never be deleted. The solutions have been created  with the same development  standards as the standard  application, and qualified   as such. The solutions implemented  in this layer are delivered as a  standard part of the Dynamics  AX product. These are not industry-specific  verticals, rather these are core  dynamics such as the Human  Resource module. DIS layer to include   country-specific functionality.  Localized Application  developed by IBI solution  provider will remain in the   DIS layer.  GLS   Global  Solutions   MBS Certified third parties  DIS   Distributor         Local Microsoft  Business Solutions  offices IBI-compliant solution  provider who offers  country specific  solutions too  [ 22 ]   Chapter 1                             Solutions in the LOS layer are  protected by the license code  framework that the standard  application utilizes. If local MBS offices want to  certify and distribute a strategic  local solution that has not  been developed in-house  e.g.  Payroll , the solution must be  implemented in the LOS layer.  Business partners develop  and distribute vertical and  horizontal solutions to other  partners and customers using  the BUS layer. Reserved for Add-on Vertical  solution. A business partner can  implement any solution in  this layer only after written  agreement from MBS. Business partners can use   this layer without any   business-related restrictions.  Corporate enterprises, as well  as business partners can modify  this layer.  The Customer and User layers  are included in order to support  enterprizes and individual  companies in their need for in- house development, without  jeopardizing the modifications  made by the business partner. Individual companies or  companies within an enterprize  can utilize this layer to make  customizations that are unique  to the customer's installation.  Layer LOS   Local  Solution   User Groups Local MBS offices  Characteristics  Business Partners  BUS   Business  Solution   Business Partners  VAR   Value  Added  Reseller  CUS   Customer      Corporate enterprizes     Business partners  USR   User   End users  [ 23 ]   Introduction to Dynamics AX  Besides these main application layers, there are patch layers, which can be  distinguished from the other application layers by the use of the letter P in the end of  the layer name. The layers are: SYP, GLP, DIP, LIP, BUP, VAP, CUP, and USP. The  utilization of the patch layers is not subject to any predefined MBS rules, and hence  they can be used to support the customers business partners in any way suitable.  This procedure provides the option of sending out corrections without interfering  with the existing layers.  All application layers are able to utilize all the tools available in the Dynamics  AX MorphX Development Suite as well as all object types, tables, classes, macros,  extended data types, forms, reports, and so forth. The online help is also included in  the Layers technology, as well as the utilization of the label system.  Having all the object types available in every application layer makes the application  layer technology very flexible and dynamic  Dynamics AX Customization Files Each layer is technically saved in a separate file called Ax .aod, for example  Axsys.aod for the SYS layer, Axdis.aod for the DIS layer, and so on. The .aod  extension is an acronym for Application Object Data file. The files are stored in the  Dynamics AX Standard folder under Appl.  Besides Ax .aod there are a few other files that hold different kinds of data  for a layer as described in the following table.   Sr. no. Naming Convention 1  Axapd.aoi  Description                        aoi stands for "application   object index". It tells Dynamics AX where to find each  individual object.

To address these challenges the following key qualities are required in an  ERP package:   Chapter 1                   Competitive and affordable cost of ownership  Flexibility in adaptability to business processes  Scalability Usability Coherence of  business processes  Ease of integration  Internationalization  Localization  We also discussed the features that make Dynamics AX an ideal ERP system   and the built-in tools that are helpful in preserving the qualities of Dynamics   during customization.  [ 25 ]    Quality in Dynamics AX-Based  ERP Solutions  In the last chapter we discussed the key characteristics that make an ERP system  ideal from a business or user perspective. We also learned why Dynamics AX can  be considered as an ideal ERP solution. In this chapter we will discuss various key  characteristics from a technical perspective and also learn to preserve them. The  following topics will be clear after studying this chapter:         What is quality? Why it is necessary to focus on quality? How we can achieve this quality?  Quality Definition for Dynamics AX Few specifications need to be considered to preserve the key characteristics of  Dynamics AX. These specifications were originally issued by Microsoft as 'Industry  Builder Initiatives'. Though they are discussed in detail, there may be some  variations as I have incorporated my experience for improving quality at   an economical price.   Coding  The code written for customization should conform to the prescribed coding  standards. The coding standards are devised on the following factors:         Ease in further customization Integration Performance                                     Quality in Dynamics AX-Based ERP Solutions  Internationalization localization Scalability Understandability  including code layout and commenting  Usability The Dynamics AX way Trustworthiness  These coding standards are categorized into the following two types:  Syntax-level best practices  static code analysis  Design-pattern level best practices  A large number of checks for syntax-level best practices can be exercised by  Dynamics AX's built-in tool, the Dynamics AX best-practice check tool. This tool can  be used:  At the time of compilation  At the time of check-in Anytime by right-clicking the object in AOT and checking best practices  Best practices can be checked for one or more node in the Application Object Tree   AOT , at any point in time, by right-clicking the node and selecting Add-Ins  Best  Practices  Check Best Practices. To configure the best-practice check at the time of compilation, a user needs to  perform the following:  1.  Select Tools  Options. 2.  Click the Compiler button. 3.  Select the Diagnostics level as level 4.  The best-practice check tool shows three types of best-practice deviations, i.e. Error,  Warning, and Information. We can select the level of severity of deviations to be  displayed. Following are the different warning levels we can select:  Errors only: If dynamics AX is supposed to show only the deviations that  have a severity level of Error. Errors and Warnings: If Dynamics AX is supposed to show deviations  that have severity levels of Error and Warning. The system will not show  deviations of severity 'Information'. All: When all deviations from best practices are to be shown to user.  Settings related to warning level will only hide the unrelated errors, but it will not  stop checking the deviations from best practices. The warning level can be set at  Tools  Options  Best Practices by selecting the appropriate warning level from the  warning level list.  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  Three different severity levels are defined as follows:   Information: Things that might be nice to know  shown in blue color in   best-practice tool output .   Warnings: Things that you should strongly consider fixing  shown in   yellow color in best-practice tool output . It is recommended to remove at  least 95% of deviations in this category and a due justification needs to be  documented about whatever could not be fixed.    Errors: Things that should definitely be fixed  shown in red color in    best-practice tool output .  If a deviation message is double-clicked, it opens the code editor with focus on that  deviation message.   Testing and Quality Assurance Standards It is imperative that the qualities of core Dynamics AX are preserved by utilizing  the same quality standards in Dynamics AX customizations as are being used in the  development of Dynamics AX, i.e. Microsoft standards. Defects must be classified  and managed appropriately. It should be emphasized that the:   The basis of defining severity and priority for defects must be identical to  Microsoft standards. The defect management system should have the characteristics defined by  Microsoft including, but not restricted to following:                             Every bug should have a unique number  ID  associated   with it.  It should allow classifying a bug on the basis of severity   and priority. It should allow insertion of comments or at least   closing comments. It should allow supplying additional information  which is  mandatory for security bugs  for security related bugs.     All known issues must be documented to describe the possible impact  failure and possible workaround to minimize the impact of known issues.  We will discuss these standards in Chapter 8, Defect Management System.  [ 29 ]   Quality in Dynamics AX-Based ERP Solutions  User Friendliness It is the de facto industry standard that help should be commonly accessed  irrespective of the user's current screen, i.e. the help system should not be different  in the HR module and CRM module. This will ensure a user gets help without  investing much effort to locate the help itself. In order to maintain consistency   with Microsoft Dynamics AX user assistance guidelines, we need to comply with   the following:                 Help documents should be in .chm file format. Help must be accessible by pressing the F1 function key. Help must describe 'how' and not just 'what' or 'why'. Help style should comply with Microsoft Dynamics AX Help   style standards. User interface should comply with Microsoft Dynamics AX user interface  guidelines and Microsoft Windows user interface guidelines. High level of consistency such as:        Same entity should not be labeled with different labels, such  as Bill of material and BOM or Inquiry and enquiry. The buttons should appear in a definite order.  Dynamics AX user interface guidelines will be discussed in details in Chapter 4,   Best Practices—GUI.  Report Standards It is desirable that common standards followed in Dynamics AX are also used during  customization. The standard reports should be developed using the report wizards  provided in Dynamics AX.  If a new type of standard report needs to be created the built-in common templates  should be used in all such reports to maintain consistency. The use of standard  templates will also improve the maintainability.  The SQL reporting should be used as described in implementation guidelines for  SQL reporting in Dynamics AX applications. These guidelines are provided in  Microsoft Dynamics AX.  [ 30 ]   Chapter 2  Performance Optimization  The coding and implementation should be performance optimized. The following  considerations could ensure that there is no performance degradation due   to customization:  Follow best practices for performance optimization three-tier architecture. Proper selection of the run-on property, which determines the tier on which  the code should run. Suitable selection will minimize the calls between  different tiers and hence performance will be improved. Proper use of caching will not only reduce the network bandwidth  resources, but will also put minimal load on the AOS Database server. Use of client server-neutral functions in code.  If the above considerations are followed, it will ensure that there is no significant  performance degradation after customization, which is one of the requirements of  the IBI specifications.  Trustworthy Computing No ERP system implementation can be successful without providing a trustworthy  computing experience to the users. A trustworthy computing experience can be  achieved using the following qualities:  Security: Today the computer networks are not only confined to an  organization. The networks may be exposed to the Internet or WAN  network, etc., which increases the risk of security attacks. The business  systems should be able to protect the system as well as maintain the data  confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Privacy: Today business success lies in information, its confidentiality, flow,  and availability. The business system should not only have an appropriate  access control mechanism, but it should also ensure that malicious users  cannot access the confidential information by using security loopholes in  design, development, or deployment. Reliability: An ERP system implementation is not just another tool. It is a  change in culture. In the new culture, business success is highly dependent  upon the reliability of an ERP system, which means in every case the ERP  system should perform as expected. The information presented by the system  should be accurate, precise, and in the required format. The customers  should experience a consistent and trouble-free computing experience, where  they need not use other means to process know the information.                       [ 31 ]   Quality in Dynamics AX-Based ERP Solutions  Trustworthiness cannot be achieved like an event. It requires educated human  resources to work continuously with a strong focus towards trustworthiness-related  qualities i.e. security, privacy, reliability, etc. Last but not least, customers should  also know how to use the system in the most secure way, i.e. some implementation  guide should be provided where security hardening is described.  The recommended approach is to educate all the concerned people about security,  secure designing and secure coding, etc. It will help them to analyze the security  concerns. All security issues must be classified in one of following categories:  spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation  of privilege, and attack surface reduction. Proper categorization will help to  understand security concerns in a better way and root-cause analysis could be   done effectively. Effective root-cause analysis will in taking the corrective and  preventive actions. We will discuss trustworthy computing in greater detail in Chapter 5, Best   Practices—Trustworthy Computing.  Globalization Microsoft Dynamics AX is a truly global ERP solution, as it supports input and  output display in more than three dozen languages and currencies for different  geographic locations on the globe. In order to preserve the globalization qualities an  ERP solution should have the following characteristics:        No customization should be required to change the date format, etc.   and hence:   Built-in data types should be used or EDT  Extended Data  Type  should be extended from built-in data types for time  and dates.  Code should be separated to language elements so that not customization is  required for translation:  Language elements  e.g. help text, display labels, error  messages, etc.  should be implemented using the label   file system. The label length may vary in different languages, so it is  necessary that widths of label UI controls are adaptable  as per the requirements in different languages. Microsoft  Dynamics has a very good feature that if best practices are  followed  e.g. labels on controls are not set to fixed width   the width of UI elements will automatically change as per the  need of the language.  [ 32 ]            Chapter 2  In different parts of the world, there are different conventions for number  formats such as decimal separators, thousand separators, etc. Microsoft  Dynamics AX provides a flexibility to adjust the number format as per the  conventions preferred. A few best practices related to thousand separator,  decimal separator, etc. need to be followed, i.e. these should be set to auto. In today's businesses where a country is not a boundary, it is necessary that an  ERP system allows working in multiple currencies and their conversion. The  Microsoft Dynamics AX facilitates the user to work in different currencies.   We will discuss these best practices will be discussed in Chapter 3 in greater detail.  Localization Localization is the process of adapting a globalized application to a particular culture  or locale. The ERP system should be localized, which means:  Language elements should be separated from the code so that code can be  used in the local language without re-customization.  The GUI should adapt as per the change in labels or number of Windows  controls so that layout is not broken. Adapting graphics for a specific culture or locale.  The Dynamics AX is a truly localizable ERP solution. The label file system in  Dynamics AX allows the separation of the following items from the code:  Display labels  F1 help files  Error messages  The Dynamics AX best-practice tool is very useful tool to find if any language  elements are embedded in code, i.e. the label file is not used for any of the   above-mentioned language elements.  Dynamics AX has an IntelliMorph technology that enables it to resize or rearrange  its user interface elements, e.g. text boxes, checkboxes, etc. These realignment or  resizing needs come from the following reasons:  Display labels are of different size in different languages. The number of UI elements may change as per the local needs and hence  there may be the need to remove some of the UI elements or to accommodate  a few more UI controls.                             [ 33 ]   Quality in Dynamics AX-Based ERP Solutions  It is a best practice to use graphics that do not contain any language element or  culture-specific information. It should be noted that conformance to this the   best-practice cannot be verified using the best-practice tool.   Platform Compatibility We need to take special care during customization to make it platform compatible:  Any technology that is not compatible with Dynamics AX should not   be used. Any name such as component name, registry key name, etc., which is a  reserved keyword in that OS should not be used. Browser compatibility should be considered while designing an   enterprise portal.  Setup Installation Any mistake during the installation or uninstallation of any software installation  may not only create malfunctioning in the application being installed or uninstalled,  but also in other applications that share some components such as DLL Active X  components, configuration settings, registry values, etc. The following examples  could be some possible problems during installation or uninstallation:  Mismanagement in reference counting and version checking of shared  components may result in deletion of a shared component while some  other application might still be using it. Another mistake may be that an  application installation does not result in updating a shared component,  which will create some malfunction in the installed application. Missing roll-back feature in setup may present a lot of difficulties if there  is a need to cancel the installation process or due to any reason setup is not  completed. One such example may be when dependency is not available in  the system setup package. Inappropriate uninstallation may corrupt shared AOT elements customized  in several different layers of Dynamics AX. Another example of improper  uninstallation is not removing label and help files manually. If label and  help files are not removed manually, they will still be used by Dynamics AX,  which means they will suppress labels that are no longer supposed to   be suppressed.                     [ 34 ]   In order to minimize the repercussions of bad installation or uninstallation, the setup  process should have the following characteristics:  Chapter 2                    The installation procedure for the application must be compatible with core  Dynamics AX product. The setup program must record all DLL and Active X components in the  registry database as the registry is the central configuration database for   user, application, and computer-specific information in the Windows  operating system. Setup must update the ApplicationVersion class in the AOT to add the  version build number of the application. The setup program for the application under installation must check if the  required Dynamics AX modules are available at an early stage of setup. If  the required dynamics AX modules are not available setup program should  show the list of dependencies and fail gracefully, i.e. reverse the setup  process appropriately. If it is not automated, the correct procedure must be  given to check it manually. Setup should not force any download from   the Internet. Dynamics AX has a built-in system for or selecting or deselecting a particular  feature by checking the configuration keys. The configuration keys can be  seen at: Main menu  Administration  Setup  System  Configuration.  The application under installation must use this mechanism to turn on  and off the features. One example of such features is country-specific  functionality. The application must not overwrite the configuration keys  available in core Dynamics AX product, but a new configuration key or any  configuration key available in core product can be extended. If extension is  not possible, new configuration keys must be created. Dynamics AX is a fully customizable ERP solution in which customization  can be done in several layers or at several places in the same layer. While  uninstalling a Dynamics AX application, the uninstallation process should  not remove any other customization, which may be in a different layer or in  the same layer in which the application being uninstalled resides.  Back up Restore A customer should be able to back up and restore the application as well as  associated data. Since in Dynamics AX-based  i.e. X++-based  applications, new  fields and tables will be treated the same way as any other data and hence core  Dynamics AX-based processes will consider these entities to be like any other data,  they will be backed up with the core Dynamics AX backup process.  [ 35 ]   Quality in Dynamics AX-Based ERP Solutions  If an application under installation has a separate database then data back up and  data restore processes must be provided in documentation.  Extensibility and Customization Dynamics AX has a built-in AOT documentation system where the considerations for  successful customization of the application are mentioned. In AOT documentation  there will be one node corresponding to each AOT element such as table, form, etc.  The corresponding node must be updated if an existing element is customized; but if a  new AOT element is created, there should be a new node in the AOT documentation.  Upgrade and Maintenance Applications can be connected to Dynamics AX in many ways such as COM  connector, BIZ Talk, etc. All integration points must be known so that customers  can access Dynamics AX externally using these integration points. The following  information is required but it is encouraged to supply additional necessary  information too.  Documentation of Integration Points Dynamics AX integration points should cover at least the following information;  however, additional information is highly encouraged.     Core Dynamics AX Objects Modified  repeat this section as many times   as necessary       New Dynamics AX Objects added that interface with core Dynamics AX                              Object modified  table form report class   List of components added or modified with core object  New restrictions or dependencies added  save delete  verifications, restrictions to data able to be viewed, etc.   List of integration points with this object   Object added  table form report class   Navigation method to new object  if a form or web resource   List of core Dynamics AX resources used by new object  Tables used Classes referenced Integration points from new object into core Dynamics AX  Method of integration used Type of integration  read only, read write, etc.   [ 36 ]   Chapter 2     External Objects added that interface with core Dynamics AX                    Object added  Navigation method to new object  if a form or web resource   List of core Dynamics AX resources used by new object  Tables used Classes referenced Integration points from new object into core Dynamics AX  Method of integration used Type of integration  read only, read write, etc.   Database Upgrade Script As Dynamics AX requires a data upgrade script for handling data upgrade,  whenever any changes are made such as releasing new versions, service packs, or  hotfixes an upgrade script should be provided if any change is required in the data  model structure.  File Versioning for DLL and ActiveX Controls All executable files  e.g. DLLs and ActiveX control files  should have associated  versioning metadata. This will help in upgrading and application of service packs or  hot fixes. The installation program for any upgrade, service pack, or hot fix checks if  required versions of these files are in place. Only if it finds everything required, will  it proceed with installation. If versioning metadata is not associated, there may be  chances of faulty installation. Metadata must have information about the supplier  company so that if any kind of corruption occurs in that file, the customer can  identify the company name and contact for the regression.  Description of All Objects Modified Dynamics AX can generate a list of all modified objects. A detailed description  should be provided for all the objects modified in a release. The description must  include how the changes affect the application.  It should be noted that the detailed description is required only for the modified  objects and not for the new objects or unchanged objects that have been customized  in previous release.  [ 37 ]   Quality in Dynamics AX-Based ERP Solutions Removal of Non-functioning Code Any non functioning code should be removed from the code base as non-functioning  code may offer difficulties while understanding the code for further customization   or support.   Summary We studied how we can define quality in Dynamics AX and why we should preserve  this quality. This chapter will be a foundation to understand the IBI specifications.   [ 38 ]   Best Practices—Technical  After completing this chapter, you will understand the basics behind the various best  practices for coding and designing. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the most  important best practices.  Most of the qualities of an ideal ERP system discussed in Chapter 1 are implemented  by conformance to the technical best practices discussed in this chapter. The  Dynamics AX best practice can be categorized in three categories i.e. application  design standards, shared standards, and AOT object standards.  Application Design Standards The Dynamics AX design standards consist of the following considerations:  Code placement Performance optimization Using field groups in tables Auto property settings  Code Placement Code placement is important as it affects the following:  Performance Customization Reusability Maintainability  upgrade, extensibility, etc.                      Best Practices—Technical  The general guidelines are that the code should be placed in such a way that various  calls to other layers are minimized, the operation is performed at the layer where  it is least expensive, and the same code need not be written at several places  e.g. if  business logic is written on a form then it needs to be written in the enterprise portal  for the web client also . So we should not only think about the tier of placement in  the three-tier architecture, but also about the best AOT  Application Object Tree   element type for a piece of code. Once these have been designed we need to think  about the type of method or objects in the classes, etc.  Three-Tier Architecture Considerations The three tiers in this architecture are dedicated for the following three types of jobs:           Client—The Presentation layer—This is where the forms are stored. Place  client-specific classes and methods here. Object server—The Business application logic layer—Transaction-oriented  database update jobs should be run here, close to the database. Database server—The Database layer—Utilize the power of the database  server by using aggregate functions, joins, and other calculating features of  the database management system.  Dynamics AX has a property, RunOn, for every AOT element, which indicates the  layer where it should be executed i.e. Client, AOS, or Database server. This RunOn  property may have one of three values i.e. Client, Called from, and Server.  Client: The object will live on the client.  Called from: The object will live at the tier where the object is created using the  'new' constructor.  Server: The object will live on the server.  Now we will discuss how to decide the RunOn property value.  Classes The value of the RunOn property for a class will decide the location of the object  created from that class.     The value of RunOn property for a class will be same as the parent class if the  parent class has a RunOn property other than Called from i.e. the RunOn  property cannot be changed for a class if the parent class has as its value  either Client or Server.  [ 40 ]               If the parent class has Called from as its RunOn property value, it can  be changed to Client or Server and if it is not changed it will retain the  inherited value i.e. Called from. The Called from value of the RunOn property means the object will live at  the tier where the code creating it  by calling the new constructor  is running.  Chapter 3  Methods Now we will discuss the execution place for various types of methods.  Class static methods and table methods  except for the database methods   can have their default behavior. The execution place for a method can be changed to Server or Client by  adding the Client or Server modifier keywords in the method declaration  as shown below:           server static boolean mymethod  : to make server the  execution place. client static boolean mymethod  : to make client the  execution place. client server static boolean mymethod  : to make  called from the execution place.  The following table summarizes the execution place of various types of methods:  AOT  elements Class static  methods  Class  instance  methods Table static  methods Table  instance  methods  Default behavior  Runs by default at the same place where the associated  class runs i.e. if the associated class has the RunOn property  value as server then the class static method will also be  executed at the server. Runs where the object of the class lives. The class objects  live as described in the class RunOn property.  Table static methods have the RunOn property as Called  from and hence by default they run where they are called. Table instance methods have the RunOn property as  Called from and hence by default they run where they  are called. The standard methods Insert doInsert, Update doUpdate,  and Delete doDelete run on the Server where the data  source is located.  Can be  changed Yes  No  Yes  No  [ 41 ]   Best Practices—Technical GUI Objects and Reports GUI objects always live on Client. GUI objects include the FormRun,  FormDataSource, all FormControls, DialogBox, and OperationProgress objects.  Reports always live on Called from, which means the object will live at the tier  where the code creating it  by calling the new constructor  is running.  Temporary Tables Temporary tables instantiate and live at the tier where data is first inserted and it  does not matter where they are declared. Since the placement of temporary tables is  very critical for performance, temporary tables should live at the tier where they are  used. If a table is utilized in more than one tier then it should live on the tier where  the greatest number of inserts and updates are performed.  Queries QueryRun has Called from as the default value of the RunOn property. The  QueryRun should always be supplied from the same tier from where it was  originally run.  If you want to create a new QueryRun in place of an old one, it should be created on  the same tier where the old QueryRun was executed.  AOT Element Type Consideration The following guidelines must be followed to decide the type of code container:  AOT element Class  Considerations Write code in class when either:                      Code is related to many tables. Code is not related to any table.  Create class instance method when:  Working on the instance variable of the class. Overriding is potentially useful.  Create class static method when:  Access to the class instance method is not required. Overriding is not needed. The functionality of the method is related to the class it   is defined on. The method needs to be executed on a different tier than the  method's tier.  [ 42 ]   Chapter 3  AOT element Table  Considerations Write code in table method when:  It is strictly related to a table.  Create table instance method when:  It is supposed to handle one record at a time.  Create table static method when:  Global class  Write code in global class when:  It is supposed to handle none, some, or all the records at a time.  Forms and  reports       Code cannot be placed more logically in another class  or table . Code is general purpose, tool extending, and application neutral. Coding on forms or reports should be avoided as far as possible i.e. except  for the calls to classes and table methods that handle complex layout and  business logic.  The edit and display methods must be avoided if they are placed in   a table. If code cannot be placed anywhere else, i.e. the presentation tier is most  suitable, then the following guidelines should be observed:  Place the code at the data source or data source field level and not  at the control level. Call classes from buttons on forms by using menu items. For  example, rather than writing a code on the form or report, code   could be written in a class and the class could be called from the   menu item.                  Maps  Views  Write code in maps when a limited number of connected fields needs to   be grouped. Do not place much code in views.  Performance Optimization The performance optimization guidelines can be categorized into the following   three categories:         Database design AOS performance optimization General programming  [ 43 ]   Best Practices—Technical Database Design The database design principles are based on the following considerations:  Minimizing the database calls by caching Minimizing database transactions Wise index designing Using the select statement in an optimum way Performing transactions in the shortest time possible  Caching Database access should be avoided whenever it is not absolutely necessary as  retrieving database records from memory is far cheaper and faster. Recording  database records in memory is known as caching. The following are the possible type  of caching on the server:  Record caching Entire table caching Result-set caching  Record Caching Record caching is a type of performance enhancement technique in which one or a  group of records is retrieved from the memory rather than the database. Retrieving  a record from memory rather than database significantly improves the data access.  Record caching can be enabled only when the following conditions are satisfied:  The CacheLookup property in the table should be enabled by selecting the  values notITTS, Found, or FoundAndEmpty. The table has a unique index; either use the primary index or the first unique  index. The index based on RecId  known as RecId index  does not qualify as  a caching index.  The retrieved records can be placed in cache if the following conditions are met:  The table is cached i.e. the above conditions are met. The select statement used to read the record uses an equal operator  = =  on  the caching key. All the fields in the record are retrieved.                                  [ 44 ]   Chapter 3  A record is looked for when the following conditions are met:          The table is cached. The select statement used to read the record uses an equal operator  = =  on  caching key. The select statement is either inside or outside TTS, but the value of the  caching property for the table is not NotITTS and the select is not forupdate.  The following table summarizes the different types of caching mechanism:  CacheLookup property None  NotITTS  Found  Explanation No data will be cached or retrieved from the cache.  This value of CacheLookup property is used when:  Tables are frequently updated e.g. transaction tables. It is very critical to read fresh data.  All select queries that retrieved at least one result will   be cached.                               All successful select queries based on caching key  are cached for this type of caching. All select queries are returned from cache if the queries are returned from cache if the  are returned from cache if the  record exists there.  A select forupdate in TTS will always read from  the database and replace the record in cache. This value of the CacheLookup property is typically  used for static tables like ZipCodes where the record  usually exists. All select queries based on caching keys are cached, queries based on caching keys are cached,  based on caching keys are cached,  even those select queries, which do not return data. All caching keys selects are returned from caching if  the record exists or is marked as non-existing, and if  it is neither marked as non-existing nor retrieving any  result it will check the database and update the   cache accordingly.  A select forupdate in TTS will always read from  the database and replace the record in cache. This value of the CacheLookup property is typically  used for tables where registering non-existing keys is  also important e.g. discount table.  FoundAndEmpty  [ 45 ]   Best Practices—Technical  CacheLookup property EntireTable  Explanation                      A copy of table is created as temporary table. All selects against the table will be performed on   the copy. Joins that include the table will only be performed  against the copy when all tables participating in the  join are EntireTable cached. Otherwise a database join  is performed. Operations that change data  insert, update, and  delete  are performed against the database as well as  against the copy. The reread method will retrieve the data from  database and update the copy data as well. The Microsoft Dynamics AX Object Server thin  client will regard an EntireTable cached table as  FoundAndEmpty cached as well, and will therefore  build a recordCache locally when accessing the table. This value of the CacheLookup property is typically   used for tables that are not supposed to be modified  frequently.  Result-set Caching The RecordViewCache is useful for caching tables that are not of static nature, or  contain so many records that the other caching methods would be impractical.  This type of caching can be available through the RecordViewCache class. The  RecordViewCache is instantiated using X++ select with a where clause that defines the  result set. Technically the RecordViewCache can be instantiated using X++ select but it  will create a copy of table in memory, which may be an inefficient use of memory.  The following rules apply to the instantiating X++ select:           It may not be a join. It must be noFetch. The table may not be temporary. When running a Dynamics AX Object Server thin client, instantiation must  be on the server.  [ 46 ]   Chapter 3                     The limitations of the result-set caching are as follows:  The RecordViewCache is not shared between Dynamics AX clients. The RecordViewCache is deactivated as soon as the RecordViewCache  object goes out of scope or is destroyed.  In some cases result-set caching may be dangerous and hence only careful use  is recommended. The following facts about result-set caching will be helpful in  deciding the use of result-set caching.  The database is simultaneously updated with the RecordViewCache. Updating the key of a row that did not qualify the result set at the time of  instantiation will not result in the row being included in the cache. Inserts are always included in the RecordViewCaches for that table.  It is definitely an advantage; however, care should be taken when  inserting a large number of rows in a table and at the same time having a  RecordViewCache on the same table as it will prolong the cache update time. A delete will remove the row from RecordViewCaches on that table but not  the table A Delete_from will invalidate RecordViewCaches on that table.  As mentioned above the RecordViewCache can go out of synchronization and hence  we may need to re-synchronize it again. X++ has a method reread, which retrieves  the data from database and updates the cached copy. Indexing Index design is very critical as far as database performance optimization is  concerned. In general indexes are stored in a separate file or table to that of the data  table. Thus searches are performed through a small set of columns  indexed columns  only  and then the data is ultimately retrieved from the table itself by the database  using the index. The objectives are as follows.  Primary keys or indexes are generally used to uniquely identify a record. The  original intention of primary and foreign keys was that of the representation and  enforcement of referential integrity between related tables. Primary keys are now  used as the most important index for a table and do not necessarily have referring  foreign keys in other tables. Primary keys are usually attached to the data space of  the table itself but not always. This is database product specific.  [ 47 ]   Best Practices—Technical  Non-primary indexes are indexes constructed from one or more table columns.  Non-primary indexes may or may not include the primary index column or columns.  The purpose of non-primary indexes is to improve database access performance.  These indexes will be created as a separate file within the database. Thus when  searching these indexes a small number of columns is loaded into memory for  searching. These indexes have virtual memory addresses into the data space of the  table, thus allowing rapid access between index space and table space.   Note that the memory or cache space required for an index is much smaller than that  of a data table since the row length of an index table is smaller. The reason behind  this is that indexes will have a fewer columns in comparison to the data table. Thus  in the case of page swapping in and out of memory or cache and disk, indexes load  many more pages into memory at once since they are smaller than data tables and  thus indexes can be traversed much more rapidly that data table spaces. Different  databases handle this in different ways.  There are different types of indexes available.  Indexes can be unique or non-unique. Unique indexes are generally used as primary  keys  not always  and non-unique indexes contain duplications that are generally  used for database access.  Clustered indexes are generally data table space forms of hashing or btree  algorithms. A clustered index clusters or groups the actual data table rows of the  table where the actual data rows reside in the leaf pages of the index.  A non-clustered index sets the leaf pages of the index as pointers to the data pages  containing the rows in the table.  Any type of indexes can be ordered as ascending or descending. Ascending indexes  are an usual practice.  Now it is obvious that indexing does not make every database operation fast;  operations other than read operations are even slowed because of indexing due to  the increased efforts required to update index files in addition to the table. What to Index To unleash the maximum benefits from indexing while avoiding or minimizing the  disadvantages of indexing, what to index or what not to index should be carefully  decided. The following are rules of thumb:  Use indexes where frequent queries are performed:       Columns are used in joins. Columns are used in where clauses or groupby.  [ 48 ]   Columns are used in order-by clauses. The group-by clause can be enhanced by indexing when the range of values  being grouped is small in relation to the number of rows in the table selected.  Indexes will degrade performance of inserts and updates, sometimes substantially.  Following are a few such cases:  Chapter 3  Tables with a small number of rows Static tables Columns with a wide range of values Tables changed frequently and with a low amount of data access Columns not used in data access query select statements Tables having no fixed width or numeric data column to index or indexing  not done on that column                    Types of Indexes There are several types of indexes and each has its own merits and demerits.  Clustered indexes are indexes made in the table itself and not in a separate index  file and hence with this type of indexes the entire table is sorted as per the indexed  column. This is the primary difference between clustered and non-clustered  indexes. In non-clustered indexes, the index is created on one or more column and  then column value it referenced to record in table. So in non-clustered indexes are  primarily make two operations i.e. locating key in index and then locating referenced  record in table unlike directly searching record in clustered indexes. Due to this  fact clustered indexes are a better choice than non-clustered indexes and hence it is  recommended to have a clustered index if only one index is required or that the most  frequently used column or primary key should be a clustered index.  Clustered indexes also have a few disadvantages. When an update action changes  the value of the indexed column, it will essentially require two actions i.e. delete  from previous position and then insert at next position as per the updated value.  A composite index is an index on two or more columns, which can be either  clustered or non-clustered. Usually composite indexes are not advised, except in the   following cases:        To cover a query: To cover all columns in a query so that the database will  not search for the reference in database and just scanning the column will  serve the purpose. To meet the specific  complex  search criteria e.g. the primary key itself is a  combination of two or more columns.  [ 49 ]   Best Practices—Technical  Some tips for indexing:  Table column  selection  Numbered columns   to make composite  key  to be included  in index  Number of indexes  Index column size                                      A column that can be easily indexed should be chosen. Numeric values are easier to index than strings and hence  indexes on integer values are much faster. If an index needs to be created on a string field it should be  fixed width and not varchar, etc. Never create indexes based on dates. Dynamics AX has an automatically generated RecID for  most of the tables. Indexing on that column is advisable if  another column does not qualify.  Try minimizing the use of composite keys. If no other single  column qualifies, RecId can be a good choice for indexing.  The number of columns in an index should be minimized so  that a search criterion is as simple as possible. A maximum of three columns are recommended for a  composite key. There is no limit to the maximum number of indexes on a  table. However, it is recommended that indexes should be  limited to only those columns that are frequently used in  the where clause of select queries. Too many indexes will slow the overall operation as one  insert or update operation will result in many insert or  update operations due to an insert or update being required  in each index files beside table.  The column or combination of columns on which an index is based  is known as the key. The key size should be as small as possible to  unleash the benefits of indexing in performance optimization. The  key size can be reduced by:  Using the minimum number of columns in the index   Using the minimum data size of the column used as   index key  Using numeric keys instead of other data types such as  varchar, strings, etc.  Distinct index keys  Index keys should be chosen so that the duplicated values for the  key are minimal. The best case is that the key is unique.   [ 50 ]   Chapter 3  Select Statements The following are the best practices regarding the use of select statements:  Use joins instead of multiple nested while selects. Use field lists where applicable. Use select or aggregate functions where applicable. Use delete_from  instead of while, select, ... delete   . Select from the cache where possible.  Transactions The key principles for the best practices related to database transactions are that the  number of database transactions should be minimized and those that are needed  should be conducted in minimal time and deadlock must be avoided. Hence the  following best practices can be derived:  Never wait for a user interaction inside a transaction. If several operations must be performed before data returns to a consistent  state, perform all the operations in one transaction. Make transactions as short and small as possible to avoid deadlocks and  large rollback logs. Avoid deadlocks or lengthy locks. Explicitly select records to be updated in  a specific order within the table  preferably the order of the key , each time,  throughout the application. Select records for update from different tables in  the same order, each time, throughout the application. Do not write or update if the record has not been changed. To avoid lengthy locks on commonly used records the following best  practices are further recommended:                                           Use Optimistic Concurrency Control  OCC . Update locks on central, commonly used  updated  records  that represent bottlenecks in the application. Try to avoid updating commonly used records inside  transactions.  Structure the design so that you can use inserts instead of  updates. Inserts do not lock objects. Place the select statement for updates as close to the  ttsCommit statement as possible, to reduce the amount of  time records are locked.  [ 51 ]   Best Practices—Technical Use Joins in Forms The use of join in forms can offer distinct advantages in comparison to use of  display methods that contains select queries. In one call all records can be fetched  for a form showing approximately twenty grid lines. An additional advantage of  using join is that it is very easy to sort, filter, and find on the joined fields.  AOS Performance Optimization The key principle behind AOS optimization is to minimize the number of calls  between the client and the server. The amount of data transported in each call is  secondary to the number of calls. A few of best practices are:       Achieve select discount. Use containers to reduce the client or server calls.  Achieve Select Discount Whenever a select statement needs to be executed from a data source located at  another tier, the returned record has certain minimum size, which means multiple  records can be fetched in a single call and hence less round trip calls to AOS are  needed for a given number of records. This is phenomenon known as 'Select Discount'.  If only one record needs to be fetched, the number of records can be minimized to  the first record only.  Using Field Groups in Tables The field groups are an important feature in Dynamics AX design, which is not only  used to synchronise forms and reports with the concerned tables  while adding,  deleting, or modifying any field of a table , but also for many other purposes such as  caching and performance optimization. The following are a few advantages of using  field groups in a table:              IntelliMorph can automatically update the layout of all related forms and  reports whenever any change is made to the field groups. It is easy to upgrade new forms and reports that have identical field groups  to the standard table i.e. the custom objects in standard field groups will also  be updated in the upgraded version. The sequence of fields can be used to determine the sequence of fields in  forms and reports and hence the same order of fields can be assured in all  concerned forms and reports related to a table. Identical field groups on tables and forms help in AOS optimization..  [ 52 ]   Chapter 3  Maintaining Auto Property Settings In Dynamics AX many properties should have their values set to Auto, which can  enable the application object to accommodate any changes automatically as per the  kernel's interpretation about various things such as locale, etc. Some advantages of  the Auto property settings are as follows:         Auto selection of date and time format as per the locale settings of the client Auto selection of currency code Form or report layout control as per the rights available to the logged-in user  Shared Standards Some Dynamics AX customization best practices are applicable irrespective of  AOT element. These standards include X++ standards, naming conventions, label  standards, and Help Text guidelines.  X++ Standards This section discusses some best practices related to the X++ language. Conformance  to this standard results in improved execution time, ease in upgrading and further  customization, efficient use of OOP concepts, better readability of code, etc. Some  general principles are as follows:                    Variable or constant or parameter declarations should be as local as possible  to utilize memory resources in an efficient way. Error conditions should be checked in the beginning so that minimum work  is done for action and rollback of action. This will also hinder denial of  service attacks. Denial of service attack is an attempt to stress the system with  too many garbage requests so that an authorized user is not served. The parameters supplied as value must not be modified or manipulated as it  may increase the chances of using wrong values somewhere else. Code should be written in a clean fashion, which means unused variables,  methods, and classes should be removed from the code. The existing MorphX functions or functionality should be used as much as  possible  unless other best practices stop you from doing so , rather than  creating new ones as it will make upgrading easier. The user should not experience a run-time error. All possible cases should be  foreseen and handled accordingly. If some unpredicted case appears during  run time, it should show an error in the Infolog with a message to help the  users on how to avoid the situation and what action can be taken to prevent it.  [ 53 ]   Best Practices—Technical                               The value of the this variable should not be changed. The reusability should be maximized. E.g. rather than repeating lines of code  at different places, a single method can be written so that changes in the  method can be reflected at all the places where this method is used. There should be only one successful return point  except in switch  statements  so that object deletion, etc. can be ensured. A method should perform a single well-defined task and be named according  to the task performed.  Text Constant Standards All the text used in Dynamics AX is supposed to be in a label file irrespective of its  use e.g. user interface or error or success message. The use of text constants can be  classified into two broad categories i.e. user interface text and system-oriented text.  The text used in the user interface should follow the following best practices:  Modify property values on the extended data types or base enums in   the application. Never create duplicate label files i.e. the same text  in the same language  but  a different label file. New label files can be created when customizing the text, but it is always  recommended to reuse the standard labels. However, it may offer a  disadvantage—all the changes made to the SYS layer label files will be gone  whenever an upgrade occurs. So the decision of customizing an existing label  file or creating new label file should be taken carefully. User interface text  labels files  should be used in double quotes.  System-oriented text constants must be in single quotes.  Exception Handling The principle uses of exception handling include freeing system resources    e.g. memory through object deletion, closing database connection, etc.  and  providing constructive information in the Infolog so that the user can prevent such  erroneous conditions. The following are a few recommended best practices related to   exception handling:  A try or catch deadlock or retry loop should always be created around  database transactions that can cause deadlocks. In the retry clause the values of transient variables should be set back to the  values before try.  [ 54 ]   Chapter 3  Branching  A few recommended best practices related to the if-else statement and switch  statement are as follows:  Always use positive logic e.g. write if  true  rather than if  ! false . Prefer switch statement rather than multiple if-else statements. Always end a case with a break or return or throw statement unless a fall  through mechanism is intentionally used. When a fall through mechanism  is used a comment should be given like   fall through so that it is clear to  every reader.  Code Layout For readability of the code, code should be written in a proper layout. Some chief  best practices for code layout are as follows:  Remove commented code before shipping code. Follow indentation rules. Follow case rules for naming classes, methods, tables, etc.  Methods Following are a few best practices for methods:  Methods should be small and logical so that it can be easily overridden or  over-layered. Methods should perform a single well defined task and from their name the  task performed should be clear. For static class methods and table methods, qualified client, server, or  client server should be used in such a way that calls to other tiers are  minimized. For greater details refer to the Best Practices for Designing section  in the Developer's Guide. To ensure trustworthiness, appropriate access levels  public, private, or  protected  should be assigned. Methods should be named according to the Dynamics AX naming  conventions; the reserved keywords such as is, check, validate, set, get, and  find should be used as per the Dynamics AX way of using these standard  methods or functions. All methods using such keywords must not have side  effects e.g. no assignment in validate, check, get, or is methods. Parameter's names must start with an underscore  _  character besides  following other generalized naming conventions.  [ 55 ]                                   Best Practices—Technical Handling Dates Dates are sources of error due to variations in date presentation formats and in   values due to differences in time zone. A few best practices for handling dates are   as follows:  Date fields must be stored or displayed in the date field only as IntelliMorph IntelliMorph  has the ability to display the date value in a format suitable for the user  provided that the date format property is chosen as Auto and it is presented  in a date control. The system date should not be considered as reliable information but in some  cases  e.g. validation of information input by a user  system date should be  read using the SystemDateGet   function instead of the today   function. Date conversion should be avoided as it will loose date properties and hence  sometimes conversion may result in wrong information. For all user   interface-related situations strFmt or date2Str should be used with a value  of -1 for all formatting-related parameters. This will allow users to use this  information in the format specified in regional settings. Care should also   be taken that string variables storing converted date information are  sufficiently long.  Label Standards It is highly recommended that any user-interface text is defined using labels. This  will ensure many advantages during translation. A few label file standards to ensure  the true benefits of the label file system are as follows:  The location of label files should be the most generalized one i.e. extended  data type  EDT . In some cases an existing EDT cannot be used only because  of the difference in label text. In such cases a new EDT should be created  by extending the existing EDT. In such cases other alternatives may also be  available  e.g. label change at the field  but the rule of thumb is to use the  label at the most general place. The label files should not be duplicated i.e. two label files should not exist for  the same text.                  [ 56 ]   AOT Object Standards The AOT object standards are specific to a particular AOT element. Broadly we can  classify AOT elements as follows:  Chapter 3  Data Dictionary             Extended data type Base Enum Tables Feature keys Table collection  Classes Forms Reports Jobs Menu items                        Data Dictionary This is a group of AOT objects including the items mentioned in the previous section.  The best practices for tables can further be divided into best practices for the fields,  field groups, indexes, table relations, delete actions, and methods.  Extended Data Type The EDT plays a great role as it is the basic entity of GUI elements. The following are  a few basic best practices related to extended data types.  All date and date format-related properties should be set to Auto. Help text should not be same as the label property. Help text is supposed to  be more descriptive and should be able to explain why and or how. An EDT name must be a real-world name, prefixed with module    if it belongs to one module only .  [ 57 ]   Best Practices—Technical Base Enum The following are a few basic best practices related to Base Enum:  The Enum name should be an indication of either the few possible values or  type of values. For example DiscountType, OpenClose, etc. Display length property should be set to auto so that in every language the  full name can be displayed. Help and label properties must have some value. Help and label properties  should not have the same value.  Tables Many of the best practices for tables come under the scope of performance  optimization, database design standards, etc. and hence those standards have been  discussed elsewhere. Some of the standards not discussed are discussed here.      The table name may consist of the following valuable information:  Prefix: Module name such as Cust for Account Payable, Sales  for Account Receivables Infix: Logical description of the content Post fix: Type of data e.g. Trans  for transactions , Jour   Journals , Line  table containing detailed information about  a particular record in header table , Table  primary main  tables , Group, Parameters, Setup, or module name to which  the table belongs  Label is a mandatory property and tables must be labelled using Label ID  only. The text value of Label ID must be unique in all languages supported. If a table belongs to one of the four types Parameter, Group, Main, or  WorksheetHeader, then it must have an associated form to maintain the table  records. This form should have a name identical to its display menu item   used to start this form  and like the table name. formRef is the property of a  table for the name of the associated form. Title Field 1 and Title Field 2 should be mentioned:  TitleField1: The key field for the records in the table. This  should be a descriptive title, if the key is information for   the user.  TitleField2: The description for the records in the table.                                  [ 58 ]   Chapter 3  Fields Most of the properties for the fields are inherited from extended data types; however,  it is not mandatory to use some or all inherited values for such properties. Here are a  few guidelines:        Name: Should be like the corresponding EDT name but if named separately,  it should be logical. The fields used as key should be postfixed as ID e.g.  CustId, ItemId, etc. HelpText: This is a mandatory property and inherited from the corresponding  EDT. Since Help Text needs to be customized as per the different uses of   the same EDT, Help text can be modified at any field but the following are   the guidelines:             The help text property should not be same as the label property. Label is also a mandatory property, which is inherited from  EDT. If a value is set here, it should be different from the  value on EDT. Every field that is either the primary key or one of the key  mandatory properties must be set to Yes. Before considering memo or container type fields, it should be  kept in mind that they add time to application and database  fetch, they inhibit array fetching, and these types of fields  cannot be used in where expressions.   Field Group The field group is a group of fields shown in the user interface. Dynamics AX has  some standard groups  e.g. Identification, Administration, Address, Dimension,  Setup, Misc, etc. , while other can be created. The fields that logically belong together  can be placed in one field group while the Misc field group can be used to group  fields that do not fit in any other field group. The dimension field group must have  a single kind of field Dimension. The field groups should have the same kind of  grouping at the database and form or reports to improve caching and hence   the performance. Delete Actions The database integrity is one of the key principles in Relational Database  Management System  RDBMS . The delete action should be used on every relation  between two tables. The following are key best practices for delete actions       Use a delete action on every relation between two tables. Use table delete actions instead of writing code to specify whether deletes  are restricted or cascaded.  [ 59 ]   Best Practices—Technical  Dynamics AX has three types of delete actions; selection of one will solely depend  upon the custom requirements. Table Methods The tables in Dynamics AX have several properties such as delete, validateDelete,  etc. and hence Dynamics AX recommends that you should not write methods or X++  code to implement something that can be done just by setting property values.  Dynamics AX recommends using inbuilt table methods for those custom  requirements that cannot be met with table properties settings. Some of the table  methods are mandatory to implement e.g. find and exists methods.  Classes The classes have a peculiarity that they may have both a back end  database  and  front end  GUI . The front interface should be easy to use and at the same time as  secure as possible. The implementation details of the class should always be hidden  from the user and hence use of private or protected methods is recommended. The   back-end methods are highly secure, standardized, and reliable and hence use of  private or protected methods is recommended in prescribed design patterns. The  design patterns depend upon the type of class. Classes can be categorized in the  following categories:  Real object Action class Supporting class                    The following are a few common best practices related to declaration:  Object member variables must only be used to hold the state of the object  i.e. variables for which values should be kept between and outside instance  method calls. Use of global variables must be minimized. Unused variables must be cleaned up; a tool available at Add-Ins  Best  Practices  Check Variables can be used to know the unused variables. Constants used in more than one method in a class  or in subclass  should be  declared during class declaration.  There is a rich set of best practices for classes and the Best Practices for Microsoft  Dynamics AX Development released by Microsoft would be good read.  [ 60 ]   Chapter 3  Forms The forms are in the presentation tier in any three-tier architecture system. Most of  them are related to look and feel or layout, which we will discuss it in Chapter 4,   Best Practices—GUI. Some other best practices for forms revolve around the   following characteristics:              Use of Intellimorph maximally No forced date or time format No forced layout such as fixed width for label, position control for GUI  controls, etc. Use of label files for GUI text Forms having minimal coding  Avoid Coding on Forms The basic concept of three-tier architecture is that forms should be used only for the  presentation tier and hence no other code such as business logic should be there on  forms. The code placed on forms also reduces their reusability and the ease of further  customization; e.g. if you want to develop an enterprise portal, the code written on  forms will have to be written again in classes or table methods, etc., which will make  the implementation complex. Another example may be when you want to 'COM  enable' your business logic; form code related to business logic will make your life  almost impossible.  Any code  other than presentation logic  written on forms imposes limitation on  performance as call between two different layers increase slowing the performance  and hence code on forms should be avoided as much as possible. In cases  where avoiding code on forms is not possible the guidelines summarized in the  following table should be used for writing code on forms.  Place to Write Code Form level  Data source  Controls  Guidelines When code is related to whole form When code is related to multiple data sources Editor or Display methods  only those that are not  related to any data source  Data source-related Edit or Display methods Code related only to the data source that cannot be  effectively placed in a table method When it is strictly related to the controls  [ 61 ]   Best Practices—Technical Use of IntelliMorph Maximally Due to a user's locale or preferred format a form may be presented in a different  language and or a different date, time, or currency format. Dynamics AX best  practices recommend Auto as the value for the display properties related to   the following:                 Date Currency Time Language Number format  such as decimal operator, separator, etc.  Label size Form size  The rule of thumb is to keep the various properties as Auto or default value, which  will help IntelliMorph to function maximally. For further details about best practices  readers are recommended to go through the Developers Guide for Best Practices.  Reports  The peculiar fact about the reports is that they are output media where the external  environment such as paper size, user's configuration about the locale or language,  font size, etc. matters.  Dynamics AX recommends using 'Auto Design' to develop the report as these kinds  of reports can change the layout according to external environmental variables.  Another way to develop a report in Dynamics AX is 'Generated Design'; this type  of design is recommended only when strict report layout is required. A few such  examples may be regulatory reports, accounts reports, etc.  Summary In this chapter we discussed various areas where quality could be improved by  adopting best practices. We also discussed various best practices, theory behind best  practices, and how to adopt these best practices, i.e. with practical tips.   [ 62 ]   Best Practices—GUI            The user interface plays a vital role in the usability of an ERP system and affects the  user's productivity. The user-interface standards for Dynamics AX are largely based  upon the following standards:  Dynamics AX user assistance best practices Windows user experience guidelines  The objective of Dynamics AX user-interface standards is to ensure consistency with  the core Dynamics AX application and minimum overriding of Dynamics AX defaults.  We will discuss how to meet the above objectives and the best practices with which  we need to comply. The following topics will be clear after reading this chapter:   Various GUI best practices Documentation of deviation from GUI best practices  Window and Screen Layout The objective of this standard is to provide commonality between Dynamics AX  and other windows applications. Meeting this objective ensures ease in managing  different Windows for the Dynamics AX application; as the user is generally aware  about Microsoft standards for windows while using other Microsoft application such  as MS Office, Outlook, and Internet Explorer, etc.    Best Practices—GUI  Sr. No. Check point  Expected  Result  No  1.1  1.2 1.3  2  3  4  5  Is there any window that can be resized by any means other than the  Resize button? Is there any form that gets resized when the grid is resized? Is there any window that gets resized when the user changes from  table view to tree view or vice versa? Is there any window that does not fit into an SVGA display with  1024*768 pixels? Is there any window that requires horizontal scrolling while in   default size? Is there any window that opens exactly on top of an already open  window?  Tester can ignore this standard if due justification   is provided.  Is there any window that cannot be resized?  No No  No  No  No  No  Navigation Pane Requirements The GUI standards for the navigation pane are to ensure that the navigation pane is  used in same way as it is used in other Microsoft applications such as Outlook, etc.   Sr. No. Checkpoint  1  2  The Navigation pane must display in a specific percentage of the  application window. If the user resizes the window, the navigation  pane must be resized automatically so that the percentage   remains constant. Is this standard followed? The Navigation pane must have the following two sections:  Yes  Expected  Result  Yes       Favorites Main menu  Is this standard followed?  Favorites The Favorites menu is a section on the navigation pane. There is no item added on  the favorites menu in core Dynamics AX, but favorite items can be added provided  the following conditions are observed:  [ 64 ]   Chapter 4  Expected  Result  Yes  Sr. No. Checkpoint  Include a maximum of seven items in the Favorites. Is this   standard followed? More than two nested  indentation  levels must not be used. Is this  standard followed? The criteria for grouping the items under favorites must be type   of task. Is this standard followed? Clear, concise, and easy-to-understand names must be used for  Favorites. Cryptic abbreviations or jargon must not be used. Is this  standard followed?  Yes  Yes  Yes  Main Menu The Main menu plays a pivotal role while navigating to various forms, reports, etc.  It is designed in such a way that it increases the usability  by structured navigation ,  and shortens the navigation path  i.e. decreases the average number of clicks to reach  various forms reports . In order to preserve these qualities any customization must  conform to the following specifications:  Sr. No. Checkpoint  Expected  Result  No  Does the number of forms at the start of the menu  for any module   exceed six? Is there any menu in which forms shown at the start are infrequently  used?  Is there any folder icon that is named other than Journals, Inquiries,  Reports, Periodic, and Setup? Do the folder icons appear in the order of Journals, Inquiries, Reports,  Periodic, and Setup? Is there any folder that contains more than six forms?  A folder not  containing any form is acceptable.  Is there any node in the main menu whose indentation level is more  than 5? Is there any menu icon that is inconsistent with Dynamics AX  standards?  If a user clicks a form icon on the main menu, make sure that the same  form icon appears in the upper-left corner of the new window. Is there  any window in which this standard is not followed?  No  No  Yes  No  No  No  No  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  [ 65 ]   Best Practices—GUI  Sr. No. Checkpoint  Expected  Result  No  Is there any form icon, whose title is different from the title on its  corresponding form?  Note: Form title may contain an extra string at the right but it must  start with the label string mentioned in the form icon. Is there any form that does not open by single-clicking the form's icon  Note: sometimes opening a form may take time after clicking the icon,  the tester is advised to test it patiently. Does double-clicking the form's icon open two identical forms?  No  No  Task Pane Requirements The task pane appears  if you opt to display it  at the right side of the application  window. The disadvantage associated with it is that it reduces the space for the  content pane and hence many users opt to not display it. Hence, UI specifications  recommend using the task pane in a way in which users are not compelled to opt for  it to complete their task. A few suggested uses of the task pane may be to display the  search results, help contents, etc. The following specifications must be observed to  ensure that a user is not compelled to use the task pane to complete any task:  Sr. No. Checkpoint  Expected  Result  Yes  The task pane must be used to present information that is useful but  not required. The task pane must not be used to display notifications or  information that is critically important to the user's task. Is this standard  followed? The task pane must not be used as a dialog box or for setting options. Is  this standard followed? The task pane must not be used as a secondary workspace that competes  with the content pane. The content pane is the primary workspace for  displaying forms and windows associated with application tasks. Is this  standard followed? The task pane must not be used to present excessive information that  confuses the user. Is this standard followed? The task pane must not be used to display content that is specific  to the currently selected form or window. The task pane should  display information that applies to the application in general or that is  peripherally useful. Is this standard followed for every window?  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  9  10  11  1  2  3  4  5  [ 66 ]   Sr. No. Checkpoint  Consider using a Wizard or alternative content format to present  information or guidance. Is there any window in which this standard is  not followed? Note: This is a recommendation so this checkpoint may be ignored with  due justification.  Forms Carefully designed forms contribute the largest part to usability, as most of the time  users deal with forms only. Dynamics AX categorizes forms in three categories and  all user interface specifications must conform to a particular form category.   Sr. No. Checkpoint  Chapter 4  Expected  Result  No  Expected  Result  No  A form must fall in one of the three standard categories of forms i.e. Two  tab controls  i.e. Header-line , One tab control, or Function window. Any  combination of the above mentioned categories in a single form is not  allowed. Does any such form exist? Is there any two-tab control form that does not contain a movable splitter  to split the form into header and lines?  The area above a table must either be blank or should contain one or more  controls that are related to frequently used filters or presentation formats  for the records displayed in the table. Is there any form in which this  standard is ignored? Is there any filter control that is supposed to filter records based upon the  group header?  Filtering criteria for a table must not be provided in a tab under the same  tab control. For example, a tab control containing a table must not contain  a Filter tab that controls the filtering of the table. Is there any form in  which this standard is ignored? Inactive filter criteria must be blank. Is there any form in which this  standard is ignored?  Is there any checkbox that can be used to activate or deactivate the   filter controls?  No  No  No  No  No  No  6  1  2  3  4  5  6.1  6.2  [ 67 ]   7  8.1  8.2  9  10  11.1  11.2  1 2  Best Practices—GUI  Sr. No Checkpoint  Expected  Result  No  The area below a table must either be blank or should contain any one of  the following:   Row extension controls   Relevant summaries of the table, for example column totals  Row extension controls contain information that belongs to the currently  selected row. Row extension controls must be used to show all relevant  fields, otherwise horizontal scrolling would be required to show all  relevant fields. Row extension must be used only for fields where vertical  scanning of the corresponding column is not relevant for users. Is there  any form in which this standard is ignored? A column total must total for the whole column in the database and not  only for the visible part. If filters are active for a column, the total should  be calculated for records controlled by filter criteria. Is there any form in  which this standard is ignored? A column total must total for the entire column in the database controlled  by filters. Is there any form in which this standard is ignored? In the default appearance of a table, horizontal scrolling must not be  present. Is there any form in which this standard is ignored? Forms of type 1 and 2  described in checkpoint 1 for forms  must not  contain OK, Cancel, or Help buttons. Is there any form in which this  standard is ignored? Buttons on forms must be placed on the right-hand side in a column. Is  there any form in which this standard is ignored? No button should be tab specific. Is there any form in which this standard  is ignored?  No  No  No  No  No  No  Edit Controls Following are the specifications for edit controls. All edit controls including disabled  edit controls must comply with these specifications.  Sr. No. Checkpoint  Expected  Result  No No  Are default edit labels overridden? Fixed labels must not be used. In other words, all static text in a  window  headers, instructions, edit control labels, etc.  must be taken  from the Dynamics AX label file system to facilitate localization. Is  there any edit control in which this standard is ignored?

No  No No  Expected  Result Yes Yes No  Tabs The tabs are categorized in two categories, i.e. grid layout and form layout. The  standard a tab needs to comply with depends upon the following:           Category of tab from layout perspective Position of tab Type of tab from use perspective e.g. setup tab, dimension tab, etc. The Windows controls it contains, such as tree view  [ 70 ]   Chapter 4  Expected  Result  No  The tabs must conform to the following specifications:  Sr. No. Checkpoint  1  2  3 4  5  6  7  8.1  8.2  9  10  The first tab in any form must always be an Overview tab. Is there any  form in which this standard is ignored? Note: The following are exceptions to these rules:           In a two-tab control form the first tab in lines must be named  Line and not Overview. If a tab contains tree view control, the tab must be named Tree  rather than Overview when tree view is selected. If tree view is  not selected this tab should be Overview only. This standard is not applicable to the function window type   of forms.  When any form is opened, the Overview tab must be displayed.  Here it should be noted that this standard applies only when an  Overview tab is present. In some cases the Overview tab can be named  as Tree or Line tab; in such cases this rule applies for the Tree tab and  Line tab respectively. Is there any form in which this standard is ignored? Does the Overview tab contain a list of records for a particular form? Is the first tab is named Line in a line tab control? Note: this rule applies only for two-tab control forms i.e. Line tab is  present only in this category of forms. Does the Line tab contain a list of 'lines' for the record selected in the  header tab control? The second tab in any form  except function windows  must always  be a General tab. This criterion is applicable to the header as well as to  lines  if they exist . Is there any form in which this standard is ignored? In a function tab control, the first tab must be named General. Is there  any function form in which this standard is ignored? The General tab must contain the most frequently used controls for the  form. Is there any form in which this standard is ignored? The General tab should show data for the record selected in the  Overview tab or the line selected in the Line tab. Is there any form in  which this standard is ignored?

The Dimension tab must contain controls where users can define  default financial options for the currently selected object, such as  preferred account or cost center for the currently selected part. Is there  any form in which this standard is ignored? The tab metaphor must be carefully observed. This, for example, means  that controls must not be added or hidden and labels must not change  on a tab depending on the value of certain input fields on that tab or on  another tab in the same tab control or on record type. It is permissible  to activate and deactivate controls dependent on record type. Is there  any form in which this standard is ignored? Note: Naming an overview tab in which a tree control is present, as  'Tree' is not only permissible but also mandatory.  Is there any tab control on a tab? Does the main key appear on the upper left-most corner of the   General tab? The number of visible tabs must not be changed when a user clicks on  any control.

The information may be a comma-separated list. If it is a comma- separated list, the first two items in the list must be the object key and  the object name. Is there any form in which this standard is ignored? Note: Comma-separated lists must not be used in the main menu even  though it is a tree view.  Is there any tree view in which the separator between items is other  than a backslash, a comma, or a slash? If more than two items are allowed in the comma-separated list, users  must be able to select relevant items for the list in a tab; this tab must be  named Setup. Is there any form in which this standard is ignored? Does tree view support drag and drop for repositioning, adding and  removing objects? Note: It will depend upon requirements so testers can exclude this  checkpoint. There must be an easily accessible explanation of the icons used in the  tree view. The explanation must appear either on the Overview tab   or Tree tab if it is available instead  or on the Setup tab. Is there is any  form in which this standard is ignored? Is the form resized when tree view is selected or deselected? If a user resizes a window containing a tree view, any increase in  window size must be used to increase the size of the tree view. Is there  any form in which this standard is ignored? Is drag and drop  when available  described in the online help for the  form? Note: If drag and drop is not available in any tree view control, this  standard is not applicable. The separator between items in a comma-separated list should be a  backslash. Is there any tree view where this standard is ignored? Note: This is recommended and not mandatory so if justification is  available, a tester can ignore this checkpoint at his or her discretion.

The objective of this help is to provide complete information  about the screen in focus so that a user can know how to complete a task. Form help: This opens in a separate window on request from the user. It  describes when and why this form should be used. Screen tips  what-is-this help : This appears near to a text box so that as a  user can know what this text box is. Tool tips: This type of help appears near a command button, if the mouse  pointer is kept stationary on the command button for a short time.  Explicit tips: This is an explanation of the currently selected object, which  automatically appears above the table.  Status bar messages: A status bar message appears on the left side of the  status bar.  [ 76 ]   Chapter 4  The following is the sample layout for various types of help:  Projects Create and maintain base data for projects. For each project, information about the project number, name, invoice project, group and project status is listed, along with  other base data. This is also where you will find an overview of project transactions, the setup for project posting, the project  sales and cost price setup, invoice information, project forecasting, WIP defination and other critical project data. Four different project types can be created. For more information on the characteristics of these project, see Type. Project hierarchy Each project that you create can be a parent to any number of child projects in a parent-child hierarchy. The project hierarchy  can contain an optional number of levels. Each child project can inherit base data from the parent project. Viewing projects Projects are viewed in either a list, or in a tree structure. Select or clear the Tree control check box to change between project  and Tree view. Sub-projects If you select the Sub-projects check box, transactions on the parent project as well as transactions on sub-projects of the  current parent project appear in the Hours, Costs, and Revenues windows. If the check box is left blank, only transactions on  the parent project appear in these windows. Also, if this check box is selected, transactions on sub-projects will be included in the project range suggested when  adjustment transactions and invoice proposals are created. Buttons Option Transactions  Description View transactions posted on the current project. Revenue transactions are revenue with no matching  costs. WIP transactinos are all transactions posted to a fixed-price project with WIP applied. Open the Activities window where you can enter project activities.

Chapter 4  Expected  Result  Yes Yes No  Documenting Deviations The Dynamics AX user interface specifications are designed to ensure a high  standard of user experience and usability; however, there may be certain  circumstances where deviation from these specifications is inevitable. A few  examples of such circumstances could be:  Legal requirements such as compliance to a legal document. Industry-specific functionality that cannot be implemented in a way  compliant to these specifications.   The documenting of deviations must be done not only for the mandatory  requirements, but also for the recommendations. To document a deviation, we need  to document the following information:  Why is a deviation necessary? Brainstorming document to document the other Dynamics AX-compliant  ways to implement and the limitation found that prevented implementation  in those ways.  Summary We have studied a large number of GUI Standards for Dynamics AX, which   will ensure:  Excellent user experience Highly assisting help Intuitive user interface Appropriate assistance in terms of messages, wizards, etc.  Though it is advised to comply with the user interface standards, if this compliance  is not possible in a particular GUI element, it should be brainstormed to minimize  the non-compliance and the various possible options to implement the functionality  and how an approach with minimum deviation was chosen should be documented.                     [ 83 ]          Best Practices—Trustworthy  Computing  Today, computers are very important and useful for individuals and organizations.  In the case of organizations, the information needs to flow in an accurate, reliable,  and controlled fashion. The success of any business depends upon the reliability,  availability, and security of information used for operational control, management,  and strategic planning of the business. Due to the criticality of information being  available in a secured and private manner, the benefits of an ERP system can be fully  unleashed only if the information is available to the customer in an accurate, secured,  and controlled manner as and when required. These characteristics will make an ERP a  trustworthy system.  Microsoft defines these qualities as follows: Availability: Our products should always be available when our customers need them.  System outages should become a thing of the past because of a software architecture that  supports redundancy and automatic recovery. Self-management should allow for service  resumption without user intervention in almost every case.  Security: The data our software and services store on behalf of our customers should be  protected from harm and used or modified only in appropriate ways. Security models should  be easy for developers to understand and build into their applications.  Privacy: Users should be in control of how their data is used. Policies for information use  should be clear to the user. Users should be in control of when and if they receive information  to make best use of their time. It should be easy for users to specify appropriate use of their  information including controlling the use of email they send.   —An excerpt from Bill Gates' email on Trustworthy Computing, January 5, 2002.  Microsoft adds another dimension in trustworthiness and that is the business  integrity. This means a software provider should be responsive and transparent in  dealing with its customer. This is beyond the scope of this book.   Best Practices—Trustworthy Computing  What is Trustworthy Computing? We have discussed the elements of a trustworthy computing experience. Now we  will discuss the core elements of trustworthy computing in greater detail from the  engineering perspective; i.e. how to achieve trustworthiness.  Security The prime component of trustworthy computing is security, which means—making  IT applications inherently safer. Security can be achieved with the   following strategy:  Making the application development life cycle compliant with Microsoft's  Security Development Lifecycle. Better equipped code analysis from the security perspective. Threat and vulnerability mitigation through:                  Employment of best-of-breed threat protection, detection, and  removal mechanisms. Isolation and resiliency; i.e. isolating the vulnerable code  and providing effective control over the various computer  processes interacting with each other.  Strong authentication mechanisms to ensure correct who, what, and   when information:  Who: To know who the logged-in user is, so that the user's  privileges can be determined, and traced at a later stage   if required. What: To know the user activities performed and the  privileges available to user so that access or deny decisions  can be taken for any of the system assets such as a data table. When: To know when events happened so that any security  attacks can be analyzed for detection, prevention, and  removal of security impacts.  Authorization: To know what types of privileges  read-only, read and   write, etc.  are available for a particular user group. Access control: The access control list  ACL  should be designed in the  beginning so that proper privileges can be assigned to the system users.  The ACL should not be limited to files or folders, but also apply to registry  settings, database files, printers, and objects in active directory, etc. Some directory, etc. Some  etc. Some  other tips about ACL are:     To protect sensitive files and folders of your application,  programmatically create ACLs during installation.  [ 86 ]                                     Be explicit and use the deny access control entry  ACE  often. A NULL discretionary access control list  DACL  can act as  a passage for a hacker. For example, a hacker can change a  NULL DACL to Everyone Deny Access so don't use NULL  DACL entries.  Chapter 5     Education and awareness are key strategies to ensure the use or development  of IT applications in the most secured way. The following could be used to  increase awareness about security:  Providing security hardening guides with ERP applications so  that ERP can be implemented in the most secured way. Providing security education to all concerned such   as programmers, testers, program managers, and   IT administrators.  Privacy The core element of privacy is that the users should feel that their information is  confidential. They are not forced to share their information, nor is the information  taken without their agreement. To meet this characteristic the following guidelines  are suggested:     Functional design to achieve privacy such as:   Features and functionality to support the customers' right to  control their personal information. Features to provide an option to customers to opt in or opt  out when providing personal information.       Design a solution keeping privacy as a concern. Comply with Microsoft Privacy Policy for development as well   as deployment.  Reliability Reliability does not have any measure; different people have different perceptions  about reliability. A non-IT professional may define reliable systems as "systems  working continuously in an expected and consistent manner." While an IT  professional may define a reliable system as "a system that is dependable requires  minimum maintenance and interruptions with high availability of the overall system."  The difference in the definitions creates a major obstruction for devising a measuring  unit for it. Microsoft defines that reliability has the following five characteristics:     Predictable: It provides consistent services.   [ 87 ]                     Best Practices—Trustworthy Computing  Maintainable: It is easy to configure and manage.  Resilient: It works despite changes in conditions.  Recoverable: It is easily restored without adverse impact.  Proven: It operates in a variety of environments.   The above qualities can be achieved with a multipoint strategy, which not only be achieved with a multipoint strategy, which not only e achieved with a multipoint strategy, which not only  ensures higher reliability, but also continuous improvement in it:  Designing for greater reliability such as interoperable design, fail-safe   design etc. Engineering to offer more reliability such as code analysis for superior  coding logic and removal of memory leakage Features to understand where the system fails or how the customer wants to  use the system, etc. Windows error reporting is one such example  Microsoft Security Development   Life Cycle To develop, deploy, and use software applications in a trustworthy way Microsoft  recommends a Security Development Life Cycle. This lifecycle is based on   SD3+C methodology.  SD3+C Methodology  Microsoft has developed a methodology to combat real-world security issues. It  consists of four pillars:     Secure by design: Any ERP solution based on Dynamics AX should be  designed, architected, and implemented in such a way that it can protect  itself as well as the information being processed. Following are a few points  that make for secure design:              The ERP solution should be designed in such a way that  it only accepts the user inputs that are supposed to be the  expected inputs. Dangerous APIs should be handled in a secured way    as prescribed by Microsoft . Data or control commands should be validated at   trust boundaries. Overall architecture should be secure, which can be achieved  by threat modeling at design stage.  [ 88 ]   Chapter 5                   Prescribed or secure design patterns should be used to ensure  secure coding. Cryptography should be used to minimize the risk of  information disclosure. Dynamics AX code access security should be used to prevent  any dangerous API being invoked by untrusted code, i.e. code  that has not originated from the AOT. Strict privileges should be applied on every API.  Vulnerability should be reduced by using the conclusions of  threat modeling. The best practices related to data authorization should   be followed.           Secure by default: Real-world software applications cannot be totally secure  even if an IT application is secured in a thousand ways but has one security  loophole. This security loophole can be utilized by a malicious user. A few  best practices can ensure minimum harm in case of malicious attacks: AN ERP system or any other application should run with the  least necessary privileges. Unused or title used services should be off. Features not used widely should be disabled by default.           Secure in deployment: The security in deployment works in two ways:  i.e. security should be hardened during deployment and the deployment  procedure should be safe and secure to apply patches. Communications: If any security vulnerability is discovered, the  protective action or workaround should be communicated to end users or  administrators in a clear and responsible manner. While communicating to  the end user or administrator, corrective action e.g. applying patches, new  deployments of workarounds, and changes in configuration settings   should be suggested.  Security Development Life Cycle The Trustworthy Security development life cycle is derived from the waterfall  model. It consists of six stages.  [ 89 ]   Best Practices—Trustworthy Computing Requirement Stages Often people have misconceptions that a review of the application developed is  sufficient to ensure the trustworthiness of the software application. Reviewing the  software application is not only cost-inefficient, but also ineffective. A security issue  found in the design while reviewing developed application may compel redesigning  and rewriting the code.   It is true that trustworthiness cannot be achieved in software applications until and  unless the people involved are educated about security. Microsoft recommends the  following mandatory security education for the development team:  Reading Writing Secure Code, Second Edition, by Michael Howard. Reading the Microsoft Dynamics AX Writing Secure X++ Code white paper  published on Microsoft website. Completing the following two Microsoft eLearning security courses:        Clinic 2806: Microsoft Security Guidance Training   for Developers Clinic 2807: Microsoft Security Guidance Training for  Developers II             Reading the Threat Modeling section of the IBI ISV Certification Handbook  distributed by Microsoft to each of the IBI solution provider.  The completion of security education in the requirement phase will provide an  opportunity to have security as the prime concern during each stage of the security  development life cycle.  This phase must also plan security, i.e. writing a security plan, defining   security-related defect classifications and progression. We will discuss more about  defect management in Chapter 8.  Design Phase The design phase is very much critical in trustworthy application development.  Carefully designed architecture is the foundation of trustworthiness of software  applications. Following are a few key activities in the design phase:     Security architecture and design guidelines definitions. The following should  be the prime concerns for this activity:        Identification of design techniques such as application of   least privileges Identification of components whose correct functioning is  essential for security  [ 90 ]   Chapter 5  Security architecture definition for the overall system  Minimization of attack surface     Security by default implementation:  Documenting the elements of the software attack surface Identification of the features that need to be installed   by default.     Conduct threat modeling for each component:  Identification of assets Identification of trust boundaries Identification of threats     Conduct risk analysis:  Assessment of impact on security for each feature as well as  each privilege level. Identification of countermeasures and risk mitigation.  Countermeasures may include information encryption at   trust boundaries and input validations before passing   trust boundary.  Implementation Phase In the implementation phase best practices are identified to meet the goal of  trustworthiness. A few such activities are:       Identification of design patterns to ensure security, privacy, and reliability. Definition of security testing. The following may be a few testing objectives:  To ensure that the Application Under Testing  AUT  does not  bypass standard security model of Dynamics AX. To ensure that the system is robust enough against   security threats. To ensure that user permissions are properly enforced as  per the various configurations such as user group, company,  configuration keys, security keys, and license code.        Apply Dynamics AX best-practice check tool and document the deviations.  Perform code reviews to:  Ensure that coding is as per the prescribed design patterns. Examine source code with an intent of detecting and  removing potential security vulnerabilities.  [ 91 ]                                        Best Practices—Trustworthy Computing Stabilization Phase This is the stage when software is almost in a stable condition  i.e. functionally  complete  and can be reviewed as a system. At this stage the security push goes  beyond the security reviews done in earlier stages. Conducting code reviews at this  stage offers an opportunity to not only review the new code, but also the modified  code and core dynamics AX code in new perspective of entirety.  In Dynamics AX the following activities are recommended by Microsoft:        Review of features and functions specifically designed to improve the  trustworthiness i.e. reliability, security, and privacy. Risk analysis done in  design phase of the security development life cycle can be useful to identify  such features and functions. Review of overall code in entirety: i.e. both new code and updated code.  Impact on existing code should also be a consideration.  Release Phase The primary activity in release phase is conducting the Final Security Review  FSR .  This activity is conducted a couple of months before implementing or shipping  the product. The FSR should be conducted by an independent security team at a  stage when non-security issues are minimum. The FSR should not only consider  the security health of the product in scope, but also previously reported issues.  The previously reported issues give a clue to the pattern of security issues and the  other areas where this kind of issues are still not discovered. It may also help to  understand the root causes and take corrective and preventive actions.  Support Servicing Phase A software application cannot be 100% secure—and even if it is100% secure today, it  will definitely be vulnerable tomorrow due to discovery of new kinds of attacks. A  support system should be in place, which can respond to newly discovered security  vulnerabilities. The response should include:          Evaluating vulnerability and issueing advisories and or updates. Conducting a post mortem of the vulnerabilities and conducting an analysis  of the chances of similar kinds of vulnerabilities in the product and taking  preventive action. Reporting newly identified vulnerabilities to the security team so that suitable  test cases can be added for future release of the same or other products.  [ 92 ]   Chapter 5  Threat Modeling Threat modeling is a security analysis technique to identify and document the threats  to meet the following objectives:           Identification of risk Analysis of risk Identification of the possible remedy or mitigation of threats Help design, development, and testing team to improve the security aspects  of design, secure development, and testing respectively  To meet the above objectives, threat modeling has three major activities: i.e.  understanding the adversary's view, characterizing security, and determining,  analyzing, and documenting the threats.  How to Conduct Threat Modeling To conduct threat modeling it is necessary to analyze the system architecture to find  the entry points and assets and cross reference these with trust levels. The entry  points or interfaces are the places in the architecture where data and or control flow  transfers between the system under consideration for threat modeling and any other  system. All entry points or interfaces must be identified and documented irrespective  of the trust level at the interfaces. Here trust level means privileges an external entity  should have to legitimately use these interfaces.  These interfaces include the following:           Open sockets Remote Procedure Call  RPC  interfaces Web services interfaces Data being read from the file system  After identifying the entry points, assets that a malicious user can misuse    e.g. manipulate, steal, etc.  should be identified. Usually most affected assets are  entities at interfaces points, but they can be other things such as process tokens,  unencrypted passwords, etc. All assets that can be a targeted for threat should be  identified and cross-referenced with trust level. Here trust level means privilege   level required to allow access or affect the assets in some way.  [ 93 ]   Best Practices—Trustworthy Computing  After identifying entry points or interfaces, the next step of threat modeling  is characterizing the security of the system, which involves binding the threat  model, gathering information about dependencies that are security critical, and  understanding the internal component structure working of the system. Once this  is done, usage scenarios are studied in order to understand how the system will be  used. This will help understand the use scenarios beyond the security architecture.  After use scenarios, the dependencies are studied, as some of the dependencies   on other systems may affect the security of the system under consideration for   threat modeling.  After collecting all the information, the system is modeled as a data flow diagram or  control flow diagram to understand the system action for various use scenarios and  data or control flow across the trust boundaries, etc. The objective of this activity is to  know the following:             How are protected resources affected? Where could an external entity manipulate an asset? What kind processing occurs beyond entry points? How is the information used beyond entry points? What processing or action is done on behalf of external entities?  Now all the threats should be documented with all the information such as  description of the threat, the target of the attack, the risk of the attack, the possible  technique for the attack, and strategy to manage the risk. Now every threat has  enough details to review these threats and prioritize them. Some of them may not be  great enough to address. The DREAD model may be used to prioritize the threats.  DREAD is discussed in Chapter 8.  Summary In this chapter we discussed trustworthy computing, the components of trustworthy  computing, and how we can achieve trustworthiness. We also discussed phased  activities in the security development lifecycle.  Last but not the least, we discussed threat modeling, which can be considered as the  foundation for trustworthy computing.   [ 94 ]   Testing  In the last few chapters we discussed the characteristics of an ERP system and  Dynamics AX as an ideal ERP system. Since we need to customize it for every  implementation, it is imperative that we preserve the qualities that make Dynamics  AX an ideal ERP system. We also discussed the best practices that should be  followed during customization to preserve the qualities of Dynamics AX.  Now we need to verify if the best practices are followed during customization. In  this chapter we will discuss various types of testing, which will cover verification  for most of the best practices. IBI references are provided so that readers working  with IBI-compliant projects can easily demonstrate IBI compliance. For each type of  testing we will discuss the following:                   Test objectives Technique Expected results Completion criterion Special considerations Responsibility  i.e. most suitable person to conduct given testing  Deliverables IBI reference  Unit Testing As in any project, unit testing is the first level of testing where most of the defects  should be caught. The objective of this testing is to verify that the labels, validations,  boundary conditions, flow, and calculations are coded as per the defined standards  and requirements.   Testing  The effectiveness of the unit testing is very critical not only for the quality of  deliverable code, but also to minimize the total efforts of the project team and ensure  the on time delivery of the code being achieved. The unit testing is done only by  developers. The following table summarizes unit testing:  Specifications for Unit Testing Technique  Trustworthiness test cases, memory management test cases, and  functional test cases  validations, conditions, boundary conditions,  flow, and calculations  should be verified by the developer.  A checklist can be prepared for each kind of code and a unit test  document can be prepared for the code under unit testing. A unit test document should be prepared that contains test cases as  well as test results. The application behaves as per the unit test cases. All the newly written code is tested.

Besides that, conformance to the naming conventions  and commenting is also in the scope of this testing. The following table summarizes  this testing.  [ 96 ]   Specifications for Compliance Check to Coding Standards Technique  Chapter 6  Dynamics AX's best-practice tool should be utilized to detect such errors,  but it should be ensured that this tool is used in default configuration. All naming conventions are reviewed after source code Titlecase  Update through the Add-Ins menu.  Most of the Microsoft Business Solutions providers have some kind of  automated mechanism to mark a comment as soon as a new code block  is written or an existing code block is modified.

To ensure that the file format for help files is .chm.  The following table summarizes the testing.  Specifications for Help Navigation  User Assistance  Testing Technique  Verification for each form by pressing the F1 key. The help text  displayed should be as per the stated requirement. While defining the help requirements, the following should be taken  into consideration:        The online help must be easy to understand and must tell  the user how to perform specific tasks. It must provide a user experience that is consistent in terms  of the writing style and depth of information. Ideally this  can be covered under Functional testing if help has been  taken care of, else a separate test must be performed for help  navigation when help is added after the functional testing.  A User assistance test document should be prepared, which will  form the basis for testing. Pressing F1 while an application window is open must result in a  launch of a contextually-correct help window.  The help window must comply with Dynamics AX help standards. All forms in the code under test have been tested and all help  documentations are as per Dynamics AX help standards. Performing this testing along with Functional testing will reduce the  efforts required.

Performance is not expected to degrade more than 5%. The following  table summarizes this testing.  Specifications for Performance Testing Technique  Dynamics AX benchmark toolkit should be used for performance testing. The performance test for standard Dynamics AX should be executed  to baseline the performance. The same tests should be run again with  application under test and the results should be compared against the  baseline values.  The Dynamics AX Event log should be checked for error and warnings  regarding the performance. Test scripts should be written for the business processes to be tested.  The business processes that are most affected by customization and are  under the main business flow of the application should be selected. Issues found are recorded in the review and authorization form. No significant  >5%  performance degradation when running  performance benchmark tool before and after installing this solution  onto core Dynamics AX. Performance degradation is not greater than 5%.  Application testing demo data must be planned and reviewed before  starting Performance Testing.

[ 100 ]   Chapter 6  Security Testing Any software application cannot be useful until and unless it is secure. As per  Microsoft vision, IT applications should be as safe as water and electrical devices in  our homes. The following should be included in the objectives of security testing for  Dynamics AX implementations:            To ensure that Application Under Testing  AUT  does not bypass standard  security model To ensure that the system is robust enough to deal with security threats Analysis of threat modeling, security measures, etc. Final code review to ensure that no critical security is left unresolved  The following table summarizes this testing. Specifications for Security Testing Technique  The following verifications should be performed as part of this testing: In Administration  Setup  Security menu, AUT must have a node  available in the tree view listing of modules. Setting no access to a user group should not allow seeing any part of  the functionality, forms, or menu item related to the AUT. A Security test plan should be written to define the scope of testing,  defect classification, root-cause classification, etc. A security checklist  should be provided to the Tester, which should be filled while testing. Test results should be recorded in an Excel sheet, which will also  contain bug classification and root-cause classification.             The access control security works as in the standard   Dynamics AX product. The counter measure is found for every security threat  identified in threat modeling. Verification of node and tree structure. Verification of removal of AUT from security menu.  The accessing permission to various groups should be checked with  Dynamics AX unique challenges; e.g. if access permission is set to NO,  all menu items, buttons, forms, etc. should be invisible. Tester. 8.1  Expected Results  Completion  Criteria  Special  Considerations  Responsibility IBI Reference  [ 101 ]   Testing  Authorization Testing Authorization testing is a type of security testing. This testing is very important  and is required to supplement the security testing to achieve the objective of  trustworthiness. This testing ensures that user permissions are enforced as per the  following configurations in Dynamics AX:           User group Company Configuration codes and security keys License codes  The following table summarizes authorization testing.  Specifications for Authorization Testing Technique  The following scenarios should be tested:                                   A security key set to View level allows the user to view records. A top-level security key is disabled; the user should not have  access to that item. A security key set to Create level allows the user to create   new records. A feature is disabled when the configuration key is turned off.  A form control is invisible when its security access is set to   No Access. A field inside a table does not appear on a form if it is set to   No Access. Users cannot see the forms to which they do not have access. Users cannot see the reports to which they do not have access.  Expected  Result Completion  Criteria Special  Considerations  A combination of various means of controlling permissions should  behave in the way a standard Dynamics AX does. All scenarios are executed.  The following special considerations must be taken care while   designing test scenarios:  All conditions  i.e. No Access, Edit, Create, View, Full Control   must be checked for users with limited permissions.  Users belonging to more than one user group  with conflicting  permissions  must be tested. Users belonging to multiple companies may have different  permissions in different companies. This must be a special  consideration while designing test scenarios. The Dynamics AX system has limited license codes, such as a  user with administrator privileges may not have access to AR or  AP as per the license provided.

Dynamics AX best practice check tool does not contain any  errors related to separation of text-strings from code.  Dynamics AX Event log contains only the warnings  accepted by the testing team.  The Dynamics AX best-practice check tool should not show any   error message. The Dynamics AX best-practice check tool should not show  any warning message until unless justification is given in  documentation. The configuration key form released by the ISV should contain  configuration keys for locales according to the customization.  The Dynamics AX best-practice check tool should be in  default configuration. The SysBPCheckIgnore Macro should not contain any kind   of entries.

If an  installation cannot be completed, the newly installed items are uninstalled and they  do not affect the Dynamics AX that is already installed. The objectives may include  the following.                 To ensure compatible installation procedure for core Dynamics AX product To ensure that the setup registers the DLLs and ActiveX controls correctly To ensure that the setup checks for proper Dynamics AX version and service  pack level To ensure that the setup checks for the presence of required   Dynamics AX modules To ensure that configuration settings are either inherent or created To ensure that the setup provides all dependencies, i.e. files necessary   for installation  [ 105 ]   Testing  The following table summarizes this testing.   Specifications for Installation Testing Technique  The installation test document should be prepared and the test  should be performed against this document. The AUT should be installed using its installation guide and the  execution should be verified thereafter. The share count for every DLL and ActiveX control should be noted  before and after installation or uninstallation or reinstallation. It  should also be checked that the registry is updated with the correct  version for DLLs and ActiveX controls. An inappropriate version of Dynamics AX could be used for the  setup process. The setup process should check for the correct  version of Dynamics AX at an early stage of installation. Every factor should be taken into consideration to ensure that setup  checks all dependencies and if any of the dependencies are not  available the setup should abort without leaving any impact on the  core Dynamics AX. It should also be checked that setup does not ask for any file  download from the Internet, etc. Ensure that the setup checks for required Dynamics AX modules by  deseleting a required module from the configuration keys. This test  should be repeated for each required module. The setup meets the guidelines mentioned as the objective of   this test.  document.

Usually X++ applications share the same database as the standard Dynamics  AX product and hence customization is considered as an extension of standard  Dynamics AX. In such a case the back up and restore process of standard Dynamics  AX will work and hence no separate mechanism is needed for this purpose. Of  course the back up and restore mechanism provided in standard Dynamics AX need  not to be tested.  This testing is applicable if customized X++ applications have a separate database.  The following table summarizes this testing.  Specifications for Back up and Restore Testing Technique  An executed sequence of backup and restore processes should  return the application to the same state. A back up and restore test document should be prepared to specify  the test cases and expected results. An executed sequence of backup and restore processes returns the  application to the same state. If the application can be restored to its original state by a sequence  of backup and restore process. Application backup and data backup processes are two different  things and hence should be tested separately. If testing is related to  an X++ application using a separate database only data backup and  restore mechanism should be tested, while if it is a .NET application  both need to be tested.

This will set the scope and vision of various types of testing performed.  Each testing type is also mapped with corresponding IBI references. This will make  IBI compliance monitoring easy.  For any type of testing it is essential that it is performed at the appropriate stage  of software testing. Various testing stages, their entry and exit criteria, etc. are  discussed in the next chapter.  [ 111 ]    Test Life Cycle  In the last chapter we discussed various types of testing applicable to Dynamics AX  customization projects. In order to unleash maximum benefits of all the tests and to  optimize the efforts and hence the cost, it is imperative that all the tests are conducted  at an appropriate time.  To know the optimum order of the various types of testing, we need to carefully  understand the test life cycle, the various testing stages in testing, and the entry and  exit criterion for testing progression to and from a testing stage.   The test lifecycle for Dynamics AX customization has some unique characteristics  due to the inherent product nature of Dynamics AX and the fact that it is a  customization process and not a complete software development.  Test Approach To optimize the efforts and better manage testing activities, we need to group  various types of tests. Each group of testing should have a common start and end  point in the software testing and development life cycle. The activities between the  start and end points are known as a testing stage. For Dynamics AX customization  projects testing should be conducted in a manner where all the types of tests should  be covered in the following stages:  Sr. no. Testing stage 1 2  Unit Module  Types of testing to be performed Unit testing of an independent piece unit. Functional testing of the module or functionality,  compliance check to coding standards, compliance check to  design and architecture guidelines, help navigation testing,  user experience and usability testing, verification of business  intelligence or reporting standards.   Test Life Cycle  Sr. no. Testing stage System testing 3  4  5 6  Regression testing  Release testing User acceptance  testing  Types of testing to be performed Performance testing, security testing, globalization  testing, localization testing, platform compatibility testing,  verification for compliance to ISV standards, back up and  restore, extensibility. Functional testing of the entire functionality, authorization  testing. Installation testing. Acceptance of the delivered functionality to be done by the  users who gave the requirements.  Entry and Exit Criteria Since a staged approach is recommended for Dynamics AX customization testing,  entry and exit criteria should be defined for every stage of software testing. You  may think that the exit criteria of a software testing stage should be the entry criteria  for the subsequent software testing stage; however, this is not true. Consider the  following example:  One of the entry criteria for system testing is 'Test Cases or Scripts that need to be  executed in this stage are ready' in addition to the exit criteria of module testing.  Entry Criteria for Unit Testing Unit testing is an activity of verifying the functionality with respect to the finalized  requirement and design. Maximum benefits of unit testing can be unleashed only  if the requirements are agreed and approved. Hence, the following should be  considered as the entry criteria for unit testing:           Functional specifications related to the requirement under test are frozen. The technical design document is completed, approved, and released. The system design is documented, approved, and released. There is no item in the query or issue register that is related to requirement  under test.  Exit Criteria for Unit Testing Unit testing should be considered completed only after the code is completed as per  the requirements and with conformance to the design standards—all code is cleaned   i.e. unused code, variables, and label files are removed , and code documentation   AOT documentations, commenting, etc.  is completed. In short, code should   [ 114 ]                                be good enough to be released to the internal customer i.e. the test team. The exit  criteria for unit testing is as follows:  Chapter 7  Unit test has been passed. The code is complete with respect to requirements under test i.e. there are no  missing features or elements. Code documentation is complete i.e. both comments and the job description. Dynamics AX best practices errors and warnings  as far as possible  have  been removed as per the test approach section. This is an optional criterion as  sometimes this testing is performed by the test team under module testing. Code optimization for three-tier architecture is done and the best practice tool  is not showing any error related to performance optimization of the code. Creation of all label files and removal of unused label files including all info  logs, warnings, etc. Unused, unreachable, and redundant code is removed. Declaration of successful unit test performance is signed recorded  Entry Criteria for Module Testing As discussed earlier, the exit criteria for one testing stage may not be the entry  criteria for another. For example, module testing cannot be started immediately after  unit testing is finished  i.e. exit criteria for unit testing are passed ; the code that  has passed the unit test needs to be deployed to the test environment and only then  can module testing start. So the following can be considered as the entry criteria for  module testing:  All required units have passed the unit test exit criteria. The unit test document is signed by the developer or peer of the developer  who conducted unit testing. The code is deployed in the test environment  having different test  environments is the ideal approach .  Exit Criteria for Module Testing The objective of module testing is to complete the various testing for this stage as  per the latest understanding of the requirements. Hence, it is necessary that the  completion criteria for all testing types are finished before completing this testing  stage, and if there is any change in understanding the requirements  through query  or issue registers requests , the impact of change should be studied, analyzed,  and tested before exiting this stage. It is also imperative that all important issues  or defects raised are closed at any terminating stage so that no future tracking is  required for any issue or defect. So the following can be considered as the exit criteria  for the module testing stage:  [ 115 ]   Test Life Cycle  All "Fix before breathing" and "Fix immediately" priority bugs are fixed and  the fix is verified. Refer Chapter 8, Defect Management System for priority  classification details. Severity level 1 and 2 bugs are fixed and the fix is verified. All issues or queries raised during module testing  related to functional  behavior of requirement under testing  are settled. All test scripts related to requirements under test have been executed and  screenshots of the results have been incorporated. If any medium or low-priority errors are pending, the implementation risk  must be approved by the Business Analyst and or Client. Completion criteria for all types of testing related to module testing stage    as mentioned in the table in the Test Approach section  have been met.  Entry Criteria for System Testing In order to enter the system testing stage it is necessary that all the customization  work exit criteria for the module testing stage are passed and preparations for  system testing have been completed. The preparation includes writing and reviewing  of 'end-to-end' and 'scenario-based' functional and non-functional test cases. Hence,  the following can be considered as the entry criteria for the system testing stage:  Application has passed the exit criteria for module testing. Test cases or scripts that need to be executed in this stage are ready. All non-functional requirements are available:                                   Performance requirement Security configurations Countries and locales supported Languages supported     All non-functional test cases are ready as per the non-functional requirements.  Exit Criteria for System Testing After completing system testing all functional as well as non-functional requirements  must be tested and important defects should not be in an open state. The system  testing stage is also appropriate for the final security review of the application as it is  the customized application in almost  except some possible issues discovered during  regression testing  developed condition. So the following may be considered as the  exit criteria for the system testing stage:  [ 116 ]                                         Chapter 7  All "Fix before breathing" and "Fix immediately" priority bugs are fixed and  the fix is verified. Severity level 1 and 2 bugs are fixed and the fix is verified. If any medium or low-priority errors are pending, the implementation risk  must be approved by the Business Analyst and or Client. Test cases scheduled for the system test phase have passed. Final security review is completed and no security-related issues are in an  open state. Completion criteria for all types of testing related to the system testing stage    as mentioned in the table in the Test Approach section  have been met.  Entry Criteria for Regression Testing Passing entry criteria for regression testing indicates that code has passed system  testing and preparations for the regression testing  which include necessary test  scripts and configurations of application  have been completed. Hence, the following  may be the entry criteria for regression testing:  Exit criteria for system testing have been met. Regression test scripts are ready. Security key or configuration keys are finalized. Consistency verification test script is ready.  In order to optimize the efforts, the regression test scripts can be designed  in a way that they can be used as consistency verification test scripts.  Exit Criteria for Regression Testing The following can be the exit criteria for the regression testing:  All "Fix before breathing" and "Fix immediately" priority bugs are fixed and  the fix is verified. Severity level 1 and 2 bugs are fixed and the fix is verified. If any medium or low-priority errors are pending, the implementation risk  must be approved by the Business Analyst and or Client. No open issues or queries exist. Completion criteria have been met for all types of testing related to the  regression testing stage  as mentioned in the table in the Test Approach section   [ 117 ]   Test Life Cycle Entry Criteria for Release Testing In the context of Dynamics AX the release testing stage has only installation testing.  As per Microsoft standards installation and uninstallation processes should be  safe and automated but some activities required for successful installation or  uninstallation cannot be automated in Dynamics AX. For all such activities the  manual procedure should be explained in the installation guide. The tester should  follow all the steps mentioned in the installation guide and system behavior should  be as mentioned in the installation guide. For more details about installation testing  the reader can refer to the previous chapter. The following points can be a considered  as the entry criteria for the release testing stage:   Successful completion of the exit criteria of the system testing stage. Installation guide is ready. Installation test cases are written and revised. The XPO or setup executable file that needs to be shipped is ready. The test environment for installation testing is ready.  Exit Criteria for Release Testing Release testing can be considered as completed after the following have   been performed:  All issues related to installation testing have been fixed. All open issues are documented as known bugs. Severity level 1 and 2 bugs are fixed and the fix is verified. If any medium or low-priority errors are pending, the implementation risk  must be approved by the Business Analyst and or Client. Completion criteria for all types of testing related to the release testing  stage   as mentioned in the table in the Test Approach section  have been met.                         Criterion Definition In order to provide clarity for the project testing team as well as the other teams in  the project, it is essential that some of the key decision criteria are documented in a  test plan and a commitment is taken from various stakeholders.  [ 118 ]   Test Case Pass or Fail Criteria Every failed test case  except at unit testing  will be recorded. The application will  not move to the subsequent software testing stage with Severity level 1 or 2 or urgent  or high priority errors. Following may be a generalized idea about the test case pass  fail criteria. More accurate definition can be defined for each type of individual test  case type  i.e. testing types :  Chapter 7  The feature will pass or fail depending upon the results of testing actions. If  the actual output from an action is the same as the expected output specified  by a test case, the feature passes. Should any action within a test case fail, the  entire case fails. If a test case fails, it is not assumed that the code is defective. A failure can  only be interpreted as a difference between the expected results, which are  derived from project documentation, and actual results. There is always the  possibility that expected results can be in error because of misinterpreted,  incomplete, or inaccurate project documentation. Reported failure is logged  for further analysis and then the cause of failure is analyzed. If it is a defect, it  should be recorded on the review and authorizations form.  Suspension Resumption Criteria The test team may suspend partial or full-testing activities on a given piece of code if  any of the following occurs:  Test environment is not updated with the latest code  which needs to be  tested . The development team cannot configure the setup data for a given piece   of code. Sanity  or build verification  testing  if any is being conducted  fails. There is a fault with a feature that prevents its testing. An item does not contain the specified changes. An excessive amount of bugs that should have been caught during the  previous phase are found during more advanced phases of testing. Here it is  very much imperative that the criteria to define excessive bug are defined i.e.   X number of defects with severity 1 or 2 or Y number of defects with priority  critical or urgent. A new version of the software is available to test.                          [ 119 ]   Test Life Cycle  Resumption of testing will begin when the following are delivered to the test team:         The code with the problem that caused suspension of testing corrected.  A list of all bugs fixed in the new version. A written assurance from the lead developer that he or she, or one of the  team members has verified that cause which suspended testing and it has  been removed.  Roles and Responsibilities For the success of the project it is necessary that each stakeholder knows his or her  responsibilities and expectations from other stakeholders.   The test team recommended for Dynamics AX customization projects is not an  isolated testing team, but the testing responsibility is distributed throughout the  project team. This is suggested to minimize the cost and make efficient utilization of  available skills.  Responsibilities  Role Test  Manager                                     Writing test plan Maintaining test plan Monitoring test progress Monitoring adherence to test plan Making decisions about entry and exit to and from a   testing stage Making decisions about suspension or resumption of testing Making changes in test strategy or amendments in test plan Coordinating test team Representing testing team in various meeting Generating various reports and matrices Risk identification, analysis, and mitigation Reporting updates about testing progress, any issues being  faced, and risk identified to Test Manager  Creating functional test cases and test scripts Performing functional testing Assisting in system test cases Writing consistency verification test scripts  Test Lead  Business  Analyst  [ 120 ]   Role Developers  Responsibilities  Lead  Developer  Testers  Chapter 7                                   Performing unit testing  Conducting peer code reviews Delivering complete builds of the application Providing feedback to the testers regarding changes and   new functionality Providing expertise and knowledge of the application   under test to the test team as and when required Eliminating errors that were agreed Conducting code reviews  performing compliance check  to design and architecture, compliance check to business  standards or reporting standards  Representing development team in triage meetings Representing trustworthy computing-related activities such  as final security review, threat review, and prioritization Writing or executing test cases other than functional  test cases  i.e. test cases for other than functional testing  regression testing, scenario-based testing, and end-to-end  functional testing  Finding, reporting, and tracking errors discovered   during testing Analyzing results Performing compliance check to coding standards, help  navigation testing, user experience and usability testing,  performance testing, globalization testing, localization  testing, platform compatibility testing, extensibility testing,  backup and restore testing, installation testing  Code Review Code review in Dynamics AX has multiple objectives, which include the following:         Compliance check to design and architecture guidelines. Verification of business intelligence or reporting standards. Final security review.   The code review should be conducted at two levels; one is at the level of piece of  code that would help to meet the first two objectives and the other is at a system  level where the major focus is on security. The system-level code review will also  help in reviewing the correctness of critical business logic.  [ 121 ]   Test Life Cycle  During code review, the objectives of this testing should be kept in mind. To ensure  meeting the objectives of the said testing a checklist should be prepared that contains  checkpoints related to this testing. This checklist should be reviewed and approved  before code review starts.  The design and architectural patterns should be reviewed and finalized from every  perspective including trustworthy computing.  Summary In this chapter we discussed various key points about the recommended testing life  cycle, its stages, entry and exit criteria for each of the testing stages, responsibilities  of each of the stakeholders, various key criteria, etc. This chapter also identified  when testing should be performed. For the success of testing activities, it is not only  necessary to perform testing with proper techniques, but also that it is performed at  the correct stage.   We saw that testing for Dynamics AX customization projects is a shared  responsibility for a project team i.e. developers, business analysts, test team, etc.; a  high level of cooperation among different teams, clear communication protocols, and  defined expectations from each of the participents are key to success of testing for  Dynamics AX customization projects.  [ 122 ]   Defect Management System  Any software system that is customized and not developed from scratch requires  comprehensive testing, which goes beyond requirement verification, as many bugs  appear because of customization. This requires a special definition for 'defect' as the  defect may be beyond the requirement area. The following could be considered as   a defect:              The system does something the requirements and design document does   not mention. The system does not do what the requirements and design   document mentions. The system does something and requirement document does not contain   any information about that function. It may be considered as a defect or   an enhancement depending upon the agreement between all relevant   stake holders. The system does not do something and requirement document does not  contain any information about that function. It may be considered as a defect  or an enhancement depending upon the agreement between all relevant  stake holders.  All issues found in the core Dynamics AX product or localization should be dealt  with case by case. Besides the aspects mentioned above, business applications  need to gain trustworthiness. To achieve this characteristic security issues must be  handled systematically. All security issues should be classified and handled as per  the methodology prescribed in this chapter.  To handle security defects, the defect tracking tool should have provision to accept  and process additional information for such issues.   Defect Management System  Defect Classification From the perspective of defect management defects can be classified into two  categories i.e. security related defects and non security related defects. The   security-related defects need some additional information attached with each  security defect. Defect classification in Dynamics AX, for all kinds of defects    i.e. irrespective of the type of testing discovering the bugs , is based on the   following factors:  Bug priority Category Issue status Requirement Ref. STRIDE  Severity Discoverability Mitigation Vulnerability Resources                                  The defect management tool should have the provision to accept all the   security-related defects' information. The tool should ensure that when a defect   is logged as a security-related issue, the user enters all the required information.   The tool should also be able to generate reports as per all the dimensions   mentioned above.  Bug Priority The bug priority categorization indicates overall importance and determines the  order in which bugs should be fixed. To ensure that bugs to be fixed on priority are  given due priority, assigning correct priority to each bug is necessary. The following  are the recommended priority levels in the IBI specifications for Dynamics AX.  Urgent  0 : Fix before doing anything else.  High  1 : Fix immediately; this should be the most important issue   after priority 0. Normal  2 : Fix soon; the specific timing is based on customer or test cost   of workaround. Low  3 : Fix if time is available, nice to have.  [ 124 ]   Severity The severity should be assigned as per the impact of the issues from a technical  perspective. The following are the recommended severity levels in the IBI  specifications for Dynamics AX:  Chapter 8  Severity 1  Must Fix : These are fixes related to system crash or information  loss. A few examples of this category are application crash, product instability,  major test blockage, high security risk, broken builds, or failed build  verification tests, application security failures and trustworthy computing  failures, data loss, corruption, or misrepresentation, memory leaks, etc. Severity 2: This severity is assigned when a major part or the entire feature  is unusable, or a small part of the feature is unusable but the workaround  is very complex. This may also be a severity level where a bug can affect  customer or testing significantly. A few examples are:           A telephone number field  which it is mandatory to fill  can  accommodate only 5 characters while real-life phone number  at customer locations are 7 digits. Functionality to encrypt sensitive information such as  credit card numbers is missing.   Severity 3: This severity level should be assigned when a minor feature  problem exists and has workaround. The customer or test should not be  affected significantly due to the bug.  A field accepts more than two characters for ISD code, but  the ISD code for the customer's country is single digit. The  workaround may be to put 00X rather than X.  Severity 4: Very minor issues such as typo errors  without giving wrong  information , incorrect tab order, etc.  Some people are confused between severity and priority and often consider that a  bug of high priority is also of high severity, which is not true. For example:  The help file is missing for a newly added feature:   High Priority  a user cannot use the functionality as the help file is the only  way to know about the new feature .  Low severity  it is not a information loss or functionality missing; from a  technical perspective it is not so damaging . Interest calculation is wrong in the year 2100 due to incorrect leap year  calculation at the end of a century:   Low priority  Customer is not affected today .   High severity  the calendar algorithm may need a change .  [ 125 ]                                              Defect Management System  Classification for Security Bugs The security bugs are classified as per STRIDE and hence it is critical to have correct  categorization of bugs:   Spoofing: If a user pretends to be another entity or person. Other terms for  spoofing are impersonation, masquerading, or identity theft. Tampering: If there is an unauthorized modification of data by using  techniques such as SQL Injection. Other terms for it may be  data  integrity. Repudiation: If a user denies having performed an action, and there is  insufficient evidence to prove the contrary.  Information disclosure: If information is accessed by an unauthorized  person. Denial of service: If people misuse the functionality with an intention   of creating stressed conditions so that other real users cannot use the   system comfortably. Elevation of privilege: If a user gets more privileges than entitled. Attack surface reduction: If code access is reduced for users with least  privileged such as anonymous users.  The defect management tool must have an additional option 'Not a Security Bug' to  declare that an issue is not a security-related issue.  Root Cause Analysis for Security Bugs Root cause analysis must be carried out for all security bugs. Based on their origin,  security bugs could be classified in one of the following types:   Not a security bug. Buffer overrun or underrun: Occurs when the size of a variable is not large  enough to contain a given value and the memory buffer is overwritten with  extra data. Buffer overruns are one of the most common and damaging  security risks. While designing or coding ensure that variables declared have  sufficient size or precision to handle the maximum or minimum possible  values. A few types of buffer overruns are heap overruns, stack-based buffer  overruns, V-table and function pointer overwrites, and exception handler  overwrites. The buffer overrun may result in access violation, instability, and  code injection for malicious purposes.  [ 126 ]                              Chapter 8  Arithmetic error: Occurs when the limitations  any of the upper or lower  range boundaries  of a variable are exceeded. For example, an integer  overflow. There can be two kinds of arithmetic errors—over flow and under  flow. Over flow occurs when the value to be stored exceeds the upper limit  of a variable's storage capacity and under flow occurs when the value to be  stored is less than lower limit of a variable. Arithmetic errors may leads to  some more serious errors such as buffer over flow or buffer underflow. SQL Script injection: This is the process of adding SQL statements in user  input, which may be to bypass authorization, call built-in stored procedures,  and probe the database. SQL injection attack are possible when SQL  statements are dynamically built using user inputs; hackers can add a part of  SQL statement to the user input and hence the resulting SQL statement could  perform a malicious operation. Cross-site scripting: This attack occurs when a user input directly outputs  without checking its validity. For example, if a malicious JavaScript is  inputted in a discussion forum, this malicious JavaScript code is executed  at the client machine whenever a user opens that forum. Another example  could be stealing client-side cookies using a form tag in email. Cryptographic weakness: Occurs when a weak algorithm is used or keys are  not securely stored. Sometimes it occurs due to human engineering factors. Weak authentication: The authentication mechanism should be strong and  the user should not be able to bypass it through any means such as SQL  injections, canonicalization, etc.  Weak authorization or inappropriate access control list: The authorization  level should be set for every asset, precisely; it should be correctly set.  Ineffective secret hiding: This occurs when some secret information is  provided to a user. A few examples are error messages, exception   handling, etc. Unlimited resource consumption  DoS : Occurs when too many services  are provided to unauthorized users. For example it should be checked at an  early stage  rather than just checking before information display to the user   whether a user is authorized or not for the information before retrieving any  data from the database. DoS attacks can be of four types: CPU starvation,  memory starvation, resource starvation, and network starvation. This threat  should be considered when either user input is trusted more than required,  costly operations are done before checking authorization, or proper security  is not involved in security design. Incorrect No pathname: A file or path name can be encoded in many ways  so the incorrect path name may lead to canonicalization errors. Path name  with spaces, or special characters such as &, ?, or + should be avoided.  [ 127 ]                              Defect Management System  Canonicalization Erros: Occur when a security decision is based upon file  name and parsing error occurs while parsing a file name, URL, or device  name. This may result in an incorrect permission being applied by the  resources being accessed.  Others such as accidental breaches  e.g. wrong operation by user due to  inappropriate or missing error message, or poor security practices , directory  traversal, and unhandled exceptions or poor exception handling due to  which a user can get valuable information.  Importance Identification Using the  DREAD Model In order to take appropriate action on each security issue, its importance needs to  be identified. DREAD is a useful tool to calculate the importance of a security bug.  DREAD stands for:  Damage Potential: What will be the degree of the damage to the system? Reproducibility: Is it easy to produce the same attacks again and again? Exploitability: Is much effort or experiment required to make an attack? Affected Users: What will be the percentage of people affected by this threat? Discoverability: Can this attack be easily discovered?   A value from one to ten is assigned to each of the five DREAD components and then  the sum of the ratings is calculated for each security threat. This sum value indicates  the importance level of a security threat.  Based on the sum value in DREAD, the following actions could be taken for   each threat:  Take no action: If the DREAD value is very low. Convey everything to customer: If the DREAD value is very low. Disable or remove the feature: If the DREAD value is moderate to high and a  fix is very costly in comparison to ROI. Fix it: If the DREAD value is moderate to high and a fix is not so complex.  The defect management tool should be able to accept one of the above values as a  closing resolution.  [ 128 ]   Chapter 8  Defect Management Tool The defect management tool must support classification with proper levels for  categorizations. Besides this there are some more additional requirements for   a Defect Management Tool as prescribed by the IBI Specifications for the   Dynamics AX.   The defect management system must have the capability to register, track,  and report the following:                                               Bugs Issues Design change requests  The defect management tool must accept or generate the following  information for each bug:  Unique number  auto generated  Description of the bug Bug priority  four levels as mentioned above  Bug severity  four levels as mentioned above  A record of comments to show the how defect is handled  throughout its life Closing comments  The defect management tool should generate reports as per the different  classification criteria mentioned above as well as status. The defect management tool must generate reports for all open bugs  i.e.  bugs with status such as work in progress, under investigation, more  information required, waiting clarification from client, deferred, etc . It will  help to generate a report for all know bugs at any point of time. The defect management tool must accept additional information for security  related bugs. The defect management tool must take an action after finding   security-related issues:  Must fix: Issues such as write access violations, stack   overflow exceptions Must investigate: Large memory allocations, integer  overflows, custom exceptions, other system-level exceptions  that could lead to an exploitable crash  [ 129 ]   Defect Management System     The defect management tool must be able to record the cause of a bug and  the options must include following:  Not a security bug Buffer overrun or underrun Arithmetic error  for example, an integer overflow  SQL Script injection Directory traversal  Race condition Cross-site scripting Cryptographic weakness Weak authentication  Weak authorization or inappropriate access control list  Ineffective secret hiding Unlimited resource consumption  DoS   Incorrect no error messages Incorrect No pathname Canonicalization Other                                               The defect management tool should be able to accept one of the following  values as resolution:  Take no action Convey everything to the customer Disable or remove the feature Fix it  Defect Life Cycle The defect life cycle should be based upon the custom needs of the project and the  communication methodology used in the project. The closing category should have  ample options so that it can be easily recorded what the reason for closing of bug is.  The possible closed categories may include the following:         Not an Issue Could not be reproduced Requirement changed  [ 130 ]   Chapter 8                   Not related to this piece of code Verified Duplicated Not reproducible As designed Deferred Withdrawn No action required  Such a wide list of closed categories will help to identify how the closed issues  reached the closing stage.  Summary In this chapter we discussed what a bug is and how to classify it. We also discussed  other dimensions applicable to classify security-related bugs and the special  characteristics required in a defect management tool.   [ 131 ]    Dynamics AX Tools  Due to peculiarities involved in the customization process, most of the standard tools  available in the market cannot be utilized unless a great effort is made to adapt them  to the needs of Dynamics AX. Fortunately Dynamics AX offers a few useful tools:           A best-practice check tool for the analysis or scanning of code A compare tool for scanning changes in code A code profiler for code coverage analysis and performance analysis A benchmark kit for benchmark testing  Best-Practice Check Tool The Dynamics AX best-practice check tool can be used to check conformance of code  and objects with the best practices for Dynamics AX. This tool can be utilized in  three different ways at compilation time  only if Diagnostic level is set to Level 4 , at  check-in time, and manually at any time.  To set the diagnostics level to level 4, go to Tools  Options  Compiler and set the  value of Diagnostics level as Level 4. To invoke this tool manually, go to one or more node in AOT, and then:   1.  Right-click.  2.  Select Add-Ins. 3.  Select Check Best Practices.    Dynamics AX Tools  Double clicking on a Best Practice Deviation message will open the code editor.  These messages are:            Errors: Things that should definitely be fixed  shown in red in    best-practice tool output    Warnings: Things that you should strongly consider fixing  shown in   yellow in best-practice tool output    Information: Things that might be nice to know  shown in blue in    best-practice tool output   The category information can be controlled from the Best Practice Option form. This  form can be accessed from the tools menu. Click Options in the tools menu and then  click Best Practices. Select Warning level to set the type of error message you want to see in the compiler  output window. The compiler output window will have three options—Errors only,  Errors and warnings, and All. The three options are described in the following table:   Option Errors only Errors and warnings All  Error Yes Yes Yes  Warning No Yes Yes  Information No No Yes  The user can also control the display of some types of confirmation check results by  checking or unchecking the concerned options as listed in the following table.  Check Properties  Unique tree node names  in the AOT Object ID AOS Performance Trustworthy  Computing Used  Existence of referenced  application objects  Explanation To check all the properties for which the value expected is the  same as the default To check the unique node names for all nodes in AOT  To check if any Object ID is modified To check the forms for AOS optimization To check whether best practices for Trustworthy computing are  followed or not To check for unused elements such as variables, extended data  types, etc. To check the existence of referenced application objects  [ 134 ]   Check Use of discontinued  functionality Record and table ID  references Configuration keys Security keys Labels  Chapter 9  Explanation To check the use of discontinued functionality in the system  that the developer does not use the RecId or TableId   To check that the developer does not use the system data types in code To check the use of configuration keys To check the use of security keys To check the use of labels in a correct way. The following are the  principle checks:             Labels should be used for all user interface text. User interface text written in code must be written in  double quotes. Labels used for help  and not for user interface text   must end with a full stop. Help and labels must not be identical.  Analysis visibility  To check the visibility setting for the tables, fields, or views  The above-mentioned best-practice checks are applicable either to all the AOT  elements or at least to more than one AOT element. Following are some best-practice  checks that are applicable only to specific AOT elements as mentioned in the table.  Checks category Check Tables  Unique labels Use of indexes  Explanation To check that each table field has a unique label To check that indexing is chosen properly, i.e.:           To check tables having one index should  have that index as clustered index To check that the primary index is  defined if there is a unique index To check that the RecId index is not  used as clustered index  To check that two tables don't have delete  actions pointing to each other  To check if title fields have been declared To check the existence of the referenced   menu item To check that each field belongs to a field group  Delete actions  Declared title field Form reference  Fields belong to a  field group  [ 135 ]   Dynamics AX Tools  Checks category Check  Table collections  Classes  Abstract  Methods  Field name  Method name  conflict Number of fields in  a field group Analysis behavior  Currency   code fields Currency   date fields Check table  relations Relations  Runbase  implementations Missing member  function Constructors  Empty methods Date features  Privacy  Print and pause  Use of variables  Future reserved  words Single quoted text  Explanation To check for field name method name conflict  To check the number of fields in a field group  To check that AnalysisSelection or  TypicalRowCount property is set or not on all  the table or views where AnalysisVisibility  property is set To check currency code fields  To check date fields  To check table relations and correctness   of relations To check that the referenced tables exists in the  table collection To check that abstract classes are marked   as abstract To check dialog box implementation through  Runbase implementation To check classes for missing member functions   To check the implementation of   class constructors To check for empty methods To check for use of date features e.g. type  casting, today function, etc. To check how greater privacy level  public,  private, etc.  can be assigned, based on how it   is called To check the code for the presence of print   and pause statements, which are used   for debugging To check the declaration, use of variables,  conformance to naming conventions, and  unused variables To check for use of any future reserved words  for variable names To check for the use of text in single quotes  [ 136 ]   Chapter 9  Checks category Check Forms  Form size  Explanation To check that form size does not exceeds  1024*768 pixels  Disabling technique To check setup of form controlling    Control names Tabs  Documentation Perspectives  disabling technique To check the naming of controls To check that the form has correct tab pages and  their captions are correct To check the spellings of documentation To check that all analysis visible objects   are included   Please note that enabling or disabling any type of check from here will just affect  display of the results; but the conformance check will still be performed.  In certain circumstances we may need to hide some errors either from a piece of code  or from one or more type of best-practice deviations from the entire code. This can be  done in the following two ways:  The "BP Deviation documented" comment is a way to stop best-practice  warnings from some of piece of code. It should be noted that this will  still show the best practice deviation but not it as warning; it will show as  information. This comment is just like an ordinary comment so should be  written as follows:                  BP Deviation Documented        In the above method the disadvantage is that an error message is still  displayed as information i.e. only the severity is suppressed. Another  way to suppress the best-practice deviation completely is to use the  SysBPCheckIgnore Macro. The following is the process of using the  SysBPCheckIgnore Macro:  1.  Add the following line of code for each combination of error code and   AOT location C+=[[BP Error Code,  @”AOTLocation”]]       where BPErrorCode is the error code for the warning error as listed in  SysBPCheck macro, while AOTLocation is the location in AOT for the  object whose BP deviation is supposed to be suppressed.  2.  Compile SysBPCheck class. mpile SysBPCheck class. pile SysBPCheck class.  3.  Restart Dynamics AX.  [ 137 ]   Dynamics AX Tools  Compare Tool The Compare tool is one of the most useful tools for code review in Dynamics AX.  The Compare tool can be used for three distinct kinds of comparisons:           The same application object in two different layers Two versions of the same object  if version control is being used  Two different application objects Code in XPO being imported with the same objects in a layer of AOT  In each case, comparison results are shown in 'Comparison form'. the following table  explains the 'Comparison form'.   Symbol Icon Color Background Shaded box with a check mark Red and blue icon Black text  Red or blue icons or text  Shaded background  Light gray background  Explanation Differences exist in the child node of current node. Differences exist with in the current node. No difference exists between the two objects in the  current code line or property or control. The current code line, property, or control belongs to  only one of the objects. Differences exist between the two objects in the  current code line or property. The same code line appears in both objects, but in a  different position.  Type of Comparison The compare tool can be used in three different ways as mentioned earlier. Now we  will discuss all three ways to compare.  Same Application Object in Two Different Layers This is to compare objects that either do not exist in the reference layer or exist in  both layers but are different in the two layers. It should be noted that if reference  layer is below the  source layer, comparison  take place between the objects in the  source layer and objects in the reference layer as well as layers below the reference  layers. The following table explains terms used in the Graphical User Interface:  [ 138 ]   Chapter 9  GUI Term Project name  Source layer  Explanation The name of the project that will be created during the   compare-layers process This layer is used as a basis for the comparison.  Reference layer  As mentioned earlier the resulting project can never hold objects that  are not included in the source layer. The layer that is to be compared with the source layer.  'OLD SYS' can be selected as reference layer to learn what objects have  been changed in the new version.  Steps to compare same application Objects in two different layers:  1.  Click Tools  Development Tools  Version Update  Compare Layers. 2.  Enter the project name, select source and reference layers and then click OK. 3.  A project holding application objects that differ is now created. Go to the   project  the name of which you entered in previous step .  4.  Compare individual objects using the 'Compare' command on the 'Add-ins'   shortcut menu.  To see the name of the layer to which each object belongs, go to   Tools  Options  Development tab and then select show all layers.  5.  See the comparison results in 'Comparison Form'  Two Versions of the Same Object Comparing two version of the same object in the same layer is possible only when  the version control system is used.   1.  Go to AOT and right-click the object and then click Add-Ins  Compare. 2.  Select the two versions to be compared and then click Compare.  3.  Click Compare again. 4.  See the comparison results in Comparison Form.  [ 139 ]   Dynamics AX Tools Two Different Application Objects The following is the process to compare two different application objects in AOT:  1.  Select the objects in the AOT. ct the objects in the AOT. 2.  Right-click and click Add-Ins  Compare. 3.  Click Compare again. 4.  See the comparison results in  ison results in Comparison Form.  Code Profiler The code profiler is a tool that follows the history of code execution while it is  running. The code profiler can be used for the following:  Measuring execution time for each line, method, object, etc. Code coverage analysis during unit testing Identifying performance bottlenecks  The code profiler can not only be invoked through the graphical user interface, but  also through X++ code. We will not discuss invoking it through X++. Using the code  profiler consists of two stages:   Gathering data  Viewing analyzing data              Gathering Data To gather execution data, the code profiler needs to be invoked and then the user  should traverse through each feature function under review. The following steps  should be followed:  1.  Open the code profiler tool by going to Tools Development Tools  Code   Profiler.  2.  Limit the check depth by checking the Trace Depth Enabled checkbox and   then selecting the number of levels.  3.  Navigate in the application till the point where the test should start. 4.  Click Start in the code profiler window. 5.  Use the functionality under different conditions so that every line of code is   executed at least once.  [ 140 ]   6.  When all the functionality  to be tested  has been used, click the Stop button   in the code profiler window.  7.  Write a description  for reference  of the code profile in the Summary dialog.  Chapter 9  Do not select the Calculate line total checkbox.   8.  Click the OK button and it will start the second stage of viewing analyzing   data when 'Profiler runs' form opens to view data.  View Analyze Data The data view for a particular run may have different objectives such as performance  analysis, code coverage analysis, etc. The code profiler has four different forms to  view data in different formats.  Every form shows time count in Ticks. To calculate these data into any unit such as  milliseconds or seconds etc. multiply the data with 'Ticks second' available on the  'Profiler run' form.  Call Tree Form In this form lines are displayed in the same sequence in which they were executed,  with the first executed line at the top. This helps to understand the flow and various  triggers in a form. In this form system methods do not appear until and unless they  are called from the application.  Profile Lines Form  This form shows 'All executed' lines according to their execution time with the  highest execution time at the top. This form can also be used to view code coverage  for a given set of test cases.  Traverse Form In this form each method is shown in the sequence of execution time with the highest  execution time shown first  though the order can be changed . In addition to the  duration it shows how many times an object was called and percent duration of total  execution time. This information can be used to optimize the effort for performance  optimization or from the testing perspective, can be used to define the priority of  performance issues. This form is divided into three parts. The upper pane shows the   [ 141 ]   Dynamics AX Tools  methods and the lower part  again divided into two sections  shows the child and  parent calls for the method selected. To select a method, double-click on it and it will  show you child and parent calls in the lower section.  To limit the type of call shown the following buttons can be used:  Button  Profile line Setup  Type of calls Opens the profile lines form to show all lines of code that are executed. This has four items to limit the type of calls displayed None: No filtering, view all fields. Code hot spots: View only the Duration, Share – duration, Method calls,  and Share – method calls fields.  Database access: View only the Method calls, Share – method calls, and  Calculated SQL time fields.  Remote connection: View only the Method calls, Share – method calls,  and Calculated AOS time fields.  Totals Forms The Totals forms are used to display aggregated data. Various Totals forms can be  accessed from Tools  Development tools  Code profiler  Profiler runs  Totals. Line total form: Displays aggregated data about total amount of time spent on  executing each line of code for a code profiler run.  Method total form: Displays aggregated data about total amount of time spent on  executing each method for a code profiler run.  Object total form: Displays aggregated data about total amount of time spent on  executing each object for a code profiler run.  Following is a summary of the buttons available on each of the three forms:  Button name and Function  Profile lines: Opens Profile lines form Line total: Opens Line total form Method total: Opens Method total form  Line total  form Yes No No  Method total  form Yes Yes No  Object total  form No Yes Yes  [ 142 ]   Profile Summary Form This form is used to calculate the total execution time for each line of code, each  method, and each object for a code profiler run. This form is used when the  'Calculate line total' checkbox is cleared on the Code profiler form while creating a  run; else total calculation is automatically done.  Chapter 9  The code profiler tool will be soon replaced by 'Trace Parser' trace parser. 'Trace Parser' trace parser.  Dynamics AX Benchmark Toolkit The 'Dynamics AX Benchmark Toolkit' for performance testing is an external tool  supplied along with Microsoft Dynamics AX Resource Kit. It offers the following  distinct advantages in comparison to the benchmark tool in Axapta 3.0.          Greater functional coverage. Light-weight business connectors in comparison to Dynamics AX clients. 'Dynamics AX Benchmark Toolkit' is a managed assembly in C�. It has two  is a managed assembly in C�. It has two a managed assembly in C�. It has two  major libraries, i.e. The Programming Model Library and The Microsoft  Dynamics AX Wrapper Library. The first library is to provide a gateway  to access Dynamics AX through business connectors. The latter library   Microsoft Dynamics AX Wrapper  is to generate type-safe managed classes  to interface with Microsoft Dynamics AX. The prerequisite for learning  about how to use this tool is to know .NET and X++ so this tool is not being  discussed in this book.   Summary We discussed some Dynamics AX built-in tools, which may play a vital role in  making the testing process more efficient and effective. Dynamics AX also has a   Unit-test framework, which is beyond the scope of this book, as unit testing is  usually carried out by the development team itself.   [ 143 ]    A Access Control List.
