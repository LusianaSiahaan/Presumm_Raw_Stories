On the one hand, managers can now easily ﬁnd and store information, and on the other hand, this hyper-amount of data does not allow us to distinguish between “good” and “bad” information. Furthermore, the data and information stored in enterprise databases may be obsolete, inaccurate, irrelevant, or partial. In other words, companies do not ﬁnd it difﬁcult to acquire and store a huge “quantity” of data and information. Their problem instead is to obtain an adequate level of “quality” of data and information. The point is that the increased volume of data and information can undermine the capacity of companies to discern quality from non-quality data and information, and this difﬁculty is even more crucial when we consider that we are living in an information economy where data, information, and knowledge become extremely strategic for companies. Therefore, the quality of information deserves particular attention.  Although IT has played a key role in bringing about information overload and underload, possible solutions to these phenomena are still being sought in the IT ﬁeld. Integrated systems, data management systems, data warehousing, data min- ing, and knowledge discovery tools are some examples of IT solutions that com- panies are adopting to deal with information overload underload. One of the most effective solutions seems to be the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning  ERP  systems, which improve data quality, data integrity, and system integration. In addition to improving data quality and system integration, companies also aim at improving their capacity to perform data analysis. As a matter of fact, in order to pursue the objective of improving the quality of information, companies need to pay attention both to the quality of incoming data and to the capacity to analyze it and deliver the resulting information to the right person, at the right time. Therefore, Business Intelligence  BI  systems are another important solution that companies use to improve their data analysis and processing capabilities and to recognize and select relevant data for a more effective decision-making process.  vii   viii  Preface  This manuscript will examine, through an empirical analysis, the role played by ERP and BI systems in reducing or managing information overload underload and thus in improving the information quality perceived by the Italian manager. The research is based on the idea that the improvement of information systems, achievable by means of ERP and BI systems, may reduce or eliminate information overload underload. We also investigate whether the combined adoption of ERP and BI systems is more effective in dealing with information overload underload than would be the single adoption of ERP or BI systems. Furthermore, the research presented in this book examines the inﬂuence that ERP and BI systems may have on the features of information ﬂow—such as information processing capacity, communication and reporting, the frequency of meetings, and information sharing —and, in turn, the inﬂuence of information ﬂow features on information quality. The research was made possible by the ﬁnancial support of the Università degli  Studi Internazionali di Roma  UNINT .  This study is part of a larger project on accounting information systems.

Furthermore, the manuscript analyzes the effects of information ﬂow on the perceived information quality. The analysis was carried out through a survey on a sample of 300 managers who work for Italian listed or non-listed companies of varying size. The participants—Chief Information Ofﬁcers, Chief Technology Ofﬁcers, Chief Executive Ofﬁcers and Controllers—were randomly selected from the LinkedIn social network database, since some scholars have recently stressed the relevance and widespread use of this social media application. We received back 79 answers, with a 26% rate of response. A set of regression and t-test analyses was performed. The main practical implication of our research is that it helps managers understand the impacts an investment in ERP or BI systems could have on information management and on the decision-making process. Other practical implications pertain to the methodology used in our study: in fact, man- agers may conduct an internal survey similar to that used for this study to assess the pre-conditions for investing in ERP and or BI systems by  a  examining the information quality perceived by employees and managers,  b  analyzing the employees’ and managers’ perception of information overload underload, and  c  investigating the perception of employees and managers regarding the current IT.  1.1 A Brief Overview of the Book  Nowadays, Information Technology  IT  innovations, the advent of the Internet, and the ease of ﬁnding and sharing information are all elements that contribute to obtaining overwhelming amounts of data and information. The storage of terabytes of data and information is becoming commonplace  Abbott 2001 , and this huge volume of easily available information is only apparently a beneﬁt for companies. In fact, on the one hand, managers can now easily ﬁnd and store information, and    Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018 C. Caserio and S. Trucco, Enterprise Resource Planning and Business Intelligence Systems for Information Quality, Contributions to Management Science, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-3-319-77679-8_1  1   2  1  Introduction  on the other this hyper-amount of data does not allow us to distinguish between “good” and “bad” information. The literature shows that organizations have far more information than they can possibly use, and at the same time they do not have the information they would actually need  Abbott 2001; Eckerson 2002 . Furthermore, the data and information stored in enterprise databases may be obsolete, inaccurate, irrelevant, or partial. In other words, companies do not ﬁnd it difﬁcult to acquire and store a huge “quantity” of data and information. Their problem instead is to obtain an adequate level of “quality” of data and information  Al-Hakim 2007; Wang et al. 2005 . The point is that the increased volume of data and information can undermine the capacity of companies to discern quality from non-quality data and information, and this difﬁculty is even more crucial when we consider that we are living in an information economy where data, information and knowledge become extremely strategic for companies  Eckerson 2002 .  Therefore, information overload  and underload  deserves particular attention. Information overload arose in the 1970s as a consequence of the information age and its widespread use of organizational computing systems  Bettis-Outland 2012 . The initial studies on information overload underload recognized the lack of rele- vant information as one of the weaknesses of management information systems  Ackoff 1967 . Other important studies emphasized that information overload happens every time the quantity of information surpasses an individual’s infor- mation processing resources, whereas information underload occurs when man- agers receive less than the amount of information necessary for their job tasks  O’Reilly 1980 . More recent studies conﬁrm that information overload is still a critical issue affecting decision-making process in several business ﬁelds  Soucek and Moser 2010; Letsholo and Pretorius 2016; Ho and Tang 2001; Rodriguez et al. 2014 .  Although IT has played a key role in bringing about information overload and underload, possible solutions to these phenomena are still being sought in the IT ﬁeld. Integrated systems, data management systems, data warehousing, data mining and knowledge discovery tools are some examples of IT solutions that companies are adopting to deal with information overload underload.  One of the most effective solutions seems to be the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning  ERP  systems, which improve data quality, data integrity and system integration. As an example, Markus and Tanis  2000 , Rajagopal  2002  and Karimi et al.  2007  recognize the following beneﬁts from ERP systems:   1  ERPs eliminate multiple data entry and concomitant errors;  2  ERPs simplify data analysis;  3  ERPs improve data integration, since they allow for the management and  sharing of data related to products, services and business activities.  In addition to improving data quality and system integration, companies also aim at improving their capacity to perform data analysis. As a matter of fact, in order to pursue the objective of improving the quality of information, companies need to pay attention both to the quality of incoming data and to the capacity to analyze it   1.1 A Brief Overview of the Book  3  and deliver the resulting information to the right person, at the right time  Agarwal and Dhar 2014; Herschel and Jones 2005 . Therefore, Business Intelligence  BI  systems are another important solution that companies use to improve their data analysis and processing capabilities, and to recognize and select relevant data for a more effective decision-making process.  This manuscript will examine, through an empirical analysis, the role played by ERP and BI systems in reducing or managing information overload underload, and thus in improving the information quality perceived by the Italian manager. The research is based on the idea that the improvement of information systems, achievable by means of ERPs and BI systems, may reduce or eliminate information overload underload. We also investigate whether the combined adoption of ERP and BI systems is more effective in dealing with information overload underload than would be the single adoption of ERP or BI systems.  ERP and BI systems may play a crucial role in improving the quality of data management and analysis. The combined use of both ERP and BI systems is expected to be more effective than the single use of one of them.  Furthermore, the research presented in this book also examines the inﬂuence that ERP and BI systems may have on the features of information ﬂow—such as information processing capacity, communication and reporting, the frequency of meetings, and information sharing—and, in turn, the inﬂuence of information ﬂow features on information quality.  1.2 Theoretical Contributions of the Present Work  From a theoretical standpoint, the present work contributes to shedding some light on:  cid:129  The relationship between ERP and information overload underload and between ERP and features of information ﬂow. The empirical results of our research show that ERP systems do not affect the perception of information overload  underload. However, some effects of the implementation of ERP systems is recognizable in other items, which are indirectly connected to the quality of information. For example, empirical results show that respondents adopting ERP perceive higher data accuracy and system reliability and, in general, a higher information processing capacity than do respondents not adopting ERP. Furthermore, the results show that companies adopting ERP have a more structured reporting system, as information is more frequently communicated on a monthly or a 6-month basis, with respect to companies that do not adopt ERP. These perceptions, though probably not connected to the perception of information overload underload, indicate that the use of ERP has a positive impact on information system quality and information quality items. This supports that part of the literature which supports the idea that ERP improves data quality, information quality and information system quality in general   4  1  Introduction  this result   Bingi et al. 1999; Dell’Orco and Giordano 2003; Chapman and Kihn 2009; Scapens and Jazayeri 2003 .   cid:129  The relationship between BI and information overload underload and between BI and features of information ﬂow. Our results show that respondents adopting BI systems do not perceive a different level of information overload or under- load than do respondents who do not adopt BI systems. However, a more detailed analysis shows that managers of companies adopting BI systems per- ceive a higher data accuracy, a higher level of information processing capacity, and a more regular reporting system, based on a systematic monthly frequency. Furthermore, our empirical results also show that respondents adopting BI systems perceive a higher information quality with respect to respondents that do not adopt BI. Therefore, the higher data accuracy and information quality perceived by BI system adopters can be due to the improvements that BI brings to the entire data-information-decision cycle. Regarding the perception of respondents pertaining to the more regular reporting system, is probably an effect of the capacities of BI systems, well-recognized by the lit- erature, which consists in providing the right information at the right time to the right person  Burstein and Holsapple 2008 . A regular and systematic reporting system could be, in fact, the effect of an accurate reporting design process carried out before implementing a BI system. A successful BI implementation should require managers to deﬁne the features of the information and reports they will need, including the frequency with which they wish to receive them  Eckerson 2005; Foshay and Kuziemsky 2014; Nita 2015 . Moreover, respon- dents adopting BI perceive a better information processing capacity, due to the variety of opportunities provided by BI systems regarding data elaboration and information ﬂow  Boyer et al. 2010; Brien and Marakas 2009; da Costa and Cugnasca 2010; Smith et al. 2012; Spira 2011 .   cid:129  The relationship between the combined use of ERP and BI and information overload underload and between the combined use of ERP and BI and features of information ﬂow. The empirical results show that respondents adopting both an ERP and a BI system do not perceive higher or lower information overload or information underload than do the other respondents. This is partially aligned with the literature, which suggests that information problems, caused by a lack of systematic information collection and processing, make BI tasks more and more difﬁcult  Li et al. 2009 . In other words, this result suggests that in companies where information collection and processing are not appropriately managed from the beginning, the potential beneﬁts of BI systems are weakly perceived or not perceived at all. Interestingly, our results also show that respondents who have implemented both ERP and BI systems perceive a higher level of information processing capacity than do respondents who adopt only ERP or BI. Therefore, despite the fact managers do not perceive that ERP and BI improve information overload underload, they recognize that these systems improve the capacity of the company to process information. Our results are thus not fully supported by the literature, which suggests that the simultaneous use of ERP and BI systems should have more of an effect on the information   1.2 Theoretical Contributions of the Present Work  5  ﬂow features than would the single adoption of ERP or BI  Berthold et al. 2010; Chapman and Kihn 2009; Horvath 2001; Scheer and Habermann 2000 .   cid:129  The relationship between the information quality perceived by managers and features of information ﬂow. Our empirical evidence reveals the features which can affect the information quality perceived by managers. In particular, we found that information processing capacity and communication and reporting affect, in different ways, the perceived information quality.  1.3 Managerial Implications of the Present Work  Some implications for practitioners emerge from both the theoretical and empirical analyses.  The main practical implication of our research is that it helps managers to understand the impacts an investment in ERP or BI systems could have on infor- mation management and on the decision-making process. The results of our research show, in fact, that the use of ERP and BI systems have indirect effects on information overload and underload.  Our study may also have implications for managers operating in sectors char- acterized by high uncertainty, since the use of ERP and BI systems is a possible solution to deal with the ambiguity arising from information overload.  As a consequence, other managerial implications are related to the possibility of adopting ERP and BI systems to improve information ﬂow, increase information quality and support strategic decisions.  In addition, further useful insights are provided by our research from a theo- retical perspective: ﬁrst, managers could support their decisions to invest in BI based on the taxonomy of BI needs emerging from the literature and summarized in this study; second, the understanding of critical success factors for the implemen- tation of ERP and BI systems may help managers to develop an effective imple- mentation project; third, the acknowledgement of the effects of ERP and BI on information quality and on information overload and underload may support managers in selecting the system they need the most; fourth, the literature analysis presented in this study may help managers in evaluating the opportunity to maintain their legacy systems and to invest in ERP or in Extended-ERP and or in BI systems, according to their particular needs, characteristics and objectives.  Other practical implications derive from the methodology used in our study: in fact, managers may conduct an internal survey similar to that used for this study in order to assess the pre-conditions for investing in ERP and or in BI systems:  a  by examining the information quality and the information system quality perceived by employees and managers;  b  by analyzing the employees’ and managers’ per- ceptions of information overload underload;  c  by investigating the perception of employees and managers regarding the appropriateness of information provided by the present systems.   6  1  Introduction  1.4 Structure of the Book  The remainder of the book is divided into 5 chapters:  cid:129  Chapter 2 deals with the characteristics of ERP systems and their effects on  information quality, according to the literature;   cid:129  Chapter 3 refers to BI systems and to the most important aspects which make  these systems crucial for information quality and for companies’ support;   cid:129  Chapter 4 presents the research design and the analysis of ERP and BI systems  with respect to information quality;   cid:129  Chapter 5 shows the research methodology applied, the empirical analysis and  the results obtained;   cid:129  Chapter 6 discusses the results and presents the conclusions of the study.  The conceptual path underlying the structure of the book is to ﬁrst examine the characteristics and the usefulness of ERP and BI systems, with the aim of analyzing their potential capacities to reduce information overload and underload and to improve information quality. Subsequently, the empirical analysis investigates whether and how the ERP and BI systems play a role in improving the information quality for a sample of Italian managers.  Following this path, Chap. 2 analyzes the academic literature on ERP, with regard to the evolution of ERP systems, which started in the 1960s when the ﬁrst reorder point systems were implemented by the companies. Material Requirements Planning  MRP  and Manufacturing Requirements Planning  MRP II  represent the next phase in this evolution  Ganesh et al. 2014 . In the ‘90s, ERP was born, and from that year to the present the evolution of ERP has not stopped: Extended ERP  or ERP II  was developed around the year 2000 and ERP systems based on cloud computing technologies have been deployed beginning in the 2010s  Chaudhary 2017; Rashid et al. 2002 . The evolution of ERP is useful for understanding how ERP systems have supported, over time, information systems quality and infor- mation quality. In fact, Chap. 2 also shows that ERP systems can positively impact information quality in two main ways: ﬁrst, they are able to directly impact the quality of information by improving data management and eliminating  or dra- matically reducing  information redundancy  Sumner 2013 ; second, ERP systems are also beneﬁcial to many other characteristics of information systems  Karimi et al. 2007; Uwizeyemungu and Raymond 2005; Xu et al. 2002 , which, indirectly, impacts the quality of information. Obviously, to obtain these beneﬁts, it is nec- essary to implement an effective ERP system by following the critical success factors suggested by the literature. Chapter 2 proposes a list of success factors based on the main literature, regarding both ERP implementation  Finney and Corbett 2007; Somers and Nelson 2004  and ERP-post implementation  Nicolaou 2004; Zhu et al. 2010 . Finally, Chap. 2 focuses on the managerial role of the Chief Information Ofﬁcer, who is responsible for the IT system and the entire information ﬂow within a ﬁrm.   1.4 Structure of the Book  7  Chapter 3 deals with BI systems, trying to follow the complete path of BI implementation and maintenance, based on the academic literature. Speciﬁcally, this chapter ﬁrst summarizes the main needs which may lead companies to implement a BI system; second, it proposes a set of critical success factors which allow for the implementation of an effective BI system that can satisfy companies’ needs; third, it presents the main maturity models of BI systems by paying par- ticular attention to the life cycle of BI systems and the need to keep them up do date. Regarding the ﬁrst part of the chapter, the summarization of companies’ needs for BI includes management information system needs  Elbashir et al. 2008; Levinson 1994; Peters et al. 2016; Rud 2009; Sudarsanam 2003 , strategic planning needs  Alkhafaji 2011; Giesen et al. 2010; Laszlo and Laugel 2000; Malmi and Brown 2008; Yeoh and Popovič 2016 , commercial and marketing needs  Chau and Xu 2012; He et al. 2013; Olszak 2016; Park et al. 2012 , regulation needs  Rutter et al. 2007; Trill 1993; Williams 1993; Wingate 2016; Yeoh and Popovič 2016  and fraud detection needs  Bell and Carcello 2000; Dorronsoro et al. 1997; Fanning and Cogger 1998; Kotsiantis et al. 2006; Ngai et al. 2011 . Each category of company needs is thoroughly analyzed according to the literature and eventually broken down into sub-needs. The second part of this chapter pertains to the critical success factors of BI implementation; several authors have proposed a different set of factors, which allows companies to maximize the effectiveness of BI system implementation. This part of the chapter takes into account the main critical success factor studies in the literature and shows the key aspects that a company should consider for effective BI implementation  Hawking and Sellitto 2010; Vosburg and Kumar 2001; Yeoh and Koronios 2010; Yeoh and Popovič 2016 . Included among these critical success factors are the ERP systems dealt with in Chap. 2. In addition to the critical success factors for BI implementation, the literature also recommends aligning the evolution of BI systems with that of business, considering the life-cycle of BI models as a driver which affects critical success factors. In this regard, the third part of the chapter refers to the BI maturity models  Hribar Rajterič 2010; Moss and Atre 2003; Tan et al. 2011; Watson 2010 .  Chapter 4 presents the research design and the research questions of our empirical research. In particular, we analyze the possible relationships between ERP, BI and information overload underload. Furthermore, we investigate whether ERP and BI systems may also affect information quality by inﬂuencing the infor- mation ﬂow features  i.e., information processing capacity, communication and reporting, information sharing and frequency of meetings . In fact, the potentialities of ERP and BI systems may positively contribute to increasing information quality  and information system quality  by means of an improved management of infor- mation ﬂow. This quality improvement may indirectly support management in counteracting, or at least reducing, the information overload underload. Finally, we investigate the role played by the features of information ﬂow in improving the information quality perceived by managers. After presenting the research design, the chapter describes the sample selection, the data collection, the variable mea- surement and the factor analysis carried out on the research variables.   8  1  Introduction  Chapter 5 pertains to the results of the empirical research. This chapter presents the methodology applied to the research, the analyses carried out and the main results of the research. Empirical results from the entire datasets of respondents demonstrate that respondents adopting an ERP or a BI system—or both an ERP and a BI system—do not perceive higher or lower information overload or information underload. Furthermore, respondents who have implemented an ERP system per- ceive a higher level of information processing capacity, a higher level of com- munication and reporting, and a higher level of frequency of meetings than do respondents who have not implemented an ERP. Respondents who have imple- mented a BI perceive a higher level of information processing capacity than do respondents who have not implemented a BI. Respondents who have implemented both ERP and BI systems perceive a higher level of information processing capacity than do respondents who have not implemented an ERP or a BI system. Results from the regression analysis show that information processing capacity has a positive effect on the information quality perceived by managers; therefore, if the information processing capacity increases, the information quality perceived by respondents increases as well. Furthermore, results show that communication and reporting have a negative effect on the information quality perceived by respon- dents; as a result, if the communication and reporting increases, the information quality decreases.  Chapter 6 presents a discussion about the results of the theoretical and empirical analysis conducted in the manuscript. The chapter also discusses the limitations of the research and suggests further developments.  References  Abbott J  2001  Data data everywhere–and not a byte of use?

These systems can collect and integrate data using a common database, thereby representing a good basis for the overall accounting process. This chapter starts with an analysis of the literature on ERP, with a particular focus on the evolution of ERP systems. The evolution of ERP is, in fact, useful in understanding how ERP systems may affect, over time, the quality of information systems and of information. The chapter also shows that ERP systems can positively impact information quality in two main ways: ﬁrst, they can directly impact the quality of information by improving data management; and second, ERP systems are also beneﬁcial to many other features of information systems, which indirectly impacts the quality of information. To obtain these beneﬁts, it is necessary to implement an effective ERP system by following the critical success factors suggested by the literature. Therefore, the chapter also proposes a list of success factors based on the main literature, regarding both ERP implementation and ERP post-implementation. Finally, the chapter focuses on the managerial role of the Chief Information Ofﬁcer, who is responsible for the IT system and the entire information ﬂow within a ﬁrm.  2.1  Introduction  The most advanced integrated Information Technology  IT  tools are represented by Enterprise Resource Planning systems  ERP 1  Granlund and Malmi 2002 . These systems are able to collect and integrate data using a common database, and thus  1ERP could be deﬁned as: “enterprise wide packages that tightly integrate business functions into a single system with a shared database”  Lee and Lee 2000; Quattrone and Hopper 2001; Newell et al. 2003; Grabski et al. 2011 . In a similar vein, Kumar and Hillegersberg deﬁned ERP as: “information systems packages that integrate information and information-based processes within and across functional areas in an organization.” Both the aforementioned deﬁnitions of ERP underline the relevance of integrated information across different functional areas of an organi- zation  Kumar and van Hillegersberg 2000 .    Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018 C. Caserio and S. Trucco, Enterprise Resource Planning and Business Intelligence Systems for Information Quality, Contributions to Management Science, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-3-319-77679-8_2  13   14  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  they represent a good basis for the overall accounting process  Chapman and Kihn 2009 .  For their potential beneﬁts, ERPs became popular during the ‘90s in ﬁrms all over the world  Arnold 2006; Sutton 2006 . Before that date, companies usually used different information systems for each functional area within the organization, which did not allow for an easy and timely exchange of information among managers. This also discouraged the comparability of accounting information  Rom and Rohde 2007 . To solve these problems and to exploit the potentialities of the new Information System Integration  ISI , ERPs were introduced especially to facilitate the exchange of information among managers and, in general, to foster internal relationships  Davenport 1998a . Therefore, their use is generally justiﬁed by the need to share consistent information across different functional areas of a company  Robey et al. 2002 .  ERP systems play a crucial role in integrating the several business functions and in improving the quality of data and, thus, of information. Therefore, this chapter has been divided into seven sections: Sect. 2.2 presents the evolution of ERP systems, from the ﬁrst examples of inventory control systems  1960s  to the recent cloud ERP  2010s ; Sect. 2.3 deals with the supporting role of ERP for information quality; Sects. 2.4 and 2.5 show the Critical Success Factors  CSFs  for ERP implementation and post-implementation, respectively; Sect. 2.6 highlights the advantages and disadvantages of ERP systems; Sect. 2.7 illustrates the role of ERP in aligning management accounting information with ﬁnancial accounting infor- mation; and Sect. 2.8 shows the role of the Chief Information Ofﬁcer  CIO .  2.2 The Evolution of ERP Systems   MRP   Planning  companies  in Material Requirements  Enterprise Resource Planning  ERP  systems have evolved from software which supported and Manufacturing Resource Planning  MRP II . In the ‘60s, only reorder point systems were developed to support managers in forecasting inventory demand on the basis of historical data. Attempts to integrate information systems started years before the birth of ERP; MRP and MRP II, in fact, represent two examples of information systems integration. MRP was born in the’70s and supported managers in pro- duction planning and inventory control through a master production schedule and a bill of materials. Its main aim was to ensure the availability of materials needed for production, in order to avoid the interruption of the production processes  Sumner 2013 . The objectives of MRP are summarized by Ganesh et al. as follows  Ganesh et al. 2014 :  cid:129  to ensure the availability of required input material for production;  cid:129  to make sure that required products are made from input material and provided  to the customer;   cid:129  to maintain an optimal level of investors;   2.2 The Evolution of ERP Systems  15   cid:129  to synchronize manufacturing activities with delivery schedules;  cid:129  to synchronize purchasing activities with manufacturing activities.  MRP evolved after about ten years into MRP II, which incorporated the ﬁnancial accounting system, sales planning functions and customer order processing  Somers and Nelson 2003 . MRP II resolved many of the problems of MRP, which were mainly due to the latter’s incapacity to manage complex manufacturing business processes  Ganesh et al. 2014 . The main difference between MRP and MRP II is that the former is a stand-alone software, whereas MRP II is an initial example of an enterprise-level system aimed at avoiding data duplication by promoting data integrity and forecast accuracy through customer feedback.  By the ‘90s, the ﬁrst ERP systems were developed with the aim of integrating the main business functions and of aligning the business processes to the ERP software  Brown et al. 2003 . For the ﬁrst time, ERP systems made it possible to generate a seamless ﬂow of information throughout the company, satisfying not only the needs of external customers but also those of internal customers  that is, information users ; by doing so, it improved the effectiveness and the timeliness of the decision-making process  Ross et al. 2003; Ganesh et al. 2014 .  From the ‘90s on, vendors added further modules and functions to the basic ERP modules, thus laying the bases for the “Extended ERPs”, or ERP II  Rashid et al. 2002 . By the 2000s, this “extended version” of ERP was made possible also by the proliferation of the Internet  Lawton 2000 , which allowed the integration of ERP with other external business modules, such as CRM  Customer Relationship Management , SCM  Supply Chain Management , APS  Advanced Planning and Scheduling , BI  Business Intelligence , and e-business capabilities  Rashid et al. 2002 . The extensions of ERP to CRM and SCM allowed for the effective man- agement of the relationships among organizations, suppliers and customers, from the procurement of materials to the delivery of the products, thereby aligning the supply system with customer demand.  Thus, the evolution from ERP to ERP II has been driven by new business requirements and new information technologies. The latter do not necessarily represent an invention of ERP vendors but arise from the market and consist of single components, such as application frameworks, databases, Decision Support Systems  DSS , which, once incorporated into the enterprise system, increase considerably the business beneﬁts  Møller 2005 . BI and business analytics are other examples of IT tools—namely, DSS tools—which have become even more integrated with the ERP system, as they use ERP data for supporting managers’ decisions. In addition, the eXtended Mark-up Language  XML  has been gradually implemented in the ERP infrastructures  Møller 2005 .  As some studies suggest, ERP II provides beneﬁts to the company only when the technology available on the market is well integrated in the enterprise system; hence, it is not sufﬁcient that the technology exists; it also has to be effectively embedded in the information system  Akkermans et al. 2003; Weston 2003 . In this regard, the deﬁnition of ERP II provided by the Gartner Research Group in 2000 states that the extended ERP  or ERP II  is a business strategy and a set of industry   16  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  domain-speciﬁc applications which create value for customers and shareholders through collaborative operational and ﬁnancial processes  Oliver 1999 .  since resources are better managed, and  b  ERP II allows  A study based on a survey shows that:  a  ERP II increases all the beneﬁts of the ERP, decision-making process to be supported even more effectively than would be the case with a non-extended ERP, as the resources of the whole supply chain are made available  Wheller 2004 .  The innovations explained so far mainly regard the need for data and informa- tion quality, the integration of ERP with other applications, and the improvement of the decision-making process. However, more recently, technology has provided another innovation for managing ERP, which consists in purchasing the system as a cloud computing service.  Cloud computing is a model of computing which provides access to a shared set of IT resources by means of the Internet. These resources consist in computer processing, storage, software, and other services provided in virtualization and accessible on the basis of an as-needed logic, from any device connected to the Internet and from any location  Laudon and Laudon 2015 .  Cloud computing technology is characterised by the following essential features   Mell et al. 2011 :  cid:129  on-demand self-service: consumers can obtain services as needed, automatically  and on their own;  dard Internet device;   cid:129  ubiquitous network access: cloud resources can be accessed through any stan-   cid:129  location-independent resource pooling: computing resources are assigned to multiple users, according to their demand. Users do not know where the com- puting resources are located;   cid:129  rapid elasticity: computing resources are rapidly adapted to meet changing user   cid:129  measured service: cloud resource fees are proportional  to the amount of  demand;  resources used.  Cloud computing consists of three different types of services: Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS , Platform as a Service  PaaS  and Software as a Service  SaaS , and it can be private, public and hybrid  Elragal and El Kommos 2012 .  Cloud ERP belongs to the SaaS category and allows companies to obtain ERP services in a cloud environment. The Internet has made it possible to introduce in the company’s value chain many applications, which are not necessarily owned by the ERP vendors. Applications, in fact, reside on web servers to which anyone on the intranet has access using a connected device  from personal computers to smartphones or tablets . Following this logic, access to the system and to the information does not imply extra costs, and anyone who needs information can obtain it with ease. This architecture has advantages also in extending ERP, as it easily allows for a selective access of suppliers and customers by means of extranets   2.2 The Evolution of ERP Systems  17  Table 2.1 Evolution of ERP  Source authors’ presentation   2010s 2000s 1990s 1980s 1970s 1960s  Cloud ERP Extended ERP ERP MRP II MRP Reorder point systems and inventory control  or the public Internet  Chaudhary 2017 . Scalability, easy upgrades and mobile access are consequent advantages of this architecture.  Regarding the differences between ERP in cloud and ERP on-premises, some studies show that cloud ERP requires no capital expenditure and no maintenance costs, as opposed to on-premises ERP; furthermore, the cloud solution is more ﬂexible and more easily accessible  Ramasamy and Periasamy 2017 .  The disadvantages and concerns regarding cloud ERP are mainly related to:  1  data security  including privacy issues  and  2  integration. In terms of data security, business data is likely to be accessed from any smartphone or device, which potentially compromises data security  Chao Peng and Baptista Nunes 2009 . Nevertheless, in this regard data security is completely controlled by the vendor, as the company only uses the services but does not own the servers where data is stored, and it has no control over who may access their business data  from the vendor side   Peng and Gala 2014 . In many cases, the company does not even know where servers are geographically located and how they are protected; this lack of transparency may introduce further data privacy concerns. For these reasons, Service Level Agreements have a crucial role in deﬁning all the conditions, guar- antees, actions and remedies between vendor and customer  Lenart 2011 .  Regarding the second item, integration, it is quite difﬁcult both for companies and for vendors to customise a cloud ERP and to integrate it with other applications. For their part, companies have limited control over the cloud and do not have sufﬁcient freedom and rights to personalize a cloud ERP, whereas vendors, in trying to make integrations, would have to face the diversity of platforms and technologies used for developing applications. As a result, until now it has not been feasible for vendors to customise the ERP package and to provide a seamless integration between the system and the applications purchased by different client companies  Peng and Gala 2014 .  Table 2.1 summarizes the evolution of ERP over the years, showing how rapidly information systems innovation is advancing. In fact, over about 50 years, tech- nology and other drivers such as globalisation, hyper-competition and market changes have dramatically changed companies’ needs with regard to the integration of information systems, data storage and elaboration, and decision-making support.   18  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  2.3  Information Quality and ERP  The attention paid to information systems quality has gradually increased over time, given the importance of information systems in providing information to man- agement. From data acquisition and elaboration to the communication of infor- mation, several components are involved, since the information system consists of a set of technical resources, data, people and procedures which interact to produce information  Kroenke and Boyle 2016  and to generate knowledge  Wijnhoven 2009 . The deﬁnitions of information systems make it clearly understood that they are composed of several dimensions. Therefore, the quality of information systems needs to be assessed through a multidimensional measure, or through frameworks which take into account the whole set of components  DeLone and McLean 1992 . According to some studies, it is important that managers identify the most critical aspects of information system quality that can affect the business  Gorla et al. 2010 .  The literature provides numerous studies aimed at analyzing how the quality of information systems could be obtained and measured under different perspectives and using different methods. The initial studies focused attention mainly on user satisfaction and system use  Lucas 1978; Ginzberg 1981; Hopelain 1982; Srinivasan 1985 . Following the idea that productivity in the computer context is related to the sense of satisfaction in using the computer services, some studies measured user satisfaction through a list of factors identiﬁed through a review of the literature  Bailey and Pearson 1983; King and Epstein 1983 , while others focused on the users’ attitude towards the changes introduced by a system—speciﬁcally, by DSS—to the work environment  Barki and Huff 1985 . Barki and Huff discovered that satisfaction is higher when DSSs bring changes to the work environment as opposed to when they do not result in substantial changes. Later studies examined service quality as a driver for information system quality; service quality refers to the fact that computer users are satisﬁed only if their expectations meet their per- ception of the quality they are getting  Pitt et al. 1995 ; the concept is thus very similar to that of user satisfaction.  Another study, based on an extensive survey conducted on a sample of 465 data warehouse users from seven companies, developed a model based on nine deter- minants of quality in an IT environment, four focused on the output of the system  i.e., the information quality , and ﬁve addressed to the information processing system needed to produce the output  i.e., the system quality   Nelson et al. 2005 . It is interesting to note that, according to the authors, information quality—con- sisting in the accuracy, completeness, currency and format of information—has a role in explaining information system quality—consisting in the signiﬁcant accessibility of the system, its reliability, response time, ﬂexibility and integration; these nine determinants are also predictive of the general information and system quality in data warehouse contexts.  Similarly, other studies identiﬁed the characteristics that give high quality to an information system. The literature review conducted by De Lone and McLean   2.3 Information Quality and ERP  19   1992  identiﬁed six factors considered critical for information system quality:  a  system quality, intended as the information processing system itself;  b  infor- mation quality, that is, accuracy, timeliness, reliability, completeness, relevance, precision and currency;  c  information use;  d  user satisfaction;  e  individual impact;  f  organizational impact. After about 20 years, De Lone and McLean updated their study, proposing other determinants that can affect information sys- tem success, divided into four categories: task, user, project, organization  Petter et al. 2013 .  As the more recent literature shows, there is no single determinant which can, on its own, explain the quality or the success of the information system; instead, it is necessary to include variables pertaining to the several aspects characterizing information systems, such as hardware and software quality, service quality, information quality, communication quality, while also considering that different, or more speciﬁc needs can arise depending on the business and on the evolution of technology  Xu et al. 2013; Bessa et al. 2016 .  Because information systems produce information and knowledge starting from data and using processing capabilities, the quality of information is related to the quality of the entire data elaboration process: if the information system allows companies to acquire and store high quality data  with the support of high quality hardware , then the processing system will generate high quality information  with the support of high quality software . This, in turn, will effectively support the decision-making process, providing a high service quality. These considerations are recognizable in a wide stream of studies on the role of data and information in improving the quality of information systems  Redman and Blanton 1997; Kahn et al. 2002; Pipino et al. 2002; Xu et al. 2002; Madnick et al. 2009 . Studies on the impact of data and information quality have been carried out to promote positive impacts and provide disincentives to negative ones. Poor data quality, in fact, could make the retrieval of business records more difﬁcult  Mikkelsen and Aasly 2005 , thereby not allowing the right information to be provided to the right stakeholder. This misalignment could be even more critical in the performance management ﬁeld: as underlined by Redman  Redman 1998 , poor data quality can compromise the achievement of strategic and tactical objectives. Other studies demonstrate that the quality of the decision-making process depends on the quality of data produced by the information system  Fisher et al. 2003; Calvasina et al. 2009; Caserio 2011  and on the coherence between data architecture and business architecture  Vasile and Mirela 2008 . Studies on data quality also involve the Enterprise Architecture and the IT governance frameworks, both aimed at aligning the information systems with the business objectives on a strategic level  Schekkerman 2004; Weill and Ross 2004; Caserio 2017 . This is evidence of how important data and information quality have become, and it explains why companies are investing in IT and information systems solutions such as ERP and BI systems. The following sections focus on these issues, in particular on the role that, according to the literature, ERP systems could play in information quality.   20  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  2.3.1  Information Quality  In the ﬁeld of Management Information Systems, information quality and infor- mation systems quality are still the most discussed topics. The literature provides different interpretations of information quality, recognizing that information quality could be intrinsic, contextual, representational, and related to accessibility  Lee et al. 2002; Zmud 1978; Ballou and Pazer 1985; DeLone and McLean 1992; Goodhue 1995; Wand and Wang 1996; Wang and Strong 1996; Jarke and Vassiliou 1997 . Intrinsic information quality pertains to the accuracy, objectivity and precision of information; this interpretation derives from the initial theoretical grounds behind Gorry and Scott Morton’s framework on the accuracy of information for structured problems  Gorry and Scott Morton 1971a .  The contextual characteristic of information quality refers to the capacity of information to be relevant, reliable and timely, capable of adding value, useful and complete. This interpretation refers to information being available in the right amount, sufﬁcient and informative, and able to create value for the decision-making process.  The representational characteristic of information quality is related to the capacity of the information to be understood and effectively implemented in the decision-making process. Information must be understandable, concise, clear and meaningful; in other words, it has to be able to represent the problem to which it refers.  Regarding information accessibility, computer systems must permit an easy and  secure access to the information.  According to other studies, information quality can be deﬁned as the coherence of information with respect to the speciﬁcations of the product or the service to which it refers and as the capacity to satisfy  or to exceed  consumer expectations  Zeithaml et al. 1990; Reeves and Bednar 1994; Kahn et al. 2002 . Based on this interpretation, high-quality information provides an accurate representation and meets the requirements of the ﬁnal user. Naturally, the coherence and the usefulness of information also depend on the initial data quality  Piattini et al. 2012 .  According to the literature, the quality of information depends on several attri- butes, divided into three main dimensions  Marchi 1993; O’Brien and Marakas 2006 :  cid:129  time: the information must be timely, and thus provided when it is needed; it has to be up-to-date, provided with the needed frequency, and can refer to the past, present or future;   cid:129  content: the information must be accurate, without errors, relevant, complete, concise; it must also have a scope and be useful in revealing the performance obtained;  the information must be clear, with the proper detail, ordered in a sequence as needed, composed of text, images, maps, graphics, etc., as required by the user in a digital or a printed paper version.   cid:129  form:   2.3 Information Quality and ERP  21  Information quality matters also for economic reasons, as both quality infor- mation and non-quality information have a cost. The costs of non-quality infor- mation involve, ﬁrst of all, a waste of time for people trying to ﬁnd the most appropriate information for their needs and to make the most reliable interpretation of inaccurate information. In addition, inaccurate information may cause several problems for the business activities depending on the type of error or inaccuracy of information  which could regard clients, orders, suppliers, internal processes, etc. , which results in costs. Moreover, data correction, the recovery of process failure, backup, recovery and other similar activities lead to the consumption of more computing resources than would be necessary if information were accurate. Similarly, because of non-quality information, redundant controls on data and information will need to be activated in order to prevent errors from negatively affecting the results  English 2002 .  2.3.2 ERP System for Information Quality  The implementation of an ERP, when critical success factors are respected  see Sect. 2.4 , has many implications for the information system. As a matter of fact, ERP is deﬁned by the literature as an information system itself  Sheu et al. 2003; Li and Olorunniwo 2008; Parthasarathy 2012; Esendemirli et al. 2015 . The greatest beneﬁt of ERP implementation is the reduction of business process complexity, since ERP aims at integrating business functions, data and processes along the value chain  Broadbent et al. 1999; Karimi et al. 2007 . In most cases, a successful ERP implementation requires a preventive Business Process Reengineering  BPR   Broadbent et al. 1999; Holland and Light 1999; Palaniswamy and Frank 2000; Fui-Hoon Nah et al. 2001  which aims at revising and optimizing the busi- ness processes. BPR developed in companies with a high business process com- plexity has more of an impact and is more expensive because of the difﬁculty in carrying out standardization  Rosenkranz et al. 2010; Schäfermeyer et al. 2012 . In this regard, Karimi et al. observe that “the higher a ﬁrm’s business process com- plexity, the higher the radicalness of its ERP implementation as a result of its potential to enable fundamental and radical changes in the ﬁrm’s business pro- cesses and their outcomes”  Karimi et al. 2007: 107 . We can consequently deduce that the higher the business process complexity, the higher the business impact  and risk of failure  of ERP implementation. In fact, the literature conﬁrms that the beneﬁts of ERP for information systems can depend on the quality of BPR  Bingi et al. 1999  and that one of the motivations that lead companies to implement an ERP is to obtain business process standardization  Al-Mashari et al. 2003 . From an opposing viewpoint, the literature also shows that a more impactful BPR may engender ERP dissatisfaction  Scheer and Habermann 2000 .  In addition to business process complexity, organizational factors play a critical role in examining the beneﬁts of ERP for information systems. Employees are a component of information systems, as well as being the end users of ERP; thus, to   22  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  obtain information system beneﬁts from an ERP implementation, people should accept the ERP and recognize its usefulness and support for their tasks. Therefore, as suggested by many authors, ERP beneﬁts information systems when top man- agement provides its support  Ein-Dor and Segev 1978; Grover et al. 1995; Grover and Segars 1996  and mediates between technology and business requirements, resolving eventual conﬂicts of interest among stakeholders  Grover et al. 1995 . Furthermore, the alignment between the ERP and the organizational objectives and needs is a critical condition that enables the ERP to improve the information system  Cline and Guynes 2001; Gefen and Ragowsky 2005 .  Along with business process complexity and organizational factors, another beneﬁt that the ERP can bring to the information system is the improvement in information quality. Given the importance recognized by companies and scholars of the quality of information, the attention paid to the circumstances that may improve information quality has gradually increased. Moreover, the huge amount of data and information that companies need to manage has increased the attention on solutions which could improve the quality of the information system.  ERP systems directly and indirectly support information quality: for example, they lead to the integrity of the system and permit users to insert data only once  Xu et al. 2002; Uwizeyemungu and Raymond 2005 .  The literature conﬁrms that companies implement ERP systems in order to resolve information problems related to the legacy systems; in fact, poor produc- tivity and performance are connected to the poor quality of information, speciﬁcally to the fragmentation of information  Davenport 1998b; Rajagopal 2002 .  ERP systems reduce data integration problems as follows  Markus and Tanis  2000a; Rajagopal 2002; Karimi et al. 2007 :   1  by eliminating multiple data entry and concomitant errors;  2  by simplifying the data analysis;  3  by managing, integrating and sharing data related to products, services and  business activities that create value.  Data integration improvement allows information to be consistent, thus ensuring that two  or more  separate systems do not generate two  or more  different versions of the same information. In other words, data integration allows each decision maker in the company, and in each subsidiary, to receive the same information; as a result, the decision-making process is faster  Shanks et al. 2003  and managers can exchange views on problems and business issues, even when the subsidiaries are located at a great distance.  As conﬁrmation of this, the relational database on which ERP systems are built makes information representative throughout the company, which is even more perceived when a company migrates from legacy systems to an ERP system  Xu et al. 2002 . In fact, legacy systems are built on separate subsystems, and thus the same data is located in several sources, thereby generating problems of information inconsistency. The resulting lack of integration makes it difﬁcult for a subsystem to   2.3 Information Quality and ERP  23  access data stored in another subsystem and makes the communication between different subsystems very problematic  Xu et al. 2002 .  Literature shows several ERP beneﬁts to the information system, wisely sum- marized by  Sumner 2013 , who recognizes that ERP:  a  allows companies to move from a stand-alone to an integrated system solution;  b  makes possible a better internal coordination, particularly among the business functions;  c  improves the integration of database;  d  allows a more effective maintenance;  e  promotes common interfaces across the company’s systems;  f  makes information consistent and available in real-time;  g  introduces a client-server model, more effective than legacy systems;  h  aligns business processes with an information model;  i  opti- mizes the number of applications required for managing business functions.  In addition to the beneﬁts which can be obtained by the adoption of ERP, it is also important to take into consideration other drivers which may lead managers to implement ERP, speciﬁcally  Skok and Legge 2001 :  cid:129  legacy systems and concerns about the Millennium Bug;  cid:129  globalization of the business;  cid:129  the more stringent national and international regulatory environment: e.g., the  European Monetary Union;   cid:129  BPR and the attention paid to process standardization, such as ISO 9000;  cid:129  scalable and ﬂexible emerging client server infrastructures;  cid:129  trend towards collaboration among software vendors.  2.4 Critical Success Factor for ERP Implementation  The ﬁrst important studies on Critical Success Factors  CSFs  and Critical Failure Factors  CFFs  of ERP were developed in the US, where the implementation of ERP occurred for the ﬁrst time  Wylie 1990 ; subsequently, several studies have also been carried out in emerging economies, which has allowed researchers to draw up frameworks useful in understanding the weight of the several factors. Most of these studies followed a methodology aimed at:  a  identifying CSFs proposed by the literature;  b  submitting these CSFs to the attention of experts, professional operators and users to obtain their judgment; and  c  setting up a sort of ranking  Ganesh and Mehta 2010; Garg 2010 . Other authors have dealt with some of the CSFs emerging from the literature by examining them on the basis of the industry, the size of the company and the country  Niu et al. 2011 .  The classiﬁcations of CSFs proposed by the literature are frequently based on a study by Davenport  Davenport 1998b , which lays down the ﬁrst relevant con- siderations about the complexity of ERP implementation. Markus et al.  2000  also show the different business strategies to be followed for an effective implementation of ERP. During the 2000s, two rich literature streams emerged, one aimed at examining the difﬁculties in implementing an ERP system and its CFFs  Markus et al. 2000; Umble and Umble 2002; Gargeya and Brady 2005; Shirouyehzad et al.   24  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  2011 , the other at identifying the CSFs of ERP implementation  Brown and Vessey 1999; Parr and Shanks 2000; Fui-Hoon Nah et al. 2001; Al-Mashari et al. 2003; Somers and Nelson 2004; Nah and Delgado 2006; Finney and Corbett 2007 . One of the ﬁrst studies to summarize the CSFs on the basis of a rigorous literature review and a cross-sectional analysis carried out on 116 companies was by Somers and Nelson  Somers and Nelson 2004 , which was later adopted as a reference in several studies. The authors identiﬁed 22 CSFs  shown in Table 2.2 , whose order of importance changes according to the phase of ERP implementation  initiation, adoption, adaptation, acceptance, routinization, infusion .  For example, in the ERP initiation and ERP acceptance phases, the “use of steering committee” is recognized as the most important factor, whereas, during the ERP adoption and adaptation phases, the “change management” has the highest importance. Again, in the ERP routinization phase, the “user training on software” plays the most important role, whereas in the ERP infusion phase, the most critical factor is the “use of consultants”.  Another important study, conducted after that by Somers and Nelson, extends the number of CSFs by identifying 26 items and classifying them into two cate- gories: strategic and tactical CSFs  Finney and Corbett 2007 . Carried out from the stakeholder perspective, this study underlines the strict connection between strategic CSFs  e.g., change management  and tactical ones  e.g., how to obtain the change management . The list of CSFs, collected through an analysis of the liter- ature, includes the 22 CSFs proposed by Somers and Nelson  2004  and adds some new aspects, such as the relevance of the implementation strategy, the choice of the ERP, precautionary crisis management  of the implementation project , and a preliminary analysis of the existing legacy system.  With regard to the deﬁnition of CSFs, some studies have followed a different approach by identifying CSFs along the various steps of ERP implementation. However, the results of these studies are very similar to those of Finney and Corbett. Kronbichler et al. for example, identify CSFs along the three phases of planning, implementation and stabilization improvement of an ERP  Kronbichler et al. 2009 . Markus and Tanis considered the factors of success failure of ERP implementation, which can occur along one or more of the following implemen- tation phases  Markus and Tanis 2000b :  cid:129  project chartering: that is, the phase in which software, project manager, budget  and scheduling are selected;   cid:129  project phase, in which the system is implemented, and thus data conversion is  performed, users are trained, and testing is achieved;   cid:129  shakedown phase, where the system begins to run regularly, becomes stabilized,  and is slightly customized;   cid:129  the onward-upward phase, consisting of a continuous improvement pursued the continuous training of users, and the evaluation of  through upgrades, post-implementation beneﬁts.   2.4 Critical Success Factor for ERP Implementation  25  Table 2.2 Critical success factors according to Somers and Nelson  Critical success factors Use of steering committee Change management Top management support Business process reengineering Clear goals and objectives Management of expectations Project champion Project team competence Partnership with vendor Use of vendor tools Data analysis and conversion  Interdepartmental cooperation Interdepartmental communication Education on new BPR Dedicated resources Project management User training on software Vendor support Minimal customization Use of consultants Architecture choices Careful selection of package  Given the relevance of a successful ERP implementation and the great impact this has on the business, many studies have focused attention on the Critical Failure Factors  CFFs : that is, on the main causes of an ERP failure. One of the most common ideas is that an ERP implementation is likely to fail if its consequences on the business structure are not accurately evaluated  Markus et al. 2000; Umble et al. 2003 .  Analysing the issue in more detail, the causes of the failure could be related to several aspects, such as ERP software modiﬁcation: in other words, the tendency of companies to ask for tailored ERP systems by forcing the vendors to ﬁnd cus- tomized solutions which turn out to be counter-productive for an effective func- tioning of ERP  Shanks et al. 2003 . System integration may represent another risk of failure, as it could lead to technical difﬁculties related to the integration of the enterprise software with a package of hardware, software, database management systems and telecommunications systems appropriate to the size, structure and geographical dispersion of the company. Furthermore, companies may need to keep legacy systems which perform operations not included in the ERP package  Tsai et al. 2005 ; these systems have to be interfaced with ERP and could give rise to some complications  Yeo 2002; Shanks et al. 2003; Umble et al. 2003 . Other problems could be due to the coordination of the several ﬁrms involved in the implementation process  applications developers, ERP vendors, vendors of ERP extensions  and to the turnover of project personnel possessing the necessary skills for managing ERP system  Shanks et al. 2003 .  Other failure factors are related to the shakedown and the onward-upward phase. Regarding the shakedown, the most important problems are due to the imple- mentation of ERP following an excessively functional perspective, a scarce deﬁ- nition of project scope, a poor consideration of end-user training needs, testing aspects, and problems concerning data quality and reporting needs.  Regarding the onward-upward phase, failure factors are mainly due to the lack of knowledge of the effects ERP investment has on business results, to the lack of   26  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  end-user knowledge of the new system, and to the difﬁculties related to the upgrade and maintenance of the ERP system  Shanks et al. 2003 . Post-implementation of ERP thus deserves special attention, since it inﬂuences the long-term success of the ERP system.  2.5 Critical Success Factors for ERP Post-implementation  The implementation stage of ERP has been largely studied by scholars and with different perspectives. The life of an ERP starts with its adoption and ends when the ERP has been replaced by a new one  Markus and Tanis 2000b .  One of the most relevant research perspectives is that related to critical success factors for the implementation of ERP systems. The post-implementation stage encompasses a number of activities which are pivotal for the success of ERP implementation  Gelinas et al. 1999 . Therefore, the post-implementation success of ERP is a complex topic due to several dimensions such as organizational perfor- mance and the ﬁnancial return on investment in ERP  Sedera and Gable 2004 . An ERP may be considered successful if it can improve the overall performance of increasing the ﬁrm’s productivity, a ﬁrm by reducing organizational costs, increasing employees and customer satisfaction, and so on  Sedera and Gable 2004 .  The success of the post-implementation process is heavily affected by the quality of the phase of ERP implementation itself and by its effectiveness in carrying out changes and improvements in processes, systems, and the overall performance of the ﬁrm  Nicolaou 2004a . In particular, Zhu et al. argue that the quality of implementation and organizational readiness affect post-implementation success  Zhu et al. 2010 .  Furthermore, successful business process changes can be considered as facili-  tators for achieving post-implementation performance gains  Guha et al. 1997 .  of  the  critical  success   2004a   Nicolaou  associated  dimensions  in post-implementation with the critical success factors of ERP implementation. The author identiﬁed the following critical success factors for ERP implementation:  1  top management support and commitment to project and ﬁt to business strategy;  2  the alignment of people, process, technology;  3  anticipated beneﬁts from the ERP implementation project;  4  the motivation behind ERP implementation; and  5  the scope of user training. The author argues that the ﬁrst factor can be linked to the following dimensions of success in post-implementation: “evaluation of ﬁt with strategic vision; review of project planning effectiveness and evaluation of infras- tructure development”. The second one can be linked to the following dimensions of post-implementation: “review of ﬁt resolution strategies; evaluation of system integration attainment and reporting and ﬂexibility”. The third factor can be linked to “evaluation of level of attainment of expected system beneﬁts”. The fourth factor can be linked to “review of driving principles for project and review of project justiﬁcation practices”. Finally, the ﬁfth success factor may be linked to “review of   2.5 Critical Success Factors for ERP Post-implementation  27  user learning and evaluation of effective knowledge transfer  among project team members and other users ”  Nicolaou 2004a .  2.6 Advantages and Disadvantages of ERPs  This section analyzes potential beneﬁts and disadvantages that may arise from ERP adoption within a ﬁrm. The literature has focused particular attention on the effects ERP adoption could produce on both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance ratios  Sect. 2.6.1 . Section 2.6.2 presents a discussion about the framework that can be used to classify the potential beneﬁts of an ERP system. Finally, Sect. 2.6.3 ana- lyzes the potential disadvantages linked to adopting an ERP system.  2.6.1 Potential Beneﬁts of ERP Adoption  The literature about the potential beneﬁts of adopting an ERP has focused on the effects this could produce on both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance indi- cators. Some scholars have even analyzed this topic by referring to tangible and intangible beneﬁts  Markus et al. 2000; Nicolaou 2004b; Fang and Lin 2006; Florescu 2007; Skibniewski and Ghosh 2009; Trucco and Corsi 2014 .  The main studies focusing on the effects ERP adoption could produce on ﬁnancial performance were carried out by Poston and Grabski 2001; Hunton et al. 2002; Hitt et al. 2002; Nicolaou 2004a. These authors found that the introduction of an ERP can produce important effects on the following ﬁnancial performance indicators:  1  Return On Assets  ROA ;  2  Return On Investment  ROI ;  3  Return On Sales  ROS ;  4  Cost of Goods Sold over Sales  CGSS ; and  5  Employee to Sales  ES . Although they found controversial results, even if they used a similar method to carry out their studies, they all agreed that ERP adoption is able to produce all its effects after a certain time-lag  Poston and Grabski 2001; Hitt et al. 2002; Hunton et al. 2003; Zaino 2004; Nicolaou 2004b .  In particular, Poston and Grabski examined the effects of ERP adoption over a three-year period, ﬁnding no signiﬁcant improvements in the main key ﬁnancial performance indices. However, they found an improvement in the cost of goods to revenue three years after the ERP system implementation  but not in the ﬁrst or second year after implementation . They also found a signiﬁcant reduction in the ratio of employee to revenue for each of the three years they examined  Poston and Grabski 2001 .  Nicolaou examined the effects of an ERP on the ﬁnancial performance of a ﬁrm over four years after implementation. He found that ERP beneﬁts on the ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performance became evident and strong only after a lag of approximately two years from ERP implementation, and therefore after two years of continued use of ERP  Nicolaou 2004b . Hitt et al. found that ﬁrms that invest in ERPs have a   28  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  higher performance in several ratios than ﬁrms with no investment in ERPs. In particular, they found that the ERP implementation phases take between one and three years, and the ﬁrst signiﬁcant beneﬁts appear on average after 31 months. Some authors noted that in the ﬁrst period of ERP implementation there is a discordant trend between internal and external performance indices; as a matter of fact, there is a reduction in performance ratios and in productivity and an increase in stock market evaluation  Hitt et al. 2002 . In a similar vein, other authors argued that the market expects that an ERP implementation may allow ﬁrms to improve their competitive advantage  Stratman 2007 . Hunton et al. examined the effects of ERP adoption on ﬁnancial performance over a period of 3 years after ERP implementation, conﬁrming the productivity paradox by comparing ﬁrm perfor- mance of adopters with those of non-adopters. They found that the ﬁnancial per- formance for ERP adopters does not change signiﬁcantly from pre- to post-adoption, although some performance ratios decline for non-adopters over the same time-period. They also found that large unhealthy adopters can expect greater performance gains than can large healthy adopters, and that the small  healthy adopters have better performance in terms of ROA, ROI, and Return On Sales  ROS  than do small unhealthy adopters  Hunton et al. 2003 . Zaino found that 60% of ﬁrms have ﬁnancial beneﬁts from ERP implementation, whereas the remaining 40% have a reduction in ROI  Zaino 2004 . Other scholars have examined the immediate after-effects of ERP adoption, ﬁnding that investments due to ERP implementation might lead to productivity and proﬁtability problems. These problems can be linked to a change in management during the implementation phases  Davenport 1998a; Hitt et al. 2002 .  internal process, customer,  More recently, other scholars have studied the potential beneﬁts ERP imple- mentation may have on non-ﬁnancial dimensions  Fang and Lin 2006; Qutaishat et al. 2012; Trucco and Corsi 2014 . Fang and Lin investigated Taiwan public ﬁrms that adopted the ERP system to evaluate the effects on non-ﬁnancial measures by exploiting the balanced scorecard and the dimensions of the balanced scorecard  ﬁnancial, innovation and learning . The authors examined whether different corporate ERP aims may affect performance after ERP implementation. The corporate aims of ERP adoption that they analyzed were re-engineering processes, performing supply chain management, implementing or supporting e-commerce, integrating ERP with other business information systems, reducing inventory costs, changing the existing legacy system, favoring the com- petitiveness of multinational enterprises, enhancing enterprise images, developing e-business. They found through a regression analysis that the balance scorecard’s ﬁnancial perspectives are closely related to non-ﬁnancial perspectives  Fang and Lin 2006 . Qutaishat et al.  2012 , through users’ interviews, underlined that ERP adoption could produce beneﬁts in terms of customer satisfaction and employee productivity  Qutaishat et al. 2012 . Trucco and Corsi found that ERP adoption can produce beneﬁts for the classical ﬁnancial indicators in terms of ROE and ROI, and for non-ﬁnancial ratios such as corporate governance and social and organizational aspects  Trucco and Corsi 2014 . In particular, they found a general beneﬁt from ERP implementation to the corporate governance score in terms of a company’s   2.6 Advantages and Disadvantages of ERPs  29  systems, processes and management practices. Furthermore, they found an improvement to a social ratio, which summarizes if and how the company describes the implementation of its training and development policy. Results from the study by Trucco and Corsi are in line with other studies that point out that ERP adoption can bring some improvements to social ratios linked to customer satisfaction and employee productivity  Markus et al. 2000; Cotteleer and Bendoly 2002; McAfee 2002 .  Moreover, prior studies have investigated the market reaction to ERP imple- mentation announcements, ﬁnding that stakeholders perceive the potential advan- tages of a new ERP system  Wah 2000; Hayes et al. 2001; Hunton et al. 2002 . Speciﬁcally, Hunton et al.  2002  found that analysts reacted positively to ERP announcements. In fact, they found that analysts who participated in the experi- mental study perceived that a ﬁrm may have some beneﬁts due to the use of an integrated Information Technology  IT  system. Even if most scholars agree that an integrated ERP produces its effects on ﬁnancial statement disclosure and has advantages regarding accounting information, most of the literature focuses on the external perceptions  analysts and external users at large . Furthermore, Hunton et al.  2002  have pointed out that one of the main limitations of their study is its external validity, since they based their results on laboratory experiments. Therefore, they call for more research regarding the potential quality improvements correlated to ERP adoption  Hunton et al. 2002 .  Another stream of literature on ERP has investigated the complex relationships between ERP and management control systems  Maccarone 2000; Booth et al. 2000; Granlund and Malmi 2002; Shang and Seddon 2002; Hartmann and Vaassen 2003; Caglio 2003; Scapens and Jazayeri 2003; Dechow and Mouritsen 2005; Sangster et al. 2009; Chapman and Kihn 2009; Granlund 2011; Kallunki et al. 2011 . Most of the above-mentioned literature agrees that ERP systems can produce their effects on the organization as a whole. In this regard, Shang and Seddon  2000  emphasized that managerial beneﬁts may arise from a better planning and management of resources, whereas Maccarone  2000  identiﬁed two main classes of beneﬁts produced by adopting an ERP:  1  a reduction in the time needed to perform managerial activities, and  2  an improvement in the quality of data and control activities at large. Sangster et al.  2009  carried out a survey using a questionnaire addressed to 700 management accountants in large UK ﬁrms to identify the effect of the perceived success of ERP implementation upon the role of respondents, ﬁnding that ERP generally improves the quality of the role of man- agement accountants if ERP adoption is successful.  Even if most scholars have emphasized the positive, even small, correlation between the use and implementation of an ERP within an organization and man- agerial controls  Quattrone and Hopper 2001; Spathis and Constantinides 2004; Kallunki et al. 2011 , others have found a quite limited impact on the improvements in management control systems and practices due to ERP adoption. Booth et al.  2000  examined the Chief Financial Ofﬁcers’  CFOs  perception about the impact of ERPs on the adoption of new accounting practices, ﬁnding little evidence.   30  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  Table 2.3 Literature review on the potential effects of ERP adoption  ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial dimensions   Dimensions Financial  Non-ﬁnancial  Main items in each dimension ROA, ROI, ROS, ROE, Cost of goods sold over sales, Employee to sales Social ratios, corporate governance, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, employee productivity, internal process, innovation and learning  Literature streams Hitt et al.  2002 , Hunton et al.  2003 , Nicolaou  2004b , Poston and Grabski  2001 , Zaino  2004  Cotteleer and Bendoly  2002 , Markus et al.  2000 , McAfee  2002 , Fang and Lin  2006 , Florescu  2007 , Markus et al.  2000 , Nicolaou  2004a , Skibniewski and Ghosh  2009 , Trucco and Corsi  2014   Speciﬁcally, they found that ERPs seem to open the way to data manipulation rather than lead to an easier collection and elaboration of management data.  According to other scholars, resistance to change on the part of controllers and the time lag between ERP adoption and the related effects on management control systems have a limited impact on the success of ERP  Granlund and Malmi 2002; Scapens and Jazayeri 2003 .  Table 2.3 summarizes the literature review on the potential effects of ERP  adoption  ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial dimensions .  2.6.2 A Framework for Classifying the Beneﬁts of ERP  Systems  Some authors have identiﬁed a framework to classify the potential beneﬁts that ERP adoption can have on the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance of a ﬁrm. In this regard, Shang and Sheddon  2002  proposed ﬁve dimensions to classify the beneﬁts of ERP systems:  1  operational dimension;  2  managerial dimension;  3  strategic dimension;  4  IT infrastructure dimension; and  5  organizational dimension  Shang and Seddon 2002 . The operational dimension refers to business processes and operation volumes  Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1996; Weill and Broadbent 1998 . Within this dimension, an ERP adoption can bring about the following classes of beneﬁts:  1  cost reduction;  2  cycle time reduction;  3  productivity improvement;  4  information quality improvement; and  5  customer service improvement. The managerial dimension pertains to senior managers of information systems  Gorry and Scott Morton 1971b . Within this dimension, an ERP adoption can bring about the following classes of beneﬁts to the ﬁrm:  1  better resource management;  2  better decision-making and planning; and  3  better performance. The strategic dimension is related to competitive advantages  Porter and Millar 1991 . Within this dimension, an ERP implementation can produce the following beneﬁts for the ﬁrm:  1  strategic business growth plan;  2  support business alliance;  3  support   2.6 Advantages and Disadvantages of ERPs  31  business innovation;  4  support cost leadership;  5  support product differentiation; and  6  support external linkages. The IT infrastructure dimension refers to the architecture of the IT and produces the following beneﬁts:  1  increased business ﬂexibility;  2  IT cost reduction; and  3  increased IT infrastructure capability. The organizational dimension refers to organizational behavior  Baets and Venugopal 1998 . Within this dimension, an ERP implementation can produce the following beneﬁts:  2  facilitate business learning;  3  empowerment; and  4  build a common vision.   1  support organizational changes;  Within this framework, Gattiker and Goodhue proposed a model in which they identiﬁed the following organizational beneﬁts due to the ERP implementations: better information quality, more efﬁcient internal business processes, and better coordination among different units of the ﬁrm  Gattiker and Goodhue 2005 .  Similarly, Markus et al. proposed different dimensions to analyze the beneﬁts of ERP implementation, including economic, ﬁnancial and strategic business ratios; business process aspects; the organization’s managers; employee and customer aspects; and supplier and investor dimensions  Markus et al. 2000 .  2.6.3 Potential Disadvantages of ERP Adoption  Despite these considerations about the potential positive effects of ERP adoption, some scholars have found some disadvantages linked to a new ERP.  Brazel and Dang  2005  found a decreased reliability of ﬁnancial statements for external users in the years following the adoption of ERP; they measured this reliability through the value of discretionary accruals. According to their frame- work, a loss of ﬁnancial statement reliability could happen because of a potential increase in the discretion managers have in the use of accounting information  Brazel and Dang 2008 . In fact, ERPs allow managers greater access to and control over ﬁnancial information  Dillon 1999 .  Furthermore, Davenport and other scholars have revealed the disadvantages, risks and costs related to ERP adoption  Davenport 1998a . Some authors have stressed the potential risks that accounting integration due to ERP adoption could bring to the company. As a matter of fact, even if the ERP system is perceived as a strategic investment within the ﬁrm  Cooke and Peterson 1998 , the most relevant risk related to this strategic investment is the failure of ERP implementation, which could even lead to ﬁrms’ bankruptcy  Davenport 1998a; Markus et al. 2000 . Despite this, an Advanced Market Research  AMR  revealed that ﬁrms invest huge amounts of money in ERP  around $79 billion in 2004 , even if some implemen- tations have failed  Carlino et al. 2000 . Some scholars have estimated that only 34% of ERP implementation projects are successful  Nelson 2007 . Costs which are associated with a new ERP may include the purchase of software, hardware, net- work investments and consulting fees  Beheshti and Beheshti 2010 .  Furthermore, an ERP could be viewed as a limitation on the discretion of managers in changing managerial controls in the future, since it is difﬁcult to   32  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  forecast the long-term implications of ERP during its initial phase of implemen- tation. To overcome this limitation a possible, but not sufﬁcient, solution could be to adopt a strategic and long-term vision during the ERP implementation phase  Grabski et al. 2001; Quattrone and Hopper 2001; Grabski et al. 2011 .  Hendricks et al. have argued that any or only a few of the ﬁnancial beneﬁts due to an IT adoption could depend on high implementation costs  Hendricks et al. 2007 . Costs are both monetary and relative to the human resources required to implement and manage the ERP system and its integration within the organization  Granlund and Malmi 2002 . However, researchers agree that a holistic view of the effects of ERP implementation is necessary  Jarrar et al. 2000; Markus et al. 2000; Gattiker and Goodhue 2005 , since the long and deep process of ERP adoption affects the whole organization  Rose and Kræmmergaard 2006 .  2.7 ERP as a Driver of Alignment Between Management  Accounting Information and Financial Accounting Information  Another stream of literature has pointed out the important role that ERP can have in information2 and internal fostering the relationship between external ﬁnancial managerial information3  Innes and Mitchell 1990; Caglio 2003; Taipaleenmäki and Ikäheimo 2013 . Some authors have argued that an ERP may represent a facilitator, motivator, even an enabler for the convergence between ﬁnancial accounting and management accounting4  Innes and Mitchell 1990; Cobb et al. 1995; Booth et al. 2000; Lukka 2007 . Booth et al.  2000  asserted that IT can set the premises for high levels of information integration.  2Financial accounting information is the product of corporate accounting and external reporting systems that measure and disclose quantitative and qualitative data concerning the ﬁnancial position and the overall performance of the ﬁrm  Bushman and Smith 2001 . Further, ﬁnancial accounting information, whose main purpose is to meet the information requirements of external stakeholders, also fulﬁls the internal need of a company to correctly disclose information to the market about its performance, thereby reducing uncertainties for investors and, consequently, the cost of capital  Lambert and Verrecchia 2014 . 3Management accounting information can be deﬁned by Anthony as the ﬂow of information used by management for internal purposes such as planning and control  Anthony 1965 . 4The two areas of ﬁnancial accounting information and management accounting information represent the existence of ﬁnancial accounting and management accounting information tends to create two different circuits of information within a ﬁrm  Popa-Paliu and Godeanu 2007; Taipaleenmäki and Ikäheimo 2013 . Even if some authors have pointed out that, in academia and from a theoretical viewpoint, there is a deep distinction between ﬁnancial accounting and management accounting, they have highlighted that there are some practical overlapping areas between the two, which need to be explored and identiﬁed  Lambert 2006 .  the accounting;  together   2.7 ERP as a Driver of Alignment Between Management Accounting …  33  Taipaleenmäki and Ikäheimo state that ERP systems could be a useful basis for changes in the accounting system. As a matter of fact, they assert that integration between ﬁnancial and management accounting information could be linked to the contemporary need to understand ERP systems and to decrease accounting resources  Ikäheimo and Taipaleenmäki 2010; Taipaleenmäki and Ikäheimo 2013 . In a similar vein, Caglio  2003  has theorized deep changes in accounting practices due to the introduction of an ERP system, and in this regard he has introduced a new hybrid ﬁgure of a manager who is somewhere between a ﬁnancial accountant and the other professional managers, conﬁrming, through a case study, the pivotal role of ERP in removing the barriers between ﬁnancial accounting and management accounting. Within this framework, Trucco found that the high level of integration in ERP improves the level of integration of accounting systems  Trucco 2014, 2015 .  2.8 The Managerial Role of the Chief Information Ofﬁcer  The managerial role of the Chief Information Ofﬁcer  CIO  was introduced in the 1980s, even if his or her tasks have increased in recent decades  Grover et al. 1993 . The CIO label was created in order to recognize that the Information Systems function had become critical in many ﬁrms  Earl 1996 .  The CIO is responsible for the enterprise IT system; indeed he she covers technical and organizational areas, such as as IT-business alignment  Gottschalk 1999 , IT investment decisions  Earl and Feeny 1994; Mithas et al. 2012 , and IT system quality improvement and evaluation  Spewak and Hill 1993 . Therefore, a CIO should ensure a cost-efﬁcient enterprise IT system in order to create long-lasting value within the ﬁrm in which he she operates  Gottschalk 1999; Li and Ye 1999; Sobol and Klein 2009; Lunardi et al. 2014 . The CIO is thus a member of the ﬁrm’s C-level executive team, assuming a strategic role and affecting the organizational and ﬁnancial performance of the whole ﬁrm  Peppard 2007 . Furthermore, the market positively perceives the presence of the new CIO and the appointment of the CIO as a ﬁrm’s leader  Chatterjee et al. 2001 .  Some scholars have identiﬁed different proﬁles of CIOs, namely architecture builder, partner, project coordinator, systems provider and technological leader, while others have proposed different features of CIOs, such as business visionary, business system thinker, value conﬁgure, entrepreneur, IT architect planner, orga- nizational designer, relationship builder and informed buyer  Chen and Wu 2011; Guillemette and Paré 2012 .  In accomplishing his her tasks, the CIO interacts with other top managers, such as the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer  CEO , the IT auditor and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer  CFO   Banker et al. 2011 . Other studies focus on the relationship between the CIO and the other top managers, especially with regard to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. In particular, the CIO should report to the CEO or to the CFO: he she should report to the CEO if the ﬁrm pursues IT initiatives in   34  2 Enterprise Resource Planning Systems  order to improve the differentiation strategy; otherwise, he she should report to the CFO in order to lead IT initiatives in facilitating cost leadership strategy  Earl and Feeny 1994; Preston et al. 2006 . The CIO should have both a technical background and managerial and leadership skills in order to support the ﬁrm’s long-term goals  Bharadwaj 2000; Corsi and Trucco 2016 .

Finally, it presents the main maturity models of BI systems, focusing on the life cycle of BI systems and the need to keep them up-to-date. In the ﬁrst part of the chapter, the summarization of companies’ needs for BI includes management information system needs, strategic planning needs, commercial and marketing needs, regulation needs, and fraud detection needs. The second part of this chapter pertains to the critical success factors of BI implementation. Several scholars have proposed different sets of factors to allow companies to maximize the effectiveness of BI system implementation. This part of the chapter considers the main critical success factor studies in the literature and shows the key aspects a company should consider for an effective BI implemen- tation. Among these critical success factors are the ERP systems dealt with in Chap. 2. In addition to the critical success factors for BI implementation, the literature also recommends aligning the evolution of BI systems with that of the business, considering the life-cycle of BI models as a driver which affects critical success factors. In this regard, the third part of the chapter discusses the BI maturity models.  3.1  Introduction  This chapter will analyze the main needs for Business Intelligence  BI  which lead companies to invest in BI solutions  Sect. 3.2 . The need to implement a BI system can arise from very different situations and could depend on internal or external aspects: for example, BI investment could be achieved to meet information system needs  Sect. 3.3 , strategic planning needs  Sect. 3.4 , commercial and marketing needs  Sect. 3.5 , or regulatory and fraud detection needs  Sect. 3.6 . After underlining the companies’ needs for BI, it is important to understand how to implement a BI system to ensure it will meet the companies’ expectations. For this    Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018 C. Caserio and S. Trucco, Enterprise Resource Planning and Business Intelligence Systems for Information Quality, Contributions to Management Science, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-3-319-77679-8_3  43   44  3 Business Intelligence Systems  purpose, Sect. 3.7 examines the main literature on the Critical Success Factors  CSFs  for BI implementation.  The success of BI is also affected by the maturity model and by the lifecycle approach used by the company; these aspects are explained in Sect. 3.8 and sup- ported by the main literature streams.  3.2 Business Intelligence and Companies Needs  The main aim of this section is to analyze the factors that lead companies to invest in BI solutions. The aim, therefore, is to identify the criteria that should be followed in guiding companies to choose the most suitable system to meet their needs.  The need to invest in BI systems is analyzed from both an academic and pro- fessional perspective  Yeoh and Popovič 2016 . However, there have been few studies that analyze, in a systematic and in-depth approach, the several factors and motivations that determine the need for companies to adopt BI systems  Yeoh and Koronios 2010; Yeoh and Popovič 2016 . Only a few studies have been carried out through surveys speciﬁcally aimed at highlighting companies’ needs for BI: the most representative example is the study of Yeoh and Popovič  2016 , which is aimed at enhancing the understanding of critical success factors in the implemen- tation of BI systems by analyzing 7 case studies and interviewing 26 business actors involved in the use of BI tools. Their research proposes an analysis of the perceived users’ needs at various organizational levels.  Another study that indirectly identiﬁes the needs of companies to implement BI systems is by Rud  2009 , which provides guidance on the many needs that companies may feel. This study presents evidence from BI professionals, CEOs and experts during their work experience on the main information and IT requirements perceived by companies and on aspects that increase  or would increase  such needs. The lack of studies addressed directly at the needs of BI has made it nec- essary to extend the analysis of the literature to articles that, although not directly focused on the analysis of companies’ BI needs, indirectly deal with their BI requirements, both in empirical and theoretical studies.  A BI system, a term coined in the early twentieth century by Gartner, can be deﬁned as an integrated set of tools and technologies used to gather, integrate, aggregate, select, validate, intelligently explore and analyze  structured and semi-structured  data and information from different sources, making them useful and usable in different decision-making processes  Reinschmidt and Francoise 2000; Olszak and Ziemba 2007 .  Studies show a growing trend in the investments that companies have made in the latest generation of IT technologies, despite the difﬁculties associated with the recent ﬁnancial crisis. Companies are now faced with the choice of alternative solutions. On the one hand, they can opt for more “traditional” IT-centric models, in which BI is controlled by Information Technology  IT . These models are based on complex technologies that require special skills, and thus the availability of IT   3.2 Business Intelligence and Companies Needs  45  experts who deliver all the reports, making the process lengthy and ineffective. On the other hand, companies can choose “more innovative” systems, also called “business-led analytics”, which, based on self-service and visual analytics tools, allow users to produce custom reports without the need for speciﬁc IT skills.  The analyses aimed at monitoring the market trends of BI solutions appear to show that the entire market is constantly growing at an annual rate of 7.9% and that the latest generation solution—”business-led”—is in rapid growth, with a rate of only 63.6% in 2015  Gartner 2017 . The latter market segment seems to be highly promising since the decision to invest in BI systems seems to be highly inﬂuenced today by the growing need for ﬂexibility in use and the personalization of data and information.  Below is a list of the critical drivers which lead companies to invest in BI technologies and the major models that companies may choose to implement these  see Table 3.1 .  Regarding the factors which affect a company’s decision to invest in BI, we can  identify the following three main drivers:   1  coercive isomorphism  DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Powell and DiMaggio 2012 , related to the need to manage a growing amount of data and information. These needs can be determined by the increasingly stringent and complex management needs, and by the need to meet the requirements of compliance with general or sectoral norms  e.g., bank regulations . The diffusion of com- puter technology and communication tools has greatly increased the amount of data and information that companies are able to manage daily;   2  mimetic isomorphism  Haveman 1993 , related to the need to cope with an increasingly competitive, global, turbulent and disrupting environment where timeliness becomes more and more critical in responding rapidly to market demands;   3  decision-making process, associated with the need to deal with more and more complex processes  Saaty 1990; Turban et al. 2014  due to highly competitive contexts that require the increasing use of advanced information technologies and sophisticated decision-making algorithms.  Table 3.1 Summarization of the main drivers of BI needs  Coercive isomorphism  DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Powell and DiMaggio 2012  Need to manage great amount of data Need to deal with complex environment Need to comply with regulations  Mimetic isomorphism  Haveman 1993   Need to compete on the market Need to deal with competitors Need to respond to market demands  Decision-making process support  Saaty 1990; Turban et al. 2014  Need for timeliness  Need for data quality  Need for reliable information   46  3 Business Intelligence Systems  As a consequence, companies need to invest in innovative BI models that can:  cid:129  meet the need of integrating and analyzing data from different applications or,  more generally, from different sources;   cid:129  reduce the opacity of certain operations and business functions by increasing  their transparency and sharing;   cid:129  increase the timeliness of data access and data processing;  cid:129  increase the number of users who have access to data and information while  reducing the technical expertise needed;   cid:129  effectively and efﬁciently manage company-speciﬁc life stages  expansion of the  business, mergers, acquisitions, and so forth .  To develop these capacities, companies need to have BI and information available for several business functions and areas. The main areas where BI needs are most felt are the following  see Table 3.2 :  a. management information systems; b. strategic planning; c. marketing; d. regulations and fraud detection.  The main literature regarding the needs of companies is reported in Table 3.3. The following sections analyze each of the BI needs reported in Table 3.2 on the  basis of the literature summarized in Table 3.3.

First of all, the needs for BI may emerge from mergers and acquisitions operations, as explained in Sect. 3.3.1. Another reason why companies perceive the need to invest in BI is to improve internal coordination and technical-organizational integration  Sect. 3.3.2 . Furthermore, because information systems aim at supporting strategic, managerial and operational decisions, companies may invest in BI to satisfy the need for data management and decision support  Sect. 3.3.3  and to improve communications  Sect. 3.3.4 .  3.3.1 Alignment to Group Logics  Extraordinary ﬁnance operations, in particular Mergers and Acquisitions  M&A , play an increasingly important role in the current economy, due in part to global- ization; such operations effect different business areas, such as the ﬁnancial struc- ture of companies, equity ownership, the business model, size and organizational set-up. Therefore, given the increased frequency and scope of these operations, due diligence activities should highlight the key success factors of M&A, such as the competitive position of the company to be acquired, the system and production processes, the human resources available, the accounting, contractual and ﬁscal situation, organizational features and information systems  Sudarsanam 2003 . This latter point is particularly relevant in the context of this study, as M&A involve the integration, and thus the alignment, of corporate information systems, with the aim of pursuing strategic and tactical objectives  Levinson 1994 . The literature shows   3.3 BI for Management Information Systems Needs  49  that such ﬁnance operations can fail if they are carried out by attributing excessive attention to ﬁnancial variables at informational and organizational ones. Empirical studies also suggest that accurate planning of M&A operations is crucial for their success  Robbins and Stylianou 1999 . One of the most common causes of M&A failure is the scant attention paid to their effects on the integration of the IT resources of the companies involved  McKiernan and Merali 1995; Roehl-Anderson 2013 .  the expense of technical,  This integration should instead be one of the primary objectives of M&A operations, as it would provide quality, accurate, useful and timely information  Buck-Lew et al. 1992  and an effective system with the characteristics of selec- tivity, ﬂexibility, reliability, timeliness and acceptability  Marchi 1993  that can support decision-making at the operational, managerial and strategic levels  Anthony 1967; Mancini 2010 . According to a slightly different analytical per- spective, for M&A operations to be successful, an alignment should be pursued between the business strategy and the technological tools available in the company  Roehl-Anderson 2013 . Therefore, the impact of M&A operations on BI systems is twofold: on the one hand, the success of the integration of information systems improves the effectiveness of BI systems, as these analyze and process data pro- vided by the information systems  Elbashir et al. 2008; Peters et al. 2016 ; on the other hand, M&A operations should be carried out by aligning the company’s strategic needs with its BI needs in order to create value  Henningsson and Kettinger 2016 .  With regard to the alignment of information systems, the need to implement a BI system may derive from the need to align the purchasing company’s BI system to that of the acquired company, in case the latter is considered more effective  Yeoh and Popovič 2016 . In this context, the most recent literature clearly demonstrates that the effective integration of information and IT systems of companies involved in M&A operations is essential for the achievement of the expected beneﬁts  Wijnhoven et al. 2006; Graebner et al. 2016; Henningsson and Kettinger 2016 . Globalization has undoubtedly favored the implementation of M&A operations, and therefore the need for companies to implement or update BI systems to align them with business strategies. The compatibility of the information and IT systems of companies is thus one of the most important success factors for M&A operations, as it inﬂuences the ability of BI systems to provide adequate decision support  Sudarsanam 2003 .  In the case of company groups, the parent company may feel the need to implement or adapt its BI systems to make them available to other companies of the group that, for organizational, structural or budget reasons, are lacking in BI tools. On the contrary, the need to invest in BI systems may be perceived by companies belonging to the corporate group due to the implementation and transfer strategies of hardware and software pursued by the parent company  Kirlidog 1996 .   50  3 Business Intelligence Systems  3.3.2 Coordination and Technical-Organizational  Integration  The need to improve internal, technical and organizational coordination is very commonly discussed in the literature on BI integration systems. One of the needs emphasized in some studies is that perceived by BI end-users, who feel that BI investment is creating value only if the tools meet their needs and improve their job performance  Hou 2012 .  The literature shows that end users’ needs generally require that BI tools   Popovič et al. 2012; Sparks and McCann 2015 :  cid:129  support the end-users’ job tasks;  cid:129  are well structured and integrated so as to facilitate the achievement of  end-users’ objectives;   cid:129  have intuitive interfaces;  cid:129  facilitate the access to data;  cid:129  increase the timeliness of data, information and communication.  In other words, BI systems should provide an adequate level of user satisfaction, which consists in the end-users perception of an acceptable alignment between the systems used and the perceived needs  Raymond 1990; Dishman and Calof 2008 . Such satisfaction can be achieved through the enhancement and integration of existing and or new BI systems; but this improvement, in turn, generates the need to manage the technical issues underlying the integration. This latter mainly concerns two closely-related factors  Isik et al. 2011 :  a.  technical-IT integration of internal business applications, which involves data, information and people;  b. enhancement of the ability to provide the information and knowledge needed to  support end-user decisions.  With reference to the ﬁrst point, obtaining a satisfactory level of integration between the business applications has become increasingly complex over time, given the high heterogeneity of databases, information platforms, software and interfaces. Furthermore, the advent of the Internet has brought new problems related to public communications, communications security and interoperability: i.e., the ability of systems to interact reliably with other systems  Hérault et al. 2005 .  To cope with these complexities and to foster a link between business appli- cations, middleware solutions were designed, which consist in software systems and interfaces that act as mediators among a lot of different applications  Serain 2002; Bieberstein 2006 .  With regard to point  b , namely, the ability of the system to provide decision support to end-users, it is still thanks to the integration  and the updating  of the systems that the decision makers can meet this need. In addition to allowing very different applications to interact, the integration of the systems also makes it pos- sible to unify information and data management systems, thus improving the   3.3 BI for Management Information Systems Needs  51  alignment of information ﬂows with business needs  Markus 2000 . Consequently, the integration of the system allows for the provision of “uniﬁed” information which supports managerial decision-making  Mendoza et al. 2006 .  In addition to providing “uniﬁed” information, an effective decision support to end-users also requires the adoption of data mining and knowledge discovery tools to transform data into knowledge; in doing so, these tools allow management to obtain insights and to make interpretations regarding a vast amount of data  Shim et al. 2002; Chou et al. 2014 .  System integration has not only technical but also organizational implications. Integration makes it necessary to identify the most appropriate and effective solu- tions for end-user training and the deﬁnition of rules and best practices that end-users could follow and share  Marjanovic 2010 .  However, the need for information system coordination and integration can also be perceived by the same top management, especially in companies that have already implemented BI systems and used them to support key business processes. Companies of this type recognize a considerable strategic value for BI systems, and they are generally the most inclined to invest in new BI solutions, since they wish to derive the maximum possible value  Marjanovic 2010 .  3.3.3  Improvement of Data Management and Decision Support Information  The implementation of BI systems inevitably responds to the need to obtain data and information that support the decision-making process. The main phases of a BI system are  Gilad and Gilad 1986; Turban et al. 2014 :  a. collection of data; b. evaluation of the validity and reliability of the data; c. data analysis; d. data storing and processing; e. dissemination and communication.  Communication precedes the acquisition and use of the information by the recipients to support their decisions. Following this path, raw data will be converted into information and therefore into knowledge, which is useful in providing deci- sion makers with the appropriate support for their strategic choices. The need to have a BI system is thus perceived even more intensely when information is critical and impacts the decision-making process  Woodside 2011 . Companies’ needs for BI to support decisions can be explored under two main aspects:  cid:129  technological, based on data and tools available for data analysis;  cid:129  informational, associated with the speciﬁc business-related decision-making  needs.   52  3 Business Intelligence Systems  Regarding the technological aspect, companies’ needs for data processing tools have evolved in line with the evolution of data complexity. Consequently, these needs have led to an evolution in BI tools  Chen et al. 2012 . According to this interpretation, the needs for BI can be correlated with the types of data that man- agers need to analyze. The more structured is the data—that is, the more it comes from corporate databases and management systems—the more companies will effectively use BI tools such as data warehousing, Extracting, Transforming and Loading technologies  ETL , On-Line Analytical Processing  OLAP  and reporting, which allow them to extrapolate useful information through statistical analyses such as regression, segmentation and clustering, and to visualize information using multidimensional tools such as scorecards and dashboards  Chen et al. 2012 .  However, BI tools needed by companies may change according to the nature and to the characteristics of the data. For example, if the data to be analyzed comes from the web in very large amounts and is not structured, companies will need Big Data and Web 2.0 tools, which would allow managers to analyze large amounts of data —such as, sites, social media, forums, blogs, and online resources in general. These tools, through advanced analyses, can provide a measurement of relevant aspects, such as online user activity  through web analytics and web intelligence tools , the frequency of use of certain terms  text mining, web mining , and the “moods” emerging from the text analysis  tone analysis, sensitivity analysis   O’Reilly 2009; O’Reilly and Battelle 2009; Chen et al. 2012 .  Companies that rely particularly on innovative tools, such as the Internet of Things, or mobile web applications, may perceive the need for BI tools that have recently begun to spread on the market  Da Xu et al. 2014; Palattella et al. 2016; Peters et al. 2016 .  In addition to relying on the data typology and tools, BI needs also depend on the speciﬁc decision-making requirements that managers must meet. Hence, investing in BI requires the identiﬁcation of the company’s real technical and informational needs to ensure the new BI resources are not acquired only to upgrade the processing capabilities, neglecting the alignment of technology to the business. Following this idea, the need for BI tools depends on the type of business activity, the industry, the complexity of the internal processes and the external environment. In other words, it depends on all those elements that contribute to creating the problems and, consequently, it affects the type of decision support needed to solve them  Moss and Atre 2003 . The study by Mackenzie et al.  2006  is also in line with these ideas: the authors distinguish the DSSs according to the decision-making needs the company has to satisfy, recognizing two types of DSSs:  a. substantive systems, which provide support for the resolution of speciﬁc kinds of problems and the management of speciﬁc decisions through processing, calculation and design capabilities;  b. procedural systems, which instead provide support for the assessment of the  consequences of a decision.   3.3 BI for Management Information Systems Needs  53  Therefore, substantive systems will be implemented by companies that need an “operational” decision-making support, and thus aid in understanding how to reach a certain goal that is already known  Checkland 1981 . This type of support is based on providing the decision maker with a set of alternatives, mostly based on mathematical calculations and simulations.  On the other hand, procedural systems will be adopted by companies that need to understand why a speciﬁc action is required, or to look for the best alternative that could solve a particular problem. In these systems—unlike the previous ones—the problems to be solved are not known in advance and are generally strategic, unstructured and not well-documented  Rosenhead and Mingers 2001; Mackenzie et al. 2006 .  3.3.4  Improvement in Communications  In addition to acquiring data and information needed to gain decision support, companies also perceive the need for BI tools to enhance their communicative skills  Rud 2009 . BI tools, therefore, can be used to improve the frequency, clarity and timeliness of communication. In some cases, the choice to implement a BI system arises from the speciﬁc need to improve the effectiveness of communications between management and customers, with the aim of improving economic and ﬁnancial performance  Krivda 2008 . Of course, the tools that can be used for this purpose include those of Web 2.0.  Some factors that may affect a company’s need for BI and the type of BI tools  required are:  cid:129  the type of business activity;  cid:129  the number of sectors and or markets in which the company operates;  cid:129  the structure of the reporting system;  cid:129  the maturity model of BI.  Regarding the ﬁrst point, some companies may adopt tools useful for promoting internal real-time collaboration, setting up collaborative teams that can discuss and share ideas and solutions for several issues  Rud 2009 . The type of business activity can also lead companies to prefer BI systems for synchronous communi- cation or asynchronous communication: the ﬁrst fulﬁlls the need for quick com- parison between the interested parties  both internal and external , while the latter is generally suitable for the resolution of less urgent problems  Coleman and Levine 2008 .  As for the second point, a high number of sectors and or markets in which the company operates may cause information overload, which could bring about a loss in decision-making accuracy, and low-quality and delayed communications  Rud 2009 . In these cases, companies would need a high-quality information system  Caserio and Trucco 2016 , which requires both an integrated transactional system   54  3 Business Intelligence Systems   e.g. ERP systems  and a BI system well-aligned with business goals  Patel and Hancock 2005 .  Concerning the third point—the structure of the reporting system—communi- cation and collaboration needs can also be met through the implementation of a reporting system, which is one of the ﬁrst investments that companies carry out in BI. Companies with this system ensure that they can select, represent and com- municate data by choosing only the most relevant data and dividing it into multi- dimensional views. In other cases, companies invest in BI reporting systems because they are interested in analyzing trends and historical data, creating fore- casts, and conducting scenario analysis  Hribar Rajterič 2010 . If company feels the need to enhance the reporting system, it can introduce more advanced solutions, such as personalized Key Performance Indicators  KPIs  and scorecards, both of which are multidimensional tools that generate reports for performance measure- ment, control and monitoring.  Regarding the fourth point—the BI maturity model—the need for an upgrade in BI could be inﬂuenced by the maturity of BI and that of the company: in fact, according to the literature on the maturity model of BI systems—used to describe, explain and evaluate the life cycle of Business Intelligence—for a BI system upgrade to produce the beneﬁts expected, the equilibrium between the level of maturity of BI and the level of maturity of the company has to be maintained  Burton 2009; Hribar Rajterič 2010; Lahrmann et al. 2011 . Therefore, in investing in BI, a company could postpone or anticipate its purchase according to the con- dition of equilibrium  or disequilibrium  between the BI and the company maturity level.  3.4 BI for Strategic Planning Needs  As previously explained, BI systems support information system management by improving data and information management, data and system integration, and reporting systems. One of the most frequent needs companies try to satisfy by implementing a BI system is that of supporting strategic decisions, planning and control. Accordingly, this section deals with the following needs of companies:  cid:129  BI needs for monitoring weak environmental signals  Sect. 3.4.1 ; BI systems may allow companies to understand the environmental dynamics and to even- tually anticipate strategic competitors;   cid:129  planning and control needs  Sect. 3.4.2 ; BI may aid companies in improving the management control system through dashboards, forecasting models, reward compensation systems, and by aligning the various business functions objectives;   cid:129  needs for advanced tools which support the alignment between the business  model and the changing environment  Sect. 3.4.3 .   3.4 BI for Strategic Planning Needs  55  3.4.1 Monitoring of Environmental Signals  Environmental changes require companies to rapidly and effectively obtain the information needed to support the decision-making process. From this perspective, the implementation of BI systems can respond to the need for tools that can support the company in the strategic planning phases and in analyzing complex problems through planning, simulation and scenario analysis tools  Georgantzas and Acar 1995; Marchi 1997; Caserio 2015 . The need to analyze unstructured problems, typically associated with environmental turbulence, has gradually been perceived since the 1970s, when the environmental complexity began to affect corporate decisions more intensely  Malaska et al. 1984; Bradﬁeld et al. 2005 .  According to the literature, companies which implement BI tools to support  strategic planning and control activities seek to satisfy the following needs:  cid:129  obtain better monitoring of the external environment and recognize weak change  signals  Rud 2009 ;   cid:129  periodic re-evaluations of the adopted business model  Giesen et al. 2010 ;  cid:129  identify and monitor over time the drivers which affect economic and ﬁnancial  results  Mitchell and Bruckner Coles 2004 ;   cid:129  create alternative scenarios for solving complex problems  Lindgren and   cid:129  obtain a quick and coordinated decision-making process  Laszlo and Laugel  Bandhold 2009 ;  2000 .  In these areas, an effective BI system would play a crucial role for companies, as it would provide environmental turbulence signals necessary to evaluate a possible revision of the business model. The analysis of the external environment is as crucial as it is difﬁcult to carry out, considering that it examines several qualitative and quantitative factors of multiple resources, including elements that, in many cases, are not known beforehand. This could make it difﬁcult for companies to adapt to the new environmental conditions in a timely manner  Pearce et al. 1997; Pearce and Robinson 2005 .  In addition, external information, useful for analyzing the strategic problems and for supporting decisions, may be available only in certain limited periods of time; furthermore, its acquisition could be costly and time-expensive, and the time available for procuring it could be insufﬁcient. Moreover, even in cases of easy information accessibility, it would still be unlikely to know, a priori and accurately, what information is needed to effectively support decisions; instead, it is much more common for management to become aware of the necessary information only when it is really needed, which usually happens when it is too late  Alkhafaji 2011 .  In addition to the need for BI to anticipate potential changes in the external environment, companies also need to continuously align their business model to the environmental changes. Therefore, BI tools that help to recognize external change signals are as important as those that support management  Alkhafaji 2011 :   56  3 Business Intelligence Systems   cid:129  in understanding whether the alignment between the business model and the  environment has been achieved  or is happening  effectively;   cid:129  in verifying if there are any inconsistencies between the desired change and the  actual change;   cid:129  in providing alternatives that enhance alignment, minimizing the negative  effects of external pressures.  However, the external environment consists of several forces and conditions related to the industry, the market and the economic system, some of which are not measurable. Thus, BI tools are useful for analyzing only measurable data, infor- mation and resources which pertain to the external environment. This analysis is usually based on the principles of SWOT analysis, which identiﬁes the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities and the threats that characterize the company and its environment  Hunger and Wheelen 2010 . Within a turbulent environmental system, BI can effectively support managers in identifying environmental elements that have changed, in recognizing which elements have a direct inﬂuence on business processes and which ones, instead, do not engender any modiﬁcation of the business model  Carpenter and Sanders 2006 .  In the absence of BI tools, it is likely that the difﬁculties in recognizing the weak signals of change will be perceived to the maximum extent possible, while an effective BI system could help to reduce them. BI tools, in fact, can support business management in several ways:  a. by providing in-depth data mining, which enables companies to acquire  non-detectable knowledge  Bose and Mahapatra 2001 ;  b. by creating forecasts based on historical trends  Liebowitz 2006 ; c. by acquiring and processing data in a timely fashion and visualizing it through  multidimensional reporting systems  Chen et al. 2012 ;  d. by providing scenarios, simulating the effects of possible future decisions   Bradﬁeld et al. 2005 .  In addition to the support in recognizing environmental change signals, BI tools also allow companies to continuously monitor the ongoing process of alignment between the business model and the new, changed environmental conditions. These tools allow the company both to monitor external information that most likely will affect the business model and to monitor the internal key variables that are most sensitive to external inﬂuences.  A BI system capable of managing such continuous monitoring and controls provides undoubted beneﬁts to business management, as it permits periodic reviews of strategic objectives and the alignment of business policies with environmental changes. The need to adapt to the changed external conditions forces companies to promptly change the business model. Consequently, there emerges the need for tools that guide and optimize business operations on a daily basis and that enable the monitoring of internal operations activities. These tools, called operational BI, allow instant visibility of the most critical business operations  Nesamoney 2004  and, in pursuing the aim of making the decision-making process as quick as   3.4 BI for Strategic Planning Needs  57  possible, operational BI systems must be matched by the continuous, on-line monitoring of business operations  White 2005 . BI systems are particularly suited for such operations because they are able to acquire information directly from original business processes, or during the process implementation, in a disaggre- gated form that allows managers to measure and monitor the performances in real-time, with a high level of detail  Alles et al. 2006 . Because business processes are often a response to environmental turbulence, continuous monitoring of these processes must necessarily be coordinated with the constant monitoring of the external environment.  Therefore, BI systems satisfy the need to monitor the external signals of change, the need to assess the adherence of the business model to the mutable environ- mental conditions, and the need to promptly reveal any discrepancy.  3.4.2 Planning and Control Requirements  Originally, BI systems were deﬁned as a collective term for data analysis tools  Anandarajan et al. 2004  that allow for timely, relevant and easy-to-use informa- tion  Hannula and Pirttimaki 2003 . Today, this deﬁnition is still valid, as BI provides signiﬁcant improvements to the traditional DSS  Mancini and Marchi 2004; Yeoh and Popovič 2016 .  In addition to the support provided to the strategic level, BI systems are also helpful in enhancing the planning and control activities performed by ﬁrms. BI systems, in fact, refer to a set of systems for data analysis and reporting that provide decision support at various levels of the organization  Hannula and Pirttimaki 2003  through business applications that include scorecards, dashboards, customer ana- lytics and supply chain analytics  Williams and Williams 2010 .  With regard to planning and control activities, the main need that leads managers to acquire BI systems is to improve the effectiveness of Corporate Performance Management  CPM , which mainly consists in resource management, cost accounting, ﬁnancial planning and budgeting  Howard 2003; Williams and Williams 2010; Elbashir et al. 2011 . BI tools provide powerful capabilities which support planning, cybernetic controls, and administrative and reward compensation controls  Elbashir et al. 2011 . According to Malmi and Brown’s deﬁnition  2008 :  cid:129  cybernetic controls provide quantitative measures for activities and processes, ﬁx performance standards, and provide feedback on the business goals, assessing variances between goals and results;   cid:129  planning controls designate functional area goals, establish standards for assessing the business function results, and assure alignment between the var- ious functional goals throughout the company;  seek to motivate the individuals,  thereby   cid:129  reward compensation controls increasing their performance;   58  3 Business Intelligence Systems   cid:129  administrative controls set organizational structures, lines of accountability, and  establish policies and procedures.  Several planning and control activities are supported by the BI tools, since they help to monitor, scan and interpret the collected information. For example, BI tools allow ﬁrms to perform ﬁnancial simulations, what-if analyses and scenario analysis before deﬁning strategic  and tactical  goals  Mancini and Marchi 2004; Aronson et al. 2005; Marchi and Caserio 2010 .  Hence, using BI solutions can dramatically improve the planning and control activities. In an integrated enterprise system, the solidity of databases is ensured by the set of relations that connect the data to each other; but in many cases the individual ability of end-users to extract relevant information without using spe- cialized applications is quite limited. This plays against the need to effectively manage planning and control activities, which require a timely response of the system and accurate enterprise data, which is useful in making estimates, forecasts, simulations, and the like. In this sense, BI systems play a crucial role as they are speciﬁcally designed to facilitate users in performing detailed analyses of enterprise data  Brignall and Ballantine 2004; Carte et al. 2005; Robertson et al. 2007 . Furthermore, the availability of timely and accurate information and data positively affect both cost management and the reporting system  Rud 2009 . In fact, BI systems are able to produce, from the underlying enterprise databases, a wide range of pre-speciﬁed reports useful for supporting planning and control activities  Elbashir et al. 2011 .  The importance of BI tools for planning and control activities is also conﬁrmed by some empirical studies: a survey conducted by Olszak  2016 , along with other case study analyses  Chaudhary 2004; Hawking et al. 2008; Davenport et al. 2010; Olszak 2015 , reveal that BI systems can be acquired for:  cid:129  supporting demand forecasting;  cid:129  informing about the realization of enterprise goals;  cid:129  increasing the effectiveness of strategic, tactical and operational planning;  cid:129  improving the quality of information related to trends and the realization of  plans;   cid:129  providing analyses of deviations from the realization of plans.  The beneﬁts of BI for planning and control activities are sometimes neither directly measurable nor explicit. This happens when the improved strategic deci- sions and the increased information quality due to the adoption of BI tools allow managers to prevent the possibility of quantifying the effects  Pranjić 2011 .  losses, without   3.4 BI for Strategic Planning Needs  59  3.4.3  Innovative BI Tools for the Adaptation to Environmental Conditions  To support strategic decisions, companies need BI tools that are sufﬁciently inno- vative and capable of recognizing the signs of change. Some studies argue that traditional BI tools, as part of strategic planning, usually consist of applications that use historical trends to derive future values, supported by statistical models  Laszlo and Laugel 2000; Rud 2009 . The same studies argue that the mathematical rigor of such models, although useful for the initial formulation of the strategy, may be an obstacle to the creativity which could be necessary for suggesting alternative sce- nario hypotheses and for proposing business model changes. Traditional BI tools are, therefore, likely to undermine the strategic adaptability of the company  Laszlo and Laugel 2000 . This strategic adaptability should be supported by an equally adaptable BI infrastructure, or by adaptive BI tools  Bäck 2002 . These systems inherit the features of expert systems and belong to the area of machine learning, which examines the ability to provide software with the capacity to learn without a speciﬁc programming. The learning process, in fact, derives from the recognition of patterns and algorithms which analyze source data to make predictions  Bose and Mahapatra 2001 .  The goals of traditional BI systems are to access data from a variety of sources, transform them into information and, through data mining algorithms, into knowledge that supports decision-making. The knowledge is made available to the decision makers through user-friendly interfaces. Unlike these traditional systems, adaptive BI not only provides support for decisions but is also able to recognize the best decisions to take on the basis of the knowledge available  Michalewicz et al. 2006 .  Therefore, in addition to transforming the data into information and information into knowledge, these systems elaborate the knowledge through optimization models and predictive algorithms, proposing decisions that are continuously updated based on the data and knowledge acquired in input. These tools are thus based on an iterative “input-output-output” logic, as shown in Fig. 3.1.  Over time, the adaptive BI system contributes to a self-learning process that gradually updates the knowledge about problems and proposes solutions aligned with the input data.  The adaptive BI system is based on a logic in which:   cid:129  the input is represented by the problem to be solved and its related data;  cid:129  the output consists of the additional knowledge that  the system generates regarding the problem, utilizing the combination of optimization and prediction models;   cid:129  the generated output  i.e., the solution proposed for the problem  represents both a decision-making support and an internal data source which returns as a sys- tem’s input; this input is also composed of new updated data acquired from external sources;   cid:129  the process is repeated cyclically.   60  3 Business Intelligence Systems  a t a D  Data   preparation  Data-mining  n o i t a m r o f n I  e g d e l w o n K  Adaptability  Optimization  models  Prediction models  s n o i s i c e D  Input - Problem  Output - Solution  Fig. 3.1 Adaptive business intelligence  Source Adapted from Michalewicz et al.  2006    The iterative approach of these systems allows companies to keep the knowledge of the problems up-to-date by taking into account the effects of environmental turbulence on the input data  Bäck 2002; Wang 2005; Salehie and Tahvildari 2009 . Therefore, companies which use traditional BI systems and operate in a turbulent environment perceive the need to adopt more innovative and ﬂexible systems, thereby favoring the adaptability necessary to cope with mutable environmental dynamics  Rud 2009 .  3.5 BI for Marketing Needs  One of the strongest needs that lead companies to invest in BI tools is to create new relationships with customers or to enhance existing relations  Olszak 2016 . BI provides valuable support for processing large amounts of structured or unstruc- tured data, thereby helping companies to analyze data related to active customers. Furthermore, BI tools may also be useful in identifying and proﬁling new potential customers through data analysis carried out, for example, on social media. Companies can thus invest in BI to meet several types of needs relating to the commercial and marketing ﬁelds  He et al. 2013; Olszak 2016 :  cid:129  market analysis to search for new needs and consumer tastes;  cid:129  market analysis to identify the target audience and proﬁle potential new  customers;   cid:129  internal data analysis on existing customers to enhance existing relationships;  cid:129  classifying active customers based on common characteristics  creating clusters  and segments ;   cid:129  implementing targeted marketing strategies.   3.5 BI for Marketing Needs  61  BI systems support companies in identifying new market opportunities in order to meet the needs of customers and increase their satisfaction levels  Chau and Xu 2012; Park et al. 2012 . The combination of these tools with Web 2.0 can even improve customer analysis. Web 2.0 tools, in fact, provide valuable support to the management of business and marketing activities, since they enable managers to interact directly with effective or potential customers and to gain information about their preferences and interests. For example, through the combination of data-mining techniques—namely, the text-mining applied to social networks—and Web 2.0, it is possible to obtain information implicit in the exchange of messages and opinions expressed by social media users  He et al. 2013 . These combined tools could also be used by companies operating in international markets; however, in these cases they should customize their global marketing strategy to meet the diverse needs of clients from many different countries  Berthon et al. 2012 .  With regard to internal customers, data analysis can only be conducted where BI tools are closely related to Customer Relationship Management  CRM  systems. The latter, in fact, represent the source from which BI tools acquire customer data related to buying habits  channel used, quantity purchased, typology of products, and so on , degree of loyalty, customer age, and customer preferences. Once the data has been acquired, BI tools process it through statistical analysis, clustering and segmentation  Olszak 2016 .  Therefore, from a commercial and marketing perspective companies invest in BI  tools to meet the following needs  Hall 2004; Hočevar and Jaklič 2008 :  cid:129  monitoring the market demand;  cid:129  deepening knowledge of clients  actual and potential ;  cid:129  proposing solutions to maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty;  cid:129  consequently, increasing economic returns and competitive advantage.  Hence, the use of BI tools in the marketing ﬁeld helps improve the customer experience as a whole by providing customers with the most timely and aligned responses to their problems and priorities  Ranjan 2009 .  3.6 BI for Regulations and Fraud Detection Needs  The study conducted by Yeoh and Popovič  2016  suggests that one of the reasons why companies adopt BI systems is to comply with regulations. In certain cases, in fact, the peculiarities of the industry and the unique characteristics of the envi- ronment in which the company operates may lead managers to acquire BI systems that make business activities easy to audit. In these cases, companies require BI tools that can create auditable reporting  in support of institutional inspections performed by the control organisms  and perform business activities in compliance with regulations. In this regard, some studies conducted in the pharmaceutical sectors suggest that companies have to make sure that their software allows them to   62  3 Business Intelligence Systems  keep audit trails and to apply access restrictions to speciﬁc ﬁelds of the enterprise database  Wingate 2016 . Therefore, the choice of BI tools and, more generally, of is sometimes inﬂuenced by the expectations of the regulatory the BI model authorities, which could require that  Trill 1993; Williams 1993 :  cid:129  software be programmed and maintained under version and change control;  cid:129  companies use good programming practices;  cid:129  data integrity issues be well implemented in the database management systems. In other cases, BI model modiﬁcations could arise from compliance with the changes in International Accounting Standards  IAS  and International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS . For example, the passage from the IAS 39 to the IFRS 9—related to the evaluation of ﬁnancial instruments—obliged companies to adopt new classiﬁcation and measurement methodologies. These changes are likely to imply some modiﬁcations also in the business applications used in accounting information systems  Corsi and Mancini 2010; Trucco 2014, 2015 .  In some cases, companies need to adopt BI tools to provide disabled people with the same quality of web services and the same effectiveness that other users receive. In such cases, Web accessibility tools, PDF accessibility tools and other speciﬁc technologies have to be adopted  Rutter et al. 2007 .  Furthermore, the need for advanced BI tools is perceived by companies that have to perform Financial Fraud Detection  FFD  activities, mainly banks and insurance ﬁrms. In this area, data-mining plays an important role as it allows companies to extract and uncover the hidden information behind large amounts of data and identify interesting patterns in databases and useful knowledge from business data  Ngai et al. 2011 . Fraud detection seems to be one of the most common and well-established applications of data-mining, as conﬁrmed by the existence of several data-mining techniques such as neural networks  Dorronsoro et al. 1997; Fanning and Cogger 1998; Cerullo and Cerullo 1999 , logistic regression  Bell and Carcello 2000; Owusu-Ansah et al. 2002; Spathis 2002 , naïve Bayes methods  Viaene et al. 2004 , and decision trees  Kotsiantis et al. 2006 , among others.  3.7 Critical Success Factors of BI Implementation  and Adoption  The previous sections summarized the main reasons that lead companies to adopt BI systems and BI tools. Once the needs for BI have been recognized, it is important to understand how BI systems are implemented within the company.  For this purpose, several authors propose a set of Critical Success Factors  CSF  considered essential for the successful implementation of BI. Yeoh and Koronios  2010 , through a multiple case study analysis, distinguish three main aspects of BI implementation—organization, process and technology—recognizing the CSFs pertaining to each of them. Regarding organization, they identify “vision   3.7 Critical Success Factors of BI Implementation and Adoption  63  and business case related factors” and “management and championship related factors”; with regard to process, they ﬁnd “team related factors”, “project man- agement and methodology related factors” and “change management related fac- tors”; regarding technology, they identify “data related factors” and “infrastructure related factors”. In their framework, the authors also consider the relevance of process performance, which includes the budget and time schedule, and infras- tructure performance, represented by system quality, information quality and sys- tem use. A follow-up study by  Yeoh and Popovič 2016  suggests that organizational factors play the most crucial role in inﬂuencing the success of BI implementation.  According to Rud  2009 , CSFs for BI are classiﬁable into ﬁve elements: effective communication, which could be obtained by sharing goals, knowledge and using different communication styles and different BI tools; collaboration, achiev- able through teamwork using speciﬁc tools, which allows people to exchange opinions about problems in a timely manner; innovation, which is the capability to develop creativity and propose new solutions to meet market needs; adaptability, attainable by keeping the organization open to change and by promoting ﬂexibility in organizational structures and interactions; and leadership, a term which sum- marizes a wide range of characteristics that leaders should have to motivate per- sonnel and to obtain the awareness of the internal needs  for example, empathy, attunement, organizational awareness, inspiration, among others . Other studies underline the fact that BI systems are an extension of ERP systems, and thus the presence of an effective ERP is one of the CSFs for BI implementation  Vosburg and Kumar 2001 . In this regard, Hawking and Sellitto  2010  propose a list of CSFs for BI implementation in an ERP system environment, identiﬁed through a content analysis performed on presentations of industry practitioners involved in the implementation, use and maintenance of BI in an ERP environment. The most frequent CSFs found through this content analysis are: management support, resources, user participation, and team skills. Other factors, such as champion, source systems and development technology, had minor frequency and thus less importance.  Another qualitative study, carried out through a literature analysis and a set of interviews conducted with executives, managers and staff before, during and after the BI implementation, suggest there are two types of CSFs for BI: implementation CSFs—collaborative culture, customization, communication, project management, integration—and success resources, top management support, training, vertical factors related to the post-BI implementation phase—perceived success, timely implementation and satisfaction.  Woodside 2011 . Other studies deal with the CSFs of BI implementation in speciﬁc industries or places. For example, Olszak and Ziemba  2012  examine the CSFs for BI implementation in small-medium enterprises in Poland, while Dawson and Van Belle  2013  focus on CSFs for Business Intelligence in South African ﬁnancial services.  Table 3.4 summarizes the main CSFs related to BI implementation emerging  from the literature.   64  3 Business Intelligence Systems  Table 3.4 Main critical success factors for BI implementation  Yeoh and Koronios  2010  Vision and business case related factors Management and championship related factors Team related factors Project management and methodology related factors Change management related factors Data related factors Infrastructure related factors Budget and time schedule System quality  Information quality System use  Rud  2009   Effective communication  Hawking and Sellitto  2010  Management support  Woodside  2011   Collaborative culture  Collaboration  Resources  Customization  Innovation  Adaptability  User participation Team skills  Communication  Project management  Leadership  Champion  Resources  Source systems Development technology  Top management support Training  Vertical integration Perceived success Timely implementation Satisfaction  It is also important to underline that several studies also recognize ERP systems as critical BI success factors, since ERP systems provide the starting data that are processed by BI systems. If the quality of data is high and the data comes from an integrated and reliable ERP system, then the BI system will also be able to provide effective decision support  Karim et al. 2007; Laudon et al. 2012 .  In examining the CSFs of BI implementation, some authors also take into account the BI maturity model, which allows the position of the company along the BI development process to be identiﬁed. Consequently, the BI maturity model enables companies to understand which are the CSFs for upgrading BI, coherent with the maturity of the company  Hribar Rajterič 2010; Popovič et al. 2012 . In other words, these studies consider the lifecycle of BI as one of the drivers that inﬂuence the CSFs.   3.8 BI Maturity Models and Lifecycle  65  3.8 BI Maturity Models and Lifecycle  Over time, the role of BI systems has gradually changed, from that of a single analytical application view to being an essential component of information systems which contributes to overall company success  Watson 2010 . To make BI systems effective, it is necessary to follow its design and structure changes. To this end, the literature provides the concept of a maturity model, which consists in a sequence of multiple archetypal levels of maturity of a certain domain that can be used to assess the degree of the model development  Lahrmann et al. 2011 .  Each level of maturity is very different from the others and composed of features that differ from those of the other levels. Key Process Areas  KPAs  are deﬁned for each level of maturity and are distinctive for that particular level. KPAs represent phases that the company needs to complete in order to achieve a certain level of maturity  Hribar Rajterič 2010 .  Maturity models allow companies to understand the overall development of a certain domain, and therefore are useful in understanding the characteristics needed by the company to evolve from one level to another. Regarding BI maturity models, the literature provides a series of examples, the main ones summarized by Lahrmann et al.  2010  and Hribar Rajterič  2010 . An example of maturity model is shown in Fig. 3.2.  Figure 3.2 shows an example of a BI Maturity Model, developed by The Data Warehouse Institute  TDWI , mainly focuses on technical issues. Maturity levels are graded through eight key process areas: scope, sponsorship, funding, value, architecture, data, development and delivery.  Business   value   Sage   Adult   Teenager   Child  Infant  Prenatal   Fig. 3.2 TDWI’s business intelligence maturity model  Source Adapted from Eckerson  2007    BI Sofistication   66  3 Business Intelligence Systems  The starting level, “prenatal”, represents the situation in which organizations have rigid management reporting systems, mainly based on standard static reports, distributed to employees on a regular time basis. Reports are hand-coded against legacy systems, therefore IT staff cannot satisfy rapidly the requests for custom reports.  The “infant” phase, represents the situation in which companies are faced with several partial and non-integrated data sources, which provide contrasting business views and do not allow for an effective decision-making process. When companies are at a “child” level, some data warehouse starts to be implemented in single business units, which, however, are not linked to each other. At the “teenager” level, companies recognize the importance of BI systems and of the centralized Data Warehouse  DW  for improving data integration and data quality. Companies make an extensive use of BI consultants to acquire BI tools that provide users with dashboards based on KPIs and with interactive reporting and analysis tools. At the “adult” level, companies implement centralized data management and standardize the architecture of DWs, the language and the metrics rules. The companies start using DWs integrated with data sources in real time. When the company reaches the “sage” level, the BI system capabilities are turned into technical services and an ad hoc information management group is responsible for managing the company’s entire data warehouse as a source for all enterprise information  Hribar Rajterič 2010 . At this level, the BI system allows for the creation of customized reports, the monitoring of KPIs, and the provision of services with high added value.  The main aim of maturity models is to allow companies to assess their BI technologies: ﬁrst, companies can understand what the BI maturity level of their system is and, second, ascertain the coherence between BI maturity and company maturity. Furthermore, maturity models support companies in comparing their system with those of competitors, in recognizing possible weak points in their BI system, and in identifying possible improvement strategies to achieve a certain maturity level  Tan et al. 2011 . Therefore, the passage from one level to another is generally dictated by strategic alignment needs.  The maturity models also support the understanding of critical success factors for BI implementation since, according to Hawking and Sellitto  2010 , success factors may vary depending on the life stage of BI in which the company is involved. Similarly, Dinter et al.  2011  suggest that a lifecycle-oriented approach allows companies to anticipate potential project risks in a timely fashion and to identify possible interventions in the early implementation stage.  This latter consideration introduces another analytical perspective, which also refers to the dynamics of BI systems over time. In addition to the maturity models, in fact, BI may also be analyzed from a lifecycle perspective. Moss and Atre  2003 , for example, state that an integrated BI system needs considerable time to be deployed. Almost all the implementations of engineering projects need to follow these phases:  cid:129  justiﬁcation, in which the developer analyses the business needs which gave rise  to the project;   3.8 BI Maturity Models and Lifecycle  67   cid:129  planning, useful  objectives;  in deﬁning strategies and examining how to achieve the   cid:129  business analysis, which deeply and analytically investigates the business requirements and the possible problems, in order to understand which product could fulﬁll the business needs;   cid:129  design, in which the developer deﬁnes the product features which could solve  the problems and satisfy the business needs;  cid:129  construction, in which the product is created;  cid:129  deployment, which allows the company to implement the product and evaluate  whether it meets the business needs.  However,  this approach is effective only when the external  and internal  environment of the company is relatively static. Since BI models tend to evolve following continuous environmental changes, the traditional deployment process become inadequate for the continual support of business decisions and needs. An effective BI deployment approach should develop iterative releases, as each deployment is likely to give rise to new requirements for the next release  Moss and Atre 2003 .  Therefore, the process to be followed, shown in Fig. 3.3, requires that initially— the justiﬁcation phase—the business opportunities have to be clearly identiﬁed and the problems that the  new  BI application release could solve and or the beneﬁts that it could bring to the company highlighted; subsequently, the planning stage  Justification  Planning  Design  Construction  Deployment  Business  Analysis  Business   opportunities   Problems to be   solved  New benefits to   bring   Technical and  nontechnical  enterprise  infrastructure   Project   requirements   definition   Database design  Implementation  ETL design  Evaluation  ETL   development   Application  development   Data mining  Changes for next release  Environment  Review of tools and processes  New business   needs   Fig. 3.3 Lifecycle of BI applications  Source Adapted from Moss and Atre  2003     68  3 Business Intelligence Systems  evaluates the technical and nontechnical enterprise infrastructure, after which the business needs are analyzed in detail to identify the requirements of the company regarding data, information, tools and internal processes. After the design and construction have been accomplished, the release is deployed. This iterative approach is important for two main reasons:  a  it keeps the functionalities of new releases constantly aligned with business needs, and  b  it learns from the previous releases, as every tool, technique and process which was not helpful in the previous project will be modiﬁed or discarded in the next one.

We speciﬁcally analyze the possible relationships between ERP, BI and information overload underload. Furthermore, we wonder whether ERP and BI systems may also affect the information quality by inﬂuencing the information ﬂow features  i.e., information processing capacity, communication and reporting, information sharing and frequency of meeting . In fact, the poten- tialities of ERP and BI systems may positively contribute to increasing the infor- mation quality  and the information system quality  by means of an improved management of information ﬂow. This quality improvement may indirectly support management the information overload  underload. Finally, we investigate the role played by the features of information ﬂow in improving the information quality perceived by managers. After discussing the research design, the chapter describes the sample selection, the data collection, the variable measurement, and the factor analysis carried out on the research variables.  in counteracting, or at  least reducing,  4.1  Introduction  The present section analyzes the literature review on information quality, infor- mation overload, information underload, and the features of information ﬂow, along with the research design and the research questions of our research.

Ackoff  1967  described the weaknesses of management information systems, stating that managers usually operate under a system deﬁ- ciency: the lack of relevant information  Ackoff 1967 . Prior studies on information overload were conducted in the ‘80s by O’Reilly  1980 , who realized that infor- mation overload happens every time the quantity of information surpasses the individual’s information processing resources  O’Reilly 1980 . Galbraith  1977 , Tushman and Nadler  1978  laid down the theoretical bases of information over- load, asserting that companies facing uncertainty need to adjust their information processing capacities to adapt successfully to the different environments. However, when the information processing capacity is not aligned anymore to the information processing requirements, companies enter into a condition of information overload  Galbraith 1977; Tushman and Nadler 1978 . More recent research supports the basic assumptions of information overload, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. With regard to the theoretical perspective, scholars have analyzed the main literature on information overload by highlighting the features, causes, con- sequences, and possible solutions to information overload  Edmunds and Morris 2000; Eppler and Mengis 2004a; Melinat et al. 2014 . According to these studies, the solutions to information overload would be the adoption of personal information management strategies, the selection of only relevant information, a reduction in the amount of information selected for the decision-making process, the use of push technology solutions and intelligent agents, and the use of value-added information. The initial empirical research on information overload conﬁrms the theories about the effects of information overload on managerial decisions  Duncan 1973; Tushman 1977 . More recent empirical studies have analyzed different aspects of information overload, such as its effect on email communication  Soucek and Moser 2010 , on the decision-making process  Letsholo and Pretorius 2016 , and on social media communication  Ho and Tang 2001; Rodriguez et al. 2014 . Both theoretical and empirical studies suggest the following actions for preventing information overload and underload:  a  avoid assuming that more information is always needed by managers;  b  do not provide more information to managers but make better use of information already available;  c  consider that, while a larger amount of relevant information leads to better decision making process, a larger amount of irrelevant information reduces the manager’s capacity to recognize the problem and thus to carry out an effective decision-making process;  d  make a better use of technology in order to select only relevant and quality information. As the literature shows, many authors recognize the cause of information overload in the amount of information  Hiltz and Turoff 1985; Miller 1994 , while others believe that information overload is due to the lack of information processing   4.2 Literature Review Supporting the Research Design  77  capacity needed to manage the information load  Eppler and Mengis 2004a; Tushman and Nadler 1978 . Information processing capacity is, in turn, affected by information quality and format  Stvilia et al. 2005 .  However, the literature shows that information overload could be due to several causes, such as the use of technology, the decision-making approach and the characteristics of the tasks performed. With regard to technology, managers tend to invest in Information Technology  IT  and in Business Intelligence  BI  to meet workers’ needs and increase their productivity, but they do not realize that tech- nology itself could give raise to “technology overload”, which is a combination of information, communication and system feature overload  Karr-Wisniewski and Lu 2010 . Investing in technology beyond a certain level might not increase produc- tivity; on the contrary, it could lead to a loss of productivity.  In terms of the decision-making approach, managers sometimes tend to produce information overload by seeking more information than they need and, at the same time, not using the information that they already possess  Feldman and March 1981 . This behavior could depend on two main reasons: ﬁrst, more available information reduces the perception of uncertainties and increases the manager’s feeling of having better control of the situation  Milliken 1987, 1990 ; second, managers feel more conﬁdent and satisﬁed if they collect more information, even when it causes overload  Connolly 1977 . The paradox, as explained by O’Reilly  1980 , is that, on the one hand, managers lose decision-making accuracy as a consequence of the information overload, while on the other they feel more con- ﬁdent and secure. Therefore, beyond a certain level of information load, further information does not provide any improvement in decision-making accuracy; on the contrary, the performance tends to decrease. Some studies focus attention on the decision-making approach. For example, Bettis-Outland  2012  asserts that incre- mental decision-making produces less information overload than does compre- hensive decision making, as the former considers fewer alternatives in solving a problem, whereas the latter by nature leads managers to seek for all the possible alternative solutions  Bettis-Outland 2012 . However, it is very difﬁcult for com- panies operating under uncertain conditions to beneﬁt from the advantages of an incremental decision-making style.  The problem of information overload might not depend only on the accumula- tion of information; managers, in fact, could feel information overloaded because of the time pressure to accomplish their tasks and the inability to prioritize tasks optimally  Kock 2000a . Moreover, communication is another relevant aspect which could give rise to information overload. In fact, as shown by Meglio and Kleiner  1990 , in many cases information users contribute to information overload, since their communication is not effective enough  Meglio and Kleiner 1990 ; this point supports the idea that information overload could depend on the individuals  knowledge base, decision style  and on task-related factors  amount of information processes, task complexity, number of information exchange interactions   Kock 2000a . Another study on task-related factors shows that tasks characterized by frequent interruptions are more likely to produce information overload than are uninterrupted tasks  Speier et al. 1999 .   78  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  There is broad agreement in the literature on the fact that managers, in pursuing the aim of feeling more conﬁdent in solving problems or making decisions, seek more information than they need, a behavior favored by the emergence of the Internet  Kiley 2005 . Nowadays, in fact, acquiring, communicating and storing huge amounts of information is much easier and faster than in the past. Hence, whereas IT can help managers to support their decisions, it could also be used improperly  overused or misused , and by doing so increasing the information overload underload.  4.2.2 Links Between Information Overload Underload  and ERP Systems  Following the literature, it seems quite clear that the capacity of companies to efﬁciently manage data and information—which is a possible cause of information overload and information underload—largely depends on the quality of Information Systems  IS   Bera 2016; Melchor and Julián 2008; Petter et al. 2013a; Simperl et al. 2010 . Even though an IS represents a symbiotic relationship between system users and the system itself  Chandler 1982; Taylor 1982  aimed at processing information to support decisions, the literature shows that very often managers are faced with the paradoxical situation of having a lot of information available but ﬁnding it difﬁcult to select the information which is useful for supporting decisions  Edmunds and Morris 2000 .  To our knowledge the literature does not provide speciﬁc studies on the rela- tionship between ERP systems and information overload underload; however, considering the main causes of information overload underload described above, and taking into consideration the results of a preliminary study which partially conﬁrms that IS quality could affect information overload  Caserio and Trucco 2016 , we can hypothesize that a well-integrated IS based on an ERP system can also play an important role in dealing with information overload and underload. As a matter of fact, from an analysis of the literature we can deduce that information overload underload could be managed through an effective system which:  a  al- lows for the collection and integration of data in a single database  Chandler 1982; Chapman and Kihn 2009 ;  b  permits consistent information to be shared across different functional areas of a company  Robey et al. 2002a ;  c  improves the reliability, timeliness, comparability and relevance of accounting information for external and internal users  Hitt et al. 2002; Mauldin and Richtermeyer 2004; Poston and Grabski 2001 , enhancing the capacity to plan and manage the resources, thereby reducing the time needed to perform managerial activities and bringing beneﬁts to the quality of data and control activities in general  Caglio 2003; Quattrone and Hopper 2001 ; and  d  meets the users’ expectations, improving job performance and increasing job satisfaction  Morris and Venkatesh 2010; Thatcher et al. 2002 .   4.2 Literature Review Supporting the Research Design  79  The aforementioned points are all made possible by the capacities of an ERP system. Some studies, which compare legacy systems with ERP systems, conﬁrm that ERP capacities could improve data and information management, and thus counteract information overload and underload through:  cid:129  an increase in system quality, as ERP systems allow companies to manage several business functions with a comprehensive software, using shared infor- mation and data ﬂows  Lee and Lee 2000  and replacing legacy systems characterized by incompatible software;   cid:129  an increase in data quality, as ERP systems solve the typical problems of legacy systems  Xu et al. 2002a :  a  keeping the same data in different subsystems  i.e., in different sources ;  b  difﬁculties and slowness in accessing the data kept in another subsystem;  c  a lack of communication capacity.  Considering that ERP systems are implemented to improve data accuracy and data management through a comprehensive relational database which connects all aspects of the business and allows data and information to be shared inside the company, these systems could play an important role in reducing or in managing information overload and underload. Thus, our ﬁrst research question is:  cid:129  RQ 1a: “Do ERP systems matter to information overload and information  underload?”  4.2.3 Links Between Features of Information Flow  and ERP Systems  In addition to the possible relationship between ERP and information overload  underload, ERP systems may also affect the information ﬂow. In fact, an ERP system brings integration into the company, favoring a real-time sharing of infor- mation. However, while ERP solutions ensure a smooth ﬂow of information across the company, they also cause a real-time sharing of possible data entry mistakes, which would have a domino effect that impacts other business units  Bingi et al. 1999 .  Another reason why ERP might improve information ﬂow is that its imple- mentation often requires a preliminary Business Process Reengineering  BPR   Scheer and Habermann 2000 , which allows ﬁrms to assess, revise and reorganize their internal processes. In the context of business process optimization, ERP systems are generally adopted to achieve ﬂexible information ﬂows, obtain short planning cycles, make available up-to-date information and more timely communications, and eliminate data redundancy. As a result, they improve infor- mation processing capacity, enhance organizational communications and data vis- ibility  Dell’Orco and Giordano 2003 , and increase the productivity of work processes  Gupta and Kohli 2006 .   80  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  The most important potentialities of ERP emerging from the literature pertaining to information ﬂow refer to:  a  the capacity to improve data management and permit data integration and sharing  Chapman and Kihn 2009 ;  b  the possibility to share consistent information across different functional areas  Robey et al. 2002b ;  c  the capacity to improve the reliability, timeliness, comparability and relevance of information  Mauldin and Richtermeyer 2004; Poston and Grabski 2001 ;  d  the possibility to achieve ﬂexible information ﬂows  Scheer and Habermann 2000 . These potentialities may also affect the reporting system, which is part of the information ﬂow. In the absence of ERP systems, business units work in silos, each of them managing its own data. ERP-implementing companies instead take advantage of data integration, which could affect reporting system management. Joseph et al.  1996 , in a study of the relationship between external reporting and management accounting, suggest that information system integration, made pos- sible by technological innovation, allows managers to have online access to the information required for carrying out control tasks. Because managers can access a huge amount of information for both control and decision-making support, they do not need to wait for the periodic reports produced by management accountants. Even if this study did not speciﬁcally focus on ERP systems, Scapens and Jazayeri  2003  propose using the same line of reasoning: they suggest that the introduction of ERP systems may have important implications for the nature of management accounting, and thus of internal reporting.  The effects of ERP on internal reporting have also been studied by Sangster et al.  2009 , who found a slight decrease in the time spent on internal reporting by management accountants. Furthermore, they found that management accountants spend signiﬁcantly less time on data collection when the ERP has been successfully implemented. In these circumstances, management accountants have more time for data analysis, performance issues, control activities, and more time to produce a larger amount of reports than before  Sangster et al. 2009 .  Based on the above considerations, we pose the following research question, which aims at understanding whether the ERP system may  and in what way  affect the information ﬂow of the company. For “information ﬂow” we refer to a set of features emerging from the literature cited above, such as information processing capacity, communication and reporting, frequency of meeting, and information sharing.  cid:129  RQ1b: “Do ERP systems matter to the features of information ﬂow?”  4.2.4 Links Between Information Overload Underload  and Business Intelligence Systems  In addition to studies on ERP, legacy or integrated systems in general, scholars have also investigated the role of Business Intelligence  BI  system in counteracting   4.2 Literature Review Supporting the Research Design  81  information overload. In fact, while ERP systems may help to prevent information overload underload by assuring data quality and system integrity, BI systems could contribute to the solution of information overload underload by addressing the right information to the right decision maker at the right time  Burstein and Holsapple 2008 .  Unlike ERP systems, the literature provides several studies which analyze the link between information overload underload and BI, supporting the idea that an effective BI system may allow companies to manage, counteract or eliminate information overload underload. Boyer et al.  2010 , for example, recognizes the use of analytics, BI and performance management systems as a solution to this problem  Boyer et al. 2010 . Similarly, Spira  2011  proposes a solution based on the use of data mining, digital mapping, geographical information systems and online preservations to reveal patterns that would otherwise remain undiscovered  Spira 2011 . O’Brien and Marakas  2009  attribute great importance to the reporting system, stating that to reduce information overload underload, companies should adopt exception reports, issued only when exceptional conditions occur, instead of periodical standard reports  Brien and Marakas 2009 .  Other studies recognize the critical role of BI in reducing these anomalies on the Web. In particular, they recognize the role of knowledge discovery tools on the Web, which would help managers who need to analyze business data on the Internet, such as the competitive environment of their company, the market situa- tion, or the competitors that most resemble their company  Chung et al. 2005 . In the Web research ﬁeld, several studies support the relevance of visualization techniques in reducing information overload and supporting managers in exploring the knowledge on the Web  Lin 1997  by means of Web-mining and webpage clustering  Hartigan 1985; Marshall et al. 2004 , while other studies support the importance of social media analytics. The attention paid to social media analysis has increased considerably in recent years given the growing importance of Web 2.0, which provides a great source of information about consumer preferences, opinions, behavior and market trends  Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan 2013; Zeng et al. 2010 .  According to other studies, information overload underload could be counter- acted using an effective corporate portal, which allows companies to easily access all the digital enterprise information and knowledge by integrating structured with unstructured information through the Intranet  Detlor 2000; Dias 2001 .  However, the idea that BI could represent a solution is not unanimously shared by the literature. Li et al.  2009 , for example, believe that information problems caused by a lack of systematic information collection and processing makes BI tasks more and more difﬁcult  Li et al. 2009 . Following this idea, information overload and underload can be prevented rather than solved, and this prevention would be obtained by collecting proper data or information and applying data mining for the succeeding elaborations. Similarly, another study underlines that BI studies often ignore the importance of information selection and pay too much attention to the capacity of BI to gather and elaborate data and to exhaustively deﬁne information requirements  Blanco and Lesca 1998 . According to this study,   82  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  information overload and underload could be reduced by selecting the early warning signals, that is, information which is anticipatory in nature and thus has the ability to inform managers about future environmental and business changes.  The above literature about the role of BI in reducing, counteracting or managing information overload and underload allows us to deﬁne our second research question:  cid:129  RQ 2a: “Does Business Intelligence matter to information overload and infor-  mation underload?”  4.2.5 Links Between Features of Information Flow  and Business Intelligence Systems  The literature on BI systems shows that BI tools are also able to improve the information ﬂow within the company. In fact, the features of information ﬂow— information processing capacity, communication and reporting, frequency of meeting and information sharing—have often been examined in the literature. BI tools play an important role in improving both internal and external information ﬂow.  Regarding the latter, the study by Rud  2009  suggests that BI systems allow companies to shift from a reactive to a proactive management of customer needs. Unlike traditional BI tools, which forecast yearly demand and then plan the pro- duction, most recent BI solutions enable ﬁrms to achieve a real-time monitoring of customer needs, which, in turn, allows for a more effective and timely communi- cation between the market and the company.  Regarding the internal information ﬂow, there are many studies in the literature which demonstrate that BI makes it possible to facilitate real-time interactions between team members  Berthold et al. 2010; Horvath 2001; Matei 2010; Rizzi 2012; Rud 2009 . The role of collaborative ad hoc BI solutions is crucial for developing infrastructures which permit an information self-service for ﬁnal users and, consequently, a collaborative decision-making process  Berthold et al. 2010 . Collaboration is vital for creating business value: according to Horvath  2001 , in the context of Supply Chain Management  SCM , intelligent e-business networks provide the competitive advantage which allows the participants in a value chain to predominate and grow. Technological solutions applied to promote collaboration among the actors involved in the value chain are the key driver for the effectiveness of SCM, since they allow companies to follow the demand chain and to respond to the changing needs of customers  Horvath 2001 .  The effectiveness of the information ﬂow has also been improved by the impact of Web 2.0 platforms and of collaborative BI solutions. The former has changed the knowledge management paradigm from the “conventional” to the “conversational”  Lee and Lan 2007  by means of synchronous and asynchronous technologies that   4.2 Literature Review Supporting the Research Design  83  enhance the collaboration among people and allow information to be easily shared. The latter is a set of tools which promotes cooperation and data sharing not only within a company but also with other companies by means of more ﬂexible warehouse approaches  Rizzi 2012 .  The literature suggests that BI systems improve information ﬂow also through OLAP  On-Line Analytical Processing  reporting technologies, which are able to extract pertinent information based on data analysis and to turn it into knowledge and rapidly-generated reports  Ranjan 2009 . The above considerations lead to the following research question:  cid:129  RQ 2b: “Does a Business Intelligence system matter to the features of infor-  mation ﬂow?”  4.2.6 The Combined Use of ERP and Business Intelligence:  Information Overload Underload and Features of Information Flow  Summarizing the analysis performed so far, there are four different situations, as shown in Table 4.1: some companies may decide to adopt both an ERP system and a BI system  case 1 ; other companies can adopt an ERP system but not a BI system  case 2 ; conversely, other companies may decide to adopt a BI system but not an ERP system  case 3 ; others may adopt neither of the two systems  case 4 .  With reference to the above table, we wonder whether companies that adopt both an ERP and a BI system  case 1  are better able to handle the information overload and information underload than are companies that adopt only an ERP system or a BI system. The idea is that the combined use of the two systems may provide greater support to the information overload and underload problems. Thus, we formulate our third research question as follows:  cid:129  RQ 3a: “Does the combined adoption of ERP and BI systems matter more to information overload and information underload than does the single adoption of an ERP or BI system?”  Similarly, the simultaneous use of ERP and BI systems is expected to be more impactful on the information ﬂow features than the single adoption of ERP and BI would be. In fact, ERP systems may affect information ﬂow through:  Table 4.1 Possible cases of ERP and BI system adoption  Source Our presentation   Case 1 Adopting ERP system Adopting BI system  Case 2 Adopting ERP system Non-adopting BI system  Case 3 Non-adopting ERP system Adopting BI system  Case 4 Non-adopting ERP system Non-adopting BI system   84  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …   a  the BPR needed for the ERP implementation  Scheer and Habermann 2000 , since BPR allows ﬁrms to restructure the internal processes and thus the internal and external communication ﬂow;   b  the enhancement of organizational communications, data visibility and the productivity of work processes  Dell’Orco and Giordano 2003; Gupta and Kohli 2006 ;   c  the capacity to improve data management and allow data integration and  sharing  Chapman and Kihn 2009 ;   d  the possibility of sharing consistent information across different functional  areas  Robey et al. 2002b ;  Poston and Grabski 2001 ;   e  the capacity to improve information quality  Mauldin and Richtermeyer 2004;   f  the achievement of ﬂexible information ﬂows  Scheer and Habermann 2000 ;  g  the improvement of data integration and reporting systems  Scapens and  Jazayeri 2003 . On the other hand, BI systems can improve the information ﬂow within the  company because they:   a  support companies in proactively managing customer needs  Rud 2009 ;  b  provide tools for real-time monitoring of customer needs;  c  allow real-time interactions among team members  Berthold et al. 2010;  Horvath 2001; Matei 2010; Rizzi 2012; Rud 2009 ;   d  support a collaborative decision-making process  Berthold et al. 2010 ;  e  promote business value creation by enabling collaboration among the actors  involved in the value chain;   f  allow companies to adapt the demand to the changing needs of customers   g  improve knowledge management and the knowledge repository  Lee and Lan   h  improve the information ﬂow through OLAP reporting technologies  Ranjan   Horvath 2001 ;  2007; Rizzi 2012 ;  2009 .  Based on the above considerations, we pose the following research question:   cid:129  RQ 3b: “Does the combined adoption of ERP and BI systems matter more to the features of information ﬂow than does the single adoption of an ERP or BI system?”  4.2.7 Literature Review on Information Quality  The literature shows several contributions involving information quality: part of the literature considers information quality as a feature—or a driver—of information systems quality  DeLone and McLean 1992a; Nelson et al. 2005 , whereas other   4.2 Literature Review Supporting the Research Design  85  contributions in the literature attempt to assess the information quality by proposing frameworks or methodologies  Bovee et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2002; Stvilia et al. 2005 . Lee et al.  2002 , for example, try to identify the business areas which have a need for information quality improvements by analyzing ﬁve major organizations. The aim of their research is to propose a methodology for assessing and improving information quality within a company. Stvilia et al.  2005  propose an information quality assessment framework by considering several typologies of information quality problems, related activities, and a taxonomy of information quality.  DeLone and McLean  1992a , along with Nelson et al.  2005 , are instead examples of studies which involve information quality as an item affecting infor- mation system quality. Nelson et al.  2005  conducted a study on data warehouse users, developing a model based on nine determinants of IT environment quality, four of which were related to information quality. The interesting thing is that the information quality features—accuracy, completeness, currency and format of information—are believed to play a signiﬁcant role in explaining information system quality. Other studies, aimed at identifying the characteristics that make an information system of high-quality, emphasize the crucial role played by infor- mation quality  DeLone and McLean 1992b, Petter et al. 2013b .  Bessa et al.  2016  and Xu et al.  2013 , examine the determinants of information system quality, including among these information quality, also underlining that different, or more speciﬁc, needs can arise depending on the business and on the evolution of technology. Therefore, they indirectly suggest that information quality, along with information system quality, is a contingent factor.  These considerations are recognizable in a wide stream of studies on the role of data and information quality in improving the quality of information systems  Kahn et al. 2002; Madnick et al. 2009; Pipino et al. 2002; Redman and Blanton 1997; Xu et al. 2002b . Studies on the impacts of data and information quality have been carried out to trigger positive impacts and disable negative ones. Scant data quality could, in fact, cause difﬁculties in the retrieval of business records  Mikkelsen and Aasly 2005 , as it obstructs the possibility of providing the right information to the right stakeholder. Other studies underline that information quality is the basis for a quality decision-making process  Calvasina et al. 2009; Caserio 2011; Fisher et al. 2003 .  Information quality is thus a key factor for several reasons. The literature sug- gests several deﬁnitions of information quality, which, for example, could be considered as the ﬁtness of user needs, as deﬁned by Juran  1992  and Strong et al.  1997 . Other studies, in proposing a deﬁnition of information quality, focus attention on information users by considering that information quality is the capacity to meet or exceed information users’ expectations  Evans and Lindsay 2002; McClave et al. 1998 . Information quality can also be deﬁned as the coherence of information with regard to the speciﬁcations of the product or the service to which it refers  Kahn et al. 2002; Reeves and Bednar 1994; Zeithaml et al. 1990 . According to this interpretation, high-quality information provides an accurate representation and meets the requirements of the ﬁnal user. Naturally, the coherence and the usefulness of information also depend on the initial data quality   86  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …   Piattini et al. 2012 . The importance of the information user perspective is also conﬁrmed by the theory of information use environments suggested by Taylor  1991 , which states that the long-term information needs of users are directly linked to their professional activities. The focus of Redman  1992  is still on the information user, even though he uses a more structured deﬁnition: information is of higher quality if it is more satisfactory than other information the user needs. In an earlier work, Eppler  2003  deﬁnes information quality under a subjective and an objective dimension; the former is the ﬁtness of user expectations and the latter is the satisfaction of activity requirements.  In addition to the deﬁnitions of information quality, the literature provides some interpretations and dimensions of information quality. Information quality could be intrinsic, contextual, representational and related to accessibility  Lee et al. 2002; Ballou and Pazer 1985; DeLone and McLean 1992b; Goodhue 1995; Jarke and Vassiliou 1997; Wand and Wang 1996; Wang and Strong 1996; Zmud 1978 . The intrinsic information quality includes dimensions related to the accuracy, objectivity and precision of information; this interpretation derives from the initial theoretical bases of Gorry and Scott Morton’s  1971  framework regarding the information features of structured problems. Information quality could be contextual, as it depends on the capacity of information to be relevant, useful, complete, reliable and timely, able to add value and to meet users’ expectations, despite the continuous changes in the  external and internal  context. Information quality could be rep- resentational, that is, related to the capacity of the information to represent the problem to which it refers; information has to be understood and effectively implemented in the decision-making process.  According to some authors, the quality of information depends on several attributes, which could be summarized in three main dimensions  Marchi 1993; O’Brien and Marakas 2006 :  cid:129  time: the information must be provided when it is needed;  cid:129  content: information must be accurate, correct, relevant, complete, concise, and  reveal knowledge about what it refers to;   cid:129  form: the information must be clear, detailed, formatted as required, and ordered  in a sequence as needed.  Following another study, the dimensions of information quality could be listed in a more detailed manner, as shown in Table 4.2, which is adapted from Kahn et al.  2002 .  Interesting to note among the features of information quality are “appropriate amount of information”, “completeness” and “concise representation”, which, in a certain way, pertain to the information overload underload issues. For our purposes, we will consider information quality as the capacity of information the meet the decision-maker’s needs.   4.2 Literature Review Supporting the Research Design  87  Table 4.2 Features of information quality  Source Adapted from Kahn et al. 2002   Features Accessibility Appropriate amount of information Believability Completeness  Concise representation Consistent representation Ease of manipulation Free of error Interpretability  Objectivity Relevancy Reputation  Security Timeliness Understandability Value-added  Deﬁnitions The possibility to easily retrieve the information The coherence between the amount of information and the task to be carried out The truthfulness of the information The capacity of information to provide all the details useful for the task The correct synthesis analysis level of information The capacity of information to be provided in the same format The possibility to use the same information for different tasks The correctness and reliability of information The information is represented using an appropriate format, language, symbols The information is unbiased, neutral, impartial The helpfulness of information for the tasks The information is highly regarded in terms of its source or content The access restrictions to information are appropriately managed The capacity of information to be up-do-date The capacity to easily comprehend the information The capacity of information to be beneﬁcial and to bring advantages from its use  4.2.8 Links between Features of Information Flow  and Information Quality  Information quality has signiﬁcant economic implications for a company since non-quality information generates costs. These costs mainly pertain to the waste of time for decision makers trying to ﬁnd the most appropriate information for their needs. Poor information quality forces decision makers to interpret the inaccurate information, and inaccuracy may cause problems for the business activities  Farhoomand and Drury 2002 . The magnitude of the problem depends on the type of errors that inaccuracy may cause.  The costs of non-quality information also consist in data correction, the recovery of process failure and other similar activities, which consume more computing resources than would be necessary if the information were accurate. Similarly, because of non-quality information, redundant controls on data and information will need to be activated to prevent decision-making errors  English 2002 .  In this regard, the literature suggests that information overload is also one of the costs of poor information quality. In the presence of information overload, man- agers might not be able to effectively manage their decision-making process, as the   88  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  information available is too abundant, or irrelevant. In these situations, managers are not able to prioritize their tasks, and thus their decision-making process col- lapses  Kock 2000b . Interestingly, some studies recognize the costs of information overload as similar to those of non-quality information; in fact, information over- load is considered as a phenomenon which affects individuals, organizations and decision-making processes because it causes a waste of time in processing redun- dant information from multiple sources on the same topic  Farhoomand and Drury 2002; Yang et al. 2009 . When a manager receives  a lot of  irrelevant information instead of  a small amount of  relevant information, he she is not able to accomplish his her job. Therefore, a situation of information underload happens when managers receive less than the amount of information they would need to accomplish their decision-making process and when they receive irrelevant instead of relevant information  Kock 2000b; O’Reilly 1980 . Information overload often results from poor quality information; that is, uncertain, ambiguous and complex information  Schneider 1987 .  The link between information quality and information overload is also recog- nizable from the countermeasures suggested by some authors. For example, Eppler and Mengis  2004b  propose that, to avoid information overload, companies should implement intelligent information management, e-tools, decision support systems and information quality ﬁlters that can prioritize information and reduce a wide set of alternatives to a more manageable size. This implies that by improving some dimensions of information quality  such as relevancy, accessibility, credibility , information overload should also decrease. Other authors belong to this line of thought: they suggest that information overload could be reduced by investing in information visualization systems, which simplify the retrieval, recognition, pro- cessing and recall of information  Strother et al. 2012; Chen and Yu 2000 . Larkin and Simon  1987  show that visualization techniques dramatically improve peo- ple’s capacity to recognize patterns, distinguish various pieces of information, and focus on the most relevant ones. The authors show that these systems allow people to process information as experts could. The literature also reveals that experts are less subject to information overload than novices are when facing the same volume of information  Agnew and Szykman 2005; Swain and Haka 2000 . Taken together, these studies suggest that visualization is a possible countermeasure to information overload, as it increases information quality and the features of information ﬂow. Information processing capacity would increase by means of the synthetic and systemic representation of information; communication would improve because messages would be more selective and, consequently, reports would better signal the relevant the literature shows that information visualization techniques can improve the quality of information, as they reduce information complexity and help to focus on the relevant details  Burkhard and Meier 2005; Shneiderman 1996 .  information. As a conﬁrmation of this,  Furthermore, another study states that to reduce information distortion, and thus to improve the quality of shared information, it is necessary that the information shared be as accurate as possible  Li and Lin 2006 . In other words, this conﬁrms that features of information quality  such as accuracy  are linked to the features of   4.2 Literature Review Supporting the Research Design  89  information ﬂow  such as the sharing of information . Other authors consider the information ﬂow as an important dimension of information quality; in fact, an effective information ﬂow allows information system users to receive  Al-Hakim 2007 :  cid:129  complete information; that is, the correct amount of information;  cid:129  information selected on the base of relevancy;  cid:129  timely information;  cid:129  up-to-date information;  cid:129  information at the required time;  cid:129  accessible information.  Similarly, Bosset   1991 , Evans and Lindsay  2002  and Fadlalla and information ﬂow in Wickramasinghe  2004  emphasize the importance of improving the effectiveness of the decision-making process. Based on these con- siderations, we posit the following research question:  cid:129  RQ4: “Do the features of information ﬂow affect the information quality per-  ceived by managers?”  4.3 Sample Selection and Data Collection  To answer the research questions, we conducted a survey on a sample of 300 Italian managers of Italian listed and non-listed companies of different size. The partici- pants—Chief Information Ofﬁcers, Chief Technology Ofﬁcers, Chief Executive Ofﬁcers and Controllers—were randomly selected from the LinkedIn social net- work database, since some scholars have recently stressed the relevance and widespread use of this social media application  Albrecht 2011 . Furthermore, the growing interest paid to LinkedIn by practitioners has also been documented by the Association of Accounting Marketing  AAM 2011 .  The main aim of the survey is to test the research design and elicit preliminary evidence from our study  Gable 1994 . The survey was divided into 6 sections as follows:  1  personal data of the interviewees;  2  features of the ﬁrms;  3  the quality features of the accounting information system;  4  communication and reporting;  5  information overload and underload; and  6  overall judgement on IS and suggestions. Since the empirical analysis is based on a survey, most of the research variables measure the managers’ perceptions, which could be interpreted as their satisfaction with the survey issues  Dillman 2008 . We received back 79 answers, with a 26% rate of response.  A test on an early-late response was conducted on the control variables “gender”, “type of ﬁrms” and “sector” to check for differences in the two groups following a wave analysis proposed by Rogelberg and Stanton  Rogelberg and Stanton 2007 . The results of a two-sample t test with equal variances showed that the mean   90  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  differences of the variables were not statistically signiﬁcant, and therefore the hypothesis of bias between early and late respondents in the surveyed sample can be rejected. All the statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0.  4.4 Variable Measurement  4.4.1 Research Variable Measurement  Surveys are useful in deﬁning the research and control variables. In our study, the survey allows us to detect:  cid:129  ERP adoption  the survey question is “Does your ﬁrm adopt an ERP system?”  1 = Yes; 0 = No ; and   cid:129  Business Intelligence adoption  the survey question is “Does your ﬁrm use  systems of Business Intelligence?” 1 = Yes, 0 = No . We created the research variable “ERP and Business Intelligence”, which assumes a value of 1 when respondents adopt both ERP and Business Intelligence and a value of 0 when respondents do not adopt any of the two systems.  With reference to information processing capacity  Tables 4.3 and 4.4 , we use  the following items:  cid:129  Data accuracy  the survey question is “What is your perception of the accuracy  of data to perform your tasks?” 1 very low,…, 7 very high ;   cid:129  Timeliness of data;  the survey question is “What is your perception of the  timeliness of data to perform your tasks?” 1 very low,…, 7 very high ;   cid:129  System reliability  the survey question is “What is your perception of the capacity of the information system to address the right choice to the right person at the right moment?” 1 very low,…, 7 very high .  Regarding communication and reporting  Tables 4.5 and 4.6 , the items are:   cid:129  Monthly reporting frequency  the survey question is “What is, on average, the  number of reports issued in one month? 1 very low,…, 7 very high ;   cid:129  6-month reporting frequency  the survey question is “What is, on average, the number of reports issued over a six-months period? 1 very low,…, 7 very high ;  cid:129  Annual reporting frequency  the survey question is “What is, on average, the  number of reports issued annually?, 1 very low,…, 7 very high ;  Table 4.3 Items included in the information processing capacity research variable  Research variable Information processing capacity  Items in the research variable Data accuracy System reliability Timeliness of data   4.4 Variable Measurement  Table 4.4 Measurement of the items included in the information processing capacity research variable  91  Items in the research variable Data accuracy System reliability Timeliness of data  Scale of measurement Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7  Table 4.5 Items included in the communication and reporting research variable  Research variable Communication and reporting  Items in the research variable Flash reporting frequency Monthly reporting frequency 6-month reporting frequency Annual reporting frequency  Table 4.6 Measurement of the items included in the communication and reporting research variable  Items in the research variable Flash reporting frequency Monthly reporting frequency 6-month reporting frequency Annual reporting frequency  Scale of measurement Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7   cid:129  Flash reporting frequency  the survey question is “How often are ﬂash reports  issued? 1 very low,…, 7 very high .  With regard to Information Sharing  Tables 4.7 and 4.8 , we consider the fol-  lowing items:  cid:129  Satisfaction about  the sharing of information with colleagues at  the same hierarchical level  the survey question is “What is your satisfaction about the information sharing with colleagues at the same hierarchical level?” 1 very low, …, 7 very high ;   cid:129  Satisfaction about the sharing of information with colleagues at higher hierar- chical the information sharing with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels?” 1 very low, …, 7 very high .  levels  the survey question is “What  is your satisfaction about  With regard to Frequency of Meeting  Tables 4.9 and 4.10 , the items are:  Table 4.7 Items included in the information sharing research variable  Items in the research variable  Research variable Information sharing  Satisfaction about the sharing of information with colleagues at the same hierarchical level Satisfaction about the sharing of information with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels   92  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  Table 4.8 Measurement of the items included in information sharing research variable  Items in the research variable  Satisfaction about the sharing of information with colleagues at the same hierarchical level Satisfaction about the sharing of information with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels  Scale of measurement Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7   cid:129  Frequency of meetings with colleagues at the same hierarchical level  the survey question is “How often do you have meetings with colleagues at the same hierarchical level?” 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often ;   cid:129  Frequency of meetings with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels  the survey question is “How often do you have meetings with colleagues who belong to higher hierarchical levels?” 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often .  The perception of information overload and underload is measured according to the prior literature  O’Reilly 1980; Karr-Wisniewski and Lu 2010 . In particular, information underload is measured through the following items  Tables 4.11 and 4.12 :  cid:129  Less information  the survey question is “How often do you realize you have less than the amount of information you would need to make the best possible decision? 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often ;   cid:129  Fewer IT resources  the survey question is “How often do you realize you have fewer than the amount of IT resources you would need to make the best possible decision? 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often ;   cid:129  No information  the survey question is “How often do you feel you are not  receiving all the information you need? 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often .  The information overload is measured through the following items  Tables 4.13  and 4.14 :  cid:129  More information  the survey question is “How often do you realize you have more than the amount of information you would need?” 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often ;   cid:129  Too many IT resources  the survey question is “How often do you realize you have too many alternative technologies to use for the same problem?” 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often ;   cid:129  Too much information  the survey question is “How often do you realize you are receiving too much information with respect to the amount you would need? 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often ;  Table 4.9 Items included in the frequency of meeting research variable  Research variable Frequency of meeting  Items in the research variable Frequency of meetings with colleagues at the same hierarchical level Frequency of meetings with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels   4.4 Variable Measurement  93  Table 4.10 Measurement of the items included in the frequency of meeting research variable  Items in the research variable Frequency of meetings with colleagues at the same hierarchical level Frequency of meetings with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels  Scale of measurement Value on a scale of 1–7  Value on a scale of 1–7  Table 4.11 Items included in the information underload research variable  Research variable Information underload  Items in the research variable Fewer IT resources Less information No information  Table 4.12 Measurement of the items included in the information underload research variable  Items in the research variable Fewer IT Resources Less Information No Information  Scale of measurement Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7  Table 4.13 Items included in the information overload research variable  Research variable Information overload  Items in the research variable More IT resources More information Too many IT resources Too much information  Table 4.14 Measurement of the items included in the information overload research variable  Items in the research variable More IT resources More information Too many IT resources Too much information  Scale of measurement Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7 Value on a scale of 1–7   cid:129  More IT resources  the survey question is “How often do you realize you have  more IT resources than you would need?” 1 very rarely,…, 7 very often ;  We also use another research variable that measures the perception of respon- dents about the absence of both information overload and information underload. This variable is called “Perceived Information Quality”  the survey question is “To what extent do you perceive that the amount of information you receive is appropriate to allow you to optimally execute your tasks? ”1 very low,…, 7 very high . Therefore, we assume that this variable measures the respondents’ perception of information quality  Table 4.15 .   94  4 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  Table 4.15 Measurement of the perceived information quality research variable  Items in the research variable Perceived information quality  Scale of measurement Value on a scale of 1–7  4.4.2 Variable Measurement: Control Variables  The control variables, shown in Tables 4.16 and 4.17, regard either respondents’ features or ﬁrms’ features. The control variables for the former are the following:  cid:129  Role  1 if the respondent  is a Chief Information Ofﬁcer, 3 if the respondent is a Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, 4 if the respondent is head of the accounting information system, 5 if the respondent is Chief Technology Ofﬁcer, and 6 if the respondent is a Chief Financial Ofﬁcer ;  cid:129  Education  1 if the respondent has only a secondary school diploma, 2 if the respondent has a bachelor or master degree, 3 if the respondent has a post-master degree, 4 if the respondent has a PhD .  is a controller, 2 if the respondent   cid:129  Gender  0 if the respondent is a male and 1 if the respondent is a female .  The control variables for the ﬁrms’ features are:   cid:129  Firm size  1  if the respondent works in a small ﬁrm,  2  if the respondent works in a medium ﬁrm,  3  if the respondent works in a medium large ﬁrm, and  4  if the respondent works in a large ﬁrm ;   cid:129  Sector  1  if the ﬁrm belongs to the service sector,  2  if the ﬁrm belongs to the industrial sector,  3  if the ﬁrm belongs to the ﬁnancial sector, and  4  if the ﬁrm belongs to the public sector ;   cid:129  Type of ﬁrm  1  if the ﬁrm is listed,  2  if the ﬁrm is non-listed,  3  if the ﬁrm is  non-proﬁt, and  4  if the ﬁrm is public .

A principal component analysis is a statistical procedure which uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components  Niculescu et al. 2016 . the validity and reliability of the factor analysis, we performed a Keiser-Meyer-Olkin  KMO  test to determine the sampling adequacy  Kaiser 1960 , a Bartlett’s sphericity test  Snedecor and Cochran 1989 , and we used the analysis of Cronbach’s alpha to assess the scale reliability  Nunnally and Bernstein 1994 . We also checked for the eigenvalue of each item in order to determine how many factors should be retained in the analysis  Hayton et al. 2004 .  To test  Eigenvalues greater than 1 are associated with retained factors  Kaiser 1960 .

Similarly, the Bartlett’s test reports a satisfactory level of goodness-of-ﬁt for each component of the research variables  Snedecor and Cochran 1989 . Communality values are consistently higher than the threshold level of 0.50. The only two items showing a communality value below the threshold level are Flash Reporting Frequency, inside the research variable Communication and Reporting, and More Information, inside the research variable Information Overload. Both items are considered important in the accounting information literature: daily ﬂash reports are of increasing importance, especially in sectors when managers need to constantly track sales performance and related trends in order to deﬁne appropriate marketing policies  Bog et al. 2011  and when management requires a quick presentation of the overall ﬁnancial strength of the company  Basile et al. 2002 . The item “more information” represents the situation in which managers feel they need to receive more information than they would need to accomplish their tasks; this situation is considered by the literature as a condition of information overload to be avoided  Galbraith 1974; Wärzner et al. 2017 . However, searching for more information makes managers feel more conﬁdent and secure about the problems to be solved  O’Reilly 1980 .   4.5 Factor Analysis  99  Moreover, the scale reliability for each component is very good, achieving a level of 0.865 for Information Processing Capacity, 0.803 for Communication and Reporting, 0.674 for Information Sharing, 0.761 for Frequency of Meeting, 0.648 for Information Overload, and 0.860 for Information Underload.  The factor analysis conﬁrms the previous literature and frameworks by identi-  fying which items could be encompassed in each research variable.

Empirical results from the entire datasets of respondents demonstrated that respondents adopting an ERP or a BI system—or both an ERP and a BI system—do not perceive higher or lower information overload or information underload. Furthermore, respondents who have implemented an ERP perceive a higher level of information processing capacity, a higher level of communication and reporting, and a higher level of frequency of meeting than do respondents who have not implemented an ERP. Respondents who have implemented a BI perceive a higher level of infor- mation processing capacity compared to respondents who have not implemented a BI. Respondents who have implemented both an ERP and a BI system perceive a higher level of information processing capacity than do respondents who have not implemented an ERP or a BI. Results from the regression analysis show that information processing capacity has a positive effect on the information quality perceived by managers; therefore, if the information processing capacity increases, the information quality perceived by respondents increases as well. Furthermore, results show that communication and reporting has a negative effect on the infor- mation quality perceived by respondents, so that if communication and reporting increases, the information quality decreases.  5.1  Introduction  This chapter presents descriptive statistics and a correlation analysis of the research and control variables for the entire dataset  Sect. 5.2 . Section 5.3 proposes the research method, the t-test and the regression analysis; Sect. 5.4 presents empirical results from the regression analysis and the t-test applied to the entire dataset of respondents. These analyses allow us to answer the research questions presented in Chap. 4. Section 5.5 presents the empirical results for the sub-sample of Chief Information Ofﬁcers. Finally, Sect. 5.6 presents the summary results for the whole dataset of respondents and for the dataset of CIOs.    Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018 C.

In particular, Table 5.1 indicates that 78.5% of respondents declare they adopt ERP in their ﬁrms, 68.4% of respondents adopt Business Intelligence, and 60.7% of respondents adopt both ERP and Business Intelligence in their ﬁrms.  Table 5.2 shows that the highest mean value is linked to Information Sharing,  whereas the lowest mean value is linked to Information Overload.  Furthermore, we ranked research variables according to their mean value in a descending order, applying a one-sample t-test  Table 5.3  to determine whether the mean response was signiﬁcantly different from the indifference level  whose value is 4 . Table 5.3 shows that, among the research variables, Information Sharing and Information Overload show a signiﬁcant mean difference from the indifference level.  Table 5.4 shows the descriptive statistics for  the items included in the Information Processing Capacity variables. Regarding the items included in this variable, the highest mean value is linked to Data Accuracy, whereas the lowest mean value is linked to Timeliness of Data. Table 5.5 shows the descriptive statistics for the items included in the Communication and Reporting variable. For items included in this variable, the highest mean value is linked to Flash Reporting frequency, whereas the lowest mean value is linked to 6-month reporting frequency.

Furthermore, Information Processing Capacity has moderate negative correlations with Information Underload and Gender. Communication and Reporting has moderate positive correlations with Information Sharing, Frequency of Meeting and Firm Size. Information Sharing has moderate positive correlations with Frequency of Meeting, Perceived Information Quality and Firm Size, and a negative moderate correlation with Information Underload. Frequency of Meeting has moderate positive correlations with Perceived Information Quality and Firm Size and a negative moderate correlation with Gender. Information Underload has a moderate negative correlation with Perceived Information Quality. Information Overload has positive moderate correlations with Perceived Information Quality and Sector. Firm Size has a positive moderate cor- relation with Sector and a negative moderate correlation with Type of Firms.  The zero-order correlation analysis demonstrates that our results are not affected  by issues of collinearity  Cohen et al. 2013 .  5.3 Research Models  5.3.1 T-Test  We used non-parametric tests  Beattie and Pratt 2003; Beattie and Smith 2012  to answer our research questions and performed a t-test analysis to check for any differences between the perception of respondents  1  who adopted ERP and those who did not;  2  who adopted Business Intelligence and those who did not; and  3  who adopted both Business Intelligence and ERP and the other respondents. By doing so, we were able to answer RQ1a, RQ1b, RQ2a, RQ2b, RQ3a and RQ3b.  5.3.2 Regression Analysis for Research Variables  Furthermore, to answer research question 4  RQ4  we performed a regression analysis on the research variables  identiﬁed in Chap. 4  created based on the factor analysis  Chap. 4 .   110  m r ﬁ f o  e p y T  r o t c e S  e z i s  m  r i F  e l o R  n o i t a c u d E  r e d n e G  d e v i e c r e P  n o i t a m r o f n I  n o i t a m r o f n I  y t i l a u q  n o i t - a m r o f n i  d a o l r e v o  d a o l r e d n u  y c n e u q e r F  g n i t e e m  f o  n o i t a m r o f n I  n o i t a c i n u m m o C  g n i r a h s  g n i t r o p e r  d n a    s n o i t a v r e s b o  9 7    s e l b a i r a v  h c r a e s e r  e h t  f o  x i r t a m n o i t a l e r r o C  1 1 5  .  e l b a T  5 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  1  1 2 1  .  0  7 8 2  .  0  * * 0 5 3  .  0 −  2 0 0  .  0  1  * 1 3 2  .  0  0 4 0  .  0  1  0 3 1  .  0 −  3 5 2  .  0  2 7 1  .  0 −  9 2 1  .  0  5 3 0  .  0  1 6 7  .  0  1  8 8 1  .  0  7 9 0  .  0  1  0 9 0  .  0  2 3 4  .  0  8 6 9  .  0  5 0  .  0  9 3 1  .  0 −  3 2 2  .  0  6 1 2  .  0 −  6 5 0  .  0  1 5 0  .  0  4 5 6  .  0  4 8 0  .  0 −  0 6 4  .  0  6 5 0  .  0  1 2 6  .  0  6 8 0  .  0 −  9 6 4  .  0  1  0 5 1  .  0 −  5 0 2  .  0  * 0 6 2  .  0  7 2 0  .  0  4 6 1  .  0 −  6 6 1  .  0  3 8 0  .  0  3 8 4  .  0  8 2 0  .  0  6 1 8  .  0  6 8 0  .  0 −  9 6 4  .  0  1  * 6 8 2  .  0  4 1 0  .  0  1 0 0  .  0  3 9 9  .  0  4 2 1  .  0 −  4 9 2  .  0  4 8 0  .  0 −  9 7 4  .  0  1 7 1  .  0  9 4 1  .  0  * 3 7 2  .  0  9 1 0  .  0  8 4 0  .  0 −  5 8 6  .  0  1  * * 4 8 3  .  0 −  1 0 0  .  0  0 9 0  .  0  1 5 4  .  0  4 6 0  .  0  2 9 5  .  0  9 9 0  .  0 −  3 0 4  .  0  0 5 0  .  0  3 7 6  .  0  4 6 0  .  0 −  1 9 5  .  0  6 7 0  .  0  1 2 5  .  0  3 2 1  .  0  1 0 3  .  0  1  5 7 1  .  0 −  * * 7 3 3 0 −  .  9 3 1  .  0  2 3 1  .  0  7 6 2  .  0  * * 2 9 3  .  0  1 0 0  .  0  * 3 2 2  .  0 −  8 4 0  .  0  1 8 0  .  0  7 7 4  .  0  7 1 1  .  0 −  4 0 3  .  0  * * 8 2 3  .  0  3 0 0  .  0  5 6 0  .  0  8 6 5  .  0  2 2 1  .  0 −  3 8 2  .  0  1  * * 2 6 5 0  .  0 0 0 0  .  4 0 0 0  .  4 8 1 0  .  9 1 1 0  .  * * 6 2 4 0  .  0 0 0 0  .  1  7 9 1 0 −  .  1 8 0 0  .  1 8 1 0  .  0 1 1 0  .  5 9 1 0 −  .  6 8 0 0  .  7 8 1 0  .  8 9 0 0  .  7 9 0 0 −  .  6 9 3 0  .  8 2 1  .  0 −  2 6 2  .  0  y l e v i t c e p s e r  ,  0  d n a  1 0  .  0  d n a  ,  1 0  .  0  d n a  5 0 0  .  ,  5 0  .  0  d n a  0 1  .  0  n e e w t e b  e e r g e d  e c n a c ﬁ i n g i s  a  e t a c i d n i  * * *  , * *  , *  s t e k c a r b  n i  e r a  s e u l a v  p  * 8 3 2  .  0  5 3 0  .  0  * * 9 2 3 0  .  3 0 0 0  .  0 3 1 0 −  .  4 7 2 0  .  6 8 0 0  .  0 7 4 0  .  4 0 1 0  .  0 8 3 0  .  1  3 1 1 0 −  .  3 2 3 0  .  4 7 1 0  .  6 2 1 0  .  7 5 0 0 −  .  0 2 6 0  .  * 9 6 2 0  .  6 1 0 0  .  0 8 0 0 −  .  1 8 4 0  .  2 9 0  .  0 −  9 1 4  .  0  n o i t a m r o f n I  g n i s s e c o r p  y t i c a p a c  1  * * 6 3 3 0  .  2 0 0 0  .  * * 3 3 6  .  0  0 0 0  .  0  * * 4 6 5 0  .  0 0 0 0  .  * * 4 8 4 0 −  .  0 0 0 0  .  8 3 0 0  .  1 5 7 0  .  * * 9 7 5 0  .  0 0 0 0  .  * 5 6 2 0 −  .  8 1 0 0  .  5 8 1  .  0  2 0 1 0  .  2 8 1 0 −  .  9 0 1 0  .  2 4 1  .  0  2 1 2 0  .  6 4 0 0 −  .  0 9 6 0  .  2 1 1  .  0 −  8 2 3  .  0  n o i t a c i n u m m o C  g n i t r o p e r  d n a  n o i t a m r o f n I  g n i r a h s  f o  y c n e u q e r F  g n i t e e m  n o i t a m r o f n I  g n i s s e c o r p  y t i c a p a c  n o i t a m r o f n I  d a o l r e d n u  n o i t a m r o f n I  d a o l r e v o  n o i t a m r o f n i  d e v i e c r e P  y t i l a u q  r e d n e G  n o i t a c u d E  e z i s  m  r i F  r o t c e S  e l o R  m r ﬁ f o  e p y T   5.3 Research Models  111   1  Y = b0 + b1  Information Sharing + b4 Frequency  Information Processing Capacity + b2 Communication and of Meeting + b5 Information Overload + b7 Gender + b8  Reporting + b3 Information Underload + b6 Role + b9 Education + b10 Sector + b11 Type of ﬁrms + b12 Firm Size + e The dependent variable  Y  is the Perceived Information Quality and represents the information quality perceived by respondents; the independent variables are the research variables identiﬁed in Chap. 4, which represent the features of the infor- mation ﬂow.

Finally, respondents who have adopted an ERP perceive a higher level of frequency of meetings with colleagues at the same hierarchical level compared to respondents who have not  t-test is statistically signiﬁcant, p value = 0.062 . In terms of the other survey items, Table 5.15 shows that there are no statistically signiﬁcant differences in the perception of respondents who have or have not adopted an ERP system.  Table 5.16 shows that respondents who adopt a Business Intelligence system in their ﬁrms perceive a higher level of data accuracy than do respondents who do not use Business Intelligence  t-test is statistically signiﬁcant, p value = 0.025 . Furthermore, respondents who adopt Business Intelligence perceive a higher level of monthly reports than do respondents who have not  t-test is statistically signif- icant, p value = 0.040  and attribute a lower score to the No information variable with respect to respondents who have not adopted a Business Intelligence system  t-test is statistically signiﬁcant, p value = 0.035 . Therefore, respondents who adopt Business Intelligence perceive they are not receiving all the information they need more rarely than do those who do not adopt Business Intelligence. Regarding the other survey items in Table 5.16, the results show that there are no statistically signiﬁcant differences in the perception of respondents who adopt or do not adopt Business Intelligence systems.  Table 5.17 shows that respondents who adopt both an ERP and a Business Intelligence system perceive a higher level of data accuracy than do the other respondents in the sample  t-test is statistically signiﬁcant, p value = 0.012  and a higher level of system reliability  t-test is statistically signiﬁcant, p value = 0.076 . Additionally, respondents adopting both ERP and Business Intelligence perceive a higher number of reports issued in one month than do the other respondents  t-test is statistically signiﬁcant, p value = 0.029  and a lower level of no information  t-test is statistically signiﬁcant, p value = 0.089 . The results show that there are no other statistically signiﬁcant differences in the perception of respondents regarding the other survey items.   5 ERP and BI as Tools to Improve Information Quality …  Table 5.15 Results of the t-test analysis for items comparing respondents who adopt ERP with those who do not  116  Item  Number of observations 62 17 62 17 62 17 62 17 62 17 62 17 62 17 62  Data accuracy  with ERP  Data accuracy  without ERP  Timeliness of data  with ERP  Timeliness of data  without ERP  System reliability  with ERP  System reliability  without ERP  Monthly reporting frequency  with ERP  Monthly reporting frequency  without ERP  6-month reporting frequency  with ERP  6-month reporting frequency  without ERP  Annual reporting frequency  with ERP  Annual reporting frequency  without ERP  Flash reporting frequency  with ERP  Flash reporting frequency  without ERP  Satisfaction about the information sharing with colleagues at the same hierarchical level  with ERP  Satisfaction about the information sharing with colleagues at the same hierarchical level  without ERP  Satisfaction about the information sharing with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels  with ERP  Satisfaction about the information sharing with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels  without ERP  Frequency of meetings with colleagues at the same hierarchical level  with ERP  Frequency of meetings with colleagues at the same hierarchical level  without ERP  Frequency of meetings with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels  with ERP  Frequency of meetings with colleagues at higher hierarchical levels  without ERP  Less information  with ERP  Less information  without ERP  Fewer IT resources  with ERP  Fewer IT resources  without ERP  No information  with ERP  No information  without ERP  More information  with ERP   17  62  17  62  17  62  17  57 16 57 16 57 16 57  T-test  p value  0.013**  0.68  0.017**  0.063*  0.078*  0.196  0.049**  0.339  Mean Standard deviation 1.647 1.663 1.692 1.965 1.573 1.579 1.818 1.543 1.854 1.519 1.89 1.863 1.964 2.004 1.591  4.68 3.53 4.08 3.88 4.4 3.35 4.32 3.41 3.94 3.06 3.97 3.29 4.55 3.47 4.37  3.94  1.784  4.6  1.684  0.73  4.76  2.078  4.34  1.536  0.062*  3.53  1.663  3.95  1.634  0.258  3.41  2.063  3.75 4.25 4.11 4.25 3.63 3.94 2.63  1.714 1.483 1.934 2.049 1.867 1.526 1.345  0.297  0.795  0.55  0.65  continued    5.4 Empirical Results  Table 5.15  continued   117  Item  T-test  p value   More information  without ERP  More IT resources  with ERP  More IT resources  without ERP  Too much information  with ERP  Too much information  without ERP  Too many IT resources  with ERP  Too many IT resources  without ERP  *, **, *** indicate a signiﬁcance degree between 0.10 and 0.05, 0.05 and 0.01, and 0.01 and 0, respectively  2.81 2.51 2.5 2.25 2.69 2.35 2.81  0.982  0.245  0.28  Number of observations 16 57 16 57 16 57 16  Mean Standard deviation 1.601 1.283 1.506 1.272 1.922 1.203 1.94  5.4.2 Empirical Results for Regression Analysis  The results of the regression analysis for the entire dataset of respondents are reported in Table 5.18. This analysis allows us to answer RQ4  Do the features of information ﬂow affect the information quality perceived by managers? .  Empirical  respondents show that  results from the entire datasets of  the Information Quality perceived by respondents  Perceived Information Quality  is affected by Information Processing Capacity, Communication and Reporting, Information Underload, Information Overload and Education. In particular, the results show that Information Processing Capacity has a positive effect on the information quality perceived by managers  b: 0.467, p value: 0.001 ; therefore, if the information processing capacity increases, the information quality perceived by respondents increases as well. Furthermore, results show that Communication and Reporting has a negative effect on the information quality perceived by respondents  b: −0.169, p value: 0.096 , so that if Communication and Reporting increases, the information quality decreases.  Among the control variables, Information Underload has a negative effect on perceived information quality; therefore, if the Information Underload increases, the perceived information quality decreases. Moreover, results show that Information Overload has a positive effect on the information quality perceived by managers, so that if the information overload increases the perceived information quality increases as well.  Results from the regression analysis allow us to answer RQ4  Do the features of information ﬂow affect the information quality perceived by managers? . We found that some features of information ﬂow can affect the information quality perceived by managers; and Communication and Reporting affect the perceived information quality differently.

Low values for the VIF index  VIF < 10  and the correlation matrix entries allow us to reject the hypothesis of multicollinearity for the entire dataset of non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms  Cohen et al. 2013 .  5.5 Additional Analysis: Empirical Results on the Chief  Information Ofﬁcer Dataset  We carried out an additional analysis on Chief Information Ofﬁcers  CIOs , since this professional ﬁgure is responsible for the company’s IT system, and thus of the entire information ﬂow within a ﬁrm  Gottschalk 1999 . The relevance of his her role has particularly increased over the last few years  Bharadwaj 2000; Corsi and Trucco 2016 . Furthermore, CIOs represent the majority  46,8%  of respondents within our dataset. Therefore, we carried out the regression and the t-test analysis speciﬁcally on this category of interviewees, adopting the same model shown above.  5.5.1 Regression Analysis for Chief Information Ofﬁcers  To deepen our research, we performed a regression analysis on the research vari- ables for CIOs. The regression model can be expressed as follows:  Y = b0 + b1  Information Processing Capacity + b2 Communication and Reporting + b3 Information Sharing + b4 Frequency of Meeting + b5 Information Underload + b6 Education + b9 Sector + b10 Type of ﬁrms + b11 Firm Size + e  Information Overload + b7 Gender + b8  The dependent variable  Y  represents the Perceived Information Quality, whereas the independent variables are the research variables identiﬁed in Chap. 4, the information ﬂow. These variables are: which represent Information Processing Capacity, Communication and Reporting, Information Sharing, and Frequency of Meeting. The control variables are: Information Underload, Information Overload, Gender, Role, Sector, Type of Firms, and Firm Size.  the features of  5.5.2 Empirical Results of the Regression Analysis on Chief  Information Ofﬁcers  The results of the regression analysis on CIOs are reported in Table 5.20.

In particular, the results show that Information Processing Capacity has a positive effect on the information quality perceived by CIOs  b: 0.380, p value: 0.093 ; therefore if the information pro- cessing capacity increases, the information quality perceived by respondents increases as well. Furthermore, results show that Communication and Reporting has a negative effect on the information quality perceived by respondents  b: −0.330, p value: 0.038 , and thus if the Communication and Reporting increases, the information quality decreases.  Results allow us to better answer RQ4  Do the features of information ﬂow affect the information quality perceived by managers? . We found that some features of information ﬂow can affect the information quality perceived by managers, speciﬁcally that Information Processing Capacity and Communication and Reporting affect the Perceived Information Quality differently. Similar considera- tions could arise from an analysis of the entire dataset of respondents. The power of the model ﬁt is high  R2 = 55.1% .

The limitations and further developments of the research were also presented. In general, our results show that information overload is less perceived than information underload in all the comparisons performed in the research. The empirical results of our research concerning the relationship between ERP systems and information overload  underload show that ERP systems do not affect the perception of information overload underload. However, the empirical results show that respondents who adopt ERP perceive higher data accuracy, system reliability and, in general, a higher information processing capacity than do respondents who do not adopt an ERP. Furthermore, our results show that respondents who adopt BI systems do not perceive a different information overload underload compared with respondents who do not adopt. However, a more detailed analysis shows that managers of companies adopting BI systems perceive a higher data accuracy, a higher level of information processing capacity, and a more regular reporting system, based on more systematic frequency. Empirical evidence on the effects of the simultaneous adoption of ERP and BI on information overload underload and on the features of information ﬂow show that respondents adopting both an ERP and a BI system do not perceive higher or lower information overload or infor- mation underload than do the other respondents. Finally, our results conﬁrm prior studies on information processing capacity and information quality and suggest that reporting is one of the drivers of information quality.  level of  6.1  Introduction  This section presents the results of the theoretical and empirical analysis conducted in the previous chapters of this manuscript.  Information overload and information underload could represent a serious limit for a company, as they can compromise the effectiveness of the decision-making process. The literature shows quite clearly that information overload and underload    Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018 C. Caserio and S. Trucco, Enterprise Resource Planning and Business Intelligence Systems for Information Quality, Contributions to Management Science, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-3-319-77679-8_6  131   132  6 Concluding Remarks  reduce decision accuracy  Eppler and Mengis 2004  and, consequently, the per- formance of managers. Information overload happens whenever the quantity of information the individual receives surpasses her his capacity to process it  O’Reilly 1980 ; therefore, it happens more frequently in companies which face high environmental uncertainty, as they would need to adapt their information processing capacity to the changing conditions of the environment. Information underload occurs when the individual receives less information than she he would need to accomplish a task  O’Reilly 1980; Eppler and Mengis 2004 . Information underload may also occur when managers receive a large amount of irrelevant information. In this case, both information overload and information underload may occur as, on the one hand, the amount of information does not allow managers to perform their actions in a timely and effective manner, and on the other irrelevant information does not provide managers with the solutions to their problems, thereby causing information underload  Melinat et al. 2014; Letsholo and Pretorius 2016 . Information overload and information underload are also related to the time pressure managers feel in performing their job and to their possible incapacity to prioritize tasks optimally  Kock 2000 . According to the literature, information overload and underload may even be due to the wrong use of technology  Lee et al. 2016 . In fact, two contrasting types of behavior have been observed: on the one hand, companies invest in powerful IT tools in order to look for data, elaborate data, extract information, and undertake data mining, and in doing so produce plenty of data and information. On the other hand, companies invest in IT tools to deal with the information overload caused by the huge amount of data and information they need to manage. Therefore, if not appropriately used and not well-aligned with the management information needs and strategic goals, technology may even worsen the information overload and underload  Karr-Wisniewski and Lu 2010 .  The literature shows that managers’ perception of  information overload  underload may represent a signal of poor information quality and, consequently, a signal of low quality of information ﬂow  Kock 2000; Farhoomand and Drury 2002; Yang et al. 2009 .  There have been several studies on information quality: part of the literature considers information quality as a feature—or a driver—of the quality of information systems  DeLone and McLean 1992; Nelson et al. 2005 , whereas other contributions attempt to assess the information quality by proposing frameworks or methodologies  Lee et al. 2002; Bovee et al. 2003; Stvilia et al. 2005 . Furthermore, the literature suggests several deﬁnitions of information quality, which, for example, could be considered as the ﬁtness of user needs, as deﬁned by Juran  1992  and Strong et al.  1997 . Other studies, in proposing a deﬁnition of information quality, focus attention on information users by viewing information quality as the capacity to meet or exceed information users’ expectations  McClave et al. 1998; Evans and Lindsay 2002 . Information quality can also be deﬁned as the coherence of information with regard to the speciﬁcations of the product or the service to which it refers  Zeithaml et al. 1990; Reeves and Bednar 1994; Kahn et al. 2002 . According to this inter- pretation, high-quality information provides an accurate representation and meets the   6.1 Introduction  133  requirements of the ﬁnal user. Naturally, the coherence and the usefulness of information also depend on the initial data quality  Piattini et al. 2012 .  According to some authors, the quality of information depends on several attributes, which could be summarized in three main dimensions  Marchi 1993; O’Brien and Marakas 2006 : time, content and form.  Our research provides an investigation of information overload and underload, information quality and features of information ﬂow conducted through a survey on a sample of 79 Italian managers. Special focus is given to Chief Information Ofﬁcers  CIOs , since this role is responsible for a company’s IT system, and thus for the entire information ﬂow within a ﬁrm  Gottschalk 1999 . The role of the CIO has noticeably increased in the last few years  Bharadwaj 2000; Corsi and Trucco 2016 . Furthermore, among our respondents, CIOs represent the majority of our dataset, with 46.8% of respondents.  In general, our results show that the information overload is less perceived than is information underload in all the comparisons performed in our research  i.e.,  a  between respondents working in companies which adopt ERP systems and those working in companies that do not;  b  between respondents working in companies which adopt BI systems and those working in companies that do not;  c  between respondents working in companies which adopt both ERP and BI systems and the other respondents .  6.2 ERP, Information Overload Underload and Features  of Information Flow  The empirical results of our research on the relationship between ERP systems and information overload underload show that ERP systems do not affect the perception of information overload underload. The research variables used to measure the perception of information overload and underload are deﬁned on the basis of previous studies  O’Reilly 1980; Karr-Wisniewski and Lu 2010  and aim at investigating whether managers perceive a lack of information—or even an absence of information—or a lack of IT resources. T-test analyses demonstrate that the perceptions of managers regarding these variables does not change whether or not they adopt ERP systems. The same is also true for research variables which investigate whether managers perceive information overload and whether they perceive having received appropriate information. It the presence of an ERP system within the company does not alter the perception of managers about the quantity and the quality of information they receive to accomplish their tasks.  thus seems thus that  However, some effects of the implementation of ERP systems is recognizable in other items, which are indirectly connected to the quality of information. For example, empirical results show that respondents adopting ERP perceive higher data accuracy and system reliability and, in general, a higher information processing   134  6 Concluding Remarks  capacity than do respondents who have not adopted ERP. Furthermore, the results show that companies adopting ERP have a more structured reporting system, as information is more frequently communicated on a monthly or a 6-month basis, than do companies that do not adopt ERP.  These perceptions, although probably not connected to the perception of infor- mation overload underload, reveal that the use of ERP has a positive impact on information system quality and on the information quality items. This conﬁrms that part of the literature which supports the idea that ERP improves data quality, information quality and information system quality in general  Bingi et al. 1999; Dell’Orco and Giordano 2003; Chapman and Kihn 2009; Scapens and Jazayeri 2003 .  For respondents adopting ERP, the perception that they are using a more reliable system may be due to the impact that a comprehensive software like ERP has on data and system quality, as suggested by Lee and Lee 2000; Xu et al. 2002. In addition, empirical results show that ﬂash reporting is more frequently used in companies adopting ERP than in ﬁrms that do not; this is in line with the idea that in the presence of ERP systems management accountants can dedicate more time to data analysis and performance measurement, and thus have more time to produce a larger amount of reports  Sangster et al. 2009 .  Another signiﬁcant perception arising from our results is that respondents adopting an ERP perceive better internal job coordination, probably because the implementation of an ERP often requires a thorough reorganization  along with a Business Process Reengineering , which may result in more frequent meetings with colleagues at the same hierarchical level. This effect is also conﬁrmed by the literature, under different perspectives  Scheer and Habermann 2000 . Respondents’ perceptions on the quality of information ﬂow are also useful in understanding the effects of ERP implementation on information issues. In fact, respondents adopting ERP perceive a better capacity to process information, along with better commu- nication; these results are in line with the literature on the impacts of ERP on information ﬂow issues  Sangster et al. 2009; Poston and Grabski 2001; Mauldin and Richtermeyer 2004; Scheer and Habermann 2000 .  Interestingly,  the empirical results described above show that,  in general, respondents adopting ERP perceive a general improvement in several items directly or indirectly connected to information quality  such as data accuracy, system reli- ability, information processing capacity, and reporting system quality  compared with those who do not adopt ERP; but at the same time, respondents who adopt ERP do not perceive either an information overload or an information underload. Consequently, these results allow us to speculate that the absence of a perception of information overload or underload could be due to the improved information and reporting quality brought about by the ERP system.  Similar results were also obtained in the sub-sample of CIOs. Table 6.1 reports our research questions regarding the relationships between ERP systems and information overload underload and between ERP and informa- tion ﬂow, our empirical evidence, and the results from the main literature, which either conﬁrm or contradict our results.   6.3 BI, Information Overload Underload and Features of Information Flow  135  Table 6.1 ERP, information overload underload and information ﬂow: empirical evidence and the main literature  Research questions RQ 1a: “Do ERP systems matter to information overload and information underload?” RQ 1b: “Do ERP systems matter to the features of information ﬂow?”  Empirical evidence  cid:129  No information overload   underload perceptions either for respondents adopting ERP or for those not adopting ERP   cid:129  Respondents adopting ERP perceive higher information quality and better communication and information ﬂow  Main literature The results are in line with the main literature on the effects of ERP on data and information quality issues  Chandler 1982; Chapman and Kihn 2009; Robey et al. 2002; Hitt et al. 2002; Mauldin and Richtermeyer 2004; Poston and Grabski 2001; Lee and Lee 2000; Xu et al. 2002   6.3 BI, Information Overload Underload and Features  of Information Flow  The empirical evidence of our research on the relationship between BI systems and information overload underload show that BI systems do not affect the perception of information overload underload. Our results show that respondents adopting BI systems do not perceive a different level of information overload or underload than do respondents who do not adopt BI systems. However, a more detailed analysis shows that managers of companies adopting BI systems perceive higher data accuracy, a higher level of information processing capacity and a more regular reporting system, based on a systematic monthly frequency.  Regarding data accuracy, the literature shows that BI systems allow companies to collect data in data warehouses, to manage and analyse it, and to carry out data cleansing to improve data accuracy and completeness by supporting managers in selecting only the relevant data, and thus in providing appropriate information  Boyer et al. 2010; Brien and Marakas 2009; da Costa and Cugnasca 2010; Smith et al. 2012 . In terms of the capacity of BI systems to provide appropriate infor- mation, our empirical results also show that respondents who adopt BI systems perceive a higher information quality than do respondents who do not adopt BI.  Therefore, the higher data accuracy and information quality perceived by BI system adopters may be due to the improvements BI brings to the entire data-information-decision cycle.  Regarding the perception of respondents pertaining to the more regular reporting system, this result is probably an effect of BI system capacities, well-recognized by the literature, which consist in addressing the right information at the right time to the right person  Burstein and Holsapple 2008 . In fact, a regular and systematic reporting system could be the effect of an accurate reporting design process carried out before implementing a BI system. Successful BI implementation should, in fact, require managers to deﬁne the features of information and reports they will need,   136  6 Concluding Remarks  Table 6.2 Business Intelligence, information overload underload and information ﬂow: empirical evidence and the main literature  Research questions RQ 2a: “Does Business Intelligence matter to information overload and information underload?” RQ 2b: “Does a Business Intelligence system matter to the features of information ﬂow?”  Empirical evidence  cid:129  No information overload   underload perceptions either for respondents who adopt BI or those who do not   cid:129  Respondents adopting BI  perceive higher data accuracy, better information processing capacity, higher information quality, and a more structured reporting system  Main literature Results are not aligned with the main literature: BI was expected to improve information overload, as suggested by the literature  Boyer et al. 2010, Brien and Marakas 2009  At the same time, the results conﬁrm the literature regarding the role of BI in improving data accuracy, information processing capabilities, and information quality  Burstein and Holsapple 2008; Foshay and Kuziemsky 2014; Nita 2015; Eckerson 2005; Smith et al. 2012   including the frequency with which they wish to receive them  Eckerson 2005; Foshay and Kuziemsky 2014; Nita 2015 .  Another interesting result of our research is that respondents who do not adopt BI systems perceive more frequently that they are not receiving all the information they would need to accomplish their tasks. This probably occurs because, without a BI system, respondents are not provided with support in collecting, selecting, managing and analysing data. As a result, business data is probably disseminated in the company, but because it is not well-organized, collected and stored, managers perceive that data does not exist at all, or their decision-making needs. This is conﬁrmed by some studies which assert that without BI, obtaining information would require a long manual process  Kelly 2005 ; furthermore, other studies state that companies, because of environmental turbu- lence, are obliged to use business information more effectively than before, which is not possible without systematic information management  Imran and Tanveer 2015 .  is insufﬁcient  to meet  As a conﬁrmation of the above result, on the other hand, respondents adopting BI perceive a better information processing capacity due to the various opportu- nities BI systems provide for data elaboration and information ﬂow  Brien and Marakas 2009; Boyer et al. 2010; da Costa and Cugnasca 2010; Spira 2011; Smith et al. 2012 .  Table 6.2 summarizes our research questions pertaining to the role of BI in affecting information overload underload and information ﬂow, the empirical evi- dence obtained and the main literature, which conﬁrms or contradicts our results.   6.4 The Combination of ERP and BI for Information Overload Underload …  137  6.4 The Combination of ERP and BI for Information Overload Underload and Features of Information Flow  The empirical evidence on the effects of the simultaneous adoption of ERP and BI on information overload underload and on the features of information ﬂow show that respondents adopting both an ERP and a BI system do not perceive higher or lower information overload or information underload than do the other respondents. Similar considerations arise from the analysis of the CIO dataset. This is partially aligned with the literature, suggesting that information problems caused by a lack of systematic information collection and processing make BI tasks more and more difﬁcult  Li et al. 2009 . In other words, this result suggests that in companies where information collection and processing are not appropriately managed from the beginning, the potential beneﬁts of BI systems are weakly perceived or not per- ceived at all.  Interestingly, our results also show that respondents who have implemented both ERP and BI systems perceive a higher level of information processing capacity than do respondents who adopt only ERP or BI. Therefore, although managers do not perceive that ERP and BI improve information overload underload, they recognize that these systems improve the capacity of the company to process information. This evidence suggests that: either information overload and information underload are not perceived as problems, even if the beneﬁts of ERP and BI are clearly recognized, or information overload and underload are indeed problems, but remain implicit in the perception of managers, who instead ﬁnd it easier to recognize the improvement in a more tangible aspect such as information processing capacity.  Our results are thus not fully supported by the literature, which argues that the simultaneous use of ERP and BI systems is expected to have more inﬂuence on the information ﬂow features than would the single adoption of ERP or BI  Scheer and Habermann 2000; Horvath 2001; Chapman and Kihn 2009; Berthold et al. 2010   Table 6.3 .  6.5  Information Quality and Features of Information Flow  The literature on this topic suggests that features of information ﬂow are relevant for improving information quality  Swain and Haka 2000; Agnew and Szykman 2005 . In particular, information processing capacity would increase by means of the synthetic and systemic representation of information, and communication would improve by means of more selective messages  Shneiderman 1996; Burkhard and Meier 2005 . Other authors consider the information ﬂow as an important dimen- sion of information quality; in fact, an effective information ﬂow allows information   138  6 Concluding Remarks  Table 6.3 The simultaneous use of ERP and BI for information overload underload and information ﬂow: empirical evidence and the main literature  Research questions RQ 3a: “Does the combined adoption of ERP and BI systems matter more to information overload and information underload than does the single adoption of an ERP or BI system?” RQ 3b: “Does the combined adoption of ERP and BI systems matter more to the features of information ﬂow than does the single adoption of an ERP or BI system?”  Empirical evidence  cid:129  The results demonstrated  that respondents adopting an ERP and a BI do not perceive higher or lower information overload or information underload than do the other respondents  cid:129  Respondents who have  implemented both ERP and BI perceive a higher level of Information Processing Capacity than do respondents who have not implemented an ERP or a BI system  Main literature Results are partially aligned with the literature, suggesting that information problems caused by a lack of systematic information collection and processing make BI tasks more and more difﬁcult  Li et al. 2009 . BI studies often ignore the importance of information selection and pay too much attention to the capacity of BI to gather and elaborate data  Blanco and Lesca 1998  Results conﬁrm those in the literature concerning the role of ERP and BI systems in improving information processing capacity  Lee and Lan 2007; Ranjan 2009; Chapman and Kihn 2009   system users to receive complete, relevant, information  Al-Hakim 2007 .  timely, up-to-date and accessible  Our empirical evidence on the relationship between information quality and the features of information ﬂow show which of these features are able to affect the information quality perceived by managers. In particular, we found that information processing capacity and communication and reporting affect, in different ways, the perceived information quality. In fact, the results reveal that information processing capacity has a positive effect on the information quality perceived by managers; therefore, if the information processing capacity increases, the information quality perceived by respondents increases as well. On the contrary, the results show that communication and reporting has a negative effect on the information quality perceived by respondents; therefore, if the communication and reporting increases, the information quality decreases. This result shows a reduction in the quality of information due to an increase in reporting frequency. However, it would be nec- essary to carry out more in-depth investigations to understand the type of reporting that leads to a reduction in the perceived quality. For example, an increase in ﬂash reporting frequency denotes greater timeliness of communication; instead, an increase in the frequency of annual reports could mean a lack of timeliness  but a greater level of accuracy . In spite of this, the results are useful in understanding that reporting frequency is actually one of the drivers of information quality  Table 6.4 .  Similar considerations arise from an analysis of the dataset of CIOs.   6.6 Limitations and Further Development  139  Table 6.4 Information quality and features of information ﬂow  Research questions RQ 4: “Do the features of information ﬂow affect the information quality perceived by managers?”  Main literature Our results conﬁrm prior studies on information processing capacity and information quality  Shneiderman 1996; Burkhard and Meier 2005  Our results suggest that reporting is one of the drivers of information quality  Al-Hakim 2007; Sangster et al. 2009   Empirical evidence Results show that Information Processing Capacity has a positive effect on the information quality perceived by managers; therefore, if the information processing capacity increases, the information quality perceived by respondents increases as well Furthermore, results show that Communication and Reporting has a negative effect on the information quality perceived by respondents; therefore, if the Communication and Reporting increases, the information quality decreases  6.6 Limitations and Further Development  This section presents some limitations of our research. The ﬁrst limitation is related to the choice of the manager sample, which is not based on the industry. The literature actually suggests that ﬁrms belonging to industries characterized by high uncertainty are more likely to face information overload and underload compared with companies operating in more stable industries  Ho and Tang 2001 . Another the perception of limitation is linked to the small number of observations: respondents about information quality in general may depend on several endogenous factors such as the size of the company, the experience of the interviewees, and their role inside the company.  information overload and underload and about  In addition to extending the sample, it would be useful for future research to submit the survey to companies at two different moments: immediately before and immediately after the company makes an ERP BI investment. By doing so, it would be possible to compare the management perception of information overload  underload before and after the adoption of the new software. This would allow for a better perception of the effects of ERP and BI on the topic we have investigated. Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between the reporting system and information quality could be carried out by analyzing the role played by the single items of our research variable “Communication and Reporting” on information quality.
