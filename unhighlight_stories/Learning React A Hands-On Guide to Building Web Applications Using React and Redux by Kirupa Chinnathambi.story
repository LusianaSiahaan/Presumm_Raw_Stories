In 1999, before blogging was even a word, he started posting tutorials on kirupa.com. In the  years since then, he has written hundreds of articles, penned a few books  none as good as  this one, of course! , and recorded a bunch of videos you can find on YouTube. When he isn’t  writing or talking about web development, he spends his waking hours helping make the web  more awesome as a Program Manager at Microsoft. In his nonwaking hours, he is probably  sleeping—or writing about himself in the third person.

Acknowledgments First, none of this would be possible without the support and encouragement of my awesome  wife, Meena. If she hadn’t put her goals on hold to allow me to spend six months designing,  writing, and rewriting everything you see here, writing this book would have been a distant  dream.  Next, I’d like to thank my parents for always encouraging me to aimlessly wander and enjoy  free time doing what I like—such as teaching complete strangers via the Internet in the late  1990s how to do cool things with programming. I wouldn’t be half the rugged indoorsman  scholar warrior I am today without them both   .  On the publishing side, writing the words you see here is the easy part. Getting the book into  your hands is an amazingly complex process. The more I learn about all the moving pieces  involved, the more impressed I am with all the individuals who work tirelessly behind the  scenes to keep this amazing machinery running. To everyone at Pearson who made this  possible, thank you! There are a few people I’d like to explicitly call out, though. First, I’d like  to thank Mark Taber for continuing to give me opportunities to work together, Chris Zahn  for patiently addressing my numerous questions and concerns, Krista Hansing for turning my  version of English into something humanly understandable, and Loretta Yates for helping  make the connections a long time ago that made all of this happen. The technical content of  this book has been reviewed in great detail by my long-time friends and online collaborators  Kyle Murray  a.k.a. Krilnon  and Trevor McCauley  a.k.a. senocular . I can’t thank them  enough for their thorough  and, frequently, humorous!  feedback.   1 Introducing React  Ignoring for a moment that web apps today both look and feel nicer than they did back in the  day, something even more fundamental has changed. The way we architect and build web apps  is very different now. To highlight this, let’s take a look at the app in Figure 1.1.  Figure 1.1  An app.  Onward!  This app is a simple catalog browser for something. As with any app of this sort, you have your  usual set of pages revolving around a home page, a search results page, a details page, and so  on. In the following sections, let’s look at the two approaches we have for building this app.  Yes, in some mysterious fashion, this leads to us getting an overview of React as well.   2  Chapter 1  Introducing React  Old-School Multipage Design If you had to build this app a few years ago, you might have taken an approach that involved  multiple, individual pages. The flow would have looked something like Figure 1.2.  Figure 1.2  Multipage design.   New-School Single-Page Apps  3  For almost every action that changes what the browser displays, the web app navigates you to  a whole different page. This is a big deal, beyond just the less-than-stellar user experience users  will see as pages get torn down and redrawn. This has a big impact on how you maintain your  app state. Except for storing user data via cookies and some server-side mechanism, you simply  don’t need to care. Life is good.  New-School Single-Page Apps These days, going with a web app model that requires navigating between individual pages  seems dated—really dated. Check out Figure 1.3.  Figure 1.3  The individual page model is a bit dated, like this steam engine.  Instead, modern apps tend to adhere to what is known as a single-page app  SPA  model. This  model gives you a world in which you never navigate to different pages or ever even reload a  page. In this world, the different views of your app are loaded and unloaded into the same page  itself.  For our app, this looks something like Figure 1.4.   4  Chapter 1  Introducing React  Figure 1.4  Single-page app.  As users interact with our app, we replace the contents of the dotted red region with the data  and HTML that matches what the user is trying to do. The end result is a much more fluid  experience. You can even use a lot of visual techniques to have your new content transition  nicely, just like you might see in cool apps on your mobile device or desktop. This sort of stuff  is simply not possible when navigating to different pages.  All of this might sound a bit crazy if you’ve never heard of single-page apps, but there’s a very  good chance you’ve run into some of them in the wild. If you’ve ever used popular web apps  like Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, you’ve used a single-page app. In all those apps,  the content gets dynamically displayed without requiring you to refresh or navigate to a  different page.  Now, I’m making these single-page apps seem really complicated. That’s not entirely the case.  Thanks to a lot of great improvements in both JavaScript and a variety of third-party frame- works and libraries, building single-page apps has never been easier. That doesn’t mean there’s  no room for improvement, though.   New-School Single-Page Apps  5  When building single-page apps, you’ll encounter three major issues at some point:  1.  In a single-page application, you’ll spend the bulk of your time keeping your data in   sync with your UI. For example, if a user loads new content, do you explicitly clear out  the search field? Do you keep the active tab on a navigation element still visible? Which  elements do you keep on the page, and which do you destroy?  These are all problems that are unique to single-page apps. When navigating between  pages in the old model, we assumed everything in our UI would be destroyed and just  built back up again. This was never a problem.  2.  Manipulating the DOM is really, really slow. Manually querying elements, adding   children  see Figure 1.5 , removing subtrees, and performing other DOM operations is  one of the slowest things you can do in your browser. Unfortunately, in a single-page  app, you’ll be doing a lot of this. Manipulating the DOM is the primary way you are able  to react to user actions and display new content.  Figure 1.5  Adding children.  3.  Working with HTML templates can be a pain. Navigation in a single-page app is   nothing more than you dealing with fragments of HTML to represent whatever you want  to display. These fragments of HTML are often known as templates, and using JavaScript  to manipulate them and fill them out with data gets really complicated really quickly.   6  Chapter 1  Introducing React  To make things worse, depending on the framework you’re using, the way your templates  look and interact with data can vary wildly. For example, this is what defining and using a  template in Mustache looks like: var view = {   title: "Joe",   calc: function   {     return 2 + 4;   } };  var output = Mustache.render "{{title}} spends {{calc}}", view ;  Sometimes your templates look like clean HTML that you can proudly show off in front of  the class. Other times, your templates might be unintelligible, with a boatload of custom  tags designed to help map your HTML elements to some data.  Despite these shortcomings, single-page apps aren’t going anywhere. They are a part of the  present and will fully form the future of how web apps are built. That doesn’t mean you have  to tolerate these shortcomings, of course. Read on.  Meet React Facebook  and Instagram  decided that enough is enough. Given their huge experience with  single-page apps, they released a library called React to not only address these shortcomings,  but also change how we think about building single-page apps.  In the following sections, we look at the big things React brings to the table.   Meet React  7  Automatic UI State Management With single-page apps, keeping track of your UI and maintaining state is hard … and also very  time consuming. With React, you need to worry about only one thing: the final state of your  UI. It doesn’t matter what state your UI started out in. It doesn’t matter what series of steps  your users took to change the UI. All that matters is where your UI ended up  see Figure 1.6 .  Figure 1.6  The final or end state of your UI is what matters in React.  React takes care of everything else. It figures out what needs to happen to ensure that your UI  is represented properly so that all that state-management stuff is no longer your concern.  Lightning-Fast DOM Manipulation Because DOM modifications are really slow, you never modify the DOM directly using React.  Instead, you modify an in-memory virtual DOM  resembling what you see in Figure 1.7 .   8  Chapter 1  Introducing React  Figure 1.7   Imagine an in-memory virtual DOM that sort of looks like this.  Manipulating this virtual DOM is extremely fast, and React takes care of updating the real DOM  when the time is right. It does so by comparing the changes between your virtual DOM and the  real DOM, figuring out which changes actually matter, and making the fewest number of DOM  changes needed to keep everything up-to-date in a process called reconciliation.  APIs to Create Truly Composable UIs Instead of treating the visual elements in your app as one monolithic chunk, React encourages  you to break your visual elements into smaller and smaller components  see Figure 1.8 .   Meet React  9  Figure 1.8  An example of how the visuals of your app can be broken into smaller pieces.  As with everything else in programming, it’s a good idea to make things modular, compact, and  self-contained. React extends that well-worn idea to how we think about user interfaces. Many  of React’s core APIs revolve around making it easier to create smaller visual components that  can later be composed with other visual components to make larger and more complex visual  components—kind of like the Russian matryoshka dolls in Figure 1.9.  see Figure 1.8 :   10  Chapter 1  Introducing React  Figure 1.9  Russian matryoshka dolls.  This is one of the major ways React simplifies  and changes  how we think about building the  visuals for our web apps.  Visuals Defined Entirely in JavaScript While this sounds ridiculously crazy and outrageous, hear me out. Besides having a really  weird syntax, HTML templates have traditionally suffered from another major problem:  You are limited in the variety of things you can do inside them, which goes beyond simply  displaying data. If you want to choose a piece of UI to display based on a particular condition,  for example, you have to write JavaScript somewhere else in your app or use some weird  framework-specific templating command to make it work.  For example, here’s what a conditional statement inside an EmberJS template looks like:  {{if person}}   Welcome back, {{person.firstName}} {{person.lastName}}! {{else}}   Please log in. {{ if}}   Meet React  11  React does something pretty neat. By having your UI defined entirely in JavaScript, you get  to use all the rich functionality JavaScript provides for doing all sorts of things inside your  templates. You are limited only by what JavaScript supports, not limitations imposed by  your templating framework.  Now, when you think of visuals defined entirely in JavaScript, you’re probably thinking  something horrible that involves quotation marks, escape characters, and a whole lot of  createElement calls. Don’t worry. React allows you to  optionally  specify your visuals  using an HTML-like syntax known as JSX that lives fully alongside your JavaScript. Instead  of writing code to define your UI, you are basically specifying markup:  This same code defined in JavaScript would look like this:  ReactDOM.render           Batman       Iron Man       Nicolas Cage       Mega Man     ,   destination  ;  ReactDOM.render React.createElement    "div",   null,   React.createElement      "h1",     null,     "Batman"    ,   React.createElement      "h1",     null,     "Iron Man"    ,   React.createElement      "h1",     null,     "Nicolas Cage"    ,   React.createElement      "h1",     null,     "Mega Man"      , destination ;   12  Chapter 1  Introducing React  Yikes! Using JSX, you are able to easily define your visuals using a very familiar syntax, while  still getting all the power and flexibility that JavaScript provides.  Best of all, in React, your visuals and JavaScript often live in the same location. You no longer  have to jump among multiple files to define the look and behavior of one visual component.  This is templating done right.  Just the V in an MVC Architecture We’re almost done here! React is not a full-fledged framework that has an opinion on how  everything in your app should behave. Instead, React works primarily in the View layer, where  all of its worries and concerns revolve around keeping your visual elements up-to-date. This  means you’re free to use whatever you want for the M and C parts of your MVC  a.k.a. Model- View-Controller  architecture. This flexibility allows you to pick and choose technologies you  are familiar with, and it makes React useful not only for new web apps you create, but also for  existing apps you’d like to enhance without removing and refactoring a whole bunch of code.  Conclusion As new web frameworks and libraries go, React is a runaway success. It not only deals with the  most common problems developers face when building single-page apps, but it also throws in a  few additional tricks that make building the visuals for your single-page apps much easier. Since  it came out in 2013, React has also steadily found its way into popular web sites and apps that  you probably use. Besides Facebook and Instagram, some notable ones include the BBC, Khan  Academy, PayPal, Reddit, The New York Times, and Yahoo!, among many others.  This article was an introduction to what React does and why it does it. In subsequent chapters,  we’ll dive deeper into everything you’ve seen here and cover the technical details that will help  you successfully use React in your own projects. Stick around.   2 Building Your  First React App  Thanks to the previous chapter, you probably now know all about the backstory of React and how  it helps even your most complex user interfaces sing. For all the awesomeness that React brings to  the table, getting started with it  kind of like this sentence  is not the most straightforward. It has  a steep learning curve filled with many small and big hurdles, as in Figure 2.1.  Figure 2.1  Hurdles come in a variety of sizes. Some are big. Some are small.  In this chapter, we start at the very beginning and get our hands dirty by building a simple  React app. You’ll encounter some of these hurdles head-on, and some of these hurdles you’ll  skip over—for now. By the end of this chapter, not only will you have built something you can  proudly show off to your friends and family, but you’ll have set yourself up nicely for diving  deeper into all that React offers in future chapters.   14  Chapter 2  Building Your First React App   Dealing with JSX Before we start building our app, there’s an important point to cover first. React isn’t like many  JavaScript libraries you might have used. It doesn’t get too happy when you simply refer to  code you’ve written for it using a script tag. React is annoyingly special that way, and it has to  do with how React apps are built.  As you know, your web apps  and everything else your browser displays  are made up of HTML,  CSS, and JavaScript  see Figure 2.2 .  Figure 2.2  Web apps are built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It doesn’t matter whether your web app was written using React or some other library, such as  Angular, Knockout, or jQuery. The end result has to be some combination of HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript; otherwise, your browser really won’t know what to do.  Now, here’s where the special nature of React comes in. Besides normal HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript, the bulk of your React code will be written in JSX. As I mentioned in Chapter 1,  “Introducing React,” JSX is a language that allows you to easily mix JavaScript and HTML-like  tags to define user interface  UI  elements and their functionality. That sounds cool and all   and you’ll see JSX in action in just a few moments , but there’s a slight problem. Your browser  has no idea what to do with JSX.  To build a web app using React, we need a way to convert our JSX into plain old JavaScript that  your browser can understand  see Figure 2.3 .   Dealing with JSX  15  Figure 2.3  JSX needs to turn into something our browser understands.  If we don’t do this, our React app simply won’t work. That’s not cool. Fortunately, we have two  solutions to this:  1.  Set up a development environment around Node and a handful of build-tools.   In this environment, every time you perform a build, all of your JSX is automatically  converted into JS and placed on disk for you to reference like any plain JavaScript file.  2.  Let your browser automatically convert JSX to JavaScript at runtime. You specify   your JSX directly, just as you would any old piece of JavaScript, and your browser takes  care of the rest.  Both of these solutions have a place in our world, but let’s talk about the impact of each.  The first solution, while a bit complicated and time-consuming at first, is the way modern  web development is done these days. Besides compiling  transpiling, to be more accurate  your  JSX to JS, this approach enables you to take advantage of modules, better build tools, and a  bunch of other features that make building complex web apps somewhat manageable.  The second solution provides a quick and direct path in which you initially spend more time  writing code and less time fiddling with your development environment. To use this solution,  all you do is reference a script file. This script file takes care of turning the JSX into JS on page  load, and your React app comes to life without you having to do anything special to your  development environment.  For our introductory look at React, we are going to use the second solution. You might be wondering  why we don’t always use the second solution. The reason is that your browser takes a perfor- mance hit each time it translates JSX into JS. That is totally acceptable when learning how to  use React, but it is totally not acceptable when deploying your app for real-life use. Because of  that lack of acceptability, we will revisit all of this later, to look at the first solution and how to  set up your development environment after you’ve gotten your feet comfortably wet in React.   16  Chapter 2  Building Your First React App   Getting Your React On In the previous section, we looked at the two ways you have for ensuring that your React app  ends up as something your browser understands. In this section, we put all those words into  practice. First, you need a blank HTML page as your starting point.  Create a new HTML document with the following contents:                 React! React! React!                         This page has nothing interesting or exciting going for it, but let’s fix that by adding a  reference to the React library. Just below the title, add these two lines:         These two lines bring in both the core React library and the various things React needs to work  with the DOM. Without them, you aren’t building a React app at all.  Now, you aren’t done yet. You need to reference one more library. Just below these two script  tags, add the following line:      Here you’re adding a reference to the Babel JavaScript compiler  http:  babeljs.io  . Babel does  many cool things, but the one we care about is its capability to turn JSX into JavaScript.   Displaying Your Name  17  At this point, your HTML page should look as follows:                 React! React! React!                                        If you preview your page right now, you’ll notice that this page is still blank, with nothing  visible going on. That’s okay. We’re going to fix that next.  Displaying Your Name Now you’re going to use React to display your name onscreen. You do that by using a method  called render. Inside your empty script tag in the body, add the following:  Don’t worry if none of this makes sense at this point. Our goal is to get something to display  onscreen first, and we’ll make sense of what we did afterward. Now, before previewing this in  the page to see what happens, you need to designate this script block as something that Babel  can work its magic on. You do that is by setting the type attribute on the script tag to a value  of text babel:  ReactDOM.render     Sherlock Holmes ,   document.body  ;      ReactDOM.render       Sherlock Holmes ,     document.body    ;     18  Chapter 2  Building Your First React App   After you’ve made that change, preview what you have in your browser. You’ll see the words  Sherlock Holmes printed in giant letters, as in Figure 2.4.  Figure 2.4  Your browser should display Sherlock Holmes.  Congratulations! You’ve just built an app using React.  As apps go, this isn’t all that exciting. Chances are, your name isn’t even Sherlock Holmes. This  app doesn’t have much going for it, but it does introduce you to one of the most frequently  used methods you’ll use in the React universe: the ReactDOM.render method.  The render method takes two arguments:  1.  The HTML-like elements  a.k.a. JSX  you want to output  2.  The location in the DOM where React will render the JSX into  Here’s what our render method looks like:  ReactDOM.render     Sherlock Holmes ,   document.body  ;  Our first argument is the text Sherlock Holmes wrapped inside some h1 tags. This HTML-like  syntax inside your JavaScript is what JSX is all about. We’ll spend a lot more time drilling into  JSX a bit later, but I should mention this up front: It is every bit as crazy as it looks. Whenever  I see brackets and slashes in JavaScript, a part of me dies on the inside because of all the string    It’s All Still Familiar  19  escaping and quotation mark gibberish I will need to do. With JSX, you do none of that. You  just place your HTML-like content as is, just like you’ve done here. Magically  like the super- awesome kind involving dragons and laser beams , it all works.  The second argument is document.body. There’s nothing crazy or bizarre about this argument.  It simply specifies where the converted markup from the JSX will end up living in our DOM. In  our example, when the render method runs, the h1 tag  and everything inside it  is placed in  our document’s body element.  Now, the goal of this exercise wasn’t to display a name on the screen. It was to display your  name. Go ahead and modify your code to do that. In my case, the render method will look as  follows:  ReactDOM.render     Batman ,   document.body  ;  Well, it would look like that if my name were Batman! Anyway, if you preview your page now,  you’ll see your name displayed instead of Sherlock Holmes.  It’s All Still Familiar The JavaScript looks new and shiny thanks to JSX, but the end result your browser sees is nice  and clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To see this for yourself, let’s make a few alterations to  how our app behaves and looks.  Changing the Destination First we’ll change where the JSX gets output. Using JavaScript to place things directly in your  body element is never a good idea. A lot can go wrong, especially if you’re going to be mixing  React with other JS libraries and frameworks. The recommended path is to create a separate  element that you will treat as a new root element. This element will serve as the destination  your render method will use. To make this happen, go back to the HTML and add a div  element with an id value of container:                 ReactDOM.render         Batman ,       document.body      ;         20  Chapter 2  Building Your First React App   With the container div element safely defined, let’s modify the render method to use it  instead of document.body. Here’s one way of doing this:  ReactDOM.render     Batman ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  Another option is to do some things outside the render method itself:  var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;   ReactDOM.render     Batman ,   destination  ;  Notice that the destination variable stores the reference to your container DOM element.  Inside the render method, you simply reference the same destination variable instead of  writing the full element-finding syntax as part of the argument itself. The reason for this is  simple: I want to show you that you’re still writing JavaScript and that render is just another  boring old method that happens to take two arguments.  Styling It Up! Time for the last change before we call it a day. Right now, our names show up in whatever  default h1 styling the browser provides. That’s just terrible, so let’s fix that by adding some CSS.  Inside your head tag, let’s add a style block with the following CSS:      container {     padding: 50px;     background-color: EEE;   }   container h1 {     font-size: 144px;     font-family: sans-serif;      color: 0080A8;   }    After you’ve added everything, preview your page. Notice that the text appears to have a  little more purpose than it did earlier, when it relied entirely on the browser’s default styling   see Figure 2.5 .   It’s All Still Familiar  21  Figure 2.5  The result of adding the CSS.  This works because, after running all the React code, the DOM’s body contains our container  element with an h1 tag inside it. It doesn’t matter that the h1 tag was defined entirely inside  JavaScript in this JSX syntax or that your CSS was defined well outside the render method. The  end result of your React app is still going to be made up of some 100% organic  and cage-free!   HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If we had to see what this transpiled JavaScript looks like, it would  look a bit like the following:                 React! React! React!                             container {       padding: 50px;       background-color: EEE;     }     container h1 {       font-size: 144px;       font-family: sans-serif;       color: 0080A8;     }   22  Chapter 2  Building Your First React App                          var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;       ReactDOM.render React.createElement        "h1",       null,       "Batman"      , destination ;            Notice that there’s nary a trace of React-like code in sight.  Also, we should use the word nary  more often in everyday conversation!   Conclusion If this is your first time building a React app, we covered a lot of ground here. One of the  biggest takeaways is that React is different than other libraries because it uses a whole new  language called JSX to define what the visuals will look like. You got a very small glimpse of  that here when we defined the h1 tag inside the render method.  JSX’s impact goes beyond how you define your UI elements. It also alters how you build  your app as a whole. Because your browser can’t understand JSX in its native representation,  you need to use an intermediate step to convert that JSX into JavaScript. One approach is to  build your app to generate the transpiled JavaScript output to correspond to the JSX source.  Another approach  the one we used here  is to use the Babel library to translate the JSX into  JavaScript on the browser itself. While the performance hit of doing this is not recommended  for live production apps, when you’re familiarizing yourself with React, you can’t beat the  convenience.  In future chapters, we spend some time diving deeper into JSX and going beyond the render  method as we look at all the important things that make React tick.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask!

They’re one of the primary  ways you have for defining the visuals and interactions that make up what people see when  they use your app. Let’s say Figure 3.1 shows what your finished app looks like.  Figure 3.1  Your hypothetical finished app.  This is the finished sausage. During development, viewed through the lens of a React project,  things might look a little less appealing. Almost every part of this app’s visuals would be  wrapped inside a self-contained module known as a component. To highlight what “almost  every” means here, take a look at the diagram in Figure 3.2.   24  Chapter 3  Components in React  Figure 3.2  Diagrammatic representation of the app components.  Each dotted line represents an individual component that is responsible for both what you see  and any interactions that it is responsible for. Don’t let this scare you. While this looks really  complicated, you will soon see that it will start to make a whole lot of sense once you’ve had  a chance to play with components and some of the awesome things they do—or, at least, try  really hard to do.  Quick Review of Functions In JavaScript, you have functions that enable you to make your code a bit cleaner and more  reusable. Now, there’s reason we’re taking some time to look at functions, and it isn’t to annoy  you! Conceptually, functions share a lot of surface area with React components, and the easiest  way to understand what components do is to take a quick look at functions first.  In a terrible world where functions don’t exist, you might have some code that looks as follows:  var speed = 10; var time = 5; alert speed * time ;     Quick Review of Functions  25  var speed1 = 85; var time1 = 1.5; alert speed1 * time1 ;   var speed2 = 12; var time2 = 9; alert speed2 * time2 ;   var speed3 = 42; var time3 = 21; alert speed3 * time3 ;  function getDistance speed, time  {   var result = speed * time;   alert result ; }  getDistance 10, 5 ; getDistance 85, 1.5 ; getDistance 12, 9 ; getDistance 42, 21 ;  function formatDistance distance  {   return distance + " km"; }   function getDistance speed, time  {   var result = speed * time;   alert formatDistance result  ; }  In a really chill world that involves functions, you can condense all that duplicated text into  something simple, like the following:  Our getDistance function removes all the duplicated code you saw earlier, and it takes speed  and time as arguments to allow you to customize the calculation that gets returned.  To call this function, all you have to do is this:  Doesn’t this look nicer? Functions provide another great value, too. Your functions  such as  the alert inside getDistance  can call other functions as part of their running. Take a look  at using a formatDistance function to change what getDistance returns:  This capability to have functions call other functions enables us to cleanly separate what   functions do. You don’t need to have one monolithic function that does everything under  the sun; you can distribute functionality across many functions that are specialized for  a particular type of task.  Best of all, after you make changes to how your functions work, you don’t have to do anything  extra to see the results of those changes. If the function signature didn’t change, any existing  calls to that function will just magically work and automatically pick up any new changes you  made to the function itself.   26  Chapter 3  Components in React  In a nutshell, functions are awesome. I know that. You know that. That’s why all of the code  we write has them all over the place.  Changing How We Deal with UI I don’t think anybody will disagree with the good functions bring to the table. They really  make it possible to structure the code for your apps in a sane way. That same level of care we  use in writing our code isn’t always possible when it comes to writing our UIs. For various   technical and nontechnical reasons, we’ve always tolerated a certain level of sloppiness with  how we typically work with our UI elements.  That’s a pretty controversial statement, so let me highlight what I mean by looking at some  examples. Let’s go back and look at the render method we used in the previous chapter:  var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;   ReactDOM.render     Batman ,   destination  ;  Onscreen, you see the word Batman printed in giant letters, thanks to the h1 element. Let’s  change things up a bit. Say that we want to print the names of several other superheroes. To do  this, we modify our render method to look as follows:  var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;   ReactDOM.render           Batman       Iron Man       Nicolas Cage       Mega Man     ,   destination  ;  Notice what you see here. We emit a div that contains the four h1 elements with our  superhero  names.  Okay, so now we have four h1 elements that each contains the name of a superhero. What if  we want to change our h1 element to something like an h3 instead? We can manually update  all of these elements as follows:  var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;   ReactDOM.render           Batman       Iron Man    Changing How We Deal with UI  27       Nicolas Cage       Mega Man     ,   destination  ;  If you preview what we have, you’ll see something that looks a bit unstyled and plain   see Figure 3.3 .  Figure 3.3  Plain vanilla superhero names.  We don’t want to go crazy with the styling here. All we want to do is italicize all these names  by using the i tag, so let’s manually update what we render by making this change:  var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;   ReactDOM.render            Batman         Iron Man         Nicolas Cage         Mega Man      ,   destination  ;   28  Chapter 3  Components in React  We went through each h3 element and wrapped the content inside some i tags. Can you start  to see the problem here? What we are doing with our UI is no different than having code  that looks as follows:  var speed = 10; var time = 5; alert speed * time ;   var speed1 = 85; var time1 = 1.5; alert speed1 * time1 ;   var speed2 = 12; var time2 = 9; alert speed2 * time2 ;   var speed3 = 42; var time3 = 21; alert speed3 * time3 ;  Every change we want to make to our h1 or h3 elements needs to be duplicated for every  instance of them. What if we want to do something even more complex than just modifying  the appearance of our elements? What if we want to represent something more complex than  the simple examples we’re using so far? What we’re doing right now won’t scale; manually  updating every copy of what we want to modify is time-consuming. It is also boring.  Now, here’s a crazy thought: What if everything awesome that we looked at about functions could  somehow be applied to how we define our app’s visuals? Wouldn’t that solve all the inefficiencies  we’ve highlighted in this section? As it turns out, the answer to that “what if” forms the core of  what React is all about. It’s time for you to say hello to the component.  Meet the React Component The solution to all of our problems  even the existential ones we grapple with  can be found in  React components. React components are reusable chunks of JavaScript that output  via JSX  HTML  elements. That sounds really pedestrian for something capable of solving great things, but as  you start to build components and gradually turn up the complexity, you’ll see that compo- nents are really powerful and every bit as awesome as I’ve portrayed them.  Let’s start by building a couple of components together. To follow along, start with a blank  React document:                 React Components    Meet the React Component  29                                             Nothing exciting is going on in this page. As in the last chapter, this page is pretty barebones,  with just a reference to the React and Babel libraries and a div element that proudly sports  an id value of container.  Creating a Hello, World! Component Let’s start really simple. We want to use a component to help us print the famous “Hello,  world!” text to the screen. As we already know, using just the render method of ReactDOM  would give us code that looks as follows:  Let’s re-create all of this by using a component. React gives us several ways of creating   components, but we are going to create them by using the class syntax. Go ahead and add  the  following highlighted code just above the existing render method:  ReactDOM.render           Hello, world!     ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  class HelloWorld extends React.Component {   }   ReactDOM.render           Hello, world!     ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  If the class syntax is foreign to you, first check out my online tutorial Using Classes in  JavaScript  https:  www.kirupa.com javascript classy_way_to_create_objects.htm .   30  Chapter 3  Components in React  Getting back to our code, we have created a new component called HelloWorld. This is a  component because it extends React.Component. If it didn’t do that, it would just be an empty  class that doesn’t do much. Inside our class, you can put all sorts of methods to further define  what HelloWorld does. Some methods that you define are special, and React uses them to help  your components work their magic. One such mandatory property is render.  Go ahead and modify our HelloWorld component by adding the render method, as shown:  class HelloWorld extends React.Component {   render   {     } }  class HelloWorld extends React.Component {   render   {     return  Hello, componentized world!    } }  Just like the render method you saw a few moments earlier as part of ReactDOM.render, the  render function inside a component is also responsible for dealing with JSX. Let’s modify our  render function to return Hello, componentized world!. Add the following highlighted line:  You’ve told the render function to return the JSX that represents the Hello, componentized  world! text. All that remains is to actually use this component. You use a component after  you’ve defined it by calling it. Here we call it from our old friend, the ReactDOM.render  method.  The way you call a component from it is a bit unique. Go ahead and replace the first argument  to ReactDOM.render with the following:  ReactDOM.render     ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  That isn’t a typo! The JSX we use for calling our HelloWorld component is the very HTML-like   . If you preview your page in your browser, you’ll see the text Hello, compo- nentized world! showing up on your screen. If you were holding your breath in suspense, you  can relax.  If you have difficulty relaxing after seeing the syntax we used for calling HelloWorld, stare at  the circle in Figure 3.4 a few moments.   Meet the React Component  31  Figure 3.4  Just some lighthearted distraction!  Okay, back to reality. What we’ve done so far might seem crazy, but simply think of your    component as a cool and new HTML tag whose functionality you fully have  control over. This means you can do all sorts of HTML-y things to it.  For example, go ahead and modify our ReactDOM.render method to look as follows:  ReactDOM.render               ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  We wrapped our call to the HelloWorld component inside a div element, and if you preview  this in your browser, everything still works. Let’s go one step further! Instead of having just    32  Chapter 3  Components in React  a single call to HelloWorld, let’s make a bunch of calls. Modify our ReactDOM.render method  to now look as follows:  ReactDOM.render                                             ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  class HelloWorld extends React.Component {   render   {     return  Hello, world!    } }  Now you’ll see is a bunch of Hello, componentized world! text instances appear. Let’s do one  more thing before we move on to something shinier. Go back to our HelloWorld component  declaration and change the text you return to the more traditional Hello, world! value:  Make this one change and then preview your example. This time around, all the various  HelloWorld calls we specified earlier return Hello, world! to the screen. No need to manually  modify every HelloWorld call—that’s a good thing!  Specifying Properties Right now, our component does just one thing. It prints Hello, world! to the screen—and only  that! That’s the equivalent of having a JavaScript function that looks like this:  Except for one very specific case, that JavaScript function doesn’t seem very useful, does it? To  increase the usefulness of this function, we need to modify it to take arguments:  function getDistance   {   alert "42km" ; }  function getDistance speed, time  {   var result = speed * time;   alert result ; }  Now this function can be used more generally for a variety of situations, not just one whose  output will be 42km.  Something similar applies to your components as well. Just as with functions, you can pass in  arguments that alter what your component does. There’s a slight terminology update you need    Meet the React Component  33  to be on top of. What we call arguments in the function world are known as properties in the  component world. Let’s see these properties in action!  You’re now going to modify the HelloWorld component to allow you to specify who or what  you greet besides the generic World. For example, imagine being able to specify Bono as part of  the HelloWorld call and seeing Hello, Bono! appear onscreen.  To add properties to a component, you need to follow two parts of instructions.  First Part: Updating the Component Definition Right now, our HelloWorld component is hard-coded to always send out Hello, world! as part  of its return value. We first need to change that behavior by having the return statement print  out the value passed in by a property. We need a name to give our property; for this example,  we call our property greetTarget.  To specify the value of greetTarget as part of our component, we need to make this  modification:  class HelloWorld extends React.Component {   render   {     return  Hello, {this.props.greetTarget}!    } }  You access a property by referencing it via the this.props property that every component has  access to. Notice how you specify this property: You place it inside curly brackets, { and }. In JSX,  if you want something to get evaluated as an expression, you need to wrap that something inside curly  brackets. If you don’t do that, you’ll see the raw text this.props.greetTarget printed out.  Second Part: Modifying the Component Call After you’ve updated the component definition, all that remains is to pass in the property value  as part of the component call. This is done by adding an attribute with the same name as the  property, followed by the value you want to pass in. In our example, that involves modifying  the HelloWorld call with the greetTarget attribute and the value you want to give it.  Go ahead and modify the HelloWorld calls as follows:  ReactDOM.render                                             ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;   34  Chapter 3  Components in React  Each HelloWorld call now has the greetTarget attribute, along with the name of a super- hero  or equivalent mythical being  that we want to greet. If you preview this example in the  browser, you’ll see the greetings happily printed out onscreen.  One last point is important to call out before we move on. You are not limited to having just a  single property on a component. You can have as many properties as you want, and your props  property will easily accommodate any property requests you have without making any fuss.  Dealing with Children A few sections ago, I mentioned that components  in JSX  are very similar to regular HTML  elements. You saw that when you wrapped a component inside a div element or specified an  attribute and value as part of specifying properties. Just as you can have many HTML elements,  your components can have children.  This means you can do something like this:       Something!     Here you have a component very cleverly called CleverComponent, and it has a p element as  a child. From within CleverComponent, you have the capability to access the p child element   and any children it has  via the children property accessed by this.props.children.  To make sense of all this, let’s look at another really simple example. This time around, we have  a component called Buttonify that wraps its children inside a button. The component looks  like this:  class Buttonify extends React.Component {   render   {     return                   {this.props.children}               ;   } }  You can use this component by calling it via the ReactDOM.render method, as shown here:  ReactDOM.render           SEND DATA     ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  When this code runs, given what the JSX in the Buttonify component’s render method  looked like, you see the words SEND DATA wrapped inside a button element. With the   appropriate styling, the result could look comically large, as in Figure 3.5.   Conclusion  35  Figure 3.5  A large Send Data button.  Getting back to the JSX, notice that we specify a custom property called behavior. This property  allows us to specify the button element’s type attribute, and you can see us accessing it via  this.props.behavior in the component definition’s render method.  There’s more to accessing a component’s children than what you’ve seen here. For example,  if your child element is just some text, the this.props.children property returns a string.  If your child element is just a single element  as in our example , the this.props.children  property returns a single component that is not wrapped inside an array. We still need to call  out a few more things, but instead of enumerating all the cases and boring you, we’ll bring up  those points later as we look at more elaborate examples.  Conclusion If you want to build an app using React, you can’t wander too far without having to use a  component. Trying to build a React app without using a component is kind of like building a  JavaScript-based app without using functions. I’m not saying that it can’t be done; it’s just one  of those things you don’t do—kind of like the Bad Idea part of the popular Animaniacs Good  Idea Bad Idea sketches  https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=2dJOIf4mdus .  If this witty video doesn’t convince you that you should learn to embrace components, I don’t  know what will—except for maybe a future chapter on creating complex components!

This page intentionally left blank    4 Styling in React  For generations, mankind  and probably really smart dolphins  has styled HTML content using  CSS. Things were good. CSS had good separation between content and presentation. The selec- tor syntax offered a lot of flexibility in choosing which elements to style and which ones to  skip. We couldn’t even find many reasons to hate the whole cascading thing CSS is all about.  Well, don’t tell React that. React doesn’t actively hate CSS, but it has a different view when it  comes to styling content. As you’ve seen, one of React’s core ideas is to make an app’s visual  pieces self-contained and reusable. That’s why the HTML elements and the JavaScript that  impacts them are in the same bucket, called a component. You got a taste of that in the   previous chapter.  What about how the HTML elements look  a.k.a. their styling ? Where should they go? You can  probably guess where we’re going with this. You can’t have a self-contained piece of UI when  the styling for it is defined somewhere else. That’s why React encourages you to specify how  your elements look right alongside the HTML and the JavaScript. In this tutorial, you’ll learn all  about this mysterious  and possibly scandalous  approach for styling your content. Of course,  we also look at how to use CSS. There’s room for both approaches, even if React might sort of,  kind of not think so.  Displaying Some Vowels To learn how to style React content, let’s work together on a  totally sweet and exciting   example that simply displays vowels on a page. First, you’ll need a blank HTML page that will  host your React content. Create a new HTML document and add the following content into it:                 Styling in React         38  Chapter 4  Styling in React                      container {       padding: 50px;       background-color: FFF;     }                         To display the vowels, you need to add some React-specific code. Just below the container  div element, add the following:      var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;     class Letter extends React.Component {     render   {       return                      {this.props.children}                  ;     }   }     ReactDOM.render               A         E         I         O         U       ,     destination    ;     Displaying Some Vowels  39  From what you learned about components earlier, nothing here should be a mystery. You’re  creating a component called Letter that is responsible for wrapping your vowels inside  a div element.  If you preview your page, you’ll see something boring that looks like Figure 4.1.  Figure 4.1  A boring output of what you see.  Don’t worry, you’ll make it look a little less boring in a few moments. After you’ve had a run at  these letters, you’ll see something that looks more like Figure 4.2.  Figure 4.2  What our result looks like with some styling applied!  The vowels will be wrapped in a yellow background, aligned horizontally, with a fancy  monospace font. Let’s look at how to do all of this both in CSS and using React’s newfangled  approach.   40  Chapter 4  Styling in React  Styling React Content Using CSS Using CSS to style React content is actually as straightforward as you can imagine it to be.  Because React ends up spitting out regular HTML tags, all of the various CSS tricks you’ve  learned over the years for styling HTML still apply. You just need to keep a few minor points  in mind.  Understand the Generated HTML Before you can use CSS, you need to get a feel for how the HTML that React spits out is  going to look. You can easily figure that out by looking at the JSX defined inside the render  methods. The parent render method is our ReactDOM-based one, and it looks as follows:       A     E     I     O     U         {this.props.children}    We have our various Letter components wrapped inside a div. Nothing too exciting here. The  render method inside our Letter component isn’t that much different, either:  As you can see, each individual vowel is wrapped inside its own set of div tags. If you play this  all out  such as previewing our example in a browser , the final DOM structure for our vowels  would look like Figure 4.3.  Figure 4.3  The preview from inside the browser.   Styling React Content Using CSS  41  We have simply an HTML-ized expansion of the various JSX fragments you saw in the render  method a few moments ago, with our vowels nested inside a bunch of div elements.  Just Style It Already! When you understand the HTML arrangement of the things you want to style, the hard part is  done. Now comes the fun and familiar part of defining style selectors and specifying the prop- erties you want to set. To affect the inner div elements, add the following inside the style tag:  div div div {   padding: 10px;   margin: 10px;   background-color: FFDE00;   color: 333;   display: inline-block;   font-family: monospace;   font-size: 32px;   text-align: center; }  class Letter extends React.Component {   render   {     return                   {this.props.children}              ;   } }  The div div div selector ensures that we style the right things. The end result will be our  vowels styled to look exactly like we set out to. With that said, a style selector of div div div  looks a bit odd, doesn’t it? It’s too generic. In apps with more than three div elements  which  is common , you can end up styling the wrong things. At times like these, you will want to  change the HTML that React generates to make the content more easily styleable.  We address this by giving our inner div elements a class value of letter. Here is where JSX  differs from HTML. Make the following highlighted change:  Notice that we designate the class value by using the className attribute instead of the class  attribute. This is because the word class is a special keyword in JavaScript. If that doesn’t make  any sense, don’t worry about it for now; we’ll cover it later.  After you’ve given your div a className attribute value of letter, there’s just one more thing  to do. Modify the CSS selector to target the div elements more cleanly:  .letter {   padding: 10px;   margin: 10px;   42  Chapter 4  Styling in React    background-color: FFDE00;   color: 333;   display: inline-block;   font-family: monospace;   font-size: 32px;   text-align: center; }  As you can see, using CSS is a perfectly viable way to style the content in your React-based  apps. In the next section, we look at how to style content using the approach React prefers.  Styling Content the React Way React favors an inline approach for styling content that doesn’t use CSS. That might seem a bit  strange at first, but it’s designed to make your visuals more reusable. The goal is to make your  components little black boxes where everything related to how your UI looks and works is  stashed. Let’s see this in action.  Continuing our example from earlier, remove the .letter style rule. Your vowels will return  to their unstyled state when you preview your app in the browser. For completeness, you  should also remove the className declaration from the Letter component’s render function.  There’s no point having your markup contain pieces you won’t be using.  Now let’s revert the Letter component to its original state:  class Letter extends React.Component {   render   {     return                   {this.props.children}              ;   } }  You specify styles inside your component by defining an object whose content is the CSS prop- erties and their values. When you have that object, you assign that object to the JSX elements  you want to style by using the style attribute. This will make more sense when you perform  these two steps yourself, so let’s apply all of this to style the output of the Letter component.  Creating a Style Object Let’s get right to it by defining our object that contains the styles we want to apply:  class Letter extends React.Component {   render   {     var letterStyle = {       padding: 10,       margin: 10,   Styling Content the React Way  43        backgroundColor: "FFDE00",       color: "333",       display: "inline-block",       fontFamily: "monospace",       fontSize: 32,       textAlign: "center"     };       return                   {this.props.children}              ;   } }  We have an object called letterStyle, and the properties inside it are just CSS property names  and their value. If you’ve never defined CSS properties in JavaScript  by setting object.style ,  the formula for converting them into something JavaScript-friendly is pretty simple:  1.  Single-word CSS properties  such as padding, margin, and color  remain unchanged.  2.  Multiword CSS properties with a dash in them  such as background-color,   font-family, and border-radius  are turned into one camel-case word, with the  dash removed and the first letter of the second word capitalized. For example, using  our example properties, background-color becomes backgroundColor, font-family  becomes fontFamily, and border-radius becomes borderRadius.  Our letterStyle object and its properties are pretty much a direct JavaScript translation of  the .letter style rule we looked at a few moments ago. All that remains now is to assign this  object to the element we want to style.  Actually Styling Our Content Now that we have our object containing the styles we want to apply, the rest is easy. Find the  element you want to apply the style on and set the style attribute to refer to that object. In our  case, that is the div element returned by our Letter component’s render function.  Take a look at the highlighted line to see how this is done for our example:  class Letter extends React.Component {   render   {     var letterStyle = {       padding: 10,       margin: 10,       backgroundColor: "FFDE00",   44  Chapter 4  Styling in React        color: "333",       display: "inline-block",       fontFamily: "monospace",       fontSize: 32,       textAlign: "center"     };       return                   {this.props.children}              ;   } }  Our object is called letterStyle, so that’s what we specify inside the curly brackets to let  React know to evaluate the expression. That’s all there is to it. Go ahead and run the example  in the browser to ensure that everything works properly and that all the vowels are properly  styled.  For extra validation, if you inspect the styling applied to one of the vowels using your browser  developer tool of choice, you’ll see that the styles are, in fact, applied inline  see Figure 4.4 .  Figure 4.4  The styles are applied inline.  While this is no surprise, it might be difficult to adjust to if you’re used to styles being inside  style rules. As they say, the times are a-changin’.   Styling Content the React Way  45  Making the Background Color Customizable The last thing to do before we wrap up is take advantage of how React works with styles. By  having our styles defined in the same vicinity as the JSX, we can make the various style values  easily customizable by the parent  a.k.a. the consumer of the component . Let’s see this in  action.  Right now, all of our vowels have a yellow background. Wouldn’t it be cool if we could specify  the background color as part of each Letter declaration? To do this in our ReactDOM.render  method, first add a bgcolor attribute and specify some colors, as shown in the following   highlighted lines:  ReactDOM.render                 A           E           I           O           U       ,     destination  ;  var letterStyle = {   padding: 10,   margin: 10,   backgroundColor: this.props.bgcolor,   color: "333",   display: "inline-block",   fontFamily: "monospace",   fontSize: 32,   textAlign: "center" };  Next, we need to use this property. In the letterStyle object, set the value of  backgroundColor to this.props.bgColor:  This ensures that the backgroundColor value is inferred from what you set via the bgColor  attribute as part of the Letter declaration. If you preview this in your browser, you will now  see the same vowels sporting some totally sweet background colors  see Figure 4.5 .   46  Chapter 4  Styling in React  Figure 4.5  Our vowels with background colors!  What we’ve just done will be very hard to replicate using plain CSS. As we start to look at  components whose contents change based on state or user interaction, you’ll see more such  examples in which the React way of styling things has a lot of merit.  Conclusion As you dive in deeper and learn more about React, you’ll see several more cases in which React  does things quite differently than what you’ve been told is correct on the web. In this tutorial,  you saw React promoting inline styles in JavaScript as a way to style content instead of using  CSS style rules. Earlier, we looked at JSX and showed how to declare the entirety of your UI in  JavaScript using an XML-like syntax that sort of, kind of looks like HTML.  In all of these cases, if you look deeper beneath the surface, the reasons React diverges from  conventional wisdom make a lot of sense. Building apps with their very complex UI requirements  necessitate a new way of solving the challenges. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques that prob- ably made a lot of sense when dealing with web pages and documents might not be applicable in  a web-app world where components are reused inside other components.  With that said, you need to pick and choose the techniques that make the most sense for your  situation. I’m biased toward React’s way of solving UI development problems, but I do my best  to highlight alternate or conventional methods as well. Tying that back to what you saw here,  using CSS style rules with your React content is totally okay, as long as you make the decision  knowing both what you gain and what you lose.

You learned that components are the primary ways through which React  enables our visual elements to behave like little reusable bricks that contain all the HTML,  JavaScript, and styling needed to run themselves. Beyond reusability, components bring  another major advantage to the table. They make possible composability. You can combine  components to create more complex components.  In this chapter, we look at what all of this means. More specifically, we look at two points:     The boring technical stuff you need to know     The boring stuff you need to know to identify components when you look at a bunch of   visual elements  Okay, what you’re going to learn isn’t actually that boring. I’m just setting your expectations  really low.  From Visuals to Components The examples we’ve looked at so far have been pretty basic. They were great for highlighting  technical concepts, but they weren’t great for preparing you for the real world.   48  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components  In the real world, what you’ll be asked to implement in React will never be as simple as a list  of names or colorful blocks of vowels. Instead, you’ll be given a visual of some complex user   interface, such as a scribble, diagram, screenshot, video, redline, or comp. Then it’ll be up to  you to bring all those static pixels to life. You’ll get some hands-on practice in this chapter  doing just that.  The task here is to build a simple color palette card  see Figure 5.1 .  Figure 5.1  A simple color palette card.   From Visuals to Components  49  Color palette cards are small rectangular cards that help you match a color with a particular  type of paint. You can see them in home improvement stores or anywhere paint is sold. Your  designer friend probably has a giant closet dedicated to them in his or her place. Anyway, our  mission is to re-create one of these cards using React.  We could go about this in several ways, but let’s take a systematic approach that simplifies and  make sense of even the most complex user interfaces. This approach involves two steps:  1.  Identify the major visual elements.  2.  Figure out what the components will be.  Both of these steps sound really complex, but as we walk through this, you’ll see that you have  nothing to worry about.  Identifying the Major Visual Elements The first step is to identify all the visual elements we’re dealing with. No visual element is too  minor to omit—at least, not initially. The easiest way to identify the relevant pieces is to start  with the obvious visual elements and then dive into the less obvious ones.  The first thing you will see in our example is the card itself  see Figure 5.2 .  Figure 5.2  The card.   50  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components  Within the card are two distinct regions. The top region is a square area that displays  a particular color. The bottom region is a white area that displays a hex value.  Let’s call out these two visual elements and arrange them into a treelike structure, as shown  in Figure 5.3.  Figure 5.3  Treelike structure.  Arranging your visuals into this treelike structure  a.k.a. a visual hierarchy  is a good way  to get a better feel for how your visual elements are grouped. The goal of this exercise is to   identify the important visual elements and break them into a parent child arrangement until  you can divide them no further.  Try to Ignore Implementation Details It might be hard, but don’t think about the implementation details yet. Don’t focus on dividing  your visual elements based on what combination of HTML and CSS is required. You’ll have  plenty of time for that later.         From Visuals to Components  51  Continuing on, we can see that our colorful square isn’t something we can divide further. That  doesn’t mean we’re done, though. We can further divide the label from the white region that  surrounds it. Right now, our visual hierarchy looks as shown in Figure 5.4, with our label and  white region occupying a separate spot in our tree.  Figure 5.4  Dividing things further into the label and the white region that surrounds it.  At this point, we have nothing else to divide any further. We’re finished identifying and   dividing up our visual elements, so the next step is to use what we’ve found to help us identify  the components.  Identifying the Components This is where things get a little interesting. We need to figure out which of the visual elements  we’ve identified will be turned into components and which ones will not. Not every visual  element needs to be turned into a component, and we also don’t want to create only a few  extremely complex components. We need to strike a balance  see Figure 5.5 .   52  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components  Figure 5.5  Not too few and not too many components.  There’s an art to figuring out which visual elements become part of a component and which  don’t. The general rule is that components should do just one thing. If you find that your potential  component will end up doing too many things, you probably want to break it into multiple  components. On the flipside, if your potential component does too little, you probably want to  skip making that visual element a component altogether.  Let’s try to figure out which elements would make good components in our example. From  looking at our visual hierarchy, both the card and the colored square seem like they fit the bill  for making a great component. The card acts as the outer container, and the colored square  simply displays a color.  That just puts a question mark around our label and the white region it is surrounded by   see Figure 5.6 .   From Visuals to Components  53  Figure 5.6  Question mark around the label and the white space around it.  The important part here is the label itself. Without it, we can’t see the hex value. That leaves  just the white region. It serves a negligible purpose; it is simply empty space, and that responsi- bility can easily be handed off to our label itself. Brace yourself for what I’m about to say next:  Sadly, our white rectangular region will not be turned into a component.  At this point, we have identified our three components, and the component hierarchy looks  like Figure 5.7.   54  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components  Figure 5.7  The three components.  An important point to note is that the component hierarchy has more to do with helping us  define our code than it does with how the finished product will look. You’ll notice that it looks  a bit different than the visual hierarchy we started with. For visual details, always refer to your  source material  a.k.a. your visual comps, redlines, screenshots, and other related items . To  figure out which components to create, you should use the component hierarchy.  Okay, now that we’ve identified our components and the relationships among all of them, it’s  time to start bringing our color palette card to life.  Creating the Components This is the easy part…sort of! It’s time to start writing some code. First we need a mostly empty  HTML page that will serve as our starting point:          Creating the Components  55           More Components                           container {       padding: 50px;       background-color: FFF;     }                          ReactDOM.render                   ,       document.querySelector "container"       ;            Take a moment to see what this page has going on. There isn’t much: just the bare minimum  needed to have React render an empty div into our container element.  After you’ve done this, it’s time to define our three components. The names we’ll go with for  our components are Card, Label, and Square. Go ahead and add the following lines just above  the ReactDOM.render function:  class Square extends React.Component {   render   {     return               ;   } }     56  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components  class Label extends React.Component {   render   {     return                ;   } }   class Card extends React.Component {   render   {     return                ;   } }  class Card extends React.Component {   render   {     var cardStyle = {       height: 200,       width: 150,       padding: 0,       backgroundColor: "FFF",       boxShadow: "0px 0px 5px 666"     };       return                          ;   } }  Besides declaring our three components, we threw in the render function that each compo- nent absolutely needs to function. Each render function returns a simple br element for now;  leaving the return value for the render function empty throws an error. Other than that, our  components are empty. In the following sections, we’ll fix that by filling them in.  The Card Component Let’s start at the top of our component hierarchy and first focus on our Card component. This  component will act as the container where our Square and Label components will live.  To implement it, go ahead and make the following highlighted modifications:   Creating the Components  57  This seems like a lot of changes, but most of the lines are going into styling the output of our  Card component via the cardStyle object. The rest of the changes are pretty unimpressive.  We return a div element, and that element’s style attribute is set to our cardStyle object.  Now, to see our Card component in action, we need to display it in our DOM as part of the  ReactDOM.render function. To make that happen, go ahead and make the following high- lighted change:  ReactDOM.render               ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  All we’re doing is telling the ReactDOM.render function to render the output of our Card  component by invoking it. If everything worked out properly, you’ll see a result identical to  Figure 5.8 if you test your app.  Figure 5.8  The result of your test, the outline of the color palette card.  Yes, it’s just the outline of the color palette card, but that’s definitely more than what you  started with just a few moments ago!   58  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components  The Square Component It’s time to go one level down in our component hierarchy and look at our Square component.  This is a pretty straightforward one, so make the following highlighted changes:  As with our Card component, we are returning a div element whose style attribute is set to  a style object that defines how this component looks. To see our Square component in action,  we need to get it onto our DOM just like we did with the Card component. The difference  this time around is that we won’t be calling the Square component via our ReactDOM.render   function. Instead, we’ll call the Square component from inside the Card component. To see  what I mean, go back to our Card component’s render function and make the following  change:  class Square extends React.Component {   render   {     var squareStyle = {       height: 150,       backgroundColor: "FF6663"     };       return                          ;   } }  class Card extends React.Component {   render   {     var cardStyle = {       height: 200,       width: 150,       padding: 0,       backgroundColor: "FFF",       boxShadow: "0px 0px 5px 666"     };       return                                  ;   } }  At this point, if you preview your app, you’ll see a colorful square making an appearance   see Figure 5.9 .   The Label Component  59  Figure 5.9  The red portion appears.  The cool thing to call out is that we called our Square component from inside the Card compo- nent! This is an example of component composability, in which one component relies on the  output of another component. The final thing you see is the result of these two components  colluding with each other. Isn’t collusion just beautiful…at least in this context?  The Label Component The last component that remains is our Label. Go ahead and make the following highlighted  changes:  class Label extends React.Component {   render   {     var labelStyle = {       fontFamily: "sans-serif",       fontWeight: "bold",       padding: 13,       margin: 0     };       return          FF6663       ;   } }   60  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components  The pattern of what we’re doing should be routine to you by now. We have a style object that  we assign to what we return. We return a p element whose content is the string FF6663. To  have what we return ultimately make it to our DOM, we need to call our Label component via  our Card component. Go ahead and make the following highlighted change:  Notice that our Label component lives just under the Square component we added to our Card  component’s return function earlier. If you preview your app in the browser now, you should  see something that looks like Figure 5.10.  class Card extends React.Component {   render   {     var cardStyle = {       height: 200,       width: 150,       padding: 0,       backgroundColor: "FFF",       boxShadow: "0px 0px 5px 666"     };       return                                            ;   } }  Figure 5.10  The label appears.   The Label Component  61  Yes, that’s right! Our color palette card is done and visible, thanks to the efforts of our Card,  Square, and Label components. That doesn’t mean we’re done yet, though. We have a few more  things to cover.  Passing Properties, Again! In our current example, we hard-coded the color value used by our Square and Label compo- nents. That’s an odd thing to do. It might or might not have been done deliberately for  dramatic effect, but fixing it is straightforward. The solution just involves specifying a property  name and accessing it via this.props. You’ve seen all this before; the only difference is the  number of times you have to do this.  There’s no way to properly specify a property on a parent component and have all descendants  automatically gain access to that property. There are many improper ways to deal with this, such  as defining global objects and directly setting the value on a component property. We won’t  concern ourselves with such improper solutions right now, though. We aren’t animals!  The proper way to pass a property value to a child component is to have each intermediate  parent component pass on the property as well. To see this in action, take a look at the high- lighted changes to our current code. We move away from a hard-coded color and instead define  our card’s color using a color property:  class Square extends React.Component {   render   {     var squareStyle = {       height: 150,       backgroundColor: this.props.color     };       return                          ;   } }   class Label extends React.Component {   render   {     var labelStyle = {       fontFamily: "sans-serif",       fontWeight: "bold",       padding: 13,       margin: 0     };     62  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components      return          {this.props.color}       ;   } }   class Card extends React.Component {   render   {     var cardStyle = {       height: 200,       width: 150,       padding: 0,       backgroundColor: "FFF",       boxShadow: "0px 0px 5px 666"     };       return                                            ;   } }   ReactDOM.render               ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  ReactDOM.render               ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  After you’ve made this change, you can specify any hex color you want as part of calling the  Card component:  The resulting color palette card features the color you specified  see Figure 5.11 .   Why Component Composability Rocks  63  Figure 5.11  The color for hex value FFA737.  Now let’s go back to the changes we made. Even though the color property is consumed by only  the Square and Label components, the parent Card component is responsible for passing the  property on to them. For even more deeply nested situations, you’ll have more  intermediate  components that will be responsible for transferring properties. It gets worse. When you have  multiple properties that you want to pass around multiple levels of components, the amount of  typing  or copying pasting  you do increases a lot as well. There are ways to mitigate this, and  we’ll look at those mitigations in much greater detail in a future chapter.  Why Component Composability Rocks When we’re heads-down in React, we often tend to forget that what we are ultimately creating  is just plain and boring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The generated HTML for our color palette  card looks as follows:            <div style="height: 200px;                 width: 150px;                 padding: 0px;                 background-color: rgb 255, 255, 255 ;                 box-shadow: rgb 102, 102, 102  0px 0px 5px;">   64  Chapter 5  Creating Complex Components        <div style="height: 150px;                   background-color: rgb 255, 102, 99 ;">               <p style="font-family: sans-serif;                 font-weight: bold;                 padding: 13px;                 margin: 0px;">         FF6663               This markup has no idea how it got there. It doesn’t know about which components were respon- sible for what. It doesn’t care about component composability or the frustrating way we had to  transfer the color property from parent to child. That brings up an important point to make.  If we had to generalize the end result of what components do, all they do is return blobs of  HTML to whatever called it. Each component’s render function returns some HTML to another  component’s render function. All of this HTML keeps accumulating until a giant blob of  HTML is pushed  very efficiently  to our DOM. That simplicity is why component reuse and  composability works so well. Each blob of HTML works independently from other blobs of  HTML, especially if you specify inline styles as React recommends. This allows you to easily  create visual elements from other visual elements without having to worry about anything.  Anything! Isn’t that pretty freaking awesome?  Conclusion As you might have realized by now, we are slowly shifting focus toward the more advanced  scenarios that React thrives in. Actually, advanced isn’t the right word. The correct word is  realistic. In this chapter, you started by learning how to look at a piece of UI and identify the  components in a way that you can later implement. You’ll find yourself in that situation all  the time. While the approach we employed seemed really formal, as you get more experienced  with creating things in React, you can ratchet down the formality. If you can quickly identify  the components and their parent child relationships without creating a visual and component   hierarchy, that’s one more sign that you are getting really good at working with React.  Identifying the components is only one part of the equation. The other part is bringing those  components to life. Most of the technical stuff you saw here was just a minor extension of  what you’ve already seen. We looked at one level of components in an earlier chapter, and  here we looked at how to work with multiple levels of components. We looked at how to pass  properties between one parent and one child in an earlier chapter, and here we looked at how  to pass properties among multiple parents and multiple children. Maybe in a future chapter  we’ll do something groundbreaking, like drawing multiple color palette cards to the screen! Or  maybe we can specify two properties instead of just a single one.

We saw a bit of this side in the previous chapter.  Passing properties from one component to another is nice and simple when you’re dealing  with only one layer of components. When you want to send a property across multiple layers  of components, things start to get complicated.  Complication is never a good thing, so in this chapter, let’s see what we can do to make  working with properties easy across multiple layers of components.  Problem Overview Let’s say that you have a deeply nested component, and its hierarchy  modeled as awesomely  colored circles  looks like Figure 6.1.   66  Chapter 6  Transferring Properties  Figure 6.1  The component hierarchy.  You want to pass a property from your red circle all the way down to the purple circles, where it  will be used. What you can’t do is the very obvious and straightforward thing shown in Figure 6.2.   Problem Overview  67  Figure 6.2  Can’t do this.  You can’t pass a property directly to the component or components that you want to target.  The reason has to do with how React works. React enforces a chain of command in which properties  have to flow down from a parent component to an immediate child component. This means you can’t  skip a layer of children when sending a property. This also means your children can’t send a  property back up to a parent. All communication is one-way from the parent to the child.  Under these guidelines, passing a property from our red circle to our purple circle looks a little  bit like Figure 6.3.  Every component that lies on the intended path has to receive the property from its parent  and then resend that property to its child. This process repeats until your property reaches its  intended destination. The problem is in this receiving and resending step.  If we had to send a property called color from the component representing our red circle to  the component representing our purple circle, its path to the destination would look something  like Figure 6.4.   68  Chapter 6  Transferring Properties  Figure 6.3  The property is passed from parent to child.  Figure 6.4  Sending the color property.   Now, imagine that we have two properties we need to send, as in Figure 6.5.  Detailed Look at the Problem  69  Figure 6.5  Sending two properties.  What if we wanted to send three properties? Or four?  You can see that this approach is neither scalable nor maintainable. For every additional  property we need to communicate, we have to add an entry for it as part of declaring each  component. If we decide to rename our properties at some point, we have to ensure that every  instance of that property is renamed as well. If we remove a property, we need to remove the  property from being used across every component that relied on it. Overall, these are the kinds  of situations we try to avoid when writing code. What can we do about this?  Detailed Look at the Problem In the previous section, we talked at a high level about what the problem is. Before we can  dive into figuring out a solution, we need to go beyond diagrams and look at a more detailed  example with real code. We need to take a look at something like the following:  class Display extends React.Component {   render   {     return     70  Chapter 6  Transferring Properties                   {this.props.color}           {this.props.num}           {this.props.size}               ;   } }   class Label extends React.Component {   render   {     return         <Display color={this.props.color}                num={this.props.num}                size={this.props.size} >      ;   } }   class Shirt extends React.Component {   render   {     return                   <Label color={this.props.color}                num={this.props.num}                size={this.props.size} >              ;   } }   ReactDOM.render               ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  Let’s take a few moments to understand what’s going on. Then we can walk through this  example together.  We have a Shirt component that relies on the output of the Label component, which relies  on the output of the Display component.  Try saying that sentence five times fast!  Figure 6.6  shows the component hierarchy.   Detailed Look at the Problem  71  Figure 6.6  The component hierarchy.   72  Chapter 6  Transferring Properties  When you run this code, the output is nothing special. It’s just three lines of text, as shown in  Figure 6.7:  Figure 6.7  What our code outputs.  The interesting part is how the text gets there. Each of the three lines of text that you see maps  to a property we specified at the very beginning inside ReactDOM.render:     The color, num, and size properties  and their values  make a journey all the way to the  Display component that would make even the most seasoned world traveler jealous. Let’s  follow these properties from their inception to when they get consumed.  I realize that a lot of  this will be a review of what you’ve already seen. If you find yourself getting bored, feel free to  skip on the next section.   Life for our properties starts inside ReactDOM.render when our Shirt component gets called  with the color, num, and size properties specified:  ReactDOM.render               ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;   Detailed Look at the Problem  73  We not only define the properties, but we also initialize them with the values they will carry.  Inside the Shirt component, these properties are stored inside the props object. To transfer  these properties on, we need to explicitly access these properties from the props object and list  them as part of the component call. The following is an example of what that looks like when  our Shirt component calls our Label component:  class Shirt extends React.Component {   render   {     return                   <Label color={this.props.color}                num={this.props.num}                size={this.props.size}  >              ;   } }  class Label extends React.Component {   render   {     return         <Display color={this.props.color}                num={this.props.num}                size={this.props.size}  >      ;   } }  class Display extends React.Component {   render   {     return                    {this.props.color}           {this.props.num}   Notice that the color, num, and size properties are listed again. The only difference from what  we saw with the ReactDOM.render call is that the values for each property are taken from their  respective entry in the props object instead of being manually entered.  When our Label component goes live, it has its props object properly filled out with the  color, num, and size properties stored. You can probably see a pattern forming here. If you  need to let out a big yawn, feel free.  The Label component continues the tradition by repeating the same steps and calling the  Display component:  Notice that the Display component call contains the same listing of properties and their values  taken from our Label component’s props object. The only good news from all this is that we’re  almost done here. The Display component just displays the properties as they were populated  inside its props object:   74  Chapter 6  Transferring Properties           {this.props.size}               ;   } }  Phew! All we wanted to do was have our Display component display some values for color,  num, and size. The only complication was that the values we wanted to display were originally  defined as part of ReactDOM.render. The annoying solution is the one you see here, with  every component along the path to the destination needing to access and redefine each prop- erty as part of passing it along. That’s just terrible. We can do better than this, and you’ll will  see how in a few moments.  Meet the Spread Operator The solution to all our problems lies in something new to JavaScript, known as the spread  operator. What the spread operator does is a bit bizarre to explain without some context, so  let’s first give you an example and then bore you with a definition.  Take a look at the following snippet:  var items = ["1", "2", "3"];   function printStuff a, b, c  {   console.log "Printing: " + a + " " + b + " " + c ; }  We have an array called items that contains three values. We also have a function called  printStuff that takes three arguments. We want to specify the three values from our items  array as arguments to the printStuff function. Sounds simple enough, right?  Here’s one really common way of doing that:  printStuff items[0], items[1], items[2] ;  We access each array item individually and pass it in to our printStuff function. With the  spread operator, we now have an easier way. You don’t have to specify each item in the array  individually; you can just do something like this:  printStuff ...items ;  The spread operator is the ... characters before our items array. Using ...items is identical  to calling items[0], items[1], and items[2] individually, as we did earlier. The printStuff  function will run and print the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to our console. Pretty cool, right?  Now that you’ve seen the spread operator in action, it’s time to define it. The spread operator  allows you to unwrap an array into its individual elements. The spread operator does a few more  things as well, but that’s not important for now. We’re going to use only this particular side of  the spread operator to solve our property transfer problem.   A Better Way to Transfer Properties  75  A Better Way to Transfer Properties You just saw an example of using the spread operator to avoid having to enumerate every  single item in our array as part of passing it to a function:  var items = ["1", "2", "3"];   function printStuff a, b, c  {   console.log "Printing: " + a + " " + b + " " + c ; }      using the spread operator printStuff ...items ;      without using the spread operator printStuff items[0], items[1], items[2] ;  The situation we face in transferring properties across components is very similar to our  problem of accessing each array item individually. Allow me to elaborate.  Inside a component, our props object looks as follows:  var props = {   color: "steelblue",   num: "3.14",   size: "medium" };  <Display color={this.props.color}          num={this.props.num}          size={this.props.size} >  As part of passing these property values to a child component, we manually access each item  from our props object:  Wouldn’t it be great if there was a way to unwrap an object and pass on the property value  pairs just like we were able to unwrap an array using the spread operator?  As it turns out, there is a way. It actually involves the spread operator as well. We explain how  later, but this means that we can call our Display component by using ...this.props:     The runtime behavior when using ...this.props is the same as when specifying the color,  num, and size properties manually. This means our earlier example can be simplified as follows   pay attention to the highlighted lines :  class Display extends React.Component {   render   {     return     76  Chapter 6  Transferring Properties                   {this.props.color}           {this.props.num}           {this.props.size}               ;   } }   class Label extends React.Component {   render   {     return                ;   } }   class Shirt extends React.Component {   render   {     return                                  ;   } }  If you run this code, the end result is unchanged from what we had earlier. The biggest differ- ence is that we are no longer passing in expanded forms of each property as part of calling each  component. This solves all the problems we originally set out to solve.  By using the spread operator, if you ever decide to add properties, rename properties, remove  properties, or do any other sort of property-related shenanigans, you don’t have to make a  billion different changes. You make one change at the spot you define your property. You make  another change at the spot you consume the property. That’s it. All the intermediate compo- nents that merely transfer the properties remain untouched because the {...this.props}  expression contains no details of what goes on inside it.  Is this the best way to transfer properties? Using the spread operator to transfer properties is convenient, and it’s a marked improvement  over explicitly defining each property at each component as we were originally doing. The thing  is, even the spread operator approach isn’t a perfect solution. If all you want to do is transfer a  property to a particular component, having each intermediate component play a role in passing  it on is unnecessary. Worse, it has the potential to be a performance bottleneck. Any change  to a property that you are passing along will trigger a component update on each component  along the property’s path. That’s not a good thing! Later, we look at ways to solve this transfer- ring properties problem in a much better, without any side effects.         Conclusion  77  Conclusion As created by the ES6 ES2015 committee, the spread operator is designed to work only on arrays  and arraylike creatures  a.k.a. something that has a Symbol.iterator property . The fact that it  works on object literals such as our props object is a result of React extending the standard. No  browser currently supports using the spread object on object literals. Our example works because  of Babel. Besides turning all our JSX into something our browser understands, Babel turns cutting- edge and experimental features into something that’s friendly across browsers. That’s why we’re  able to get away with using the spread operator on an object literal, and that’s why we’re able to  elegantly solve the problem of transferring properties across multiple layers of components.  Now, does any of this matter? Is it really critical that you know about the nuances of the spread  operator and how it works in certain situations and doesn’t work in others? For the most part,  no. The important part to realize is that you can use the spread operator to transfer props from  one component to another. The other important part to realize is that we will look at some  other ways in the future to make transferring properties equally simple, without running into  any performance issues.

This page intentionally left blank    7 Meet JSX…Again!  As you’ve probably noticed by now, we’ve been using a lot of JSX. But we really haven’t taken  a good look at what JSX actually is. How does it work? Why don’t we just call it HTML? What  quirks does it have up its sleeve? In this chapter, we answer all those questions and more! We  do some serious backtracking  and some forwardtracking  to see what we need to know about  JSX in order to be dangerous.  What Happens with JSX? One of the biggest things we’ve glossed over is trying to figure out what happens with our JSX  after we’ve written it. How does it end up as the HTML that you see in the browser? Take a look  at the following example, where we define a component called Card:  class Card extends React.Component {   render   {     var cardStyle = {       height: 200,       width: 150,       padding: 0,       backgroundColor: "FFF",       boxShadow: "0px 0px 5px 666"     };       return                                            ;   } }   80  Chapter 7  Meet JSX…Again!  We can quickly spot the JSX here. It’s the following four lines:               Keep in mind that browsers have no idea what to do with JSX. They probably think you’re  crazy if you even try to describe JSX to them. That’s why we’ve been relying on things like  Babel to turn that JSX into something the browsers understand: JavaScript.  This means that the JSX we write is for human  and well-trained cat  eyes only. When this JSX  reaches our browser, it ends up getting turned into pure JavaScript:  return React.createElement    "div",   { style: cardStyle },   React.createElement Square, { color: this.props.color } ,   React.createElement Label, { color: this.props.color }   ;  All of those neatly nested HTML-like elements, their attributes, and their children get turned  into a series of createElement calls with default initialization values. Here’s what our entire  Card component looks like when it gets turned into JavaScript:  class Card extends React.Component {   render   {     var cardStyle = {       height: 200,       width: 150,       padding: 0,       backgroundColor: "FFF",       boxShadow: "0px 0px 5px 666"     };       return React.createElement        "div",       { style: cardStyle },       React.createElement Square, { color: this.props.color } ,       React.createElement Label, { color: this.props.color }       ;   } }  Notice that there’s no trace of JSX anywhere! All these changes between what we wrote  and what our browser sees are part of the transpiling step we talked about in Chapter 1,  “Introducing React.” That transpilation happens entirely behind the scenes, thanks to Babel,    JSX Quirks to Remember  81  which we’ve been using to perform this JSX-to-JS transformation entirely in the browser. We’ll  eventually look at using Babel as part of a more involved build environment in which we  generate a transformed JS file, but you’ll see more on that when we get there in the future.  So there you have it, an answer to what exactly happens to all our JSX: It gets turned into sweet  JavaScript.  JSX Quirks to Remember As we’ve been working with JSX, you’ve probably noticed that we’ve run into some arbitrary  rules and exceptions on what we can and can’t do. In this section, let’s look at those quirks…and  some brand new ones!  Evaluating Expressions JSX is treated like JavaScript. As you’ve seen a few times already, this means that you aren’t  limited to dealing with static content like the following:  class Stuff extends React.Component {   render   {     return          Boring static content!       ;   } };  The values you return can be dynamically generated. All you have to do is wrap your  expression in curly braces:  class Stuff extends React.Component {   render   {     return          Boring {Math.random   * 100} content!       ;   } }  Notice that we’re throwing in a Math.random   call to generate a random number. It gets eval- uated along with the static text alongside it, but because of the curly braces, what you see looks  something like the following: Boring 28.6388820148227 content!  These curly braces allow your app to first evaluate the expression and then return the result  of the evaluation. Without them, you would see your expression returned as text: Boring  Math.random   * 100 content!  That isn’t what you would probably want.   82  Chapter 7  Meet JSX…Again!  Returning Multiple Elements In a lot of our examples, we’ve returned one top-level element  often a div  that then had  many other elements under it. You aren’t technically limited to following that pattern: You can  actually return multiple elements. And you can do that in two ways.  One way is to use an arraylike syntax:  class Stuff extends React.Component {   render   {     return         [          I am ,          returning a list ,          of things!        ]      ;   } }  class Stuff extends React.Component {   render   {     return         [          I am ,          returning a list ,          of things!        ]      ;   } }  Here we are returning three p tags. They don’t have a single common parent. Now, when you  return multiple items, you might or might not have to deal with one detail, depending on the  version of React you are targeting. You need to specify a key attribute and a unique value for  each item:  This helps React better understand which element it is dealing with and whether to make any  changes to it. How do you know whether you need to add the key attribute? React tells you.  You’ll see a message similar to the following printed to your Dev Tools Console: Warning: Each  child in an array or iterator should have a unique “key” prop.  You also have another  and, arguably, better  way to return multiple elements. This involves  something known as fragments. The way you use it looks as follows:  class Stuff extends React.Component {   render   {     return                    I am    JSX Quirks to Remember  83           returning a list           of things!               ;   } }  You wrap the list of items you want to return into a magical React.Fragment component.  Note a few cool things here:  1.  This component doesn’t actually generate a DOM element. It is just something you   specify in JSX that has no tangible existence when transpiled into the HTML your  browser sees.  2.  You aren’t treating what you are returning as items in an array, so you don’t need   commas or anything separating each item.  3.  There’s no need to specify a unique key attribute and value; this is all taken care of under   the covers for you.  Before we leave this section, know that you can use a more condensed syntax instead of fully  specifying React.Fragment... like an animal. You can use just empty   and   tags:  class Stuff extends React.Component {   render   {     return                    I am           returning a list           of things!               ;   } }  This looks like something from the future, so if you’re inclined to use fragments to return  multiple values, feel free to use this smaller syntax.  You Can’t Specify CSS Inline As you saw in Chapter 4, “Styling in React,” the style attribute in your JSX behaves differently  from the style attribute in HTML. In HTML, you can specify CSS properties directly as values  on your style attribute:       Blah!      84  Chapter 7  Meet JSX…Again!  In JSX, the style attribute can’t contain CSS inside it. Instead, it needs to refer to an object  that contains styling information:  class Letter extends React.Component {   render   {     var letterStyle = {       padding: 10,       margin: 10,       backgroundColor: this.props.bgcolor,       color: "333",       display: "inline-block",       fontFamily: "monospace",       fontSize: "32",       textAlign: "center"     };       return                   {this.props.children}              ;   } }  Notice that we have an object called letterStyle that that contains all the CSS properties   in camel-case JavaScript form  and their values. That object is what we then specify to the  style attribute.  Comments Just as it’s a good idea to comment your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s a good idea to provide  comments inside your JSX. Specifying comments in JSX is similar to how you comment in  JavaScript, with one exception. If you’re specifying a comment as a child of a tag, you need  to enclose your comment within the { and } angle brackets to ensure that it is parsed as  an expression:  ReactDOM.render           Gabagool!      { * I am a child comment * }          ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;   Capitalization, HTML Elements, and Components  85  Our comment in this case is a child of our div element. If you specify a comment wholly  inside a tag, you can just specify your single-line or multiline comment without having to use  the { and } angle brackets:  ReactDOM.render           Gabagool!      <Label        * This comment          goes across          multiple lines *           className="colorCard"    end of line      >    ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  In this snippet, you can see an example of both a multiline comment and a comment at  the end of a line. Now that you know all of this, you have one less excuse to not comment  your JSX.  Capitalization, HTML Elements, and Components Capitalization is important. To represent HTML elements, ensure that the HTML tag  is lowercase:  ReactDOM.render                   Something goes here!           ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  ReactDOM.render               ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  When you want to represent components, the component name must be capitalized:  If you get the capitalization wrong, React will not render your content properly. Trying to  identify capitalization issues is probably the last point you’ll think about when things aren’t  working, so keep this little tip in mind.   86  Chapter 7  Meet JSX…Again!  Your JSX Can Be Anywhere In many situations, your JSX won’t be neatly arranged inside a render or return function  as in the examples you’ve seen so far. Take a look at the following example:  var swatchComponent =   ;   ReactDOM.render          {swatchComponent}    ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  We have a variable called swatchComponent that is initialized to a line of JSX. When our  swatchComponent variable is placed inside the render function, our Swatch component gets  initialized. All of this is totally valid. You will do more such things in the future when you  learn how to generate and manipulate JSX using JavaScript.  Conclusion With this chapter, we’ve finally pieced together in one location the various bits of JSX  information that the previous chapters introduced. The most important point to remember is  that JSX is not HTML. It looks like HTML and behaves like it in many common scenarios, but  it is ultimately designed to be translated into JavaScript. This means you can do things that  you could never imagine doing using just plain HTML. Being able to evaluate expressions or  programmatically manipulate entire chunks of JSX is just the beginning. In upcoming chapters,  we’ll explore this intersection of JavaScript and JSX further.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask!

They have properties   a.k.a. props  that are passed in from their parent, but nothing  usually  changes about them  once the components come alive. Your properties are considered immutable once they’ve been  set. For many interactive scenarios, you don’t want that. You want to be able to change aspects  of your components as a result of some user interaction  or some data getting returned from  a server or a billion other things .  We need another way to store data on a component that goes beyond properties. We need a  way to store data that can be changed. What we need is something known as state. In this  chapter, you learn all about state and how you can use it to create stateful components.  Using State If you know how to work with properties, you totally know how to work with states…sort of.  There are some differences, but they’re too subtle to bore you with right now. Instead, let’s just  jump right in and see states in action by using them in a small example.  We’re going to create a simple lightning counter example, as shown in Figure 8.1.   88  Chapter 8  Dealing with State in React   Figure 8.1  The app you will be building.  This example does nothing crazy. Lightning strikes Earth’s surface about 100 times a second,  according to National Geographic. We have a counter that simply increments a number you see  by that same amount. Let’s create it.  Our Starting Point The primary focus of this example is to see how we can work with state. There’s no point  spending a lot of time creating the example from scratch and retracing paths that we’ve walked  many times already. That’s not the best use of anybody’s time.  Instead of starting from scratch, modify an existing HTML document or create a new one with  the following contents:                 Dealing with State         Using State  89                                 class LightningCounter extends React.Component {       render   {         return              Hello!           ;       }     }       class LightningCounterDisplay extends React.Component {       render   {         var divStyle = {           width: 250,           textAlign: "center",           backgroundColor: "black",           padding: 40,           fontFamily: "sans-serif",           color: "999",           borderRadius: 10         };           return                                                  ;       }     }       ReactDOM.render         ,       document.querySelector "container"       ;             90  Chapter 8  Dealing with State in React   Now let’s take a few minutes to look at what our existing code does. First, we have a compo- nent called LightningCounterDisplay. The bulk of this component is the divStyle object,  which contains the styling information responsible for the cool rounded background. The  return function returns a div element that wraps the LightningCounter component.  The LightningCounter component is where all the action will take place:  class LightningCounter extends React.Component {   render   {     return          Hello!       ;   } }  The last thing to look at is our ReactDOM.render method:  ReactDOM.render     ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  As it is right now, this component has nothing interesting going for it. It just returns the word  Hello! That’s okay—we’ll fix up this component later.  It just pushes the LightningCounterDisplay component to our container element  in our DOM. That’s pretty much it. The end result is the combination of markup from our  ReactDOM.render method and the LightningCounterDisplay and LightningCounter  components.  Getting Our Counter On Now that you have an idea of what we’re starting with, it’s time to make plans for our next  steps. The way our counter works is pretty simple. We’re going to be using a setInterval  function that calls some code every 1000 milliseconds  a.k.a. 1 second . That “some code” is  going to increment a value by 100 each time it’s called. Seems pretty straightforward, right?  To make this all work, we’re relying on three APIs that our React component exposes:  1.  componentDidMount  2.  setState  This method gets called just after our component gets rendered  or mounted, as React  calls it .  This method allows you to update the value of the state object.  You’ll see these APIs in use shortly, but here you get a preview so that you can spot them easily  in a lineup.   Getting Our Counter On  91  Setting the Initial State Value We need a variable to act as our counter. Let’s call this variable strikes. We have a bunch of  ways to create this variable, but the most obvious one is the following:  var strikes = 0;    :P  We don’t want to do that, though. For our example, the strikes variable is part of our compo- nent’s state. We want to create a state object, make our strikes variable a property of it, and  ensure that we set all of this up when our component is getting created. The component we  want to do all this to is LightningCounter. Go ahead and add the following highlighted lines:  class LightningCounter extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       strikes: 0     };   }     render   {     return          Hello!       ;   } }  We specify our state object inside our LightningCounter component’s constructor. This runs  way before your component gets rendered. We’re telling React to set an object containing our  strikes property  initialized to 0 .  If we inspect the value of our state object after this code has run, it looks something like the  following:  var state = {   strikes: 0 };  Before we wrap up this section up, let’s visualize our strikes property. In our render method,  make the following highlighted change:  class LightningCounter extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       strikes: 0     };   }     92  Chapter 8  Dealing with State in React     render   {     return          {this.state.strikes}       ;   } }  We’ve replaced our default Hello! text with an expression that displays the value stored by the  this.state.strikes property. If you preview your example in the browser, you will see a  value of 0 displayed. That’s a start!  Starting Our Timer and Setting State Next up, is getting our timer going and incrementing our strikes property. As we mentioned  earlier, we will be using the setInterval function to increase the strikes property by 100 every  second. We’re going to do all of this immediately after our component has been rendered using  the built-in componentDidMount method.  The code for kicking off our timer looks as follows:  class LightningCounter extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       strikes: 0     };   }     timerTick   {     this.setState {       strikes: this.state.strikes + 100     } ;   }     componentDidMount   {     setInterval this.timerTick, 1000 ;   }     render   {     return          {this.state.strikes}       ;   } }   Getting Our Counter On  93  Go ahead and add these highlighted lines to our example. Inside our componentDidMount  method that gets called after our component gets rendered, we have our setInterval method  that calls a timerTick function every second  or 1000 milliseconds .  We haven’t defined our timerTick function, so let’s fix that by adding the following high- lighted lines to our code:  class LightningCounter extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       strikes: 0     };   }     timerTick   {     this.setState {       strikes: this.state.strikes + 100     } ;   }     componentDidMount   {     setInterval this.timerTick, 1000 ;   }     render   {     return          {this.state.strikes}       ;   } }  What our timerTick function does is pretty simple: It just calls setState. The setState  method comes in various flavors, but for what we’re doing here, it just takes an object as its  argument. This object contains all the properties you want to merge into the state object. In our  case, we are specifying the strikes property and setting its value to be 100 more than what it  is currently.   94  Chapter 8  Dealing with State in React   Note: Incrementing the Existing State Value As you’ve seen here, you will often end up modifying an existing state value with an updated  value. We’re getting the existing state value by calling this.state.strikes. For performance- related reasons, React might decide to batch state updates in rapid succession. This could lead  to the original value stored by this.state to be out-of-sync with reality. To help with this, the  setState method gives you access to the previous state object via the prevState argument. Using that argument, our code could be made to look as follows:  this.setState  prevState  => {      strikes: prevState.strikes + 100    return {    };  } ;  The end result is similar to what we had originally. Our strikes property is incremented  by 100. The only potential change is that the value of the strikes property is guaranteed  to be whatever the earlier value stored by our state object would be. So should you use this approach to update your state? There are good arguments on both  sides. One side argues for correctness, despite this.state working out fine for most real- world cases. The other side argues for keeping the code simple and not introducing additional   complexity. There’s no right or wrong answer here, so use whatever approach you prefer.  I’m calling this out only for completeness because you could run into the prevState approach  in any React code you encounter in the wild.       You need to do one more thing. The timerTick function has been added to our component,  but its contents don’t have their context set to our component. In other words, the this  keyword where we are accessing setState will return a TypeError in the current situation.  You can employ several solutions here, each a little frustrating in its own way. We’ll look at  this problem in detail later. For now, we’re going to explicitly bind our timerTick function to  our component so that all the this references resolve properly. Add the following line to our  constructor:  constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {         strikes: 0     };       this.timerTick = this.timerTick.bind this ; }  When you’ve done this, the timerTick function is ready to be a useful part of our component.   Optional: The Full Code  95  Rendering the State Change If you preview your app now, you’ll see our strikes value start to increment by 100 every  second  see Figure 8.2 .  Figure 8.2  The strikes value increments by 100 every second.  Let’s ignore for a moment what happens with our code. That’s pretty straightforward. The  interesting thing is that everything we’ve done ends up updating what you see onscreen. That  updating has to do with this React behavior: Whenever you call setState and update something in  the state object, your component’s render method gets automatically called. This kicks off a cascade of  render calls for any component whose output is also affected. The end result of all this is that  what you see on your screen in the latest representation of your app’s UI state. Keeping your  data and UI in sync is one of the hardest problems with UI development, so it’s nice that React  takes care of this for us. It makes all this pain of learning to use React totally worth it…almost!  Optional: The Full Code What we have right now is just a counter that increments by 100 every second. Nothing about  it screams lightning counter, but it does cover everything about states that I wanted you to  learn right now. If you want to optionally flesh out your example to look like our version that  you saw at the beginning, this is the full code for what goes inside our script tag:  class LightningCounter extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       strikes: 0     };       this.timerTick = this.timerTick.bind this ;   }   96  Chapter 8  Dealing with State in React     timerTick   {     this.setState {       strikes: this.state.strikes + 100     } ;   }     componentDidMount   {     setInterval this.timerTick, 1000 ;   }     render   {     var counterStyle = {       color: "66FFFF",       fontSize: 50     };       var count = this.state.strikes.toLocaleString  ;       return          {count}       ;   } }   class LightningCounterDisplay extends React.Component {   render   {     var commonStyle = {       margin: 0,       padding: 0     };       var divStyle = {       width: 250,       textAlign: "center",       backgroundColor: "020202",       padding: 40,       fontFamily: "sans-serif",       color: "999999",       borderRadius: 10     };       var textStyles = {       emphasis: {         fontSize: 38,         ...commonStyle       },   Conclusion  97        smallEmphasis: {         ...commonStyle       },       small: {         fontSize: 17,         opacity: 0.5,         ...commonStyle       }     };       return                              LIGHTNING STRIKES           WORLDWIDE            since you loaded this example                ;   } }   ReactDOM.render     ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  If you make your code look like everything you see here and run the example again, you  will see our lightning counter example in all its cyan-colored glory. While you’re at it, take a  moment to look through the code to ensure that you don’t see too many surprises.  Conclusion We just scratched the surface on what we can do to create stateful components. While using  a timer to update something in our state object is cool, the real action happens when we start  combining user interaction with state. So far, we’ve shied away from the large amount of  mouse, touch, keyboard, and other related things that your components will come into contact  with. In an upcoming chapter, we fix that. Along the way, you’ll see us taking what we’ve seen  about states to a whole new level. If that doesn’t excite you, then I don’t know what will.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask!

This page intentionally left blank    9 Going from Data  to UI in React  When you’re building your apps, thinking in terms of props, state, components, JSX tags,  render methods, and other React-isms might be the last thing on your mind. Most of the time,  you’re dealing with data in the form of JSON objects, arrays, and other data structures that have  no knowledge  or interest  in React or anything visual. Bridging the gulf between your data and  what you eventually see can be frustrating! Not to worry, though. This chapter helps reduce some  of those frustrating moments by running through some common scenarios you’ll encounter.  The Example To help make sense of everything you’re about to see, we need an example. It’s nothing too  complicated, so go ahead and create a new HTML document and throw the following stuff  into it:                 From Data to UI                           container {       padding: 50px;       background-color: FFF;     }         100  Chapter 9  Going from Data to UI in React                    class Circle extends React.Component {       render   {         var circleStyle = {           padding: 10,           margin: 20,           display: "inline-block",           backgroundColor: this.props.bgColor,           borderRadius: "50%",           width: 100,           height: 100,         };           return                                    ;       }     }       ReactDOM.render                           ,       document.querySelector "container" ;      ;            When you have your document set up, go ahead and preview what you have in your browser.  If everything went well, you’ll be greeted by a happy yellow circle  see Figure 9.1 .   The Example  101  Figure 9.1   If everything went well, you’ll get this yellow circle.  If you see what I see, great! Now, let’s take a moment to understand what this example is doing.  The bulk of what you see comes from the Circle component:  class Circle extends React.Component {   render   {     var circleStyle = {       padding: 10,       margin: 20,       display: "inline-block",       backgroundColor: this.props.bgColor,       borderRadius: "50%",       width: 100,       height: 100,     };       return                        ;   } }   102  Chapter 9  Going from Data to UI in React   It’s mostly made up of our circleStyle object that contains the inline style properties that  turn our boring div into an awesome circle. All the style values are hard-coded except for the  backgroundColor property, which takes its value from the bgColor prop that gets passed in.  Going beyond our component, we ultimately display our circle via our usual ReactDOM.render  method:  ReactDOM.render               ,   destination  ;  We have a single instance of our Circle component declared, and we declare it with the  bgColor prop set to the color we want our circle to appear. Now, having our Circle compo- nent be defined as is inside our render method is a bit limiting, especially if we’re going to  be dealing with data that could affect what our Circle component does. In the next couple  sections, we’ll look at the ways we have for solving that.  Your JSX Can Be Anywhere, Part II In Chapter 7, “Meet JSX…Again” , you learned that JSX can actually live outside a render  function and can be used as a value assigned to a variable or property. For example, we can  fearlessly do something like this:  var theCircle =  ;   ReactDOM.render          {theCircle}    ,   destination  ;  The theCircle variable stores the JSX for instantiating our Circle component. Evaluating this  variable inside our ReactDOM.render function results in a circle getting displayed. The end  result is no different than what we had earlier, but freeing our Circle component instantiation  from the shackles of the render method gives us more options to do crazy and cool things.  For example, you can go further and create a function that returns a Circle component:  function showCircle   {   var colors = ["393E41", "E94F37", "1C89BF", "A1D363"];   var ran = Math.floor Math.random   * colors.length ;        return a Circle with a randomly chosen color   return  ; }   Dealing with Arrays  103  In this case, the showCircle function returns a Circle component  boring!  with the value for  the bgColor prop set to a random color value  awesome sauce! . To have our example use the  showCircle function, all you have to do is evaluate it inside ReactDOM.render:  As long as the expression you’re evaluating returns JSX, you can put pretty much anything you  want inside the { and } brackets. That flexibility is really nice because you can do a lot when  your JavaScript lives outside the render function.  Dealing with Arrays Now we get to some fun stuff! When you’re displaying multiple components, you can’t always  manually specify them:  ReactDOM.render          {showCircle  }    ,   destination  ;  ReactDOM.render          {showCircle  }     {showCircle  }     {showCircle  }    ,   destination  ;  In many real-world scenarios, the number of components you display is related to the number  of items in an array or arraylike  a.k.a. iterator  object you’re working with. That brings up a  few simple complications. For example, let’s say that we have an array called colors that looks  as follows:  var colors = ["393E41", "E94F37", "1C89BF", "A1D363",               "85FFC7", "297373", "FF8552", "A40E4C"];  We want to create a Circle component for each item in this array  and set the bgColor prop to  the value of each array item . We can do this by creating an array of Circle components:  var colors = ["393E41", "E94F37", "1C89BF", "A1D363",               "85FFC7", "297373", "FF8552", "A40E4C"];   var renderData = [];   for  var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++  {   renderData.push   ; }   104  Chapter 9  Going from Data to UI in React   In this snippet, we populate our renderData array with Circle components just as we originally  set out to do. So far, so good. React makes displaying all of these components very simple. Take  a look at the highlighted line for all you have to do:  ReactDOM.render          {renderData}    ,   destination  ;  In our render method, all we do is specify our renderData array as an expression that we  need to evaluate. We don’t need to take any other step to go from an array of components to  something that looks like Figure 9.2 when you preview in your browser.  Figure 9.2  What you should see in your browser.   Conclusion  105  Okay, I lied. There’s actually one more thing we need to do, and it’s a subtle one. React makes  UI updates really fast by having a good idea of what exactly is going on in your DOM. It does  this in several ways, but one really noticeable way is by internally marking each element with  some sort of an identifier.  When you create elements dynamically  such as what we’re doing with our array of Circle  components , these identifiers are not automatically set. We need to do some extra work.  That extra work takes the form of a key prop whose value React uses to uniquely identify each  particular component.  For our example, we can do something like this:  for  var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++  {   var color = colors[i];   renderData.push   ; }  On each component, we specify our key prop and set its value to a combination of color and  index position inside the colors array. This ensures that each component we dynamically create  ends up getting a unique identifier that React can then use to optimize any future UI updates.  Check Your Console, Yo! React is really good at telling you when you might be doing something wrong. For example, if  you dynamically create elements or components and don’t specify a key prop on them, you’ll be  greeted with the following warning in your console:  Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop.  Check the top-level render call using  .  When you’re working with React, it’s a good idea to periodically check your console for any  messages. Even if things seem to be working just fine, you never know what you might find.        Conclusion All the tips and tricks you’ve seen in this article are made possible because of one thing: JSX is  JavaScript. This is what allows you to have your JSX live wherever JavaScript thrives. To us, it  looks like we’re doing something absolutely bizarre when we specify something like this:  for  var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++  {   var color = colors[i];   renderData.push   ; }   106  Chapter 9  Going from Data to UI in React   Even though we’re pushing pieces of JSX to an array, just like magic, everything works in the  end when renderData is evaluated inside our render method. I hate to sound like a broken  record, but this is because what our browser ultimately sees looks like this:  for  var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++  {   var color = colors[i];     renderData.push React.createElement Circle,     {       key: i + color,       bgColor: color     }  ; }  When our JSX gets converted into pure JS, everything makes sense again. This is what allows us  to get away with putting our JSX in all sorts of uncomfortable  yet photogenic!  situations and  still get the end result we want. In the end, it’s all just JavaScript.

As you probably guessed, that  isn’t normal. In most apps, especially the kind of UI-heavy ones you’ll be building, the app will  do a ton of things only as a reaction to something. Those somethings could be triggered by a  mouse click, a key press, a window resize, or a whole bunch of other gestures and interactions.  Events are the glue that makes all of this possible.  Now, you probably know all about events from your experience using them in the DOM world.   If you don’t, then I suggest getting a quick refresher first: https:  www.kirupa.com html5   javascript_events.htm.  The way React deals with events is a bit different, and these differences  can surprise you if you aren’t paying close attention. Don’t worry, that’s why you have this  book! We start off with a few simple examples and then gradually look at increasingly more  bizarre, complex, and  yes!  boring things.  Listening and Reacting to Events The easiest way to learn about events in React is to actually use them, and that’s exactly what  you’re going to do here. To help with this, we have a simple example made up of a counter  that increments each time you click a button. Initially, our example will look like Figure 10.1.  Figure 10.1  Our example.   108  Chapter 10  Events in React  Each time you click the plus button, the counter value will increase by 1. After you click the  plus button a bunch of times, it will look sort of like Figure 10.2.  Figure 10.2  After clicking the plus button a bunch of times  23 .  Under the covers, this example is pretty simple. Each time you click on the button, an event  gets fired. We listen for this event and do all sorts of React-ey things to get the counter to  update when this event gets overheard.  Starting Point To save all of us some time, we aren’t going to be creating everything in our example from  scratch. By now, you probably have a good idea of how to work with components, styles, state,  and so on. Instead, we’re going to start off with a partially implemented example that contains  everything except the event-related functionality that you’re here to learn.  First, create a new HTML document and ensure that your starting point looks as follows:                 Events                         container {       padding: 50px;       background-color: FFF;     }         Listening and Reacting to Events  109  When your new HTML document looks like what you see, it’s time to add our partially imple- mented counter example. Inside our script tag below the container div, add the following:                          class Counter extends React.Component {   render   {     var textStyle = {       fontSize: 72,       fontFamily: "sans-serif",       color: "333",       fontWeight: "bold"     };       return                   {this.props.display}              ;   } }   class CounterParent extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       count: 0     };   }     render   {     var backgroundStyle = {       padding: 50,       backgroundColor: "FFC53A",       width: 250,       height: 100,       borderRadius: 10,       textAlign: "center"     };   110  Chapter 10  Events in React      var buttonStyle = {       fontSize: "1em",       width: 30,       height: 30,       fontFamily: "sans-serif",       color: "333",       fontWeight: "bold",       lineHeight: "3px"     };       return                              +               ;   } }   ReactDOM.render               ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  Now preview everything in your browser to make sure it works. You should see the begin- ning of our counter. Take a few moments to look at what all of this code does. You shouldn’t  see anything that looks strange. The only odd thing is that clicking the plus button won’t do  anything. We’ll fix that in the next section.  Making the Button Click Do Something Each time we click the plus button, we want the value of our counter to increase by 1. What we  need to do roughly looks like this:  1.  Listen for the click event on the button.  2.  Implement the event handler so that we react to the click and increase the value of our   this.state.count property that our counter relies on.  We’ll just go straight down the list, starting with listening for the click event. In React, you  listen to an event by specifying everything inline in your JSX itself. More specifically, you specify  inside your markup both the event you’re listening for and the event handler that will get called. To do    Making the Button Click Do Something  111  this, find the return function inside our CounterParent component and make the following  highlighted change:    .   .   . return                  +       ;  We’ve told React to call the increase function when the onClick event is overheard. Next,  let’s go ahead and implement the increase function  a.k.a. our event handler . Inside our  CounterParent component, add the following highlighted lines:  class CounterParent extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       count: 0     };       this.increase = this.increase.bind this ;   }     increase e  {     this.setState {       count: this.state.count + 1     } ;   }     render   {     var backgroundStyle = {       padding: 50,       backgroundColor: "FFC53A",       width: 250,       height: 100,       borderRadius: 10,       textAlign: "center"     };       var buttonStyle = {       fontSize: "1em",       width: 30,   112  Chapter 10  Events in React        height: 30,       fontFamily: "sans-serif",       color: "333",       fontWeight: "bold",       lineHeight: "3px"     };       return                              +               ;   } }  All we’re doing with these lines is making sure that each call to the increase function incre- ments the value of our this.state.count property by 1. Because we’re dealing with events,  our increase function  as the designated event handler  will get access to any event argu- ments. We’ve set these arguments to be accessed by e, and you can see that by looking at our  increase function’s signature  that is, what its declaration looks like . We’ll talk about the  various events and their properties in a little bit when we take a detailed look at Events. Lastly,  in the constructor, we bind the value of this to the increase function.  Now, go ahead and preview what you have in your browser. Once everything has loaded, click  the plus button to see our newly added code in action. The counter value should increase with  each click. Isn’t that pretty awesome?  Event Properties As you know, events pass what are known as event arguments to our event handlers. These  event arguments contain a bunch of properties that are specific to the type of event you’re  dealing with. In the regular DOM world, each event has its own type. For example, if you’re  dealing with a mouse event, your event and its event arguments object are of type MouseEvent.  This MouseEvent object allows you to access mouse-specific information, such as which button  was pressed or the screen position of the mouse click. Event arguments for a keyboard-related  event are of type KeyboardEvent. Your KeyboardEvent object contains properties that  among  many other things  allow you to figure out which key was actually pressed. I could go on  forever for every other event type, but you get the point. Each event type contains its own set  of properties that you can access via the event handler for that event.  Why am I boring you with things you already know? Well….   Event Properties  113  Meet Synthetic Events In React, when you specify an event in JSX as we did with onClick, you’re not directly dealing  with regular DOM events. Instead, you’re dealing with a React-specific event type known as a  SyntheticEvent. Your event handlers don’t get native event arguments of type MouseEvent,  KeyboardEvent, and so on. They always get event arguments of type SyntheticEvent that  wrap your browser’s native event instead. What’s the fallout of this in our code? Surprisingly  not a whole lot.  Each SyntheticEvent contains the following properties:  These properties should seem pretty straightforward…and generic! The nongeneric stuff  depends on what type of native event our SyntheticEvent is wrapping. This means that a  SyntheticEvent that wraps a MouseEvent will have access to mouse-specific properties such  as the following:  boolean bubbles boolean cancelable DOMEventTarget currentTarget boolean defaultPrevented number eventPhase boolean isTrusted DOMEvent nativeEvent void preventDefault   boolean isDefaultPrevented   void stopPropagation   boolean isPropagationStopped   DOMEventTarget target number timeStamp string type  boolean altKey number button number buttons number clientX number clientY boolean ctrlKey boolean getModifierState key  boolean metaKey number pageX number pageY DOMEventTarget relatedTarget number screenX number screenY boolean shiftKey   Similarly, a SyntheticEvent that wraps a KeyboardEvent will have access to these additional  keyboard-related properties:  114  Chapter 10  Events in React  boolean altKey number charCode boolean ctrlKey boolean getModifierState key  string key number keyCode string locale number location boolean metaKey boolean repeat boolean shiftKey number which  In the end, all of this means that you still get the same functionality in the SyntheticEvent  world that you had in the vanilla DOM world.  Now, here’s something I learned the hard way: Don’t refer to traditional DOM event documentation  when using SyntheticEvents and their properties. Because the SyntheticEvent wraps  your native DOM event, events and their properties might not map one-to-one. Some DOM  events don’t even exist in React. To avoid running into any issues, if you want to know the  name of a SyntheticEvent or any of its properties, refer to the React Event System document   https:  facebook.github.io react docs events.html  instead.  Doing Stuff with Event Properties By now, you’ve seen more about the DOM and SyntheticEvents than you’d probably like. To  wash away the taste of all that text, let’s write some code and put your newfound knowledge to  good use. Right now, our counter example increments by 1 each time you click the plus button.  We want to increment our counter by 10 when the Shift key on the keyboard is pressed while clicking  the plus button with our mouse.  We can do that by using the shiftKey property that exists on the SyntheticEvent when  using the mouse:  boolean altKey number button number buttons number clientX number clientY boolean ctrlKey boolean getModifierState key  boolean metaKey number pageX number pageY   More Eventing Shenanigans  115  The way this property works is simple. If the Shift key is pressed when this mouse event fires,  then the shiftKey property value is true. Otherwise, the shiftKey property value is false.  To increment our counter by 10 when the Shift key is pressed, go back to our increase  function and make the following highlighted changes:  DOMEventTarget relatedTarget number screenX number screenY boolean shiftKey  increase e  {   var currentCount = this.state.count;     if  e.shiftKey  {     currentCount += 10;   } else {     currentCount += 1;   }     this.setState {     count: currentCount   } ; }  When you’ve made the changes, preview the example in the browser. Each time you click  the plus button, your counter will increment by 1 just like always. If you click on the plus  button with your Shift key pressed, notice that the counter increments by 10 instead.  All of this works because we change our incrementing behavior depending on whether the  Shift key is pressed. That’s primarily handled by the following lines:  if  e.shiftKey  {   currentCount += 10; } else {   currentCount += 1; }  If the shiftKey property on our SyntheticEvent event argument is true, we increment our  counter by 10. If the shiftKey value is false, we just increment by 1.  More Eventing Shenanigans We’re not done yet! Up to this point, we’ve looked at how to work with events in React in a  very simplistic way. In the real world, things rarely will be as direct as what you’ve seen. Your  real apps will be more complex, and because React insists on doing things differently, you’ll  need to learn  or relearn  some new event-related tricks and techniques to make your apps  work. That’s where this section comes in. We’re going to look at some common situations  you’ll run into and how to deal with them.   116  Chapter 10  Events in React  You Can’t Directly Listen to Events on Components Let’s say your component is nothing more than a button or another type of UI element that  users will be interacting with. You can’t get away with doing something like what we see in the  following highlighted line:  class CounterParent extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       count: 0     };       this.increase = this.increase.bind this ;   }     increase e  {     this.setState {       count: this.state.count + 1     } ;   }     render   {     return                                            ;   } }  class PlusButton extends React.Component {   render   {     return                   +              ;   } }  On the surface, this line of JSX looks totally valid. When somebody clicks our PlusButton  component, the increase function gets called. In case you’re curious, this is what our  PlusButton component looks like:  Our PlusButton component doesn’t do anything crazy; it only returns a single HTML element.   More Eventing Shenanigans  117  No matter how you slice and dice this, none of it matters. It doesn’t matter how simple or  obvious the HTML we’re returning via a component looks. You simply can’t listen for events on  them directly. This is because components are wrappers for DOM elements. What does it even  mean to listen for an event on a component? When your component gets unwrapped into  DOM elements, does the outer HTML element act as the thing you’re listening for the event  on? Is it some other element? How do you distinguish between listening for an event and  declaring a prop you’re listening for?  There’s no clear answer to any of those questions. It’s too harsh to say that the solution is to  simply not listen to events on components, either. Fortunately, there’s a workaround: We can  treat the event handler as a prop and pass it on to the component. Inside the component, we  can then assign the event to a DOM element and set the event handler to the value of the prop  we just passed in. I realize that probably makes no sense, so let’s walk through an example.  Take a look at the following highlighted line:  class CounterParent extends React.Component {   .   .   .   render   {     return                                            ;   } }  class PlusButton extends React.Component {   render   {     return                   +              ;   } }  In this example, we create a property called clickHandler whose value is the increase event  handler. Inside our PlusButton component, we can then do something like this:  On our button element, we specify the onClick event and set its value to the clickHandler  prop. At runtime, this prop gets evaluated as our increase function, and clicking the plus  button ensures that the increase function gets called. This solves our problem while still  allowing our component to participate in all this eventing goodness.   118  Chapter 10  Events in React  Listening to Regular DOM Events If you thought the previous section was a doozy, wait until you see what we have here. Not all  DOM events have SyntheticEvent equivalents. It might seem like you can just add the on  prefix and capitalize the event you’re listening for when specifying it inline in your JSX:  It doesn’t work that way! For events that React doesn’t officially recognize, you have to follow  the traditional approach that uses addEventListener with a few extra hoops to jump through.  class Something extends React.Component {   .   .   .   handleMyEvent e  {        do something   }     render   {     return          Hello!       ;   } }  Take a look at the following section of code:  class Something extends React.Component {         .         .         .   handleMyEvent e  {        do something   }     componentDidMount   {     window.addEventListener "someEvent", this.handleMyEvent ;   }     componentWillUnmount   {     window.removeEventListener "someEvent", this.handleMyEvent ;   }     render   {     return          Hello!       ;   } }   More Eventing Shenanigans  119  We have our Something component that listens for an event called someEvent. We start listen- ing for this event under the componentDidMount method, which is automatically called when  our component gets rendered. We listen for our event by using addEventListener and speci- fying both the event and the event handler to call.  That should be pretty straightforward. The only other point you need to keep in mind is that  you need to remove the event listener when the component is about to be destroyed. To do  that, you can use the opposite of the componentDidMount method, the componentWillUnmount  method. Put your removeEventListener call inside that method to ensure that no trace of our  event listening exists after our component goes away.  The Meaning of this Inside the Event Handler When dealing with events in React, the value of this inside your event handler is different  than what you normally see in the non-React DOM world. In the non-React world, the value of  this inside an event handler refers to the element that fired the event:  function doSomething e  {   console.log this ;    button element }   var foo = document.querySelector "button" ; foo.addEventListener "click", doSomething, false ;  In the React world, the value of this does not refer to the element that fired the event. The  value is the very unhelpful  yet correct  undefined. That’s why we need to explicitly specify  what this binds to using the bind method, as you’ve seen a few times:  class CounterParent extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       count: 0     };       this.increase = this.increase.bind this ;   }     increase e  {     console.log this ;       this.setState {       count: this.state.count + 1     } ;   }   120  Chapter 10  Events in React    render   {     return                              +               ;   } }  In this example, the value of this inside the increase event handler refers to the  CounterParent component. It doesn’t refer to the element that triggered the event. You can  attribute this behavior to us binding the value of this to our component from inside our  constructor.  React…Why? Why? Before we call it a day, let’s use this time to talk about why React decided to deviate from how  we’ve worked with events in the past. There are two reasons:  1.  Browser compatibility  2.  Improved performance  Let’s elaborate on these reasons a bit.  Browser Compatibility Event handling is one of those things that works consistently in modern browsers, but once  you go back to older browser versions, things get really bad really quickly. By wrapping all the  native events as an object of type SyntheticEvent, React frees you from dealing with event- handling quirks.  Improved Performance In complex UIs, the more event handlers you have, the more memory your app takes up.  Manually dealing with that isn’t difficult, but it is a bit tedious as you try to group events under  a common parent. Sometimes that just isn’t possible. Sometimes the hassle doesn’t outweigh  the benefits. What React does is pretty clever.  React never directly attaches event handlers to the DOM elements. It uses one event handler at  the root of your document that is responsible for listening to all events and calling the appropriate  event handler as necessary  see Figure 10.3 .   Conclusion  121  Figure 10.3  React uses one event handler at the root of your document.  This frees you from having to deal with optimizing your event handler–related code yourself.  If you’ve manually had to do that in the past, you can relax, knowing that React takes care of  that tedious task for you. If you’ve never had to optimize event handler–related code yourself,  consider yourself lucky.  Conclusion You’ll spend a good amount of time dealing with events, and this chapter threw a lot of things  at you. We started by exploring the basics of how to listen to events and specify the event  handler. Toward the end, we got fully invested and looked at eventing corner cases that you’ll  bump into if you aren’t careful enough. You don’t want to bump into corners. That’s never fun.

This page intentionally left blank    11 The Component Lifecycle  In the beginning, we took a very simple view of components and what they do. As you learned  more about React and did cooler and more involved things, you came to see that components  aren’t all that simple. They help us deal with properties, state, and events, and often are respon- sible for the well-being of other components as well. Keeping track of everything components  do sometimes can be tough.  To help with this, React provides us with lifecycle methods. Unsurprisingly, lifecycle methods  are special methods that automatically get called as our component goes about its business.  They notify us of important milestones in a component’s life, and we can use these notifica- tions to simply pay attention or change what our component is about to do.  In this chapter, we look at these lifecycle methods and talk about what we can do with them.  Note: Changes Are a Foot Here! There are proposed changes in this area that will change how lifecycle methods behave. What  you see printed here is based on the latest guidance, but note that this information may  change. Visit this link to be kept up-to-date: http:  bit.ly lifecycleChanges.  Meet the Lifecycle Methods Lifecycle methods aren’t very complicated. You can think of them as glorified event handlers  that get called at various points in a component’s life. As with event handlers, you can write  some code to do things at those various points. Before we go further, it’s time for you to  quickly meet our lifecycle methods:     componentWillMount     componentDidMount     componentWillUnmount     componentWillUpdate     componentDidUpdate     shouldComponentUpdate     componentWillReceiveProps     componentDidCatch   124  Chapter 11  The Component Lifecycle  We aren’t quite done yet. We’re going to throw one other method into the mix even though it  isn’t strictly a lifecycle method: the infamous render method.  Some of these names probably sound familiar to you, and some you’re probably seeing for the  first time. Don’t worry. By the end of all this, you’ll be on a first-name basis with all of them!  We’re going to look at these lifecycle methods from various angles, starting with some code.  See the Lifecycle Methods in Action Learning about these lifecycle methods is about as exciting as memorizing names for foreign  places you have no plans to visit. To make all of this more bearable, let’s play with them in a  simple example before we get all academic and read about them.  To play with this example, go to the following URL: https:  www.kirupa.com react  lifecycle_example.htm. When this page loads, you’ll see a variation of the counter example  you saw earlier  see Figure 11.1 .  Figure 11.1  A variation on the counter example.  Don’t click the button or anything just yet.  If you’ve already clicked the button, just refresh the  page to start the example from the beginning.  I’m saying this for a reason, and it isn’t because  my OCD is acting up. You want to see this page as it is before you interact with it.  Now bring up your browser’s developer tools and take a look at the Console tab. In Chrome,  you’ll see something that looks like Figure 11.2.   Meet the Lifecycle Methods  125  Figure 11.2  The Console view in Chrome.  Notice what you see printed. You see some messages, and these messages start with the name of  what looks like a lifecycle method. If you click the plus button now, notice that your Console  shows more lifecycle methods getting called  see Figure 11.3 .  Figure 11.3  More lifecycle methods getting called.  Play with this example for a bit. You can see that it allows you to place all of these lifecycle  methods in the context of a component that you’ve already seen. As you keep clicking the plus  button, more lifecycle method entries show up. Eventually, when your counter approaches  a value of 5, your example disappears and the following entry shows up in your console:   componentWillUnmount: Component is about to be removed from the DOM! At this  point, you’ve reached the end of this example. Of course, to start over, you can just refresh  the page.   126  Chapter 11  The Component Lifecycle  Now that you’ve seen the example, let’s take a quick look at the component that’s responsible  for all of this  full source: https:  github.com kirupa kirupa blob master reactjs lifecycle.htm :  class CounterParent extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       console.log "constructor: Default state time!" ;       this.state = {       count: 0     };       this.increase = this.increase.bind this ;   }     increase   {     this.setState {       count: this.state.count + 1     } ;   }     componentWillUpdate newProps, newState  {     console.log "componentWillUpdate: Component is about to update!" ;   }     componentDidUpdate currentProps, currentState  {     console.log "componentDidUpdate: Component just updated!" ;   }     componentWillMount   {     console.log "componentWillMount: Component is about to mount!" ;   }     componentDidMount   {     console.log "componentDidMount: Component just mounted!" ;   }     componentWillUnmount   {     console.log "componentWillUnmount: Component is about to be removed from the DOM!" ;   }     shouldComponentUpdate newProps, newState  {     console.log "shouldComponentUpdate: Should component update?" ;     Meet the Lifecycle Methods  127      if  newState.count < 5  {       console.log "shouldComponentUpdate: Component should update!" ;       return true;     } else {       ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode destination ;       console.log "shouldComponentUpdate: Component should not update!" ;       return false;     }   }     componentWillReceiveProps newProps  {     console.log "componentWillReceiveProps: Component will get new props!" ;   }     render   {     var backgroundStyle = {       padding: 50,       border: "333 2px dotted",       width: 250,       height: 100,       borderRadius: 10,       textAlign: "center"     };       return                                         +                        ;   } }   console.log "defaultProps: Default prop time!" ; CounterParent.defaultProps = {   };  Take a few moments to understand what all this code does. It seems lengthy, but the bulk of it  is just each lifecycle method listed with a console.log statement defined. After you’ve gone  through this code, play with the example one more time. Trust me. The more time you spend in  the example to figure out what’s going on, the more fun you’ll have. The following sections will be  dreadfully boring when we look at each lifecycle method across the rendering, updating, and  unmounting phases. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.   128  Chapter 11  The Component Lifecycle  The Initial Rendering Phase When your component is about to start its life and make its way to the DOM, the following  lifecycle methods get called  see Figure 11.4 .  Figure 11.4  The lifecycle methods called initially.  What you saw in your console when the example was loaded was a less colorful version of what  you saw here. Now let’s go a bit further and see more about what each lifecycle methods does.  Getting the Default Props This property on the component allows you to specify the default value of this.props. If we  wanted to set a name property on our CounterParent component, it could look as follows:  CounterParent.defaultProps = {   name: "Iron Man" };  This gets run before your component is even created or any props from parent components are  passed in.   Meet the Lifecycle Methods  129  Getting the Default State This step happens inside your component’s constructor. You get the chance to specify the  default value of this.state as part of your component’s creation:  constructor props  {   super props ;     console.log "constructor: Default state time!" ;     this.state = {     count: 0   };     this.increase = this.increase.bind this ; }  Notice that we’re defining our state object and initializing it with a count property whose  value is 0.  componentWillMount This is the last method that gets called before your component gets rendered to the DOM.  There’s an important point to note here: If you call setState inside this method, your   component will not re-render.  render This one should be very familiar to you by now. Every component must have this method  defined, and it is responsible for returning some JSX. If you don’t want to render anything,  simply return null or false.  componentDidMount This method gets called immediately after your component renders and gets placed on  the DOM. At this point, you can safely perform any DOM querying operations without  worrying about whether your component has made it. If you have any code that depends  on your component being ready, you can specify all of that code here as well.  With the exception of the render method, all of these lifecycle methods can fire only once.  That’s quite different from the methods you see next.   130  Chapter 11  The Component Lifecycle  The Updating Phase After your components get added to the DOM, they can potentially update and re-render when  a prop or state change occurs. During this time, a different collection of lifecycle methods gets  called. Yawn. Sorry…  Dealing with State Changes First, let’s look at a state change. As we mentioned earlier, when a state change occurs, your  component calls its render method again. Any components that rely on the output of this  component also get their render methods called. This is done to ensure that the component is  always displaying the latest version of itself. All of that is true, but it’s only a partial representa- tion of what happens.  When a state change happens, all the lifecycle methods in Figure 11.5 get called.  Figure 11.5  Lifecycle methods called when a state change happens.  Check out what these lifecycle methods do:   Meet the Lifecycle Methods  131  shouldComponentUpdate Sometimes you don’t want your component to update when a state change occurs. This  method allows you to control this updating behavior. If you use this method and return a true  value, the component will update. If this method returns a false value, this component will  skip updating.  That probably sounds a bit confusing, so take a look at a simple snippet:  shouldComponentUpdate newProps, newState  {   console.log "shouldComponentUpdate: Should component update?" ;     if  newState.count < 5  {     console.log "shouldComponentUpdate: Component should update!" ;     return true;   } else {     ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode destination ;     console.log "shouldComponentUpdate: Component should not update!" ;     return false;   } }  This method gets called with two arguments, which we named newProps and newState. In  this snippet of code, we check whether the new value of our id state property is less than or  equal to 2. If the value is less than or equal to 2, we return true to indicate that this compo- nent should update. If the value is not less than or equal to 2, we return false to indicate that  this component should not update.  componentWillUpdate This method gets called just before your component is about to update. Nothing too exciting  happens here. One point to note is that you can’t change your state by calling this.setState  from this method.  render If you didn’t override the update via shouldComponentUpdate, the code inside render gets  called again to ensure that your component displays itself properly.  componentDidUpdate This method gets called after your component updates and the render method has been called.  If you need to execute any code after the update takes place, this is the place to stash it.   132  Chapter 11  The Component Lifecycle  Dealing with Prop Changes The other time your component updates is when its prop value changes after it has been  rendered into the DOM. In this scenario, the lifecycle methods in Figure 11.6 get called.  Figure 11.6  Lifecycle methods when the component’s prop value changes.  The only new method here is componentWillReceiveProps. This method receives one argu- ment, and this argument contains the new prop value that is about to be assigned to it.  You saw the rest of the lifecycle methods when looking at state changes, so let’s not revisit  them. Their behavior is identical when dealing with a prop change.  The Unmounting Phase The last phase to look at is when your component is about to be destroyed and removed from  the DOM  see Figure 11.7 .  Only one lifecycle method is active here, and that is componentWillUnmount. You perform  cleanup-related tasks here, such as removing event listeners and stopping timers. After this  method gets called, your component is removed from the DOM and you can say goodbye to it.   Conclusion  133  Figure 11.7  Only one lifecycle method is active when your component is about to be destroyed  and removed from the DOM.  Conclusion Components are fascinating little things. On the surface, they seem like they don’t have much  going on. As in a good documentary about the oceans, when we look a little deeper and closer,  it’s almost like seeing a whole other world. As it turns out, React is constantly watching and  notifying your component every time something interesting happens. All of this is done via  the  extremely boring  lifecycle methods that we spent this entire tutorial looking at. Now,  I want to reassure you that knowing what each lifecycle method does and when it gets called  will come in handy one day. All that you’ve learned isn’t just trivial knowledge, although your  friends will be impressed if you can describe every lifecycle method from memory. Go ahead  and try it the next time you see them.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask! If you have any questions or your code isn’t running like you expect, don’t hesitate to ask!

This page intentionally left blank    12 Accessing DOM Elements  in React  Sometimes you want to access properties and methods on an HTML element directly. In our  React-colored world, where JSX represents everything that is good and pure about markup, why  would you ever want to deal directly with the horribleness that is HTML? As you will find out   if you haven’t already , in many cases, dealing with HTML elements through the JavaScript  DOM API directly is easier than fiddling with “the React way” of doing things. To highlight one  such situation, take a look at the Colorizer example in Figure 12.1.  Figure 12.1  Colorizer example.   136  Chapter 12  Accessing DOM Elements in React   If you have access to a browser, you can view it live at the following location:  https:  www.kirupa.com react examples colorizer.htm.  The Colorizer colorizes the  currently  white square with whatever color you provide it. To see  it in action, enter a color value inside the text field and click tap the Go button.  If you don’t  have any idea of what color to enter, yellow is a good one.  After you provide a color and  submit it, the white square turns whatever color value you provided  see Figure 12.2 .  Figure 12.2  The white square turns yellow.  The fact that the square changes color for any valid color value you submit is pretty awesome,  but that isn’t what you should focus on. Instead, pay attention to the text field and the button  after you submit a value. Notice that the button gets focus, and the color value you just  submitted is still displayed inside the form. If you want to enter another color value, you need  to explicitly return focus to the text field and clear out whatever current value is present. Eww!  That seems unnecessary, and we can do better than that from a usability point of view.  Wouldn’t it be great if we could both clear the existing color value and return focus to the text  field immediately after submitting a color? That would mean that if we submitted a color value  of purple, afterward we would see something that looks like Figure 12.3.   The Colorizer Example  137  Figure 12.3  We get purple and the text field is ready for the next color.  The entered value of purple is cleared and the focus is returned to the text field. This allows us  to enter additional color values and submit them easily without having to keep jumping back  and forth between the text field and the button. Isn’t that much nicer?  Getting this behavior right using JSX and traditional React techniques is hard. We aren’t even  going to bother explaining how to go about it. On the other hand, getting this behavior right  by dealing with the JavaScript DOM API on various HTML elements directly is pretty easy.  Guess what we’re going to do? In the following sections, we’re going to use something known  as refs, which React provides to help us access the DOM API on HTML elements. We’ll also look  at portals, which allow us to render content to any HTML element on the page.  The Colorizer Example To explain refs and portals, we’ll be modifying the Colorizer example you saw earlier. The code  for it looks as follows:          138  Chapter 12  Accessing DOM Elements in React            The Colorizer!                           container {       padding: 50px;       background-color: FFF;     }       .colorSquare {       box-shadow: 0px 0px 25px 0px 333;       width: 242px;       height: 242px;       margin-bottom: 15px;     }       .colorArea input {       padding: 10px;       font-size: 16px;       border: 2px solid CCC;     }       .colorArea button {       padding: 10px;       font-size: 16px;       margin: 10px;       background-color: 666;       color: FFF;       border: 2px solid 666;     }       .colorArea button:hover {       background-color: 111;       border-color: 111;       cursor: pointer;     }                        The Colorizer Example  139      class Colorizer extends React.Component {       constructor props  {         super props ;           this.state = {           color: "",           bgColor: "white"         };           this.colorValue = this.colorValue.bind this ;         this.setNewColor = this.setNewColor.bind this ;       }         colorValue e  {         this.setState {           color: e.target.value         } ;       }         setNewColor e  {         this.setState {           bgColor: this.state.color         } ;           e.preventDefault  ;       }         render   {         var squareStyle = {           backgroundColor: this.state.bgColor         };           return                                                            <input onChange={this.colorValue}                 placeholder="Enter a color value">                 go                                     ;       }     }     140  Chapter 12  Accessing DOM Elements in React       ReactDOM.render                           ,       document.querySelector "container"       ;            Take a few moments to look through the code and see how it maps to our example. You  shouldn’t find anything surprising here. Once you’ve gotten a good understanding of this code,  it’s time to learn about refs.  Meet Refs As you know very well by now, inside our various render methods we’ve been writing  HTML-like things known as JSX. Our JSX is simply a description of what the DOM should  look like. It doesn’t represent actual HTML, despite looking a whole lot like it. To provide a  bridge between JSX and the final HTML elements in the DOM, React provides us with  something funnily named as refs  short for references .  The way refs works is a little odd. The easiest way to make sense of it is to just use it. Take  a look at just the render method from our Colorizer example:  render   {   var squareStyle = {     backgroundColor: this.state.bgColor   };     return                                    <input onChange={this.colorValue}                placeholder="Enter a color value">           go                   ; }   Meet Refs  141  Inside this render method, we are returning a big chunk of JSX representing  among other  things  the input element where we enter our color value. We want to access the input  element’s DOM representation so that we can call some APIs on it using JavaScript.  The way we do that using refs is by setting the ref attribute on the element whose HTML we  want to reference:  render   {   var squareStyle = {     backgroundColor: this.state.bgColor   };     return                                    <input onChange={this.colorValue}                ref={}                placeholder="Enter a color value">           go                   ; }  Because we’re interested in the input element, our ref attribute is attached to it. Right now,  our ref attribute is empty. What you typically set as the ref attribute’s value is a JavaScript  callback function. This function gets called automatically when the component housing this  render method gets mounted. If we set our ref attribute’s value to a simple JavaScript func- tion that stores a reference to the referenced DOM element, it would look something like the  following highlighted lines:  render   {   var squareStyle = {     backgroundColor: this.state.bgColor   };     var self = this;     return                                    <input onChange={this.colorValue}                ref={                  function el  {   142  Chapter 12  Accessing DOM Elements in React                      self._input = el;                  }                }                placeholder="Enter a color value">           go                   ; }  The end result of this code running once our component mounts is simple: We can access  the HTML representing our input element from anywhere inside our component by using  self._input. Take a few moments to see how the highlighted lines of code help do  that. When you’re done, we’ll walk through this code together.  First, our callback function looks as follows:  function el  {  self._input = el; }  This anonymous function gets called when our component mounts, and a reference to the  final HTML DOM element is passed in as an argument. We capture this argument using the el   identifier, but you can use any name for this argument that you want. The body of this  callback  function simply sets a custom property called _input to the value of our DOM element. To  ensure that we create this property on our component, we use the self variable to create a  closure—the this in question refers to our component instead of the callback function itself.  Phew!  Let’s focus on what we can do now that we have access to our input element. Our goal is to  clear the contents of our input element and give focus to it once the form gets submitted. The  code for doing that will live in our setNewColor method, so add the following highlighted  lines:  setNewColor e  {   this.setState {     bgColor: this.state.color   } ;     this._input.focus  ;   this._input.value = "";     e.preventDefault  ; }  Calling this._input.value = "" clears the color we entered. We set focus back to our input  element by calling this._input.focus  . All our ref-related work was to simply enable these  two lines; we needed some way to have this._input point to the HTML element representing  our input element that we defined in JSX. Then we can just call the value property and focus  method that the DOM API exposes on this element.   Using Portals  143  Simplifying Further with ES6 Arrow Functions Learning React is hard enough, so I’ve tried to avoid forcing you to use ES6 techniques by  default. When it comes to working with the ref attribute, using arrow functions to deal with the  callback function simplifies matters a bit. This is one of those cases for which I recommend  you use an ES6 technique. As you saw a few moments ago, to assign a property on our component to the referenced  HTML element, we did something like this:            function el  {              self._input = el;  <input      ref={            }          }>     <input      ref={          }>                el  => this._input = el  To deal with context shenanigans, we created a self variable initialized to this, to ensure  that we created the _input property on our component. That seems unnecessarily messy. Using arrow functions, we can simplify all of this down to just the following:  The end result is identical to what we spent all this time looking at. Because of how arrow func- tions deal with context, you can use this inside the function body and reference the  component  without doing any extra work. No need for an outer self variable equivalent!       Using Portals You need to be aware of one more DOM-related trick. So far, we’ve been dealing with HTML  only in the context of what our JSX generates, either from a single component or combined  through many components. This means we’re limited by the DOM hierarchy our parent  components impose on us. Having arbitrary access to any DOM element anywhere on the page  doesn’t seem possible. Or is it? As it turns out, you can choose to render your JSX to any DOM  element anywhere on the page; you aren’t limited to just sending your JSX to a parent compo- nent. The magic behind this wizardry is a feature known as portals.  The way we use a portal is very similar to what we do with our ReactDOM.render method.  We specify the JSX we want to render, and we specify the DOM element we want to render to.    144  Chapter 12  Accessing DOM Elements in React   To see all of this in action, go back to our example and add the following h1 element  as a sibling just above where we have our container div element defined:         Colorizer                   .           .           .  colorHeading {   padding: 0;   margin: 50px;   margin-bottom: -20px;   font-family: sans-serif; }  Next, add the following style rule inside the style tag to make our h1 element look nicer:  With this style rule added, let’s first preview our app to make sure that the HTML and CSS we  added look as expected  Figure 12.4 :  Figure 12.4  What our example looks like currently!   Using Portals  145  Here’s what we want to do. We want to change the value of our h1 element to display the  name of the color we are currently previewing. The point to emphasize is that our h1 element  is a sibling of the container div element where our app is set to render into.  To accomplish what we’re trying to do, go back to our Colorizer component’s render  method and add the following highlighted line to the return statement:  return                            <input onChange={this.colorValue}               ref={                 function el  {                   self._input = el;                 }               }               placeholder="Enter a color value">         go                   ;  var heading = document.querySelector "colorHeading" ;   class ColorLabel extends React.Component {   render   {     return ReactDOM.createPortal        ": " + this.props.color,       heading      ;   } }  Here we’re instantiating a component called ColorLabel and declaring a prop called color  with its value set to our bgColor state property. We haven’t created this component yet, so to  fix that, add the following lines just above where we have our ReactDOM.render call:  We are referencing our h1 element with the heading variable. That’s old stuff. For the new stuff,  take a look at our ColorLabel component’s render method. More specifically, notice what our  return statement looks like. We are returning the result of calling ReactDOM.createPortal  :  class ColorLabel extends React.Component {   render   {     return ReactDOM.createPortal    146  Chapter 12  Accessing DOM Elements in React         ": " + this.props.color,       heading      ;   } }  class ColorLabel extends React.Component {   render   {     return ReactDOM.createPortal        ": " + this.props.color,       heading      ;   } }  class ColorLabel extends React.Component {   render   {     return ReactDOM.createPortal        ": " + this.props.color,       heading      ;   } }  The ReactDOM.createPortal   method takes two arguments: the JSX to print and the DOM  element to print that JSX to. The JSX we are printing is just some formatting characters and the  color value we passed in as a prop:  The DOM element we are printing all of this to is our h1 element referenced by the heading  variable:  When you preview your app and change the color, notice what happens. The color we specified  in our input element shows up in the heading  Figure 12.5 :   Using Portals  147  Figure 12.5  Our header now contains our color element.  The important part to re-emphasize is that our h1 element is outside the scope of our main  React app, which prints to our container div element. By relying on portals, we have  direct access to any element in our page’s DOM and can render content into it, bypassing the   traditional parent child hierarchy we’ve been living under so far.   148  Chapter 12  Accessing DOM Elements in React   Conclusion Most of the time, everything you want to do will be within arm’s reach of the JSX you’re  writing. Sometimes, though, you need to break free from the box React puts you in. Even  though everything we’re creating is rendering to a HTML document, our React app is like a  self-sufficient tropical island within the document; you never quite see the actual HTML that  lies just beneath the sands. To help you both see the HTML inside the island and make contact  with things that live outside the island, we looked at two features, refs and portals. Refs allow  you to cut through and access the underlying HTML element behind the JSX. Portals allow you  to render your content to any element in the DOM that you have access to. Between these two  solutions, you should be able to easily address any need that you have to deal with regards to  the DOM directly.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask!

To review what we mentioned earlier when talking about this approach, the downside is  performance. As your browser handles all of the page loading things it normally does, it is also  responsible for turning your JSX into actual JavaScript. That conversion is a time-consuming  process that is fine during development but not fine if every user of your app has to pay that  performance penalty.     Setting Up Your React Dev Environment Easily  151  The solution is to set up your development environment so that your JSX-to-JS conversion is  handled as part of getting your app built  Figure 13.2 :  Figure 13.2  What the proper dev setup does with our JSX!  With this solution, your browser is loading your app and dealing with an already converted   and potentially optimized  JavaScript file. Good stuff, right? The only reason we delayed  talking about all of this until now is for simplicity. Learning React is difficult enough. Adding  the complexity of build tools and setting up your environment as part of learning React is just  not cool. Now that you have a solid grasp of everything React does, it’s time to change that  with this chapter.   152  Chapter 13  Setting Up Your React Dev Environment Easily  In the following sections, we’re going to look at one way to set up your development environ- ment using a combination of Node, Babel, and webpack. If all of this sounds bizarre to you,  don’t worry. We’ll use a really nifty solution created by Facebook that makes all of this a breeze.  Onward!  Meet Create React A few years ago, getting your build environment set up would have been a huge pain because  it involved manually configuring all the tools we’ve talked about. You would have had to ask  your really smart friend for some advice. You might even have questioned your decision to  learn programming and React in the first place. Fortunately, the Create React project   https:  github.com facebookincubator create-react-app  came about and greatly simplified the  process of setting up your React environment. You just run a few commands on your command  line, and your React project is automatically created with all the proper behind-the-scenes  configurations.  To get started, first make sure you have the latest version of Node installed  https:  nodejs.org  .  Then bring up your favorite command line. If you aren’t too familiar with command lines,  don’t worry. On Windows, launch either the command prompt or the BASH shell. On Mac,  launch the Terminal. You’ll see something that looks like this:  It’s basically some bizarre window with a blinking cursor that allows you to type things into  it. The first thing you need to do is install the Create React project. Type the following in your  command line and press Enter Return:  npm install -g create-react-app   Meet Create React  153  It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, but once your installation has  completed, it’s time to create our new React project. Navigate to the folder where you want to  create your new project—this can be your desktop, a location under Documents, and so on.  When you’ve navigated to a folder in your command line, enter the following to create a new  project at this location:  create-react-app helloworld  You’ll see something that looks as follows:  After the command has fully executed, you’ll have a project called helloworld created for you.  Don’t worry too much about everything that’s going on; we’ll look at the project contents  later. For now, the first thing to do is test this project. Navigate into the newly created project’s  helloworld folder by typing the following:  cd helloworld  npm start  From inside this folder, enter the following to test the app:  If you have yarn installed, Create will prefer it over npm for the install and you’ll see onscreen  instructions saying to use yarn start instead of npm start.   154  Chapter 13  Setting Up Your React Dev Environment Easily  Your project will get built, a local web server will get started, and you’ll see your project  running, similar to the following image:  If everything worked out properly, you should see the same thing. If this is your first time  creating a new React project using the command line, congratulations! This is a really big step.  You aren’t done, though. Now, we need to take a few steps back and revisit what exactly just  happened.  Making Sense of What Happened Right now, we just see whatever default content the create-react-app command generated  for us. That isn’t very helpful. First, let’s take a look at what exactly gets generated. Your file  and folder structure after running create-react-app helloworld will look as in Figure 13.3:   Meet Create React  155  Figure 13.3  What our file and folder structure looks like.  The index.html in your public folder gets loaded in your browser. If you take a look at this file,  you’ll realize that it’s very basic. Here are the contents of this file with all the comments removed:                    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1,  shrink-to-fit=no">                            React App                      You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.                          156  Chapter 13  Setting Up Your React Dev Environment Easily  The important part to look at is the div element with an id value of root. This is where the  contents of our React app ultimately get printed to. Speaking of that, the contents of our React  app with all the JSX are contained inside the src folder. The starting point for our React app is  contained in index.js:  import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import '. index.css'; import App from '. App'; import registerServiceWorker from '. registerServiceWorker';   ReactDOM.render  , document.getElementById 'root'  ; registerServiceWorker  ;  Notice the ReactDOM.render call that looks for the root element we called out inside  index.html. You’ll also see a bunch of import statements at the top of the page. These import  statements are part of something in JavaScript known as modules. The goal of modules is to  divide the functionality of your app into increasingly smaller pieces. When it comes time to  use a piece, you import only what you need instead of everything and the entire kitchen sink.  Some of the modules you import are a part of code in your project. Other modules, like React  and ReactDOM, are external to your project but still capable of being imported. I can say a lot  about module loading, but for your sanity  and mine! , let’s just leave that topic alone for now.  In our code right now, we’re importing both the React and React-DOM libraries. That should be  familiar from when we included the script tags for them earlier. We’re also importing a CSS file,  a service worker script that we’ll reference as registerServiceWorker, and a React compo- nent that we’ll reference as App.  Our App component seems like our next stop, so to see what’s inside it, open App.js:  import React, { Component } from 'react'; import logo from '. logo.svg'; import '. App.css';   class App extends Component {   render   {     return                                            Welcome to React                                To get started, edit  src App.js  and save to reload.                        ;   } }   export default App;   Meet Create React  157  Notice that our App.js file has import statements of its own. Some, such as the one for React  and Component, seem necessary, given what our code is doing. The last line here is interesting:  export default app. It contains the export command and the name that our project will  use to identify the exported module. You’ll use this exported name when importing the App  module in other parts of the project, such as index.js. Closing out what this file is doing, it  also imports an image and CSS file that are needed to make this page work.  You’ve now seen a different way of structuring code using some potentially new keywords.  What’s the purpose of all of this? These modules, import statements, and export statements  are just niceties to make our app’s code more manageable. Instead of having everything defined  in one giant file, you can break your code and related assets across multiple files. Depending on  which files you reference and what files get loaded ahead of other files, our mysterious build  process  currently kicked off with an npm start  can optimize the final output in a variety of  ways that we don’t need to worry about.  The important point to note is that none of these things you are doing to your code affect the function- ality of your final app in any major way. Behind the scenes, when we’re ready to test our app, a  build step takes place. This build step makes sense of all of the various files and components  you are importing, to present them as an easily digestible set of combined files for the browser  to take care of. We’ll get one JS file with all the relevant pieces represented:  We’ll also get one combined CSS file. Depending on what else you might have configured, you  could get other combined files for your HTML and more. All of these will be in a form that  your browser will immediately know what to do with. Your browser will have no additional  work to do, as in our in-browser solution we were using initially. Everything gets generated  as vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   158  Chapter 13  Setting Up Your React Dev Environment Easily  Creating Our HelloWorld App Now that you’ve gotten a better idea of what this project is doing, let’s modify the example.  We want to display the words Hello, world! to our screen. We’ll go about this by creating  a component, appropriately called HelloWorld, to handle it for us. The new part in this isn’t  that you get some text to display onscreen; you’re a pro at that by this point. The part to focus  on is how to structure the files in your project to ensure that you’re creating your app the  right way.  To get started, go to your src directory and delete all the files you see there. Then create a new  file called index.js. Inside that file, add the following contents:  We’re importing our React and ReactDOM modules here. We’re also importing a component  called HelloWorld that we are specifying in our ReactDOM.render call. That component  doesn’t exist, so we are going to fix that next.  In the same src directory that we’re in right now, create a file called HelloWorld.js. Then go  ahead and modify it by adding in the following:  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import HelloWorld from ". HelloWorld";   ReactDOM.render       ,     document.getElementById "root"   ;  import React, { Component } from "react";   class HelloWorld extends Component {   render   {     return                    Hello, world!               ;   } }   export default HelloWorld;  Take a moment to look through what you’ve added. You shouldn’t see anything really exciting  going on here—just a boring import statement, our HelloWorld component that prints some  text to the screen, and  in the last line  code that tags our HelloWorld component for export- ing so that it can be imported by another module, such as our index.js.  With these changes made, we can test the application. Make sure you’ve saved all your changes.  Go back to the command line and type in npm start. If your app was already running behind    Creating Our HelloWorld App  159  the scenes, you would automatically see it update with the latest changes. If that didn’t happen  or your app stopped, press Ctrl+C to stop the session and enter npm start again.  You should see something similar to this on your screen:  If this is what you see, great! Our example is working now, but it looks a little too plain. Let’s  fix that by adding some CSS. Create a stylesheet called index.css, and add the following style  rule into it:  In this approach for building apps, creating the stylesheet is only one part of what you have to  do. The other part requires you to reference the newly created index.css in the index.js file.  Open index.js and add the highlighted import statement for it:  body {   display: flex;   align-items: center;   justify-content: center;   min-height: 100vh;   margin: 0; }  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import HelloWorld from ". HelloWorld"; import ". index.css";  ReactDOM.render       ,     document.getElementById "root"   ;   160  Chapter 13  Setting Up Your React Dev Environment Easily  If you go back to your browser, you’ll notice that the current setup automatically refreshes your  page with all the latest changes. You’ll see the words Hello, world! centered vertically and  horizontally for you. Not bad, but we can do better.  The last thing we want to do is make our text appear in a more stylish fashion. We could add  the appropriate style rules to index.css itself, but the more appropriate solution is to create  a new CSS file that we reference only in our HelloWorld component. The end result of both  approaches is identical, but you want to get into the practice of grouping related files  and their  dependencies  together, as part of being a better developer.  Create a new file called HelloWorld.css inside the src folder. Add the following style rule  into it:  All that’s left is to reference this stylesheet in the HelloWorld.js file, so open that file and add  the highlighted import statement:  h1 {     font-family: sans-serif;     font-size: 56px;     padding: 5px;     padding-left: 15px;     padding-right: 15px;     margin: 0;     background: linear-gradient to bottom,                                 white 0%,                                 white 62%,                                 gold 62%,                                 gold 100% ; }  import React, { Component } from "react"; import ". HelloWorld.css";   class HelloWorld extends Component {   render   {     return                    Hello, world!               ;   } }   export default HelloWorld;  If you go back to your browser, you know that everything worked out fine if you see something  like the following:   Creating a Production Build  161  You’ll see the words Hello, world! displayed, but with a little more style and pizazz   as the cool kids say these days  than they did a few moments ago.  Creating a Production Build We’re almost done. We’ve got just one more thing left to do. So far, we’ve been building this  app in development mode. In this mode, our code isn’t minified and some of the things run  in a slow verbose setting so that we can debug issues more easily. When it’s time to send the  app live to our real users, we want the fastest and most compact solution possible. For that, we  can go back to the command line and enter the following  after stopping the build by pressing  Ctrl+C :  npm run build  The script takes a few minutes to create an optimized set of files for you. Once it has run to  completion, you’ll see some confirmation text that looks as follows:   162  Chapter 13  Setting Up Your React Dev Environment Easily  When this has completed, you can follow the onscreen prompts to deploy it to your server or  just test it locally using the popular serve node package.  Also take a moment to browse through all the files that were generated. The end result is just  plain HTML, CSS, and JS files. No JSX. No multiple JS files. We have just a single JS file that  contains all the logic our app needs to work.  Conclusion So that just happened! In the preceding sections, we used the awesome Create React solution  to create our React app in a modern way. If this is your first time building apps like this, you’ll  want to get more familiar with this approach. We use the create-react-app command for  future React examples; our earlier in-browser approach was just to help you learn the basics  without fiddling with all of what you saw here. Under the covers, Create React hides a lot of  the complexity that goes with tweaking Node, Babel, webpack, and other components. That is  its greatest strength, as well as its greatest weakness.  If you want to go beyond the happy path that Create React provides, you’ll need to learn a lot  of the complexity hidden underneath. Covering all of that goes beyond this book. As a starting  point, take a look at what’s specified in the various JS files under the node_modules react_ scripts scripts path.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask!

This “dealing” typically  looks as follows:  1.  Your app makes a request for some data to a remote service.  2.  The remote service receives the request and sends back some data.  3.  Your app receives the data.  4.  Your app formats and displays the data to the user.  Whether or not you realize it, almost all your favorite websites follow these four steps…Facebook,  Amazon, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, KIRUPA, and so on. When you starting loading a page on  any of these sites, they all display some data initially.   164  Chapter 14  Working with External Data in React   To keep your initial page size low, not everything is downloaded at once. After your page has  fully loaded or you interact with your page, the page downloads additional data from the server  and displays it.   Working with External Data in React    165  This is all done without requiring you to refresh the page or lose any state your page is in. The  magic behind it all is a little bit of JavaScript that handles the four steps we looked at earlier. In  this chapter, you’ll learn all about the JavaScript needed to do that and how to make it all work  inside a React app.  By the end, you’ll have created a simple React app that looks as follows  view in your browser  here: https:  www.kirupa.com react examples ipaddress.htm :   166  Chapter 14  Working with External Data in React   Here you’re seeing your device’s IP address displayed. That’s it. I realize that this isn’t very  complicated, as examples go  especially if you were all excited seeing Twitter highlighted in the  screenshots , but it contains just the right amount of complexity and relevant details to ensure  that you know how to deal with external data from inside a React app.  Onward!  Web Request 101 As you probably know very well by now, the Internet is made up of a bunch of interconnected  computers, called servers. When you’re surfing the web and navigating between web pages,  you’re really telling your browser to request information from any of these servers. It kind of  looks as follows: Your browser sends a request, waits awkwardly for the server to respond to  the request, and  once the server responds  processes the request. All of this communication is  made possible because of something known as the HTTP protocol.  The HTTP protocol provides a common language that allows your browser and a bunch of  other things to communicate with all the servers that make up the Internet. The requests your  browser makes on your behalf using the HTTP protocol are known as HTTP requests, and these  requests go well beyond simply loading a new page as you are navigating. A common  and  whole lot more exciting!  set of use cases revolves around updating your existing page with data  resulting from a HTTP request.  For example, you might have a page where you’d like to display some information about  the currently logged-in user. This is information your page might not have initially, but it is  information your browser will request when you’re interacting with the page. The server will  respond with the data and update your page with that information. All of this probably sounds  a bit abstract, so I’m going to go a bit weird for a few moments and describe a possible HTTP  request and response for this example.   It’s React Time!  167  To get information about the user, here’s our HTTP request:  GET  user Accept: application json  For that request, here’s what the server might return:  200 OK Content-Type: application json   {   "name": "Kirupa",   "url": "http:https:  www.kirupa.com" }  This back-and-forth happens a bunch of times, and it’s all fully supported in JavaScript. This  ability to asynchronously request and process data from a server without requiring a page  navigation reload has a term: Ajax  or AJAX, if you want to shout . This acronym stands for  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. If you were around web developers a few years ago, Ajax  was the buzzword everybody threw around to describe the kind of web apps we take for granted  today  Twitter, Facebook, Google Maps, Gmail, and more  that constantly fetch data as you  interact with the page, without requiring a full page reload.  In JavaScript, the object that is responsible for allowing you to send and receive HTTP requests  is the weirdly named XMLHttpRequest. This object allows you to do several things that are  important to making web requests:  1.  Send a request to a server  2.  Check on the status of a request  3.  Retrieve and parse the response from the request  4.  Listen for the readystatechange event that helps you react to the status of your request  XMLHttpRequest does a few more things, but those aren’t important to deal with right now.  Why Not Use Third-Party Libraries? A bunch of third-party libraries wrap and simplify how you can work with the XMLHttpRequest  object. Feel free to use them if you want, but using the XMLHttpRequest object directly isn’t  very complicated, either. It’s only a few lines of code, and  compared to everything you’ve been  learning in React  they’re some of the easiest lines of code you’ll encounter.        It’s React Time! Now that you have a good enough understanding of how HTTP requests and the XMLHttpRequest  object work, it’s time to shift our focus to the React side. I should warn you, though, that React  brings very little to the table when it comes to working with external data. React is primarily    168  Chapter 14  Working with External Data in React   focused on the presentation layer  a.k.a. the V in MVC . We’ll be writing regular, boring JavaScript  inside a React component whose primary purpose is to deal with the web requests we’ll be making. We’ll  talk more about that design choice in a little bit, but let’s get the example up and running first.  Getting Started The first step is to create a new React app. From your command line, navigate to the folder  where you want to create your new project and enter the following:  create-react-app ipaddress  Press Enter Return to run that command. A few moments later, a brand new React project will  be created. You want to start from a blank slate, so you’re going to delete a lot of things. First,  delete everything under your public folder. Next, delete everything inside your src folder.  Don’t worry: You’ll fill them back with content you care about in a few moments, starting with  your HTML file.  Inside the public folder, create a new file called index.html. Add the following content  into it:             IP Address                         All we have going here is a div element named container. Next, go to your src folder and  create a new file called index.js. Inside this file, add the following:  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import ". index.css"; import IPAddressContainer from ". IPAddressContainer";   var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;   ReactDOM.render                       ,     destination  ;   Getting the IP Address  169  This is the script entry point for our app, and it contains the boilerplate references to React,  ReactDOM, a nonexistent CSS file, and a nonexistent IPAddressContainer component.  We also have the ReactDOM.render call that is responsible for writing our content to the  container div element we defined in our HTML a few moments ago.  There’s just one more thing to do before we get to the really interesting stuff. Inside the src  folder, create the index.css file and add the following style rule into it:  body {   background-color: FFCC00; }  Save all these changes if you haven’t done so already. We sort of have the beginnings of our app  started. In the next section, we’re going to make our app really useful—or at least get really close!  Getting the IP Address Next on our plate is to create a component whose job it is to fetch the IP address from  a web service, store it as state, and then share that state as a prop to any component  that requires it. Let’s create a component to help. Inside your src folder, add a file called  IPAddressContainer.js and then add the following lines inside it:  import React, { Component } from "react";   class IPAddressContainer extends Component {   render   {     return          Nothing yet!       ;   } }   export default IPAddressContainer;  The lines you just added don’t do a whole lot. They just print the words Nothing yet! to  the screen. That’s not bad for now, but let’s go ahead and modify the code to make the HTTP  request by adding the following changes:  var xhr;   class IPAddressContainer extends Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;      this.state = {       ip_address: "..."     };       this.processRequest = this.processRequest.bind this ;   }   170  Chapter 14  Working with External Data in React     componentDidMount   {     xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ;     xhr.open "GET", "https:  ipinfo.io json", true ;     xhr.send  ;       xhr.addEventListener "readystatechange", this.processRequest, false ;   }     processRequest   {     if  xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200  {       var response = JSON.parse xhr.responseText ;         this.setState {         ip_address: response.ip       } ;     }   }     render   {     return          Nothing yet!       ;   } };  Now we’re getting somewhere! When our component becomes active and the component- DidMount lifecycle method gets called, we make our HTTP request and send it off to the  ipinfo.io web service:          .         .         .         componentDidMount   {           xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ;           xhr.open 'GET', "https:  ipinfo.io json", true ;           xhr.send  ;             xhr.addEventListener "readystatechange", this.processRequest, false ;         }         .         .         .   When we hear a response back from the ipinfo service, we call the processRequest function  to help us deal with the result:  Getting the IP Address  171          .         .         .    processRequest   {     if  xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200  {       var response = JSON.parse xhr.responseText ;         this.setState {         ip_address: response.ip       } ;     }         .         .         .  Next, modify the render call to reference the IP address value stored by our state:  var xhr;   class IPAddressContainer extends Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       ip_address: "..."     };       this.processRequest = this.processRequest.bind this ;   }     componentDidMount   {     xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ;     xhr.open "GET", "https:  ipinfo.io json", true ;     xhr.send  ;       xhr.addEventListener "readystatechange", this.processRequest, false ;   }     processRequest   {     if  xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200  {       var response = JSON.parse xhr.responseText ;     172  Chapter 14  Working with External Data in React         this.setState {         ip_address: response.ip       } ;     }   }     render   {     return          {this.state.ip_address}       ;   } }  If you preview your app in your browser, you should see an IP address displayed. If you need  a reminder, you can preview your app by navigating into your ipaddress folder via your  command line and entering npm start. When your app launches, it will look something like  the following:  Our app currently doesn’t look like much, but we’ll fix that in the next section.  Kicking the Visuals Up a Notch The hard part is done! We created a component that handles all the HTTP requesting shenani- gans, and we know that it returns the IP address when called. Now we’re going to format the  output a bit so that it doesn’t look as plain as it does now.   Getting the IP Address  173  To do that, we won’t add HTML elements and styling-related details to our  IPAddressContainer component’s render method. Instead, we’ll create a new component  whose only purpose will be to deal with all of that.  Add a new file called IPAddress.js in your src folder. Then edit it by adding the following  content into it:  import React, { Component } from "react";   class IPAddress extends Component {   render   {     return                   Blah!              ;   } }   export default IPAddress;  Here we’re defining a new component called IPAddress that will be responsible for displaying  the additional text and ensuring that our IP address is visually formatted exactly the way we  want. It doesn’t do much right now, but that will change really quickly.  We first want to modify this component’s render method to look as follows:  class IPAddress extends Component {   render   {     return                    {this.props.ip}             This is your IP address...probably :P                 ;   } }   export default IPAddress;  The highlighted changes should be self-explanatory. We’re putting the results of a prop value  called ip inside an h1 tag, and we’re displaying some additional text using a p tag. Besides making  the rendered HTML a bit more semantic, these changes ensure that we can style them better.  To get these elements styled, add a new CSS file to the src folder called IPAddress.css. Inside  this file, add the following style rules:  h1 {   font-family: sans-serif;   text-align: center;   174  Chapter 14  Working with External Data in React     padding-top: 140px;   font-size: 60px;   margin: -15px; } p {   font-family: sans-serif;   color: 907400;   text-align: center; }  With the styles defined, we need to reference this CSS file in our IPAddress.js file. To do that,  add the following highlighted line:  All that remains is to use our IPAddress component and pass in the IP address. The first step is  to ensure that the IPAddressContainer component is aware of the IPAddress component by  referencing it. At the top of IPAddressContainer.js, add the following highlighted line:  import React, { Component } from "react"; import ". IPAddress.css";   class IPAddress extends Component {   render   {     return                    {this.props.ip}             This is your IP address...probably :P                 ;   } }  export default IPAddress;  The second  and last!  step is to modify the render method as follows:  import React, { Component } from "react"; import IPAddress from ". IPAddress";     .     .     .  class IPAddressContainer extends Component {     .     .     .   render   {     return                ;   } }   Getting the IP Address  175  In our highlighted line, we call our IPAddress component, define a prop called ip, and set its  value to the ip_address state variable. This is done to ensure that our IP address value travels  all the way back to the IPAddress component’s render method, where it gets formatted and  displayed.  If you preview the app in your browser now, you should see something identical to the  example we set out to create in the beginning.  At this point, you’re done with the app…and almost done with this tutorial. You just need to  know one more thing about these awesome components that you’ve added.  Presentational vs. Container Components Given what we’ve seen here so far, it seems like a good time to talk about a design choice  that we’ve been indirectly following not just in this tutorial, but in other tutorials as well. In our  React apps, we have been primarily dealing with two types of components:  1.  Components that deal with how things look. These are better known as    presentational components.  2.  Components that perform some under-the-covers processing. Examples of this   processing include routing, increasing a counter, fetching data via a HTTP request, and so  on. You will see these components referred to as container components.  Thinking about your components in terms of whether they display something  presentational  or  whether they feed data to other components  container  helps you better organize your React  app. For the full low-down on how to deal with these two types of components, check out this  article by React’s Dan Abramov: https:  medium.com @dan_abramov smart-and-dumb- components-7ca2f9a7c7d0.               176  Chapter 14  Working with External Data in React   Conclusion At this point, you’re probably wondering what was made special because of React. All we really  did here was use a boring old JavaScript API inside a component, hook up some events, and  do the same state- and prop-related tasks you’ve done several times already. Here’s the thing:  You’ve already learned almost everything there is to learn about the basics of React. Going  forward, nothing should surprise you. The only new things we’ll be looking at fall into the  category of repurposing and repackaging the basic concepts you already know into newer and  cooler situations. After all, isn’t that what programming is all about?  Note: If you run into any issues, ask! If you have any questions or your code isn’t running like you expect, don’t hesitate to ask!

In this  chapter, we tie together a lot of the concepts and techniques you’ve learned to create some- thing that works as follows: https:  www.kirupa.com react examples todo.htm.  You start with a blank app that allows you to enter tasks for later  see Figure 15.1 .  Figure 15.1  A blank app with task entry.   178  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React  The way this Todo List app works is pretty simple. You type in a task or item or whatever you  want into the input field and then press Add  or click Enter Return . After you’ve submitted  your item, you’ll see it appear as an entry. You can keep adding items and have them all show  up  see Figure 15.2 .  Figure 15.2  You can add tasks and have them show up.  To remove an item, just click on an existing entry. Pretty simple, right? In the following  sections, we build this app together from scratch using a lot of the adrenaline-inducing   techniques you’ve learned so far.   Getting Started  179  This is going to be a fun exercise of building each part of the app and learning  in awesomely  painstaking detail  how the various little things work along the way.  Onward!  Getting Started The first step is to create a new React app, as you learned in Chapter 13, “Setting Up Your React  Dev Environment Easily.” From your command line, navigate to the folder where you want to  create your new project and enter the following:  create-react-app todolist  Press Enter Return to run that command. A few moments later, a brand new React project is  created. We want to start from a blank slate, so we’re going to delete everything contained in  our public folder and our src folder.  By now, you know the drill. You need a starting point, so go ahead and create a new HTML  document inside your public folder called index.html. Inside it, add the following content:            Todo List      180  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React  This page is pretty basic, as you can tell. The real magic is going to be happening in the src  directory, where your JavaScript and CSS files will live. In the src directory, create a new file  called index.css and add the following style rules into it:                   body {   padding: 50px;   background-color: 66CCFF;   font-family: sans-serif; } container {   display: flex;   justify-content: center; }  ReactDOM.render                 Hello!       ,     destination  ;  Now let’s add the JavaScript that rounds out the starting page. Within the same src directory,  add a new file called index.js. Inside this file, add the following content:  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import ". index.css";  var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;  Take a moment to look at what you’ve just added. By now, you should be fully familiar with  what’s going on with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript here. What we really have is the founda- tion. In the following sections, we’ll build on top of this all the pieces that make up the rest of  our Todo List app.  Creating the Initial UI Right now, our app doesn’t do a whole lot. It doesn’t look like much, either. We’ll deal with the  functionality in a little bit, but first let’s get the various UI elements up and running. That isn’t  very complicated for our app. First we’ll get our input field and button to appear. This is all  done by using the div, form, input, and button elements.   All of that will live inside a component we’ll call TodoList. In your src folder, add a file called  TodoList.js. Inside this file, add the following:  Creating the Initial UI  181  import React, { Component } from "react";   class TodoList extends Component {   render   {     return                                                                          add                                     ;   } }   export default TodoList;  Take a moment to glance at what you’ve added. You can see a bunch of JSX that gets the form  elements up and running. To use the newly created TodoList component, let’s go back to  index.js and reference it to see how our app looks now. Go ahead and make the following  two changes:  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import ". index.css"; import TodoList from ". TodoList";   var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;   ReactDOM.render                       ,     destination  ;  Save all your changes and preview in your browser. If everything worked, you’ll see something  that looks like Figure 15.3.   182  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React  Figure 15.3  What our app looks like right now.  Right now, we have our input field and submit button showing up. These two UI elements  neither work nor look too visually appealing. We’ll fix that in a little bit, but first let’s talk  about how we’re going to add the rest of the app’s functionality.  Building the Rest of the App As you can imagine, getting the initial UI elements to show up is the easy part. Tying up all the  visuals with the underlying data is where the real work lies. This work can roughly be divided  into five parts:  1.  Adding items  2.  Displaying items  3.  Styling  4.  Removing items  5.  Animating items as they are added or removed  Individually, all of these little implementation details are easy to wrap your brain around.  When you put them together, you need to watch out for a few things. We’ll look at all that and  more in the following sections.   Building the Rest of the App  183  Adding Items The first major task to tackle is setting up the event handlers and default form-handling behav- ior to allow us to add an item. Go back to the form element and make the following high- lighted change:  class TodoList extends Component {   render   {     return                                                                          add                                     ;   } }  class TodoList extends Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.addItem = this.addItem.bind this ;   }     addItem e  {    }    .    .    . }  We listen for the submit event on the form itself, and we call the addItem method when that  event is overheard. Notice that we aren’t listening for any event on the button itself. This is  because our button has a type attribute set to submit. This is one of those HTML trickeries  in which clicking on the button whose type is submit is the equivalent of firing the submit  event on the form.  Now it’s time to create our addItem event handler that will get called when our form gets  submitted. Add the following highlighted lines just above where we have our render function  defined:   184  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React  All we did was define our addItem event handler and ensure that the keyword resolves prop- erly. We still haven’t done anything remotely close to actually adding a task, so let’s start by  first defining our state object in the constructor:  constructor props  {   super props ;    this.state = {     items: []   };     this.addItem = this.addItem.bind this ; }  Our state object isn’t very complicated. We’re just defining an items array property that  will be responsible for storing the various items that you can enter. All that’s left to do now is  read the entered value from our input element and store it in our items array when the user  submits it. The only complication here is actually reading the value from a DOM element. As  you know, React puts up a gate between us and the DOM. It doesn’t like to have us accessing  DOM elements and fiddling with properties on them, but it does give us a loophole via refs  that we can use.  In our render function, make the following highlighted change:  render   {   return                                       this._inputElement = a}                  placeholder="enter task">                        add                             ; }  Here we’re storing a reference to our input element in the appropriately named _inputElement  property. To state this differently, anywhere inside this component where we want to access  our input element, we can do so by accessing _inputElement. Now it’s time to fill out our  addItem function with the following content:  addItem e  {   var itemArray = this.state.items;     if  this._inputElement.value !== ""  {     itemArray.unshift {   Building the Rest of the App  185        text: this._inputElement.value,       key: Date.now       } ;       this.setState {       items: itemArray     } ;       this._inputElement.value = "";   }     console.log itemArray ;     e.preventDefault  ; }  itemArray.unshift {   text: this._inputElement.value,   key: Date.now   } ;  Take a moment to look through what we’re doing. We create a variable called itemArray to  store the current value of our items state object. Next, we check to see if our input element  has any content inside it. If it’s empty, we don’t do anything. If our input element has some  text entered, we add that text to our itemArray:  We aren’t just adding the entered text. We’re actually adding an object that contains both the  entered text and a unique key value that’s set by the current time  Date.now   . If you aren’t  clear on why we’re specifying the key, that’s okay. You’ll totally see why in a few moments.  The rest of our code is pretty boring. We’re setting our state’s items property to the value of  itemArray. We’re clearing the value of our input element to make room for the next todo  item. This line here might be less boring:  e.preventDefault  ;  We’re overriding this event’s default behavior. The reason has to do with how form submission  works. By default, when you submit a form, the page reloads and clears everything out. We  definitely don’t want that. By calling preventDefault, we block the default behavior. That’s a  good thing!  It’s time to take stock of where we are right now. If you preview your app and check the  browser console, you’ll see our state object correctly populating with each new todo item we  added  see Figure 15.4 .   186  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React  Figure 15.4  We can now see the entries being stored. I realize that this might not seem like  much, but we’re making great progress—seriously!  Note For an alternate approach for setting new state inside the add. This method without modifying  the existing state, check out this version: http:  bit.ly setStateConcat.  Displaying the Items Having our todo items show up only in the console might be exciting for some of your users,  but I’m pretty certain that most probably want to see these items displayed directly on the  page. To do this, we’re going to rely on another component. To get started, let’s call this  component TodoItems, specify it in our TodoList component’s render method, and pass in  our items array as a prop.  All of that translated into markup and code looks as follows:  render   {   return                             Displaying the Items  187  After you’ve done this, add the import statement to the top of the document as well:  These two changes wrap up the work we want to do in TodoList.js for now. Next, let’s go  ahead and actually create our TodoItems component. In the src directory, create a new file  called TodoItems.js and add the following content into it:              this._inputElement = a}                  placeholder="enter task">                        add                                     ; }  import React, { Component } from "react"; import TodoItems from ". TodoItems";   class TodoList extends Component {   .   .   .  import React, { Component } from "react";   class TodoItems extends Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.createTasks = this.createTasks.bind this ;   }     createTasks item  {     return  {item.text}    }     render   {     var todoEntries = this.props.entries;     var listItems = todoEntries.map this.createTasks ;       return                   {listItems}              ;   } };   export default TodoItems;  This might look like a lot of code to add in one giant swoop, but take a moment to look  at what exactly you’re adding. In our render function, we’re taking the list of todo items    188  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React   passed in as entries  and turning them into JSX HTML-ish elements. We do that by calling map  on our items and relying on the createTasks function:  createTasks item  {   return  {item.text}  }  The value stored by our listItems variable is an array of li elements that contain the appropri- ate content to print. Notice that we’re setting the key attribute—whose value, as you recall, we set  earlier using Date.now  —on each element, to make it easier for React to keep track of the elements.  We turn this list of elements into something we can show onscreen with the following:  return           {listItems}      ;  After you’ve made this change, save all the changes and preview the app in its current state   npm start if it isn’t already running . If everything worked properly, not only will you be able  to add items, but you also will be able to see them  see Figure 15.5 .  Figure 15.5  Our entries are now showing up!   Displaying the Items  189  If what you see looks similar to the figure, that’s awesome! To celebrate, let’s take a little break  from looking at JS and JSX.  Styling our App Right now, our app’s awesome functionality isn’t reflected in how the app currently looks.  We’re going to fix this easily by adding one stylesheet and putting all the relevant style rules  into it. In the src folder, create a new stylesheet called TodoList.css and add the following  style rules into it:  .todoListMain .header input {   padding: 10px;   font-size: 16px;   border: 2px solid FFF;   width: 165px; } .todoListMain .header button {   padding: 10px;   font-size: 16px;   margin: 10px;   margin-right: 0px;   background-color: 0066FF;   color: FFF;   border: 2px solid 0066FF; } .todoListMain .header button:hover {   background-color: 003399;   border: 2px solid 003399;   cursor: pointer; } .todoListMain .theList {   list-style: none;   padding-left: 0;   width: 250px; } .todoListMain .theList li {   color: 333;   background-color: rgba 255,255,255,.5 ;   padding: 15px;   margin-bottom: 15px;   border-radius: 5px; }  After you’ve created this stylesheet, you need to reference it. In TodoList.js, add a reference  to this stylesheet at the top:  import React, { Component } from "react";   190  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React  import TodoItems from ". TodoItems"; import ". TodoList.css";   class TodoList extends Component {   .   .   .  If you preview your app after this change, it will look as shown in Figure 15.6.  Figure 15.6  Our app is starting to look much nicer.  As you can see, our app looks much nicer. All we did is add some CSS, so from a functionality  point of view, nothing has changed. We’ll make more progress on functionality next.   Displaying the Items  191  Removing Items At this point, we can add items and see them appear. What we can’t do is remove items after  they’ve been added. We’re going to allow users to remove items by clicking on them directly.  This seems straightforward to implement, right? The only thing to watch out for involves  where to put all our code. The items we click on are defined in TodoItems.js. The actual logic  for populating the items lives in our state object in TodoList.js. To give you a preview of  what to expect, we will be partaking in some shenanigans as we pass things between both of  those components.  First we need to set up the event handler for dealing with the click event. Change the return  statement under createTasks to look as follows:  createTasks item  {   return   this.delete item.key }              key={item.key}>{item.text}  }  We’re simply listening to the click event and associating it with an event handler called  delete. What might be new is our approach for passing arguments to the event handler.  Because of how event arguments and event handlers deal with scope, we work around all those  issues using an arrow function that allows us both to maintain the default event argument  and pass in our own arguments. If this seems bizarre, you can feel better knowing that this is a  JavaScript quirk and has nothing to do with React.  After you’ve made this change, you need to define the delete event handler. Make the follow- ing highlighted changes:  class TodoItems extends Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.createTasks = this.createTasks.bind this ;   }     delete key  {     this.props.delete key ;   }     .     .     .  Here we define a function called delete that takes our argument for the item key. To ensure  that this resolves properly, we explicitly bind this in the constructor. Notice that our delete  function doesn’t actually do any deleting. It just calls another delete function passed into this  component via props. We’ll work backward from here and deal with that next.   192  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React  In TodoList.js, take a look at our render function. When calling TodoItems, let’s specify a  prop called delete and set it to the value of a function called deleteItem:  render   {   return                                       this._inputElement = a}                  placeholder="enter task">                        add                          <TodoItems entries={this.state.items}                  delete={this.deleteItem} >          ; }  This change ensures that our TodoItems component now has knowledge of a prop called delete.  This also means that our delete function we added in TodoList actually connects. All that  remains is actually defining our deleteItem function so that it can deal with deleting an item.  First, go ahead and add the deleteItem function to your TodoList component:  deleteItem key  {   var filteredItems = this.state.items.filter function item  {     return  item.key !== key ;   } ;     this.setState {     items: filteredItems   } ; }  You can add it anywhere, but my preference is to put it just below where our addItem function  lives. Take a look at what this code does. We are passing the key from our clicked item all the  way here, and we check this key against all the items we’re storing currently via the filter  method:  var filteredItems = this.state.items.filter function item  {   return  item.key !== key ; } ;   Displaying the Items  193  The result of running this code is simple. We create a new array called filteredItems that  contains everything except the item we are removing. This filtered array is then set as our new  items property on our state object:  this.setState {   items: filteredItems } ;  Our UI then updates and the removed item disappears forever. The last thing we need to  do is deal with the usual shenanigans surrounding this. Make the following change in the  constructor:  This ensures that all references to this inside deleteItem will reference the correct thing.  Now we have just one more thing to do before we can declare victory in deleting items. Open  TodoList.css and make the following highlighted change and style rule addition:  constructor props  {   super props ;     this.state = {     items: []   };     this.addItem = this.addItem.bind this ;   this.deleteItem = this.deleteItem.bind this ; }  .todoListMain .theList li {   color: 333;   background-color: rgba 255,255,255,.5 ;   padding: 15px;   margin-bottom: 15px;   border-radius: 5px;     transition: background-color .2s ease-out; }   .todoListMain .theList li:hover {   background-color: pink;   cursor: pointer; }  This provides the hover effect when you move the mouse cursor over the item that you want  to remove. With this change done, our functionality to remove an item should be complete.  Preview your app now and try adding some items and removing them. It should work well.  And now on to just one more thing….   194  Chapter 15  Building an Awesome Todo List App in React  Animation! Animation! Animation! Our very last task is to add some animations, to make adding and removing items look more  natural. React offers many ways to animate something. You can use traditional approaches such  as CSS animations, CSS transitions, requestAnimationFrame, the Web Animations API,  or  even a popular animation library. All of these approaches will take you far…very far.  When it comes to animating the existence of an element, though, the traditional approaches  we outlined run into some limitations. This is because React entirely handles the lifecycle of an  element as it is about to be deleted from the DOM. We can definitely override some of the life- cycle methods to intercept an element deletion and interject our own animation logic, but that  gets us a bit too far into the weeds. We don’t want to deal with that right now.  Fortunately, the React community has come up with a handful of lightweight animation librar- ies that make animating adding and deleting elements really easy. One such library is Flip  Move. Among many things, this library makes animating the addition and removal of list  elements simple.  To use this library, we need to first add it to our project. From the command line, make sure  you are still in the same location as our todolist project and run the following command:  npm i -S react-flip-move  Click Enter Return to copy all the necessary things locally into our project’s node_modules  folder. That’s all the setup required. After you’ve done this, in TodoItems.js, add the follow- ing import statement at the top:  import FlipMove from 'react-flip-move';  Now all that’s left is to tell our FlipMove component to animate our list of items. In our  render function, make the following highlighted change:  render   {   var todoEntries = this.props.entries;   var listItems = todoEntries.map this.createTasks ;     return                         {listItems}                  ; }  We’re simply wrapping our listItems  just before getting them printed  inside a FlipMove  component and specifying the animation duration and the type of easing function to use.  That’s it. If you preview your app now, you’ll see that adding and removing items doesn’t just  suddenly happen; these items are smoothly animated instead.   Conclusion  195  Uncontrolled Components vs. Controlled Components Form elements are interesting. These are elements that contain some state on their own. For  example, your text element might have some content in it, or you might have some items  already selected in a drop-down list. React is all about centralizing state into its own little  world, so it doesn’t like that form elements have their own internal mechanism for storing  state. The guidance is to synchronize all the form data inside a React component by using  events such as onChange. These components that let React deal with form elements are  known as controlled components. Still, it’s a hassle to have every form element deal with keeping state in sync. The React devel- opers get that as well. The workaround is to do nothing. We simply let form elements deal  with their own state and use refs to access the values when needed. That’s what we did in  this example. When we have components that defer all state management to the form DOM   element, these components are known as uncontrolled components.        Conclusion Our Todo app is pretty simple in what it does, but by building it from scratch, we covered  almost every little interesting detail React brings to the table. More important, we created an  example that shows how the various concepts we learned individually play together. That’s  truly actually the important detail.   Now here’s a quick question for you: Does everything we’ve done in this chapter make sense? If  so, you’re in good shape to tell your friends and family that you’re close to mastering React. If  you still find some areas confusing, I recommend that you go back and reread the chapters that  address your shortcomings.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask!

This page intentionally left blank    16 Creating a Sliding  Menu in React  Sliding menus are all the rage in UIs today. All the cool kids are building them, and your  friends probably just can’t get enough of them. These menus are basically off-screen elements  that slide into view when you click or tap on something. That something could be an arrow, a  hamburger icon, or something else that indicates a menu will appear.  To see a sliding menu in action, go here: https:  www.kirupa.com react examples  slidingmenu_css index.html.  You’ll see a yellow menu with some navigation links smoothly slide in. If you click a naviga- tion link or anywhere in the yellow region inside that menu, the menu slides back  really  smoothly again, of course  and the content behind it reappears. Let’s look at how to create all  of this using React.  Note: For a Non-React Solution If you’re looking to create this menu using plain JavaScript without any React wizardry, the  tutorial Creating a Smooth Sliding Menu  http:  bit.ly plainSidingMenu  has you covered.        How the Sliding Menu Works Before we jump into the code, let’s take a few moments to better understand how exactly our  sliding menu works. Starting at the very top, we have our page that displays some content:   198  Chapter 16  Creating a Sliding Menu in React   When you decide to bring up the menu  by clicking tapping the blue circle in our example ,  the menu magically slides into view:   How the Sliding Menu Works  199  The way this sliding menu works isn’t as crazy as it seems. The menu is never truly nonexistent;  it is simply hidden outside the view. To see what that looks like, check out the following diagram:  Just to the left of the content what we see is our menu, patiently hiding until it is called upon.  We do that by shifting the menu as far left as we can until it’s fully out of view. Figuring out  how far to shift is easy. Our menu’s size is the same as our browser’s window  a.k.a. the view- port  size because we want the menu to fully cover up whatever is shown. Given that detail, we  just shift the menu left by the browser’s width. One way of doing that might be by using some  CSS that looks as follows:  theMenu {   position: fixed;   left: 0;   top: 0;   transform: translate3d -100vw, 0, 0 ;     width: 100vw;   height: 100vh; }   200  Chapter 16  Creating a Sliding Menu in React   We set our menu’s position to fixed. This single change gives our menu a whole lot of magical  capabilities. For starters, it ensures that normal layout rules no longer apply to it. We can posi- tion our menu anywhere we want using normal x and y values, and the menu won’t shift away  from where we have it positioned. If that isn’t awesome enough, our menu won’t even display  a scrollbar if we happen to hide it somewhere offscreen.  All this is a good thing because we hide our menu offscreen by setting our menu’s left and  top properties to 0 and setting our menu’s transform property to a translate3d method with  a horizontal value of -100vw. The negative value ensures that we shift the menu left by the  amount equivalent to our browser window’s width. While not directly related to position, the  size of our menu plays an important role as well. That’s why, in this CSS snippet, we have the  width and height properties set with values of 100vw and 100vh, respectively, to ensure that  our menu’s size is the same as our browser window’s size.  What Are These vw and vh Units? If you’ve never seen the vw and vh units, they stand for viewport width  vw  and viewport  height  vh . They’re a bit similar to percentage values. Each unit is 1 100th the width or height  of your viewport  what we’ve been simply calling the browser window . For example, a value of  100vw means that its value is the full width of our browser window. Similarly, 100vh refers to a  value that is the full height of our browser window.     When the menu is called upon to slide into view, we slide the menu right until its horizontal  position is the same as our browser window origin. If we had to look at what the CSS for it  might look like, this would be an easy change from what we already have. We simply set our  transform property’s translate3d method and set the horizontal position to a value of 0vw.  That might look something like this:  transform: translate3d 0vw, 0, 0 ;  This change ensures that our menu is shifted right from being hidden offscreen  with a hori- zontal translate value of -100vw  and is now visible. When our menu needs to disappear,  we can translate it back:  transform: translate3d -100vw, 0, 0 ;  The biggest thing we haven’t spoken about is the animation that makes the sliding look cool.  This is done using a simple CSS transition that animates the transform property:  transition: transform .3s cubic-bezier 0, .52, 0, 1 ;  If you’re not familiar with CSS transitions, it’s a very simple concept to wrap your brain  around. I don’t explain it here, so take a few moments and read through the short Introduction  to CSS Transitions article  https:  www.kirupa.com html5 introduction_css_transitions.htm  for  an overview.   Setting Up the Sliding Menu  201  So far, we’ve taken a bird’s-eye view of how our sliding menu works. A few details need to be  looked at, but we’ll do that in the next couple sections when we actually build this menu.  Setting Up the Sliding Menu Now that you have a basic idea about how a sliding menu works, let’s turn all that theoreti- cal knowledge into some sweet JSX and code. The first thing we’re going to do is look at our  example in terms of the individual components that will make it up.  At the very top, we have our MenuContainer component:  This component is responsible for doing nonvisual things like managing state, hosting our  Menu and MenuButton components, and displaying some of the initial text. The bird’s-eye view  looks a bit like this:   202  Chapter 16  Creating a Sliding Menu in React   In the next few sections, we’ll start creating these components and getting the example up and  running.  Getting Started Use create-react-app to create a new project called slidingmenu. If you aren’t familiar with  how to do that, check out Chapter 13, “Setting Up Your React Dev Environment Easily,” to  walk through the details of creating and working with React projects. After you’ve created your  project, you want to start from a blank slate. Delete everything in your public and src folders.  You’ll re-create the necessary pieces shortly.  Let’s start by creating our HTML document. In your public folder, create a file called index. html. Inside it, add the following contents:             Sliding Menu in React        Getting Started  203                This HTML page is simply the destination where all of our React components will eventually  render their output.  Next, you want to create a file called index.js in the src folder that will be responsible for  teeing things up in the code. Add the following content into this file:  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import ". index.css"; import MenuContainer from ". MenuContainer";   ReactDOM.render     ,   document.querySelector "container"   ;  The render call here is responsible for displaying the output of our MenuContainer compo- nent into the container div element we specified in HTML a few moments ago. In our  import statements, besides pulling in the react and react-dom libraries, we are referencing  index.css and our MenuContainer component. That’s all there is to our index.js file.  Next we’re going to create the index.css file in our src folder and get the page’s basic styling  defined. In this file, add the following two style rules:  body {   background-color: EEE;   font-family: sans-serif;   font-size: 20px;   padding: 25px;   margin: 0;   overflow: auto; }   container li {   margin-bottom: 10px; }  There isn’t much to say about these style rules, so the last thing we do to get our initial app set  up is create our MenuContainer component. Create a file called MenuContainer.js in the src  folder and add the following JS and JSX into it:  import React, { Component } from "react";   class MenuContainer extends Component {   render   {     return     204  Chapter 16  Creating a Sliding Menu in React                                Can you spot the item that doesn't belong?                           Lorem               Ipsum               Dolor               Sit               Bumblebees               Aenean               Consectetur                                     ;   } }   export default MenuContainer;  Be sure to save the changes you made to all of your files, and test your app  using npm start   to ensure that your initial setup of the app works fine. If everything worked out properly, your  default browser will launch and you’ll see something that looks as follows:  There’s no menu to slide or button to press; we’ll add both of those in the next couple sections.   Showing and Hiding the Menu  205  Showing and Hiding the Menu With the initial setup out of the way, it’s time for the fun part: actually building the menu. Our  menu is shown or hidden as follows:  1.  When you click a button, the menu slides into view.  2.  When you click anywhere on the menu, the menu slides out of view.  This means that we need to account for a few things going on. We need to maintain some state  to keep track of whether the menu is hidden or shown. This state needs to be something we  update from both the button and the menu because clicking on either will toggle whether the  menu is visible. We need our state to live in a common location that both the menu and the  button can access. That common location will be inside our MenuContainer component, so  let’s add the code relating to our state logic.  In the MenuContainer.js file, add the constructor and toggleMenu methods just above our  render method:  constructor props  {   super props ;     this.state = {     visible: false   };     this.toggleMenu = this.toggleMenu.bind this ; }   toggleMenu   {   this.setState {     visible: !this.state.visible   } ; }  import React, { Component } from "react";   class MenuContainer extends Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;       this.state = {       visible: false     };    The code you’ve just added should look like a walk in the park by now. You’re storing a variable  called visible in your state object, and you’re creating a method called toggleMenu that will  be responsible for toggling whether visible is true or false.  Next up is dealing with the click events on the button and menu. If the goal is to update our  state from inside our MenuContainer component, we need to place our event handler inside  MenuContainer as well. Go ahead and add the following highlighted lines:   206  Chapter 16  Creating a Sliding Menu in React       this.handleMouseDown = this.handleMouseDown.bind this ;     this.toggleMenu = this.toggleMenu.bind this ;   }     handleMouseDown e  {     this.toggleMenu  ;      console.log "clicked" ;     e.stopPropagation  ;   }     toggleMenu   {     this.setState {       visible: !this.state.visible     } ;   }   .   .   . }  When the handleMouseDown method is called, we call toggleMenu, which toggles whether the  menu appears. At this point, you’re probably wondering where the actual code for dealing with  a click event is. What exactly will trigger a call to handleMouseDown? The answer is, nothing  so far! We’ve done things in a bit of a reverse order and defined our event handler first. We  handle the association between our event handler and our click event in a few moments  when dealing with our button and menu components.  Creating the Button In your src folder, create two files called MenuButton.js and MenuButton.css. Then open  MenuButton.js in your code editor. Inside it, add the following lines of code:  import React, { Component } from "react"; import '. MenuButton.css';   class MenuButton extends Component {   render   {     return         <button id="roundButton"               onMouseDown={this.props.handleMouseDown}>       ;   } }   export default MenuButton;  Take a moment to see what this code is doing. There isn’t a whole lot going on. We define a  button element called roundButton, and we associate the onMouseDown event with a prop we    Showing and Hiding the Menu  207  are referencing as handleMouseDown. Before moving on, open MenuButton.css and add the  following style rules:  roundButton {   background-color: 96D9FF;   margin-bottom: 20px;   width: 50px;   height: 50px;   border-radius: 50%;   border: 10px solid 0065A6;   outline: none;   transition: all .2s cubic-bezier 0, 1.26, .8, 1.28 ; }   roundButton:hover {   background-color: 96D9FF;   cursor: pointer;   border-color: 003557;   transform: scale 1.2, 1.2 ; }   roundButton:active {   border-color: 003557;   background-color: FFF; }  render   {   return             .     .     .    ; }  Now it’s is time to actually instantiate our newly created MenuButton component. Go back to the  MenuContainer component and add the following highlighted line inside the render method:  For this line to actually do something, be sure to add the appropriate import statement at the  top for our MenuButton.js file. That’s an easy one to overlook!  Notice that we are passing in a prop called handleMouseDown, and its value is the handle- MouseDown event handler that we defined earlier. This ensures that when you click the  button inside the MenuButton component, the handleMouseDown method that lives in the  MenuContainer component gets called. All of this is great, but our button isn’t very useful  without a menu to help slide into view. We’ll fix that next.  Creating the Menu It’s time to create our Menu component that will be responsible for all things dealing with the  menu. Before we actually create this component, let’s pretend that it already exists and call it    208  Chapter 16  Creating a Sliding Menu in React   from our render method inside our MenuContainer. Add the following highlighted call to our   currently imaginary  Menu component just below where you added the call to MenuButton a  few short moments earlier:  render   {   return             <Menu handleMouseDown={this.handleMouseDown}           menuVisibility={this.state.visible}  >     .     .     .    ; }  Add the import statement for Menu.js as well. Getting back to the Menu component, look at  the props you’re passing in. The first prop should look familiar to you. It is handleMouseDown  and its value is our handleMouseDown event-handling method. The second prop is called  menuVisibility. Its value is the current value of our visible state property. Now let’s go ahead  and actually create our Menu component and see, among other things, how these props get used.  In the same src folder we have been partying in for the past few sections, add one file called  Menu.js and another file called Menu.css. Inside Menu.js, add the following contents:  import React, { Component } from "react"; import ". Menu.css";   class Menu extends Component {   render   {     var visibility = "hide";       if  this.props.menuVisibility  {       visibility = "show";     }       return         <div id="flyoutMenu"            onMouseDown={this.props.handleMouseDown}            className={visibility}>           Home             About             Contact             Search                ;   } }   export default Menu;   Showing and Hiding the Menu  209  Pay attention to the JSX in the return statement. We have a div element called flyoutMenu  with some sample content. In our div element, we call our handleMouseDown event-handling  method  passed in via a prop  when the onMouseDown event is overheard. Next, we set a class  value on this element; the value is the result of evaluating a variable called visibility. As you  might recall, class is a reserved name in JavaScript and you can’t use it directly in our JSX; it  has to be specified as className.  Getting back to our code, the value of visibility is set a few lines earlier:  The value is either hide or show, depending on whether the menuVisibility prop  whose  value is specified by our visible state property  is true or false. While it might not look like  it, the code revolving around className plays a really important role in determining whether  your menu is actually visible. When we look at our CSS, you’ll see why. Now open Menu.css  and add the following style rules into it:  var visibility = "hide";   if  this.props.menuVisibility  {   visibility = "show"; }  flyoutMenu {   width: 100vw;   height: 100vh;   background-color: FFE600;   position: fixed;   top: 0;   left: 0;   transition: transform .3s               cubic-bezier 0, .52, 0, 1 ;   overflow: scroll;   z-index: 1000; }   flyoutMenu.hide {   transform: translate3d -100vw, 0, 0 ; }   flyoutMenu.show {   transform: translate3d 0vw, 0, 0 ;   overflow: hidden; }   flyoutMenu h2 a {   color: 333;   margin-left: 15px;   text-decoration: none; }     210  Chapter 16  Creating a Sliding Menu in React   flyoutMenu h2 a:hover {   text-decoration: underline; }  The CSS you see here mostly deals with how our menu itself looks, but the actual showing and  hiding of the menu is handled by the flyoutMenu.hide and flyoutMenu.show style rules.  Which of these style rules becomes active depends entirely on the code we looked at earlier. In  our flyoutMenu div element, remember that the class value on the generated HTML  which  our CSS maps to  will be either hide or show, depending on what value we set for className.  Pretty cool, right?  At this point, we’re fully done with all our coding. Be sure to save all your changes and ensure  that the app works just like the example we started with. Don’t nuke this project, though. We’ll  be revisiting this and addressing some major shortcomings in a little bit.  Conclusion This is one of the first examples we’ve looked at in which we’re using React to create a  common UI occurrence, a sliding menu. As part of this, you learned more about the interplay  between components, such as dealing with events event handlers, sharing state, and so on. As  we look at more examples together, you’ll see that there isn’t a whole lot more to React than  what you’ve seen here. All that remains is a clever arrangement and rearrangement of the same  concepts in more complex scenarios. This doesn’t mean we’re done, though. There’s more React  to be had and more examples to create and fully understand!  Note: If you run into any issues, ask!

That doesn’t mean you get all that great performance for free, though.  While React handles a lot of the heavy lifting, you should consciously take certain steps to  ensure that your app isn’t doing unnecessary work and slowing things down. One of the  biggest steps involves making sure each component’s render method is called only when it  absolutely has to be. In the next few sections, we’ll look at why that’s a problem and what you  can do about it.  About the render Method The render method’s official job description is pretty simple. It just needs to show up on each  component and help generate the JSX to return to whatever parent component called it. If we  had to loosely describe the full workflow from components on one end and a fully finished app  on the other end, it would look as follows:   212  Chapter 17  Avoiding Unnecessary Renders in React  You have your finished app on one side. You have the components that make up the app on  the other. Inside all these components, you see render methods returning bits and chunks of  JSX getting combined with more bits and chunks of JSX from other components. This process  repeats until you get the final JSX at the root of the component hierarchy where we have our  ReactDOM.render call. From there, the React Magic happens that turns all this JSX into the  appropriate HTML CSS JS to display in the browser.  Now that you have a very basic idea of how React works, let’s get back into the weeds where  our components and their render methods live. In all the React code you’ve written so far,  you might also have noticed that you never had to explicitly call the render method on any    Optimizing render Calls  213  component. That just sort of happened automatically. Let’s get more precise here. Three things  cause a render method to automatically get called:  1.  A prop that lives on your component gets updated.  2.  A state property that lives on your component gets updated.  3.  A parent component’s render method gets called.  All three of these cases seem like good examples of when we want our component’s render  method to be automatically called. After all, all three of these cases could cause your visual state  to change, right?  The answer is, well, it depends! Very often, components find themselves being forced to  re-render even though the prop or state that is changing has absolutely nothing to do with  them. In some situations, a parent component is correctly rendering or re-rendering, but that is  localized to just that component. There’s no need to ask the child components to re-render for  something that doesn’t affect them.  Now, I might be painting an alarming picture of unnecessary work that has been going on right  under our noses. One point to keep in mind is that a render method being called is not the  same thing as the DOM ultimately getting updated. React takes a few additional steps in which  the DOM is diffed  that is, the previous version is compared with the new current version  to  truly see if any changes need to be represented. All of these “few additional steps” means work,  and more complex apps with a lot of components will face many instances that will start to  add up. Some of this is additional work done by React’s internals. Some of it are just important  things we do in our render methods; we often have a lot of code there to help generate the  appropriate JSX. Rarely does our render method return a static piece of JSX with no evaluation  or calculation happening, so minimizing unnecessary render calls is a good thing.  Optimizing render Calls Now that we’ve looked at the problem, let’s examine some approaches we can use to ensure  that we’re calling a component’s render method only when absolutely necessary. The follow- ing sections walk you through this.  Getting an Example Going To help make sense of this, we’re going to look at an example. It’s not just any example, either.  We’ll revisit our sliding menu that we created earlier. If you have it handy, go ahead and open  it in your code editor.  If you don’t have the project handy, that’s okay. Use create-react-app to create a new React  project and overwrite everything in your src and public folders with the contents from the  Sliding Menu Github repo:   214  Chapter 17  Avoiding Unnecessary Renders in React  When  you have the sliding menu project ready, run it in your browser to make sure that every- thing works—or still works.  If you haven’t completed the sliding menu from the previous chapter, I highly encourage you  to do so. Having the working project handy is all fine and good, but knowing how the code  works and understanding some of the choices we made during implementation is important.  You can certainly follow along without understanding that chapter, but don’t say I didn’t warn  you if some of the code you’re about to see seems a bit out of place.  Looking at our example, to reuse a graphic you’ve already seen, the component hierarchy for  our sliding menu app looks as follows:   Optimizing render Calls  215  At the root is MenuContainer, and it has two children: MenuButton and Menu. Although it’s  not shown in the diagram, there’s a ReactDOM.render call in index.js that exposes our  MenuContainer to the DOM:  ReactDOM.render     ,   document.getElementById "container"   ;  When the button rendered by MenuButton is clicked, we set a Boolean state property  called  visible  in MenuContainer to true. This state property change triggers our Menu compo- nent to update a class value that activates the appropriate CSS to slide our menu in. Clicking  anywhere in the menu dismisses the menu by undoing what was done via setting the state  property in MenuContainer to false.   216  Chapter 17  Avoiding Unnecessary Renders in React  Seeing the render Calls The first thing we want to do is see the render calls being made. You can do this in many ways.  You can set a break point in your code and inspect the results using your browser’s developer  tools. You can install the React Developer Tools add-on  for Chrome or Firefox  from https:   github.com facebook react-devtools and inspect each component. You can also take a very simple  approach and insert console.log statements inside the render methods you’re interested in.  Because we have only three components in our sliding menu example, the console.log  approach is an easy one that we’ll use for now. In your code editor, open MenuContainer.js,  MenuButton.js, and Menu.js and scroll down to each component’s respective render method.  At the very top of this method, we’re going to add a console.log call.  In MenuContainer.js, add the following highlighted line:  render   {   console.log "Rendering: MenuContainer" ;   return                       <Menu handleMouseDown={this.handleMouseDown}             menuVisibility={this.state.visible} >                  Can you spot the item that doesn&apos;t belong?                         Lorem               Ipsum               Dolor               Sit               Bumblebees               Aenean               Consectetur                             ; }  Let’s do something similar in MenuButton.js:  render   {   console.log "Rendering: MenuButton" ;     return       <button id="roundButton"             onMouseDown={this.props.handleMouseDown}>     ; }  Lastly, add the following highlighted line in Menu.js:  render   {   console.log "Rendering: Menu" ;     Seeing the render Calls  217    var visibility = "hide";     if  this.props.menuVisibility  {     visibility = "show";   }     return       <div id="flyoutMenu"          onMouseDown={this.props.handleMouseDown}          className={visibility}>         Home           About           Contact           Search            ; }  Once you have added these three lines, run your app in your browser. Once the app is up and  running, bring up your browser’s developer tools and take a look at what is printed in the console:   218  Chapter 17  Avoiding Unnecessary Renders in React  You might see warnings and other stuff displayed, but look for the output of the console.log  statements you added. When you first run your app, you’ll see that all three of our components  have their respective render method getting called. This is expected because it’s the first time  your app is being loaded.  With your console still open, go ahead and click the blue button to bring up the menu. Then  take a look at your console. You’ll see the following new items  highlighted in green :  Rendering: MenuContainer  Rendering: MenuButton  Rendering: Menu  clicked  Rendering: MenuContainer  Rendering: MenuButton  Rendering: Menu  When the handleMouseDown event handler gets called, we print the text clicked to the  console. This isn’t important for what we’re doing right now, but it does provide a nice separa- tion between our series of render calls. With that said, notice that displaying our menu results  in all three of our components’ render methods getting called. Click the menu to dismiss it.  You’ll see that all three render methods get called again. That doesn’t seem right, does it?  Because we’re toggling a prop on Menu and our state is stored on MenuContainer, it makes  sense for those two components’ render methods to be called…for now. But, why is our  MenuButton component’s render method getting called every single time?  Looking at MenuContainer’s render call, we are calling our Menu component and passing in a  prop whose value will never change:     The value of our handleMouseDown method doesn’t change each time our menu is opened  or closed. This is because our MenuContainer  a.k.a. the MenuButton’s parent  has its render  method called. If a parent’s render method gets called, all the child components’ render  methods get called as well. If you’re keeping score, this is reason 3 we listed a few sections ago  when talking about what causes a render method to be called automatically.  So what options do we have for stopping our MenuButton component’s render method from  being unnecessarily called? As it turns out, we have two.  Overriding a Component Update A while ago, we looked at the various lifecycle methods React provides. One of them is  shouldComponentUpdate. This method is called just before a render call is made, and you can  block the render method from being called by having the shouldComponentUpdate method  return false. Here we’re going to use the shouldComponentUpdate method to do just that.   Seeing the render Calls  219  Inside the MenuButton component, add the following highlighted lines:  import React, { Component } from "react"; import ". MenuButton.css";   class MenuButton extends Component {   shouldComponentUpdate nextProps, nextState  {     return false;   }     render   {     console.log "Rendering: MenuButton" ;       return         <button id="roundButton"               onMouseDown={this.props.handleMouseDown}>       ;   } }   export default MenuButton;  Refresh your app to test your code. Pay attention to the console and see what gets printed  when you’re showing and hiding a menu. Your output when your page loads and the menu is  displayed for the first time now appears as follows:  Rendering: MenuContainer  Rendering: MenuButton  Rendering: Menu  clicked  Rendering: MenuContainer  Rendering: Menu  Notice that our MenuButton component’s render method isn’t called. That’s great. Before we  celebrate too much, though, we’ve really taken a hammer to our problem by always returning  false when shouldComponentUpdate gets called. While that works for what we are doing,  let’s be a bit more careful to ensure that we aren’t accidentally preventing valid updates in the  future if we eventually modify MenuButton and how it gets used.  When you look at the shouldComponentUpdate method’s signature, you can see that two argu- ments are passed in. One is for the next prop value, and the other is for the next state value.  We can use these arguments to compare the present with the future and act a bit more intel- ligently about whether we allow our render call to be made. In the case of MenuButton, the    220  Chapter 17  Avoiding Unnecessary Renders in React  only prop we’re passing in is for the value of handleMouseDown. We can check to ensure that  this value doesn’t change by modifying the shouldComponentUpdate method, as follows:  shouldComponentUpdate nextProps, nextState  {   if  nextProps.handleMouseDown === this.props.handleMouseDown  {     return false;   } else {     return true;   } }  This code ensures that we don’t unnecessarily call render if the value of handleMouseDown  stays the same. If the value of handleMouseDown changed, we could properly return a value  of true to allow the render call to be made. You can use other criteria to specify whether  the component’s render method should get called, and what you do depends entirely on the  component in question. Feel free to get creative, if you need to.  Using PureComponent It’s a common occurrence to have components forced to re-render despite not having relevant  prop or state changes. Our MenuButton example is just one such occurrence. The solution is to  call shouldComponentUpdate and check whether any prop or state changes have taken place.  To avoid having to make this check all the time, a special kind of component can handle this  checking automatically for you. That component is PureComponent.  Until now, all of our components have been based on Component:  class Blah extends Component {   render   {     return          Hello!       ;   } }  class Blah extends PureComponent {   render   {     return          Hello!       ;   } }  To base our components off PureComponent, all you have to do is this:  That’s pretty much it. Your component will now be extra careful about calling render only  when it determines that a change to either the prop or state has actually been made. To see this  for yourself, you can change MenuButton to be a PureComponent instead of just a Component.   Seeing the render Calls  221  In MenuButton.js, first delete the shouldComponentUpdate method; you don’t need it  anymore. Then make the following two highlighted changes:  import React, { PureComponent } from "react"; import ". MenuButton.css";  class MenuButton extends PureComponent {   render   {     console.log "Rendering: MenuButton" ;       return         <button id="roundButton"               onMouseDown={this.props.handleMouseDown}>       ;   } }   export default MenuButton;  We first import the necessary code from the React library to make PureComponent work. Next,  we extend our MenuButton from PureComponent. That’s it. If you test your app now and  inspect the console after displaying the menu, you’ll see that our MenuButton component’s  render method doesn’t get called when your menu decides to show up  or disappear .   Why Not Always Use PureComponent? The PureComponent seems pretty awesome, right? Why don’t we just use it always and ditch  Component altogether? We probably should! With that said, there are a few reasons you might  want to stick with Component. First, PureComponent performs what’s known as a shallow comparison. It isn’t a comprehensive  check of everything that might have changed in your props or state between calls to re-render.  For many cases, that’s okay. For other cases, that might not be. Keep that in mind when using  PureComponent. You might find that you need to write your own shouldComponentUpdate  and handle the updating logic manually. You can’t use PureComponent and specify should- ComponentUpdate at the same time, although that makes a nice try! Beyond the comparison logic, the bigger problem with using PureComponent is performance.  Having each of your components check to see if props or state have changed, even if it’s a  shallow check, takes up computation time. Remember, these checks happen every time your  component decides to re-render or is asked to re-render by a parent. For complex UIs, that  could happen frequently without you even realizing it. TL;DR: This should probably have been mentioned at the top of this note, but what are you  going to do? Basically, it’s fine to use PureComponent instead of Component. Just be aware  of the two  minor  side effects.      222  Chapter 17  Avoiding Unnecessary Renders in React  Conclusion Ensuring that your app is performant requires constant vigilance. Profile your app’s perfor- mance frequently, and definitely do so each time you make a code change with the goal of  optimizing performance. Each performance optimization you make brings complexity that just  adds to your  or your team’s  overhead of maintaining the code and making fixes in it for the  lifetime of your app. Be conscious and don’t overoptimize. If your app works really well on the  devices and browsers you’re targeting  especially the low-end ones , consider your job done.  Take a break and don’t do any extra work!

Here we’re going to use React to build a simple single-page app  also  referred to as SPA by the cool kids and people living in Scandinavia . As we talked about in  our React introduction forever ago, single-page apps are different from the more traditional  multipage apps that you see everywhere. The biggest difference is that navigating a single-page  app doesn’t involve going to an entirely new page. Instead, your pages  commonly known  as views in this context  typically load inline within the same page itself:   224  Chapter 18  Creating a Single-Page App in React Using React Router  When you’re loading content inline, things get a little challenging. The hard part isn’t loading  the content itself. That’s relatively easy. The hard part is making sure that single-page apps  behave in a way that is consistent with what your users are accustomed to. More specifically,  when users navigate your app, they have some expectations:  1.  The URL displayed in the address bar should always reflect the thing users are viewing.  2.  Users expect to be able to use the browser’s back and forward buttons successfully.  3.  Users should be able to navigate to a particular view  a.k.a. deep link  directly using the   appropriate URL.  With multipage apps, these three things come for free. You don’t have to do anything extra for  any of it. With single-page apps, because you aren’t navigating to an entirely new page, you  have to do real work to deal with these three things that your users expect to just work. You need  to ensure that navigating within your app adjusts the URL appropriately. You need to ensure  that your browser’s history is properly synchronized with each navigation to allow users to use  the back and forward buttons. If users bookmark a particular view or copy paste a URL to access  later, you need to ensure that your single-page app takes them to the correct place.  To deal with all of this, you have a bucket full of techniques commonly known as routing.  With routing, you try to map URLs to destinations that aren’t physical pages, such as the  individual views in your single-page app. That sounds complicated, but fortunately, a bunch  of JavaScript libraries can help with this. One such JavaScript library is the star of this  tutorial, React Router https:  github.com reactjs react-router . React Router provides routing  capabilities to single-page apps built in React. What makes it nice is that it extends what you  already know about React in familiar ways to give you all of this routing awesomeness. In this  tutorial, you’ll learn all about how it does that…and hopefully more.  Onward!  The Example Before we go further, take a look at the following example in your browser: https:  www.kirupa .com react examples react_router index.html.  Here, you have a simple React app that uses React Router to provide all the navigation and  view-loading goodness:   Getting Started  225  Click the various links to load the relevant content, and feel free to open this page in its own  browser window  https:  www.kirupa.com react examples react_router index.html  to use the  back and forward buttons and see them working.  In the following sections, we’re going to be building this app in pieces. By the end, not only  will you have re-created this app, but hopefully you’ll have learned enough about React Router  to build cooler and even more awesome things.  Getting Started First we need to get our project set up. We’ll use our trusty create-react-app command to  do this. From your favorite terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to create your app  and type the following:  create-react-app react_spa   226  Chapter 18  Creating a Single-Page App in React Using React Router  This creates our new project inside a folder called react_spa. Go ahead and navigate into this  folder:  cd react_spa  Normally, this is where we start messing around with deleting the existing content to start from  a blank slate. We’ll do that, but first, we’re going to install React Router. To do that, run the  following command:  npm i react-router-dom --save  This copies the appropriate React Router files and registers it in our package.json so that our  app is aware of its existence. That’s good stuff, right?  It’s time to clean up the project to start from a clean slate. From inside your react_spa folder,  delete everything inside your public and src folders. Now, let’s create the index.html file  that will serve as our app’s starting point. In your public folder, create a file called index.html  and add the following contents into it:                <meta name="viewport"         content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">    React Router Example                    Take a quick glance at the HTML. You shouldn’t see anything surprising here. Next, we’ll create  our JavaScript entry point. Inside the src folder, create a file called index.js and add the  following contents into it:  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import Main from ". Main";   ReactDOM.render     ,   document.getElementById "root"   ;  Our ReactDOM.render call lives here, and we’re rendering our Main component…which  doesn’t exist yet. The Main component will be the starting point for our SPA expedition using  React Router, and you’ll see how beginning with the next section.   Building Our Single-Page App  227  Building Our Single-Page App The way we build our app is no different than the way we’ve been building all the apps so far.  We’ll have a main parent component. Each individual “page” of our app will be a separate  component that feeds into the main component. The magic React Router brings to the table  is basically choosing which components to show and which to hide. To make this feel natural  and seamless, all of this navigating is tied in with our browser’s address bar and back forward  buttons.  Displaying the Initial Frame When building an SPA, a part of your page will always remain static. This static part, also  referred to as an app frame, could be one invisible HTML element that acts as the container for  all of your content, or it could include some additional visual things such as a header, a footer,  or navigation. In our case, our app frame will be a component that contains UI elements for  our navigation header and an empty area for content to load in.  Inside our src folder, create a new file called Main.js and add the following content into it:  import React, { Component } from "react";   class Main extends Component {   render   {     return                    Simple SPA                        Home               Stuff               Contact                                                ;   } }   export default Main;  Take a look at what we have here. We have a component called Main that returns some  HTML. That’s it. To see what we have so far in action, type npm start and see what’s going  on in your browser.   228  Chapter 18  Creating a Single-Page App in React Using React Router  You should see an unstyled version of an app title and some list items:  This doesn’t look all fancy and styled, but that’s okay for now; we’ll deal with that later. The  important thing to call out is that there’s nothing React Router specific here—absolutely nothing!  Creating Our Content Pages Our app will have three pages of content. This content will be just a simple component that  prints out some JSX. Let’s get that created and out of the way. First, create a file called Home.js  in the src directory and add the following content:  import React, { Component } from "react";   class Home extends Component {   render   {     return                    HELLO           Cras facilisis urna ornare ex volutpat, et         convallis erat elementum. Ut aliquam, ipsum vitae         gravida suscipit, metus dui bibendum est, eget rhoncus nibh         metus nec massa. Maecenas hendrerit laoreet augue         nec molestie. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis         dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.             Duis a turpis sed lacus dapibus elementum sed eu lectus.               ;   } }   export default Home;   Next, create a file called Stuff.js in the same location and add in the following:  Building Our Single-Page App  229  import React, { Component } from "react";   class Stuff extends Component {   render   {     return                    STUFF           Mauris sem velit, vehicula eget sodales vitae,         rhoncus eget sapien:                       Nulla pulvinar diam             Facilisis bibendum             Vestibulum vulputate             Eget erat             Id porttitor                         ;   } }   export default Stuff;  import React, { Component } from "react";   class Contact extends Component {   render   {     return                    GOT QUESTIONS?           The easiest thing to do is post on         our  forums .                        ;   } }   export default Contact;  We have just one more page left. Create a file called Contact.js in the src folder and make  sure its contents are the following:   230  Chapter 18  Creating a Single-Page App in React Using React Router  That’s the last of the content we’re going to add. If you take a look at what you’re adding,  you’ll see that these components can’t get any simpler. They just return some boilerplate JSX  content. Be sure to save all your changes to these three files. We’ll look at how to make them  useful shortly.  Using React Router We have our app frame in the form of our Main component. We have our content pages repre- sented by the Home, Stuff, and Contact components. Now we need to tie all of these together  to create our app. This is where React Router comes in. To start using it, go back to Main.js  and ensure that your import statements look as follows:  import React, { Component } from "react"; import {   Route,   NavLink,   HashRouter } from "react-router-dom"; import Home from ". Home"; import Stuff from ". Stuff"; import Contact from ". Contact";  We are importing Route, NavLink, and HashRouter from the react-router-dom NPM  package installed earlier. In addition, we’re importing our Home, Stuff, and Contact compo- nents because we’ll be referencing them as part of loading our content.  React Router works by defining what I call a routing region. Inside this region are two things:  1.  Your navigation links  2.  The container to load your content into  There’s a close correlation between the URL your navigation links specify and the content that  ultimately gets loaded. There’s no way to easily explain this without first getting our hands  dirty and implementing what you just read about.  The first thing to do is define the routing region. Inside our Main component’s render  method, add the following highlighted lines:  class Main extends Component {   render   {     return                                Simple SPA                            Home                 Stuff                 Contact                 Building Our Single-Page App  231                                                   ;   } }  The HashRouter component provides the foundation for the navigation and browser history  handling that routing is made up of. Next we need to define our navigation links. We already  have list elements with the a element defined. We need to replace them with the more specialized  NavLink component, so go ahead and make the following highlighted changes:  class Main extends Component {   render   {     return                                Simple SPA                            Home                 Stuff                 Contact                                                                ;   } }  For each link, pay attention to the URL we’re telling our router to navigate to. This URL value   defined by the to prop  acts as an identifier to ensure that the right content gets loaded.  We match the URL with the content by using a Route component. Go ahead and add the  following highlighted lines:  class Main extends Component {   render   {     return                                Simple SPA                            Home                 Stuff                 Contact                 232  Chapter 18  Creating a Single-Page App in React Using React Router                                                                                           ;   } }  As you can see, the Route component contains a path prop. The value you specify for the  path determines when this route is going to be active. When a route is active, the component  specified by the component prop gets rendered. For example, when we click on the Stuff link   whose path is  stuff as set by the NavLink component’s to prop , the route whose path value  is also  stuff becomes active. This means the contents of our Stuff component get rendered.  You can see all of this for yourself. Jump back to your browser to see the live updates or run npm  start again. Click around on the links to see the content loading in and out. Something seems  off, though, right? The content for our home page seems to always display even if we’re click- ing on the Stuff or Contact links:   It’s the Little Things  233  That seems problematic. We’ll look at how to fix that and do many more little housekeeping  tasks in the next section when we go one level deeper into using React Router.  It’s the Little Things In the previous section, we got our SPA mostly up and running. We just wrapped our entire  routing region inside a HashRouter component, and we separated our links and the place our  links load by using the NavLink and Route components, respectively. Getting our example  mostly up and running and fully up and running are two different things. In the following  sections, we’ll close those differences.  Fixing Our Routing We ended the previous section by determining that our routing has a bug in it. The contents of  our Home component are always displaying because the path for loading our Home component  is  . Our Stuff and Contact components have the   character as part of their paths as well.  This means our Home component always matches whatever path we are trying to navigate to.  The fix for that is simple. In the Route component representing our Home content, add the  exact prop as shown here:                   This prop ensures that the Route is active only if the path is an exact match for what is  being loaded. If you preview your app now, you’ll see that the content loads correctly, with  the Home content displaying only when our app is in the Home view.  Adding Some CSS Right now, our app is completely unstyled. The fix for that is easy. In your src folder, create a  file called index.css and add the following style rules into it:  body {   background-color: FFCC00;   padding: 20px;   margin: 0; } h1, h2, p, ul, li {   font-family: sans-serif; }   234  Chapter 18  Creating a Single-Page App in React Using React Router  ul.header li {   display: inline;   list-style-type: none;   margin: 0; } ul.header {   background-color: 111;   padding: 0; } ul.header li a {   color: FFF;   font-weight: bold;   text-decoration: none;   padding: 20px;   display: inline-block; } .content {   background-color: FFF;   padding: 20px; } .content h2 {   padding: 0;   margin: 0; } .content li {   margin-bottom: 10px; }  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import Main from ". Main"; import ". index.css";   ReactDOM.render     ,   document.getElementById "root"   ;  Now, we need to reference this stylesheet in our app. At the top of index.js, add the import  statement to do just that:  Save all your changes if you haven’t done so yet. If you preview the app now, you’ll notice that  it’s starting to look a bit more like the example we started with:   It’s the Little Things  235  We’re almost done here! We just need to do a few more things.  Highlighting the Active Link Right now, it’s hard to tell which link corresponds to content that is currently loaded. Having  some sort of a visual cue would be useful. The creators of React Router have already thought of  that. When you click a link, a class value of active is automatically assigned to it.  For example, this is what the HTML for clicking on the Stuff link looks like:   Stuff   All we really have to do, then, is add the appropriate CSS that lights up when an element has  a class value of active set on it. To make this happen, go back to index.css and add the  following style rule toward the bottom of your document:  .active {   background-color: 0099FF; }  After you have added this rule and saved your document, go back to your browser and click  around on the links in our example. You’ll see that the active link whose content is displayed is  highlighted with blue. Notice also that our Home link is always highlighted. That isn’t correct.  The fix is simple: Just add the exact prop to the NavLink component representing our Home  content:    Home     Stuff     Contact     236  Chapter 18  Creating a Single-Page App in React Using React Router  Now go back to the browser. You’ll see that our Home link gets the active color treatment only  when the Home content is displayed:  At this point, we’re done with the code changes to build our SPA using React Router. Yay!  Conclusion By now, we’ve covered a good chunk of the cool functionality React Router has in helping  you build your SPA. This doesn’t mean there aren’t more interesting things for you to take  advantage of. Our app was pretty simple, with very modest demands on the routing functionality  we needed to implement. React Router provides a whole lot more  including variations of APIs for  what you’ve seen here , so if you’re building a more complex single-page app than what we’ve  looked at so far, you should totally spend an afternoon taking a look the full React Router  documentation https:  github.com reactjs react-router   and examples.

In fact, it’s not even between  any characters we’ve seen in books or movies. It’s actually between React and a mysterious  unknown straggler from a far-away land, known as Redux.   238  Chapter 19  Introduction to Redux  By now, you know enough about React to understand how it works and why it does some of  the things it does. We haven’t talked about Redux at all, though. We need to fix that before we  can try to figure out why React and Redux get along so well. In the following sections, we take  a deep dive into what Redux is.  What Is Redux? If we’ve learned one thing in all this time, it is this: Maintaining application state and keeping it  consistent with our UI is a major challenge. Solving this is partly why libraries such as React really  took off. If you cast a wider net and look beyond just the UI layer, you’ll see that maintaining  application state in general is complicated. The typical app has many layers, and each layer has  its own dependency on some piece of data that it relies on to do its thing.  Visualizing the relationship between your app’s functionality and its application state often is  pretty confusing:   To solve this more general problem of maintaining application state, you have Redux. The  easiest way to understand how Redux works is just to walk through the various pieces that go  into it. The first thing we need is an app:  What Is Redux?  239  This app doesn’t have to be anything special. It can be built in React, Angular, Vue, vanilla  JS, or whatever happens to be the hot new library or framework this week. Redux doesn’t care  how your app is built. It only cares that your app has a magical way for dealing with applica- tion state and storing it. In the Redux world, we store all our application state in a single  location that we’ll just call the Store:   240  Chapter 19  Introduction to Redux  The thing about the Store is that reading data from it is easy. Getting information into it is a  whole another story. You add a new state to  or modify existing state in  the Store by using  a combination of actions, which describe what to change, and a reducer, which determines  what the final state will be as a result for a given action. When you throw both of these into  the picture, this is what you see:   What Is Redux?  241  This diagram omits a few more moving pieces, but it’s a good approximation of what happens  when our app needs to update the state stored in the Store. Now, looking at this diagram,  you’re probably wondering why there’s all this roundaboutness and indirection. Why can’t  our app just update the Store directly?   242  Chapter 19  Introduction to Redux  The reason is scalability. Even for simple apps, keeping our application state in-sync with what  our app is doing is a chore. For complex apps in which different parts want to access and  modify the application state, forget about it! This roundabout way is Redux’s answer for making  sure storing application state is easy for both simple apps and complex ones. Beyond just ease,  Redux helps make maintaining your application state predictable. Dan Abramov and Andrew  Clark, the creators of Redux, interpreted predictable as follows:  1.  Your entire application’s state is stored in a single location. You don’t have to search  across a variety of data stores to find the part of your state you want to update. Keeping  everything stored in a single location also ensures that you don’t have to worry about  keeping all of this data in sync.   Building a Simple App Using Redux  243  2.  Your state should be read-only and can be modified only through actions. As you  saw in the diagram earlier, in a Redux world, you need to ensure that random parts of  your app can’t access the Store and modify the state stored inside it. The only way our  app can modify what is in the Store is by relying on actions.  3.  You specify what the final state should be. To keep things simple, your state is never   modified or mutated. You use a reducer to specify what the final result of your state  should be.  These three principles might seem a bit abstract, but as you start to write some Redux code,  you’ll see them put into practice.  Building a Simple App Using Redux We’re now going to take all the diagrams and text you saw in the previous section and turn  them into code. The app we’re building to highlight how Redux works will be a really simple  console-driven app without any UI. This app will store and display a list of favorite colors.  From our app, you’ll be able to add colors and remove colors. That’s pretty much it.  This might seem like a step backward from the UI-rich apps we’ve been building, but this app  will tie together all this theoretical Redux knowledge to produce some tangible lines of code.  The goal is to simply make sense of Redux. We’ll complicate our world by combining Redux  with some UI later.  It’s Redux Time First we need to create a new HTML document and reference the Redux library as part of it.  We won’t be using create-react-app or any fancy build system here. This will be just a loose  HTML file somewhere that you can view in your browser. Using your favorite code editor, go  ahead and create a new file called favoriteColors.html and add the following markup:             Favorite Colors!                               244  Chapter 19  Introduction to Redux  As you can see, we have an empty HTML document with only the basic structure defined.  We’re referencing a hosted version of the Redux library, which is fine for kicking the tires  like we’re doing. For production apps, like the ones you saw with React, you have better  approaches to use. We’ll look at those better approaches later, but referencing the library  directly is okay for now.  Lights! Camera! Action! With our Redux library referenced, we need to define our actions. Remember, the action is the  only mechanism we have to communicate with our Store. For our app, because we want to add  and remove colors, our actions will represent that want in a way the Store will understand.  Inside your script tag, add the following lines:  function addColor value  {   return {     type: "ADD",     color: value   }; }   function removeColor value  {   return {     type: "REMOVE",     color: value   }; }  function addColor value  {   return {     type: "ADD",     color: value   }; }  We have two functions, addColor and removeColor. They each take one argument and return  an action object as a result. For addColor, the action object is the highlighted two lines:  When defining an action, you have a lot of freedom. Every action object has a type property.  This is a keyword that signals what you’re intending to do. Beyond that, any other information  you send along with your action is entirely up to you. Because we’re interested in adding or  removing a color value from our Store, our action object also has a color property that stores  the color we’re interested in.  Let’s get back to our addColor and removeColor functions. Both really serve just one purpose:  to return an action. There’s a more formal name for these functions in the Redux world.  They’re known as action creators because they, um, create an action.   Building a Simple App Using Redux  245  Our Reducer Our actions define what we want to do, but the reducer handles the specifics of what happens  and how our new state is defined. You can think of the reducer as the intermediary between  the Store and the outside world, where it does the following three things:  1.  Provides access to the Store’s original state  2.  Allows you to inspect the action that was currently fired  3.  Allows you to set the Store’s new state  You can see all this when you add a reducer to deal with adding and removing colors from the  Store. Add the following code after the point where you’ve defined your action creators:  function favoriteColors state, action  {   if  state === undefined  {     state = [];   }     if  action.type === "ADD"  {     return state.concat action.color ;   } else if  action.type === "REMOVE"  {     return state.filter function item  {       return item !== action.color;     } ;   } else {     return state;   } }  function favoriteColors state, action  {   if  state === undefined  {     state = [];     }     if  action.type === "ADD"  {     return state.concat action.color ;   } else if  action.type === "REMOVE"  {     return state.filter function item  {       return item !== action.color;     } ;   } else {     return state;   } }  Take a moment to walk through what this code is doing. First we ensure that we actually have  some state to fiddle with:   246  Chapter 19  Introduction to Redux  If our state object doesn’t exist, as with the first time we launch our app, we just initialize it as  an empty array. You can use any data structure you want, but an array is the right one for what  we’re trying to do here.  From there, the rest of our code is responsible for dealing with our actions. Note that the  reducer gets the full action object via its action argument. This means you have access to not  only the action’s type property, but also anything else you specified earlier as part of defining  your actions.  For this example, if our action’s type is ADD, we add the color  specified by the action’s color  property  to our state array. If our action’s type is REMOVE, we return a new array with the color  in question omitted. Lastly, if our action’s type is something we don’t know, we just return our  current state, unmodified:  function favoriteColors state, action  {   if  state === undefined  {     state = [];   }     if  action.type === "ADD"  {     return state.concat action.color ;   } else if  action.type === "REMOVE"  {     return state.filter function item  {       return item !== action.color;     } ;   } else {     return state;   } }  Pretty simple, right? Be sure to keep one important Redux design choice in mind. The Redux  documentation  https:  redux.js.org docs basics Reducers.html  describes it best:  Things you should never do inside a reducer:     Mutate its arguments     Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions     Call non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now   or Math.random    Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects.  No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.  You can see this in our code. To add new color values to our state array, we used the concat  method, which returns an entirely new array made up of both the old values and the new  value we’re adding. Using push would give us the same end result, but it violates our goal of  not modifying the existing state. To remove color values, we continue to maintain our goal of  not modifying our current state. We use the filter method, which returns a brand new array  with the value we want to remove omitted.   Building a Simple App Using Redux  247  Also keep the following in mind, as Mark Erikson  @acemarke   reminded me: Redux doesn’t contain  any mechanics to prevent us from modifying state and making other poor choices. The creators of Redux  have provided some guidelines. It’s up to us to follow them and put those guidelines into practice.  Store Stuff All that remains now is to tie our actions and the reducer with our Store. First we have to actu- ally create the Store. Below your favoriteColors reducer function, add the following:  var store = Redux.createStore favoriteColors ;  Here we’re creating a new Store using the createStore method. The argument we provide is  the favoriteColors reducer we created a few moments ago. We’ve now come full circle in  using Redux to store application state. We have our store, we have our reducer, and we have  actions that tell our reducer what to do.  To see everything fully working, we’re going to add  and remove  some colors to the Store.  To do this, we use the dispatch method on our store object that takes an action as its   argument. Go ahead and add the following lines:  store.dispatch addColor "blue"  ; store.dispatch addColor "yellow"  ; store.dispatch addColor "green"  ; store.dispatch addColor "red"  ; store.dispatch addColor "gray"  ; store.dispatch addColor "orange"  ; store.dispatch removeColor "gray"  ;  Each dispatch call sends an action to our reducer. The reducer takes the action and performs  the appropriate work to define our new state. To see the Store’s current state, you can just add  the following after all the dispatch calls:  console.log store.getState   ;  As its name implies, the getState method returns the state’s value. If you preview your app in  the browser and bring up your browser’s developer tools, you’ll see that the colors we added get  displayed in the console:   248  Chapter 19  Introduction to Redux  We’re almost done here; We have just one more really important thing to cover. In real-world  scenarios, you want to be notified each time your application’s state is modified. This push  model will make your life much easier if you want to update UI or perform other tasks as a  result of some change to the Store. To accomplish this, you have the subscribe method for  specifying a function  a.k.a. a listener  that gets called each time the contents of the Store are  modified. To see the subscribe method in action, just after you defined the store object,  add the following highlighted lines:  var store = Redux.createStore favoriteColors ; store.subscribe render ;   function render   {   console.log store.getState   ; }  After you’ve done this, preview your app again. This time, whenever you call dispatch to fire  another action, the render function gets called when the Store is modified. Phew!  Conclusion We’ve taken a whirlwind tour of Redux and the major pieces of functionality it brings to the  table. We looked at not only the concepts that make Redux really useful for dealing with appli- cation state, but also the code to make everything real. The only thing we didn’t get to do was  create a more realistic example. Redux is flexible enough to work with any UI framework, and  each UI framework has its own magic in working with Redux. Our UI framework of choice is,  of course, React! We’ll look at how to tie them together in the next chapter.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask! If you have any questions or your code isn’t running like you expect, don’t hesitate to ask!

Why is Redux so popular in React projects? To help answer this, take  a look at the following component hierarchy for some arbitrary app:   250  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React  What this app does isn’t very important. The only detail we’ll throw in here is that some  of these components are responsible for managing state and transferring some of that state  around in the form of props:   In an ideal setup, the data that each component needs flows neatly down from parent to child:   Using Redux with React  251  Unfortunately, outside of simple scenarios, what we want to do isn’t very realistic. Your  typical app does a lot of state generating, processing, and transferring. One component  might initiate a state change. Another component somewhere else will want to react to it.    252  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React  The props related to this state change might travel both down the tree  yay!  as well as up the  tree  no!  to reach whatever component is relying on the data being transferred:  We’ve been guilty of this quite a few times ourselves as part of communicating something    variable value, function event handler reference, and so on  from child to parent and beyond.  At this point, we need to acknowledge a few problems that can arise from data traveling willy  nilly through our components:  1.  Dependencies make our code difficult to maintain. React’s stated goal was to avoid  spaghetti-like dependencies. When we have data flowing around our app, we end up  with exactly what we were supposed to be free from.    Using Redux with React  253  2.  Each time your state changes or a prop is transmitted, all affected components are   asked to re-render. To ensure that your UI is in sync with the current state, this behavior  is a good thing. As we mentioned previously, many components are unnecessarily  asked to re-render when they’re simply passing a value from parent to child, with  no additional input. We looked at ways of minimizing this re-rendering by setting  shouldComponentUpdate or relying on PureComponent, but both approaches are a  hassle to keep in sync as your app’s data needs evolve.  3.  Our component hierarchy mimics the UI, not our data needs. The way we arrange   and nest our components helps separate our UI into smaller and manageable pieces.  This is the correct approach. Despite the correctness, the components that initiate a  state change and the ones that need to react to it are often not in the same parent child  descendant arrangement  a.k.a. subtree . Similar to what we talked about in ii, this  requires our props to travel great distances, often multiple times per change.  The solution to our problems is Redux. Now, Redux doesn’t fully solve all of these problems,  but it gets us really close. Redux allows you to have all of your application’s state live inside its  data store instead of being distributed across a bunch of components:   254  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React  This approach solves several problems. If you want to share data from one part of your app  with another, you can do that without having to navigate up and down your component  hierarchy:  You can initiate a state change and involve only the components that are impacted directly.  This directness reduces a lot of overhead you would otherwise have to maintain to ensure that  your data  and any changes to it  gets to its intended destination without causing unnecessary  renders. Pretty cool, right?   Now let’s go one level higher. From an architectural point of view, the overview of Redux you  got in the Introduction still holds:   Using Redux with React  255  Besides the Store, we still have to work with actions, reducers, and all the other related pieces  that make up the Redux party. The only difference is that our app is built using React, and this  difference  and how it plays with Redux  is where we focus our attention here.  Onward!   256  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React  Managing React State with Redux The way Redux plugs into your React app is as straightforward as calling a few Redux APIs from  your React code. Just two steps are involved:  1.  Give your app a reference to the Redux store.  2.  Map the action creators, dispatch functions, and state as props to whatever component   needs data from the Store.  To see what’s involved in bringing these two steps to life, we’re going to build a simple  Counter app that looks as in Figure 20.1:  Figure 20.1  An example of the counter app we will create.  Our app will have a plus button and a minus button to increase or decrease a counter value.  That’s it. Nothing else is going on here; this is just the right level of functionality and   complexity to help you get your feet wet with combining React and Redux.   Managing React State with Redux  257  How Redux and React Overlap This is generally where we’d start copying and pasting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get our  example up and running. We’ll totally get there in a few moments, but first we need to walk  through how this app is structured. Ignoring the data and state management side, we’re going  to have just two components  Figure 20.2 :  Figure 20.2  How our app is currently set up.  We’ll have an App component and a Counter component. Now, a counter isn’t the most  complicated of examples to think about. If we had to implement it using plain old state, we  would simply create a state object inside Counter and have a variable whose value increases or  decreases, depending on what button we press.   258  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React  When we throw Redux into the mix, our component arrangement gets a little bizarre. It will  look as in Figure 20.3:  Figure 20.3  What our app’s arrangement will be once we add Redux into the mix.   Managing React State with Redux  259  The items in blue are what we originally had. The items in green are new as part of incorpo- rating Redux into our app. Earlier, we mentioned that adding Redux to our app involved two  steps. The green additions mimic those steps closely:  1.  The first step of providing access to our Redux store is handled by the Provider   component.  2.  The second step of granting any interested components access to our dispatch and   actions is handled by the Connect component.  Going into a little more detail, the Provider component is the gateway to getting Redux func- tionality in our React app. It is responsible for storing a reference to the Store and ensuring that  all components in our app have a way of accessing it. It is able to do that by being the top- most component in your component hierarchy. That vaulted position allows it to easily pass  Redux-related wisdom throughout the entire app.  The Connect component is a bit more interesting. It isn’t a full-blown component in the  traditional sense. It’s known as a Higher Order Component  https:  reactjs.org docs higher- order-components.html , or HOC, as the cool kids say it. HOCs provide a consistent way to  extend the functionality of a preexisting component by simply wrapping it and injecting their  own additional functionality into it. Think of this as the React-friendly way to mimic what the  extends keyword does when working with ES6 classes. Looking at our diagram, the end result  is that, thanks to the Connect HOC, our Counter component has access to any actions and  dispatch calls needed to work with the Redux Store, without you having to write any special  code to access it. The Connect HOC takes care of that.  Both the Provider and Connect HOCs create a symbiotic relationship that gives any old  React app the ability to easily work with Redux’s peculiar  yet totally efficient and awesome   way of managing the application state. As we start to build our app, you’ll see how this  relationship plays out.  Getting Started Now that you have an idea of how our app will be structured and some of the Redux-specific  constructs we’ll be using, let’s shift gears and start to build our app. To get started, first use  create-react-app to create an app we’ll call reduxcounter:  create-react-app reduxcounter  Now let’s install the Redux and React Redux dependencies. From inside your  terminal  command-line environment, navigate to the reduxcounter folder and run the  following command:  npm install redux  This installs the Redux library so that our app can use the basic building blocks Redux provides  for fiddling with application state. After the Redux library has fully installed, we need to    260  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React  deal with one more dependency. Run the following command to bring over all the React  Redux content:  npm install react-redux  When this command has run to completion, we’ll have everything needed to both build our  React app and use some Redux magic in it as well. It’s time to start building our app!  Building the App We first need to clear our package of all unnecessary and extraneous files. Go to your src and  public folders, and delete all the contents you see in both locations. Then, create a new file  called index.html in your public folder and add the following HTML into it:             Redux Counter                         The only point to note is that we have a div element with an id value of container.  Next, let’s create the JavaScript that will be the entry point to our app. In the src folder, create  a file called index.js and add the following contents into it:  import React, { Component } from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import { createStore } from "redux"; import { Provider } from "react-redux"; import counter from ". reducer"; import App from ". App"; import ". index.css";   var destination = document.querySelector "container" ;      Store var store = createStore counter ;     Managing React State with Redux  261  Take a moment to look at what we’re doing here. We’re first initializing our Redux store and  using our trustworthy createStore method that takes a reducer at its argument. Our reducer is  referenced by the counter variable, and if you look at our import statements, it is defined in a  file called reducer.js. We’ll deal with that in a few moments.  After creating our Store, we provide it as a prop to our Provider component. The Provider  component is intended to be used as the outermost component in our app, to help ensure that  every component has access to the Redux Store and related functionality:  Next, let’s create our reducer. You already saw that our reducer is referenced by the counter  variable and lives inside a file called reducer.js—which doesn’t exist. Let’s fix that by first  creating a file called reducer.js in the src folder. After you have created this file, add the  following JavaScript into it:  ReactDOM.render               ,   destination  ;  ReactDOM.render               ,   destination  ;     Reducer function counter state, action  {   if  state === undefined  {     return { count: 0 };   }     var count = state.count;     switch  action.type  {     case "increase":       return { count: count + 1 };     case "decrease":       return { count: count - 1 };     default:       return state;   } }   export default counter;   262  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React  Our reducer is pretty simple. We have a count variable that we initialize to 0 if our state is  empty. This reducer will deal with two action types: increase and decrease. If the action  type is increase, we up our count value by 1. If our action type is decrease, we decrease our  count value by 1 instead.  At this point, we’re about halfway done building our example  Figure 20.4 :  Figure 20.4  We are almost there with getting our app working!   Managing React State with Redux  263  We’re ready to go one level deeper in our app and deal with our App component. Inside the  src folder, create a new file called App.js. Inside, add the following:  import { connect } from "react-redux"; import Counter from ". Counter";      Map Redux state to component props function mapStateToProps state  {   return {     countValue: state.count;   }; }      Action var increaseAction = { type: "increase" }; var decreaseAction = { type: "decrease" };      Map Redux actions to component props function mapDispatchToProps dispatch  {   return {     increaseCount: function   {       return dispatch increaseAction ;     },     decreaseCount: function   {       return dispatch decreaseAction ;     }   }; }      The HOC var connectedComponent = connect    mapStateToProps,   mapDispatchToProps   Counter ;   export default connectedComponent;  First up is our mapStateToProps function:     Map Redux state to component props function mapStateToProps state  {   return {     countValue: state.count;   }; }  Take a few moments to see what’s going on here. The main purpose of the code here is to turn  all the Redux-specific hooks into something we can use in React. More specifically, we provide  all those hooks as props that our component can easily consume through two functions, called  mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps.   264  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React  This function subscribes to all Store updates and gets called when anything in our Store  changes. It returns an object that contains the Store data you want to transmit as props to  a component. In our case, what we’re transmitting is pretty simple: an object that contains  a property called countValue whose value is represented by our old count property  from the Store.  Providing the Store value as props is only one part of what we need to do. The next part is to  give our component access to the action creators and actions, also in the form of props. The  following code handles this:     Action var increaseAction = { type: "increase" }; var decreaseAction = { type: "decrease" };      Map Redux actions to component props function mapDispatchToProps dispatch  {   return {     increaseCount: function   {       return dispatch increaseAction ;     },     decreaseCount: function   {       return dispatch decreaseAction ;     }   }; }  The really interesting stuff happens with mapDispatchToProps. We return an object contain- ing the name of the two functions our component can call to dispatch a change to our Store.  The increaseCount function fires off a dispatch with an action type of increase. The  decreaseCount function fires off a dispatch with an action type of decrease. If you look at  the reducer we added a few moments ago, you can see how either of these function calls will  affect the value of count we’re storing in our Store.  All that remains now is to ensure that whatever component we want to provide all these  props to has some way of actually receiving them. That is where the magical connect   function comes in:  This function creates the magical Connect HOC we talked about earlier. It takes our   mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps functions as arguments, and it passes all of that  into the Counter component, which you also specify. The end result of all this code running is  the equivalent of rendering the following:  var connectedComponent = connect    mapStateToProps,   mapDispatchToProps   Counter ;      <Counter increaseCount={increaseCount}            decreaseCount={decreaseCount}            countValue={countValue} >     Managing React State with Redux  265  Our Counter component gets access to increaseCount, decreaseCount, and countValue.  The only strange thing is that there’s no render function or equivalent in sight. All of that is  handled automatically by React and its treatment of HOC.  We’re almost done! It’s time to get our Counter component up and running. In your src direc- tory, add a file called Counter.js. Put the following into it:  import React, { Component } from "react";   class Counter extends Component {   render   {     return                   <button className="buttons"                 onClick={this.props.decreaseCount}>-           {this.props.countValue}          <button className="buttons"                 onClick={this.props.increaseCount}>+               ;   } }   export default Counter;  This will probably be the most boring component you’ve seen in quite some time. We’ve  already talked about how our Connect HOC sends down props and other related shenanigans  to our Counter component. You can see those props in use here to display the counter value  or call the appropriate function when our plus or minus buttons are clicked.  The last thing we need to do is define our CSS file to style our counter. In the same src folder  we’ve been working in all this time, create a file called index.css. Inside this file, add the  following style rules:  body {   margin: 0;   padding: 0;   font-family: sans-serif;   display: flex;   justify-content: center;   background-color: 8E7C93; }   .container {   background-color: FFF;   margin: 100px;   padding: 10px;   border-radius: 3px;   width: 200px;   266  Chapter 20  Using Redux with React    display: flex;   align-items: center;   justify-content: space-between; }   .buttons {   background-color: transparent;   border: none;   font-size: 16px;   font-weight: bold;   border-radius: 3px;   transition: all .15s ease-in; }   .buttons:hover:nth-child 1  {   background-color: F45B69; }   .buttons:hover:nth-child 3  {   background-color: C0DFA1; }  At this point, we’re done with our example. If you haven’t done so yet, save your changes  across all the files you’ve been working on. If you preview your app in the browser  using npm  start , you will see your counter working as expected.  Conclusion In many ways, Redux is designed to fix some of the shortcomings that React often claims as  advantages. We looked at some of these advantages when we examined how data in React is  supposed to flow. You could even go further and say that the ideas behind Redux should be  formalized as part of React itself so that you get even better integration. But Redux isn’t perfect,  either. As with many things in programming, Redux is simply one of many tools you have for  accomplishing a task. Not every situation involving data requires Redux; in fact, adding Redux  sometimes can create unnecessary complexity in what you’re trying to do. Dan Abramov, one  of the creators of Redux, wrote a great article  https:  medium.com @dan_abramov you-might- not-need-redux-be46360cf367  describing some situations when you probably shouldn’t use  Redux to solve your problem. I highly encourage you to read that to get the full picture.  Note: If you run into any issues, ask! If you have any questions or your code isn’t running like you expect, don’t hesitate to ask!
