Because I must write that book without the benefit of existing models, I begin by doing my best to master the technology, and then I write the book to help other newcomers learn as much as I did, but more quickly and with less pain, anguish, and confusion. To accomplish that goal, I write as much content as I feel is necessary to cover the topic in the depth that my readers require.   When I started on what became the 4th and Gold editions of the JavaScript Bible, there were models to follow  my previous three editions  plus a substantial amount of brand new material, much of which had not yet been documented anywhere. I also assumed the responsibility of integrating the frequently conflicting and com- peting philosophies of the ways the JavaScript language is applied to a variety of browser brands and versions. Resolving these conflicts is a challenge that I face in my own programming work with clients, and I take great pleasure in sharing my solutions and approaches with other programmers floating in the same boat.  As my editor and I began counting the pages I had assembled for these new edi- tions, we discovered that the number of pages far outstripped the printer’s binding capabilities, even in a thicker volume made possible by using a hard cover  the Gold edition . Certainly not all of the words that I had written were so precious that some of them couldn’t be cut. But we were hundreds of pages beyond capacity. To cut that much content would have forced exclusion of coverage of language or doc- ument object model vocabulary.   Fortunately, as had been done in previous editions, the plan for the new editions included Adobe Acrobat versions of the books on the accompanying CD-ROM. Although a significant compromise to ease of reading, it was possible to move some of the book’s content to the CD-ROM and leave the most important parts on the printed page. For the softcover 4th edition, reference chapters covering less-used or advanced subjects were pulled from print; for the hardcover Gold edition, which was longer and targeted more for professional scripters, the advanced chapters were put back into the book  along with 15 additional chapters for that edition , and the JavaScript tutorial was exiled to the CD-ROM.   But even after making the difficult decisions about which chapters could go to the CD-ROMs, the page counts for both volumes were still excessive. Something else — something big — had to go. The remaining bundle that could free us from the page   4855-7 FM.F  6 26 01  8:33 AM  Page x  x  JavaScript Example Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  count devil was all of the Example sections from the reference vocabulary. By being nondiscriminatory about these extractions — that is, extracting all of them instead of only selected sections — we could convey to readers a consistent organizational model.  In the end, the extracted Example sections from Parts III and IV found their way into Appendix F on the CD-ROMs of both editions of the larger tome. I knew that as a reader of my own books  and one of a certain age at that  I would not enjoy having to flip back and forth between book and screen to refresh my memory about a term and see it in action. A more pleasing solution for many JavaScript Bible readers would be a separate volume containing a printed version of the Examples sections. The new volume would act as a companion to both the 4th and Gold editions of the JavaScript Bible.  Using Appendix F as a starting point, I divided the content into chapters along the same lines as the JavaScript Bible reference sections. This also gave me a chance to study the examples for each chapter with fresh eyes. The examples haven’t changed, but I had the opportunity to direct the reader’s attention to examples that I thought were particularly helpful in mastering a document-level or core language object. Thus, each chapter of this book begins with a scene-setting introduction and a list of highlights to which you should pay special attention. Also, since you will likely be scanning through the book from time to time, I added many illustrations of the pages produced from the code listings. These figures will help you visualize what important listing code does when the page is loaded into a browser.  Now you know the story behind the JavaScript Examples Bible. Some budget- conscious readers may not be thrilled to pay more for what appears to be a printout of content they already own in electronic format. If so, then please continue using the Acrobat version. But if, like me, you enjoy the portability and visual scanability of a printed work, then keeping this book near your JavaScript Bible volume will enhance your learning and research activities.  Organization and Features of This Book  Almost all chapters in this book correspond to similarly named chapters in Parts III and IV from the JavaScript Bible 4th and Gold editions. Although chapters in this book are consecutively numbered starting with Chapter 1, each chapter title includes a reference to the corresponding chapter number from the big books. For example, Chapter 1 of this book provides the Examples sections for terms related to generic HTML elements. That subject is covered in Chapter 15 of the big books. There is not always a one-to-one relationship between chapters. Several chapters of the big books have no Examples sections in them because sample code is embed- ded as part of the big book text. Therefore, don’t be surprised to see gaps in pointers to JavaScript Bible reference chapters.    4855-7 FM.F  6 26 01  8:33 AM  Page xi  Preface  xi  Listing numbers are derived from their original order in what had been planned as a contiguous volume. Such listing numbers are the ones referred to in the “On the CD-ROM” pointers throughout Parts III and IV of the big books. This should help you locate an example’s listing when you reach one of those pointers in the JavaScript Bible. Notice, too, that the big books’ running footers with property, method, and event handler names appear in this book, too. Therefore, if you should be looking at an example listing of this book and wish to consult the more detailed discussion of the subject in the large book, turn to the corresponding big book chapter and locate the corresponding terminology within the object’s chapter.  Many examples throughout this book refer to The Evaluator. This Web page applica- tion is described at length in Chapter 13 of the big books. You can find the file for The Evaluator within the Listings\Chap13 folder on the CD-ROM for either the big book or this book.  CD-ROM  The accompanying CD-ROM contains the complete set of over 300 ready-to-run HTML documents from the JavaScript Bible, Gold Edition. These include listings for both the Examples sections in this book and all other listings from the Gold edition. You can run these examples with your JavaScript-enabled browser, but be sure to use the index.html page in the Listings folder as a gateway to running the listings. This page shows you the browsers that are compatible with each example listing.   The Quick Reference from Appendix A of the big books is in .pdf format on the CD-ROM for you to print out and assemble as a handy reference, if desired. Adobe Acrobat Reader is included on the CD-ROM so that you can read this .pdf file. Finally, the text of the book is in a .pdf file format on the CD-ROM for easy searching.  Formatting and Naming Conventions  The script listings and words in this book are presented in a monospace font to set them apart from the rest of the text. Because of restrictions in page width, lines of script listings may, from time to time, break unnaturally. In such cases, the remainder of the script appears in the following line, flush with the left margin of the listing, just as they would appear in a text editor with word wrapping turned on. If these line breaks cause you problems when you type a script listing into a docu- ment yourself, I encourage you to access the corresponding listing on the CD-ROM to see how it should look when you type it.  To make it easier to spot in the text when a particular browser and browser version is required, most browser references consist of a two-letter abbreviation and a ver- sion number. For example, IE5 means Internet Explorer 5 for any operating system;   4855-7 FM.F  6 26 01  8:33 AM  Page xii  xii  JavaScript Example Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  NN6 means Netscape Navigator 6 for any operating system. If a feature is intro- duced with a particular version of browser and is supported in subsequent ver- sions, a plus symbol  +  follows the number. For example, a feature marked IE4+ indicates that Internet Explorer 4 is required at a minimum, but the feature is also available in IE5, IE5.5, and so on. Occasionally, a feature or some highlighted behav- ior applies to only one operating system. For example, a feature marked IE4+ Windows means that it works only on Windows versions of Internet Explorer 4 or later. As points of reference, the first scriptable browsers were NN2, IE3 Windows, and IE3.01 Macintosh. Moreover, IE3 for Windows can be equipped with one of two versions of the JScript.dll file. A reference to the earlier version is cited as IE3 J1, while the later version is cited as IE3 J2. You will see this notation primarily in the compatibility charts throughout the reference chapters.   4855-7 FM.F  6 26 01  8:33 AM  Page xiii  Acknowledgments Because most of the content of this volume was created as part of the  JavaScript Bible, the acknowledgments that you see in your copy of the 4th or  Gold editions apply equally to this volume. But this JavaScript Examples Bible did not come into being without additional effort on the part of dedicated Hungry Minds, Inc., staff. In particular, I want to thank Sharon Cox for turning my idea into a title, and editor Neil Romanosky, who, even after marshaling over 4,000 pages of content for the 4th and Gold editions, took charge of this volume to maintain conti- nuity across the entire series. Thanks, too, to my friends and family, who certainly must have grown weary of my tales of reaching schedule milestones on this project not once, not twice, but three times over many, many months.

handlers of all element objects  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15  Document object models for both IE4+ and NN6 expose all  HTML elements as scriptable objects. A beneficial  byproduct of this concept is that object model designers find it easier to implement their models according to genuinely object- oriented principles.  In truth, modern HTML and DOM industry standards encourage browser makers to think in object-oriented terms anyway.  The object-oriented principle most applicable to the way we work with objects is that all HTML elements inherit properties, methods, and event handlers from a generic  and unseen  HTML element object. Thus, specifications for any HTML element object start with those of the generic object, and then pile on element-specific features, such as the src property of an IMG element. This chapter deals almost exclusively with the properties, methods, and event handlers that all HTML elements have in common.  Examples Highlights  ✦ Modern object models and the scripting world now pay  much attention to the containment hierarchy of ele- ments and text nodes in a document. The function shown in Listing 15-3 demonstrates how vital the childNodes property is to scripts that need to inspect  and then perhaps modify  page content.  ✦ Element containment is also at the forefront in Listing  15-10, where W3C DOM syntax demonstrates how to use the firstChild and lastChild properties, plus the insertBefore  , appendChild  , and replaceChild   methods, to change portions of page content on the fly.  ✦ In the IE Windows world, data binding can be a powerful  tool that requires only tiny amounts of your code in a page. You can get a good sense of the possibilities in the extended examples for the dataFld and related properties.   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 2  2  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  ✦ Follow the steps for the disabled property to see how form controls can be disabled in IE4+ and NN6. IE5.5 lets you disable any element on the page, as you can witness in real time when you follow the example steps.  ✦ Long-time IE scripters know the powers of the innerHTML and innerText  properties. Listing 15-11 solidifies by example the precise differences between the two related properties. Only one of these properties, innerHTML, is implemented in NN6.  ✦ Grasping the details of properties that govern element positions and dimen-  sions is not easy, as noted in the JavaScript Bible text. But you can work through the examples of the client-, offset-, and scroll-related properties for IE4+ and the offset-related properties in NN6 to help you visualize what these properties con- trol. If you are scripting cross-browser applications, be sure to work through the offset-related properties in both browsers to compare the results.  ✦ Compare the IE5+ attachEvent   method and NN6 addEventListener    method for modern ways to assign event handlers to element objects. Although the method names are different, the two work identically.  ✦ Observe how the getAttribute   method returns an object’s property value  when the property name is a string and the name is the same as an assigned element attribute name. The getAttribute   method is the prescribed way to retrieve property values according to the W3C DOM.  ✦ You can see how the getElementsByTagName   method returns an array of  nested elements with a particular tag. This is a great way, for example, to get a one-dimensional array of all cells within a table.  ✦ Spend time comparing how the various insert- and replace-related methods  operate from different points of view. In the IE world, most operate on the cur- rent element; in the W3C DOM world, the methods operate on child nodes of the current element.  ✦ For IE5+ Windows, check out the way dynamic properties are managed  through the getExpression  , setExpression  , and recalc   methods. Listing 15-32 demonstrates a neat graphical clock that employs these methods.  ✦ IE5+ Windows provides a number of event handlers, such as onBeforeCopy,  onBeforePaste, onCopy, onCut, and onPaste that let scripts manage the specific information preserved in the clipboard. These event handlers can also be used with the onContextMenu event handler to facilitate custom context menus.  ✦ Another set of IE5+ Windows event handlers provides excellent control over  user dragging and dropping of elements on a page. Listing 15-37 is particularly interesting in this regard.  ✦ Listing 15-41 shows a cross-browser laboratory for understanding the three  keyboard events and how to get key and character information from the event. You see event-handling that works with IE4+, NN4, and NN6 event models.  ✦ Numerous mouse-related events belong to all HTML elements. Listings 15-42  and 15-43 demonstrate simplified image swapping and element dragging.   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 3  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   3  Generic Objects  Properties accessKey  Compatibility  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   When you load the script in Listing 15-1, adjust the height of the browser window  so that you can see nothing below the second dividing rule.

The first button sets the color style property of every visible element on the page to red. Thus, elements  including the normally non-childbearing ones such as HR and INPUT  are affected by the color change. But if you reset the page and click the largest button, only those elements that can contain nested elements receive the color change.

Try it out in The Evaluator by entering the following statements into the top text field: walkChildNodes   walkChildNodes getElementById “myP”    The results of this function show the nesting relationships among all child nodes within the scope of the initial object. It also shows the act of drilling down to further childNodes collections until all child nodes are exposed and catalogued. Text nodes are labeled accordingly. The first 15 characters of the actual text are placed in the results to help you identify the nodes when you compare the results against your HTML source code.

Try it out in The Evaluator in IE5+ by entering the following statements into the top text field: walkChildren   walkChildren “myP”   The results of this function show the nesting relationships among all parent and child elements within the scope of the initial object. It also shows the act of drilling down to further children collections until all child elements are exposed and catalogued. The element tags also display their ID and or NAME attribute values if any are assigned to the elements in the HTML source code.

Only the width of the DIV element is specified in its style sheet rule, which means that the paragraph’s text wraps inside that width and extends as deeply as necessary to show the entire paragraph. The clientHeight property describes that depth. The clientHeight property then calculates where a logo image should be positioned immediately after DIV, regardless of the length of the text. As a bonus, the clientWidth property helps the script center the image horizontally with respect to the paragraph’s text.  Listing 15-6: Using clientHeight and clientWidth Properties       clientHeight and clientWidth Properties    function showLogo   {  var paragraphW = document.all.myDIV.clientWidth var paragraphH = document.all.myDIV.clientHeight    correct for Windows Mac discrepancies var paragraphTop =  document.all.myDIV.clientTop  ?   document.all.myDIV.clientTop : document.all.myDIV.offsetTop  var logoW = document.all.logo.style.pixelWidth    center logo horizontally against paragraph document.all.logo.style.pixelLeft =  paragraphW-logoW  2    position image immediately below end of paragraph document.all.logo.style.pixelTop = paragraphTop + paragraphH document.all.logo.style.visibility = “visible”  }        Position and Show Logo Art   <IMG SRC=”logo.gif”>     Continued  elementObject.clientHeight   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 14  14  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 15-6  continued    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetaur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

To assist in the vertical positioning of the logo, the offsetTop property of the  DIV object provides the position of the start of the DIV with respect to its outer container  the BODY . Unfortunately, IE Mac uses the clientTop property to obtain the desired dimension. That measure  assigned to the paragraphTop variable , plus the clientHeight of the DIV, provides the top coordinate of the image.  If you use only IE5, you can eliminate the DIV wrapper around the P element and  assign the STYLE attribute directly to the P element. The script can then read the clientHeight and clientWidth of the P object.  contentEditable  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Listing 15-7 is a simplified demonstration of how to turn some text inside a  document into an editable element. When you click the button of a freshly loaded page, the toggleEdit   function captures the opposite of the current editable state via the isContentEditable property of the DIV that is subject to edit. You switch on editing for that element in the next statement by assigning the new value to the contentEditable property of the DIV. For added impact, turn the text of the DIV to red to provide additional user feedback about what is editable on the page. You can also switch the button label to one that indicates the action invoked by the next click on it.  Listing 15-7: Using the contentEditable Property        .normal {color: black} .editing {color: red}  elementObject.contentEditable   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 15  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   15      function toggleEdit   {  var newState = !editableText.isContentEditable editableText.contentEditable = newState editableText.className =  newState  ? “editing” : “normal” editBtn.innerText =  newState  ? “Disable Editing” : “Enable Editing”  }      Editing Contents     Turn on editing to modify the following text:   Edit this text on the fly....     Enable Editing         The BUTTON element has an onFocus event handler that immediately invokes the blur   method on the button. This prevents a press of the spacebar  during editing  from accidentally triggering the button.

For example, an unmodified copy of The Evaluator contains an EM element whose ID is “myEM”. Enter document. all.myEM.style into the bottom property listing text box and press Enter. Notice how most of the property values are empty. Now enter document.all.myEM. currentStyle into the property listing text box and press Enter. Every property has a value associated with it.  elementObject.currentStyle   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 16  16  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  dataFld dataFormatAs dataSrc  Compatibility  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Listing 15-8 is a simple document that has two TDC objects associated with it.  The external files are different formats of the U.S. Bill of Rights document. One file is a traditional, tab-delimited data file consisting of only two records. The first record is a tab-delimited sequence of field names  named “Article1”, “Article2”, and so on ; the second record is a tab-delimited sequence of article content defined in HTML:  ARTICLE I  Congress shall make...   The second file is a raw text file consisting of the full Bill of Rights with no HTML formatting attached.  When you load Listing 15-8, only the first article of the Bill of Rights appears in a blue-bordered box. Buttons enable you to navigate to the previous and next articles in the series. Because the data source is a traditional, tab-delimited file, the nextField   and prevField   functions calculate the name of the next source field and assign the new value to the dataFld property. All of the data is already in the browser after the page loads, so cycling through the records is as fast as the browser can reflow the page to accommodate the new content.  Listing 15-8: Changing dataFld and dataSrc Properties       Data Binding    display {width:500px; border:10px ridge blue; padding:20px} .hiddenControl {display:none}     function nextField   {  var elem = document.all.display var fieldName = elem.dataFld var currFieldNum = parseInt fieldName.substring 7, fieldName.length ,10  currFieldNum =  currFieldNum == 10  ? 1 : ++currFieldNum elem.dataFld = “Article” + currFieldNum  }  elementObject.dataFld   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 17  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   17  function prevField   {  var elem = document.all.display var fieldName = elem.dataFld var currFieldNum = parseInt fieldName.substring 7, fieldName.length ,10  currFieldNum =  currFieldNum == 1  ? 10 : --currFieldNum elem.dataFld = “Article” + currFieldNum  }  function toggleComplete   {  if  document.all.buttonWrapper.className == “”  { document.all.display.dataSrc = “rights_raw” document.all.display.dataFld = “column1” document.all.display.dataFormatAs = “text” document.all.buttonWrapper.className = “hiddenControl”  } else {  }  document.all.display.dataSrc = “rights_html” document.all.display.dataFld = “Article1” document.all.display.dataFormatAs = “HTML” document.all.buttonWrapper.className = “”  }         U.S. Bill of Rights     <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Toggle Complete Individual”  onClick=”toggleComplete  ”>            <DIV ID=”display” DATASRC=”rights_html” DATAFLD=”Article1”  DATAFORMATAS=”HTML”>                                elementObject.dataFld   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 18  18  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Another button on the page enables you to switch between the initial piecemeal  version of the document and the unformatted version in its entirety. To load the entire document as a single record, the FieldDelim and RowDelim parameters of the second OBJECT element eliminate their default values by replacing them with characters that don’t appear in the document at all. And because the external file does not have a field name in the file, the default value  column1 for the lone col- umn in this document  is the data field. Thus, in the toggleComplete   function, the dataSrc property is changed to the desired OBJECT element ID, the dataFld property is set to the correct value for the data source, and the dataFormatAs property is changed to reflect the different intention of the source content  to be rendered as HTML or as plain text . When the display shows the entire document, you can hide the two radio buttons by assigning a className value to the SPAN element that surrounds the buttons. The className value is the identifier of the class selector in the document’s style sheet. When the toggleComplete   function resets the className property to empty, the default properties  normal inline display style  take hold.  One further example demonstrates the kind of power available to the TDC under script control. Listing 15-9 displays table data from a tab-delimited file of Academy Award information. The data file has eight columns of data, and each column heading is treated as a field name: Year, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Director Film, Best Actress, Best Actress Film, Best Actor, and Best Actor Film. For the design of the page, only five fields from each record appear: Year, Film, Director, Actress, and Actor. Notice in the listing how the HTML for the table and its content is bound to the data source object and the fields within the data.  The “dynamic” part of this example is apparent in how you can sort and filter the  data, once loaded into the browser, without further access to the original source data. The TDC object features Sort and Filter properties that enable you to act on the data currently loaded in the browser. The simplest kind of sorting indicates on which field  or fields, via a semicolon delimited list of field names  the entire data set should be sorted. Leading the name of the sort field is either a plus  to indicate ascending  or minus  descending  symbol. After setting the data object’s Sort property, invoke its Reset   method to tell the object to apply the new property. The data in the bound table is immediately redrawn to reflect any changes.  Similarly, you can tell a data collection to display records that meet specific criteria.  In Listing 15-9, two select lists and a pair of radio buttons provide the interface to the Filter property’s settings  see Figure 1-1 . For example, you can filter the output to display only those records in which the Best Picture was the same picture of the winning Best Actress’s performance. Simple filter expressions are based on field names: dataObj.Filter = “Best Picture” = “Best Actress Film”  Listing 15-9: Sorting and Filtering Bound Data       Data Binding — Sorting     elementObject.dataFld   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 19  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   19  function sortByYear type  {  oscars.Sort =  type == “normal”  ? “-Year” : “+Year” oscars.Reset    } function filterInCommon form  {  var filterExpr1 = form.filter1.options[form.filter1.selectedIndex].value var filterExpr2 = form.filter2.options[form.filter2.selectedIndex].value var operator =  form.operator[0].checked  ? “=” : “ ” var filterExpr = filterExpr1 + operator + filterExpr2 oscars.Filter = filterExpr oscars.Reset    }          Academy Awards 1978-1997      Sort list by year  from newest to oldest  or  from oldest to newest .

The script finds out the reference of the object’s containing document for further reference to other objects: function getCompanionFormCount obj  {  var ownerDoc = obj.document return ownerDoc.forms.length  }  Because the ownerDoc variable contains a valid reference to a document object, the  return statement uses that reference to return a typical property of the document object hierarchy. firstChild lastChild  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  These two properties come in handy for Listing 15-10, whose job it is to either add or replace LI elements to an existing OL element. You can enter any text you want to appear at the beginning or end of the list. Using the firstChild and lastChild properties simplifies access to the ends of the list. For the functions that replace child nodes, the example uses the replaceChild   method. Alternatively for IE4+, you can modify the innerText property of the objects returned by the firstChild or lastChild property. This example is especially interesting to watch when you add items to the list: The browser automatically renumbers items to fit the current state of the list.

In the second statement, the old number is increased by 10 percent and turned into a percentage string by appending the percentage symbol to the value. The resulting string value is assigned to the width property of the table.

Enter the following statement into the top text field to assign a tabIndex value to the myP element so that, by default, the element receives focus and the dotted rectangle: document.all.myP.tabIndex = 1  Press the Tab key several times until the paragraph receives focus. Now, disable  the focus rectangle: document.all.myP.hideFocus = true  If you now press the Tab key several times, the dotted rectangle does not appear around the paragraph. To prove that the element still receives focus, scroll the page down to the bottom so that the paragraph is not visible  you may have to resize the window . Click one of the focusable elements at the bottom of the page, and then press the Tab key slowly until the Address field toolbar has focus. Press the Tab key once. The page scrolls to bring the paragraph into view, but there is no focus rectangle around the element.

You can retrieve an object reference once you know the object’s id property  via the document.getElementById elemID  method .

The purpose is to demonstrate how the innerHTML and innerText properties differ in their intent. Two text boxes contain the same combination of text and HTML tags that replaces the inner content of the paragraph’s label.  If you apply the default content of the first text box to the innerHTML property of the label1 object, the italic style is rendered as such for the first word. In addition, the text in parentheses is rendered with the help of the small style sheet rule assigned by virtue of the surrounding   tags. But if you apply that same content to the innerText property of the label object, the tags are rendered as is.  Use this as a laboratory to experiment with some other content in both text boxes.

The P element whose ID is myP is a good place to start. The P element itself is a nodeType of 1: document.getElementById “myP” .nodeType  This element has three child nodes: a string of text  nodeName text ; an EM  element  nodeName EM ; and the rest of the text of the element content  nodeName text . If you view the nodeType of either of the text portions, the value comes back as 3: document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes[0].nodeType  In NN6 and IE5 Mac, you can inspect the nodeType of the one attribute of this  element  the ID attribute : document.getElementById “myP” .attributes[0].nodeType  With NN6 and IE5 Mac, you can see how the document object returns a  When IE5 does not support a nodeType constant for a node, its value is sometimes  reported as 1.

The nodeValue is converted to an integer  for NN6’s string values  before performing the math and reassignment: function widenCols textareaElem  {  var colWidth = parseInt textareaElem.attributes[“cols”].nodeValue, 10  textareaElem.attributes[“cols”].nodeValue =  colWidth * 1.1   elementObject.nodeValue   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 32  32  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The second example replaces the text of an element, assuming that the element  contains no further nested elements: function replaceText elem, newText  {  if  elem.childNodes.length == 1 && elem.firstChild.nodeType == 3  {  elem.firstChild.nodeValue = newText  }  }  The function builds in one final verification that the element contains just one child  node and that it is a text type. An alternative version of the assignment statement of the second example uses the innerText property in IE with identical results: elem.innerText = newText  offsetHeight offsetWidth  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  With IE4+, you can substitute the offsetHeight and offsetWidth properties  for clientHeight and clientWidth in Listing 15-6. The reason is that the two elements in question have their widths hard-wired in style sheets. Thus, the offsetWidth property follows that lead rather than observing the default width of the parent  BODY  element.  With IE5+ and NN6, you can use The Evaluator to inspect the offsetHeight and  offsetWidth property values of various objects on the page. Enter the following statements into the top text box: document.getElementById “myP” .offsetWidth document.getElementById “myEM” .offsetWidth document.getElementById “myP” .offsetHeight document.getElementById “myTable” .offsetWidth  offsetLeft offsetTop  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   elementObject.offsetLeft   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 33  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   33  Example  The following IE script statements utilize all four “offset” dimensional properties  to size and position a DIV element so that it completely covers a SPAN element located within a P element. This can be for a fill-in-the-blank quiz that provides text entry fields elsewhere on the page. As the user gets an answer correct, the blocking DIV element is hidden to reveal the correct answer. document.all.blocker.style.pixelLeft = document.all.span2.offsetLeft document.all.blocker.style.pixelTop = document.all.span2.offsetTop document.all.blockImg.height = document.all.span2.offsetHeight document.all.blockImg.width = document.all.span2.offsetWidth  Because the offsetParent property for the SPAN element is the BODY element,  the positioned DIV element can use the same positioning context  it’s the default context, anyway  for setting the pixelLeft and pixelTop style properties.  Remember that positioning properties belong to an element’s style object.  The offsetHeight and offsetWidth properties can read the dimensions of the SPAN element  the example has no borders, margins, or padding to worry about  and assign them to the dimensions of the image contained by the blocker DIV element. This example is also a bit hazardous in some implementations. If the text of span2 wraps to a new line, the new offsetHeight value has enough pixels to accommodate both lines. But the blockImg and blocker DIV elements are block-level elements that render as a simple rectangle. In other words, the blocker element doesn’t turn into two separate strips to cover the pieces of span2 that spread across two lines.  offsetParent  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  You can use the offsetParent property to help you locate the position of a  nested element on the page. Listing 15-12 demonstrates how a script can “walk” up the hierarchy of offsetParent objects in IE for Windows to assemble the location of a nested element on a page. The goal of the exercise in Listing 15-12 is to position an image at the upper-left corner of the second table cell. The entire table is centered on the page.  The onLoad event handler invokes the setImagePosition   function. The  function first sets a Boolean flag that determines whether the calculations should be based on the client or offset sets of properties. IE4 Windows and IE5 Mac rely on client properties, while IE5+ Windows works with the offset properties. The discrepancies even out, however, with the while loop. This loop traverses the offsetParent hierarchy starting with the offsetParent of the cell out to, but not including, the document.body object. The body object is not included because that is the positioning context for the image. In IE5, the while loop executes only once  elementObject.offsetParent   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 34  34  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  because just the TABLE element exists between the cell and the body; in IE4, the loop executes twice to account for the TR and TABLE elements up the hierarchy. Finally, the cumulative values of left and top measures are applied to the positioning properties of the DIV object’s style and the image is made visible.  Listing 15-12: Using the offsetParent Property    cElement.offsetParent.tagName == “TR”  ? false : true  : false       offsetParent Property    function setImagePosition  {  var cElement = document.all.myCell    Set flag for whether calculations should use    client- or offset- property measures. Use    client- for IE5 Mac and IE4 Windows; otherwise    use offset- properties. An ugly, but necessary    workaround. var useClient =  cElement.offsetTop == 0  ?   if  useClient  {  var x = cElement.clientLeft var y = cElement.clientTop  } else {  var x = cElement.offsetLeft var y = cElement.offsetTop  } var pElement = document.all.myCell.offsetParent while  pElement != document.body  {  if  useClient  {  x += pElement.clientLeft y += pElement.clientTop  } else {  x += pElement.offsetLeft y += pElement.offsetTop  } pElement = pElement.offsetParent  } document.all.myDIV.style.pixelLeft = x document.all.myDIV.style.pixelTop = y document.all.myDIV.style.visibility = “visible”  }            The offsetParent Property     After the document loads, the script positions a small image in the upper left corner of the second table cell.     elementObject.offsetParent   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 35  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   35      This is the first cell   This is the second cell.       <DIV ID=”myDIV” STYLE=”position:absolute; visibility:hidden; height:12; width:12”>         outerHTML outerText  Compatibility  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   The page generated by Listing 15-13  IE4+ Windows only  contains an H1 element  label and a paragraph of text. The purpose is to demonstrate how the outerHTML and outerText properties differ in their intent. Two text boxes contain the same combination of text and HTML tags that replaces the element that creates the paragraph’s label.  If you apply the default content of the first text box to the outerHTML property of the label1 object, the H1 element is replaced by a SPAN element whose CLASS attribute acquires a different style sheet rule defined earlier in the document. Notice that the ID of the new SPAN element is the same as the original H1 element. This allows the script attached to the second button to address the object. But this second script replaces the element with the raw text  including tags . The element is now gone, and any attempt to change the outerHTML or outerText properties of the label1 object causes an error because there is no longer a label1 object in the document.  Use this laboratory to experiment with some other content in both text boxes.

NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   parentTextEdit  Compatibility  Example  The page resulting from Listing 15-14 contains a paragraph of Greek text and  three radio buttons that select the size of a paragraph chunk: one character, one word, or one sentence. If you click anywhere within the large paragraph, the onClick event handler invokes the selectChunk   function. The function first examines which of the radio buttons is selected to determine how much of the paragraph to highlight  select  around the point at which the user clicks.  After the script employs the parentTextEdit property to test whether the  clicked element has a valid parent capable of creating a text range, it calls upon the property again to help create the text range. From there, TextRange object methods shrink the range to a single insertion point, move that point to the spot nearest the cursor location at click time, expand the selection to encompass the desired chunk, and select that bit of text.  Notice one workaround for the TextRange object’s expand   method anomaly: If  you specify a sentence, IE doesn’t treat the beginning of a P element as the starting end of a sentence automatically. A camouflaged  white text color  period is appended to the end of the previous element to force the TextRange object to expand only to the beginning of the first sentence of the targeted P element.  elementObject.parentTextEdit   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 39  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   39  Listing 15-14: Using the parentTextEdit Property       parentTextEdit Property    P {cursor:hand}     function selectChunk   {  var chunk, range for  var i = 0; i < document.forms[0].chunk.length; i++  {  if  document.forms[0].chunk[i].checked  {  chunk = document.forms[0].chunk[i].value break      }  } var x = window.event.clientX var y = window.event.clientY if  window.event.srcElement.parentTextEdit  {  range = window.event.srcElement.parentTextEdit.createTextRange   range.collapse   range.moveToPoint x, y  range.expand chunk  range.select    }  }           Choose how much of the paragraph is to be selected when you click anywhere in it:   Character  Word  Sentence  .

Putting this fragment into a document that is accessible across a slow network  helps. If the image is not in the browser’s cache, you might get the uninitialized or loading result. The former means that the IMG object exists, but it has not started receiving the image data from the server yet.

The data  source is a small, tab-delimited file consisting of 20 records of Academy Award data. Thus, the table that displays a subset of the fields is bound to the data source object. Also bound to the data source object are three SPAN objects embedded within a paragraph near the top of the page. As the user clicks a row of data, three fields from that clicked record are placed into the bound SPAN objects.  The script part of this page is a mere single statement. When the user triggers the onClick event handler of the repeated TR object, the function receives a reference to the TR object as a parameter. The data store object maintains an internal copy of the data in a recordset object. One of the properties of this recordset object is  elementObject.recordNumber   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 41  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   41  the AbsolutePosition property, which is the integer value of the current record that the data object points to  it can point to only one row at a time, and the default row is the first row . The statement sets the AbsolutePosition property of the recordset object to the recordNumber property for the row that the user clicks. Because the three SPAN elements are bound to the same data source, they are immediately updated to reflect the change to the data object’s internal pointer to the current record. Notice, too, that the third SPAN object is bound to one of the data source fields not shown in the table. You can reach any field of a record because the Data Source Object holds the entire data source content.

Now assign a color to the style property via the upper text box: document.all.myEM.style.color = “red”  If you now type the two earlier statements into the upper box, you can see that  the style object reflects the change, while the runtimeStyle object still holds onto its original  empty  value.  scopeName  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   elementObject.scopeName   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 43  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   43  Example  If you have a sample document that contains XML and a namespace spec, you  can use document.write   or alert   methods to view the value of the scopeName property.

To begin, enter the following into the bottom one-line text field to list the properties of the body object: document.body  This displays a long list of properties for the body object. Now enter the follow-  ing property expression in the top one-line text field to see the scrollHeight prop- erty of the output TEXTAREA when it holds the dozens of lines of property listings: document.all.output.scrollHeight  The result, some number probably in the hundreds, is now displayed in the output  TEXTAREA. This means that you can scroll the content of the output element vertically to reveal that number of pixels. Click the Evaluate button once more. The result, 13 or 14, is a measure of the scrollHeight property of the TEXTAREA that had only the previous result in it. The scrollable height of that content was only 13 or 14 pixels, the height of the font in the TEXTAREA. The scrollWidth property of the output TEXTAREA is fixed by the width assigned to the element’s COLS attribute  as calculated by the browser to determine how wide to make the textarea on the page .  scrollLeft scrollTop  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   elementObject.scrollLeft   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 44  44  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment with these two properties of the TEXTAREA object, which displays the output of evaluations and property listings. To begin, enter the following into the bottom one-line text field to list the properties of the body object: document.body  This displays a long list of properties for the body object. Use the TEXTAREA’s  scrollbar to page down a couple of times. Now enter the following property expres- sion in the top one-line text field to see the scrollTop property of the output TEXTAREA after you scroll: document.all.output.scrollTop  The result, some number, is now displayed in the output TEXTAREA. This means  that the content of the output element was scrolled vertically. Click the Evaluate button once more. The result, 0, is a measure of the scrollTop property of the TEXTAREA that had only the previous result in it. There wasn’t enough content in the TEXTAREA to scroll, so the content was not scrolled at all. The scrollTop property, therefore, is zero. The scrollLeft property of the output is always zero because the TEXTAREA element is set to wrap any text that overflows the width of the element. No horizontal scrollbar appears in this case, and the scrollLeft property never changes.

To that end, you can use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment in IE4+ with the values that the sourceIndex property returns to see how the index values of the document.all collection follow the source code.  To begin, reload The Evaluator. Enter the following statement in the top text box  to set a preinitialized global variable: a = 0  When you evaluate this expression, a zero should appear in the Results box.  Next, enter the following statement into the top text box: document.all[a].tagName + “ [“ + a++ + “]”  There are a lot of plus signs in this statement, so be sure you enter it correctly. As  you successively evaluate this statement  by repeatedly clicking the Evaluate but- ton , the global variable  a  is incremented, thus enabling you to “walk through” the  elementObject.sourceIndex   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 45  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   45  elements in source code order. The sourceIndex value for each HTML tag appears in square brackets in the Results box. You generally begin with the following sequence: HTML [0] HEAD [1] TITLE [2]  You can continue until there are no more elements, at which point an error message appears because the value of a exceeds the number of elements in the document.all array. Compare your findings against the HTML source code view of The Evaluator.

To begin, enter the following statement into the lower, one-line text box to inspect the style property for the document.body object: document.body.style  Now inspect the style property of the table element that is part of the original  version of The Evaluator. Enter the following statement into the lower text box: document.getElementById “myTable” .style In both cases, the values assigned to the style object’s properties are quite limited by default. tabIndex  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The HTML and scripting in Listing 15-16 demonstrate not only the way you can  modify the tabbing behavior of a form on the fly, but also how to force form ele- ments out of the tabbing sequence entirely in IE. In this page, the upper form  named lab  contains four elements. Scripts invoked by buttons in the lower form control the tabbing sequence. Notice that the TABINDEX attributes of all lower form elements are set to -1, which means that these control buttons are not part of the tabbing sequence in IE.  elementObject.tabIndex   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 46  46  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  When you load the page, the default tabbing order for the lab form control ele- ments  default setting of zero  takes charge. If you start pressing the Tab key, the precise results at first depend on the browser you use. In IE, the Address field is first selected; next the Tab sequence gives focus to the window  or frame, if this page were in a frameset ; finally the tabbing reaches the lab form. Continue press- ing the Tab key and watch how the browser assigns focus to each of the element types. In NN6, however, you must click anywhere on the content to get the Tab key to start working on form controls.  The sample script inverts the tabbing sequence with the help of a for loop that initializes two variables that work in opposite directions as the looping progresses. This gives the last element the lowest tabIndex value. The skip2   function sim- ply sets the tabIndex property of the second text box to -1, removing it from the tabbing entirely  IE only . Notice, however, that you can click in the field and still enter text.  See the disabled property earlier in this chapter to see how to prevent field editing.  NN6 does not provide a tabIndex property setting that forces the browser to skip over a form control. You should disable the control instead.  Listing 15-16: Controlling the tabIndex Property       tabIndex Property    function invert   {  var form = document.lab for  var i = 0, j = form.elements.length; i < form.elements.length;  i++, j--  {  form.elements[i].tabIndex = j  function skip2   {  document.lab.text2.tabIndex = -1  function resetTab   {  var form = document.lab for  var i = 0; i < form.elements.length; i++  {  form.elements[i].tabIndex = 0  }  }  }  }  }         tabIndex Property Lab      Text box no. 1:    Text box no. 2:        elementObject.tabIndex   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 47  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   47   And a checkbox       <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Invert Tabbing Order” TABINDEX=-1 onClick=”invert  ”>  <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Skip Text box no. 2  IE Only ” TABINDEX=-1  onClick=”skip2  ”>  <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Reset to Normal Order” TABINDEX=-1 onClick=”resetTab  ”>        The final function, resetTab  , sets the tabIndex property value to zero for all lab form elements. This restores the default order; but in IE5.5 Windows, you may experience buggy behavior that prevents you from tabbing to items after you reset them. Only the reloading of the page provides a complete restoration of default behavior. tagName  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   You can see the tagName property in action for the example associated with the sourceIndex property discussed earlier.

A simple paragraph ele-  ment has its TITLE attribute set to “First Time!”, which is what the tooltip dis- plays if you roll the pointer atop the paragraph and pause after the page loads. But an onMouseOver event handler for that element increments a global variable counter in the script, and the title property of the paragraph object is modified with each mouseover action. The count value is made part of a string assigned to the title property. Notice that there is not a live connection between the title property and the variable; instead, the new value explicitly sets the title property.

After you enter some text into the text box and click the button, the addRow   function appends a row to the table. The left column displays the identifier generated via the table row object’s uniqueID property. IE5+ generates identifiers in the format “ms__idn”, where n is an integer starting with zero for the current browser session. Because the addRow   function assigns uniqueID values to the row and the cells in each row, the integer for each row is three greater than the previous one. There is no guarantee that future gener- ations of the browser will follow this format, so do not rely on the format or sequence in your scripts.

Its purpose is to turn the color style property of an object to either a   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 51  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   51  default color  “red”  or any other color that is passed to the component. For details on the syntax of the   tags, see Chapter 48 of the JavaScript Bible. The code presented here helps you see how the page and scripts in Listing 15-19b work.  Listing 15-19a: The makeHot.htc Behavior Component            var oldColor var hotColor = “red”  function setHotColor color  {  hotColor = color  function makeHot   {  if  event.srcElement == element  {  oldColor = style.color runtimeStyle.color = hotColor  function makeNormal   {  if  event.srcElement == element  {  runtimeStyle.color = oldColor      }  }  }  }  }    The object to which the component is attached is a simple paragraph object,  shown in Listing 15-19b. When the page loads, the behavior is not attached, so clicking the paragraph text has no effect.  When you turn on the behavior by invoking the turnOn   function, the  addBehavior   method attaches the code of the makeHot.htc component to the myP object. At this point, the myP object has one more property, one more method, and two more event handlers that are written to be made public by the component’s code. If you want the behavior to apply to more than one paragraph in the document, you have to invoke the addBehavior   method for each paragraph object.  After the behavior file is instructed to start loading, the setInitialColor   func- tion is called to set the new color property of the paragraph to the user’s choice from the SELECT list. But this can happen only if the component is fully loaded. Therefore, the function checks the readyState property of myP for completeness before invok- ing the component’s function. If IE is still loading the component, the function is invoked again in 500 milliseconds.  elementObject.addBehavior     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 52  52  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  As long as the behavior is loaded, you can change the color used to turn the  paragraph “hot.” The function first ensures that the component is loaded by check- ing that the object has the new color property. If it does, then  as a demonstration of how to expose and invoke a component method  the method of the component is invoked. You can also simply set the property value.

Notice that the removeBehavior   method is associated with the myP object, and the parame- ter is the ID of the behavior added earlier. If you associate multiple behaviors with an object, you can remove one without disturbing the others because each has its own unique ID.  addEventListener “eventType”, listenerFunc, useCapture  removeEventListener “eventType”, listenerFunc, useCapture   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  Listing 15-20 provides a compact workbench to explore and experiment with the  basic W3C DOM event model.

The page includes a simple, two-item list. A form enables you to add items to the end of the list or replace the last item with a different entry.  elementObject.appendChild     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 56  56  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The append   function creates a new LI element and then uses the  appendChild   method to attach the text box text as the displayed text for the item. The nested expression, document.createTextNode form.input.value , evaluates to a legitimate node that is appended to the new LI item. All of this occurs before the new LI item is added to the document. In the final statement of the func- tion, appendChild   is invoked from the vantage point of the UL element — thus adding the LI element as a child node of the UL element.  Invoking the replaceChild   method in the replace   function utilizes some  of the same code. The main difference is that the replaceChild   method requires a second parameter: a reference to the child element to be replaced. This demon- stration replaces the final child node of the UL list, so the function takes advantage of the lastChild property of all elements to get a reference to that final nested child. That reference becomes the second parameter to replaceChild  .  Listing 15-21: Various Child Methods       appendChild  , removeChild  , and replaceChild   Methods    function append form  {  if  form.input.value  {  var newItem = document.createElement “LI”  newItem.appendChild document.createTextNode form.input.value   document.getElementById “myUL” .appendChild newItem   function replace form  {  if  form.input.value  {  var newItem = document.createElement “LI”  var lastChild = document.getElementById “myUL” .lastChild newItem.appendChild document.createTextNode form.input.value   document.getElementById “myUL” .replaceChild newItem, lastChild   }  }  }  }  }  function restore   {  var oneChild var mainObj = document.getElementById “myUL”  while  mainObj.childNodes.length > 2  {  oneChild = mainObj.lastChild mainObj.removeChild oneChild   }        Child Methods    Here is a list of items:   First Item  elementObject.appendChild     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 57  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   57   Second Item     Enter some text to add replace in the list:               The final part of the demonstration uses the removeChild   method to peel  away all children of the UL element until just the two original items are left standing. Again, the lastChild property comes in handy as the restore   function keeps removing the last child until only two remain. Upon restoring the list, IE5 Mac fails to render the list bullets; but in the browser’s object model, the UL element still exists.  applyElement elementObject[, type]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  To help you visualize the impact of the applyElement   method with its differ-  ent parameter settings, Listing 15-22 enables you to apply a new element  an EM element  to a SPAN element inside a paragraph. At any time, you can view the HTML of the entire P element to see where the EM element is applied, as well as its impact on the element containment hierarchy for the paragraph.  After you load the page, inspect the HTML for the paragraph before doing any- thing else. Notice the SPAN element and its nested FONT element, both of which surround the one-word content. If you apply the EM element inside the SPAN ele- ment  click the middle button , the SPAN element’s first  and only  child element becomes the EM element; the FONT element is now a child of the new EM element.

From each window, you can bring the other window to the front. The main window uses the object returned by window.open   to assemble the refer- ence to the new window. In the subwindow  whose content is created entirely on the fly by JavaScript , self.opener is summoned to refer to the original window, while self.blur   operates on the subwindow itself  except for the buggy behav- ior of NN6 noted earlier . Blurring one window and focusing on another window yields the same result of sending the window to the back of the pile.   Listing 15-23: The window.focus   and window.blur    Methods       Window Focus   and Blur         declare global variable name var newWindow = null function makeNewWindow   {     check if window already exists if  !newWindow  newWindow.closed  {     store new window object in global variable  Continued  elementObject.blur     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 60  60  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 15-23  continued   newWindow = window.open “”,””,”width=250,height=250”     pause briefly to let IE3 window finish opening setTimeout “fillWindow  ”,100      window already exists, so bring it forward newWindow.focus    } else {  }  }    assemble new content and write to subwindow function fillWindow   {  var newContent = “   Another Subwindow  ” newContent += “ ” newContent += “ A Salmon-Colored Subwindow. ” newContent += “ <INPUT TYPE=’button’ VALUE=’Bring Main to Front’  onClick=’self.opener.focus  ’>”     the following button doesn’t work in NN6 newContent += “ <INPUT TYPE=’button’ VALUE=’Put Me in Back’  onClick=’self.blur  ’>”  newContent += “   ”    write HTML to new window document newWindow.document.write newContent  newWindow.document.close    }        Window focus   and blur   Methods      <INPUT TYPE=”button” NAME=”newOne” VALUE=”Show New Window” onClick=”makeNewWindow  ”>        A key ingredient to the success of the makeNewWindow   function in Listing 15-23  is the first conditional expression. Because newWind is initialized as a null value when the page loads, that is its value the first time through the function. But after you open the subwindow the first time, newWind is assigned a value  the subwin- dow object  that remains intact even if the user closes the window. Thus, the value doesn’t revert to null by itself. To catch the possibility that the user has closed the window, the conditional expression also sees if the window is closed. If it is, a new subwindow is generated, and that new window’s reference value is reassigned to the newWind variable. On the other hand, if the window reference exists and the window is not closed, the focus   method brings that subwindow to the front. You can see the focus   method for a text object in action in JavaScript Bible Chapter 25’s description of the select   method for text objects.  elementObject.blur     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 61  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   61  clearAttributes    Compatibility  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to examine the attributes  of an element before and after you apply clearAttributes  . To begin, display the HTML for the table element on the page by entering the following statement into the upper text field: myTable.outerHTML  Notice the attributes associated with the   tag. Look at the rendered table to see how attributes such as BORDER and WIDTH affect the display of the table. Now, enter the following statement in the top text box to remove all remov- able attributes from this element: myTable.clearAttributes    First, look at the table. The border is gone, and the table is rendered only as wide  as is necessary to display the content with no cell padding. Lastly, view the results of the clearAttributes   method in the outerHTML of the table again: myTable.outerHTML  The source code file has not changed, but the object model in the browser’s mem- ory reflects the changes you made.

The page includes various types of buttons at the bottom. You can “click” the checkbox, for example, by entering the following statement in the topmost text field: document.myForm2.myCheckbox.click    If you use a recent browser version, you most likely can see the checkbox change states between checked and unchecked each time you execute the statement.  elementObject.click     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 62  62  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  cloneNode deepBoolean   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to clone, rename, and append an element found in The Evaluator’s source code. Begin by cloning the paragraph element named myP along with all of its content. Enter the following statement into the topmost text field: a = document.getElementById “myP” .cloneNode true  The variable a now holds the clone of the original node, so you can change its ID attribute at this point by entering the following statement: a.setAttribute “ID”, “Dolly”   If you want to see the properties of the cloned node, enter a into the lower text field. The precise listing of properties you see depends on whether you use NN or IE; in either case, you should be able to locate the id property, whose value is now Dolly.  As a final step, append this newly named node to the end of the body element by  entering the following statement into the topmost text field: document.body.appendChild a   You can now scroll down to the bottom of the page and see a duplicate of the con- tent. But because the two nodes have different ID attributes, they cannot confuse scripts that need to address one or the other.  componentFromPoint x,y   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  You can experiment with this method in the code supplied with Listing 15-24. As  presented, the method is associated with a TEXTAREA object that is specifically sized to display both vertical and horizontal scrollbars. As you click various areas of the TEXTAREA and the rest of the page, the status bar displays information about the location of the event with the help of the componentFromPoint   method. The script utilizes a combination of the event.srcElement property and the  componentFromPoint   method to help you distinguish how you can use each one  elementObject.componentFromPoint     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 63  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   63  for different types of event processing. The srcElement property is used initially as a filter to decide whether the status bar will reveal further processing about the TEXTAREA element’s event details.  The onMouseDown event handler in the BODY element triggers all event process- ing. IE events bubble up the hierarchy  and no events are cancelled in this page , so all mouseDown events eventually reach the BODY element. Then, the whereInWorld   function can compare each mouseDown event from any element against the textarea’s geography.  Listing 15-24: Using the componentFromPoint   Method       componentFromPoint   Method    function whereInWorld elem  {  var x = event.clientX var y = event.clientY var component = document.all.myTextarea.componentFromPoint x,y  if  window.event.srcElement == document.all.myTextarea  {  if  component == “”  {  status = “mouseDown event occurred inside the element”  status = “mouseDown occurred on the element\’s “ + component  status = “mouseDown occurred “ + component + “ of the element”  }        componentFromPoint   Method     Tracking the mouseDown event relative to the textarea object.

The behavior is identical to that of Listing 15-26, which demonstrates the IE5.5 equivalent: fireEvent  . This example does not perform all intended actions in the first release of NN6 because the browser does not fully implement the document.createEvent   method. The example is designed to operate more com- pletely in a future version that supports event generation.

Three nested element objects are assigned separate onClick event handlers  via the init   function invoked after the page loads — although you can also set these event handlers via onClick attributes in the tags . Each handler displays an alert whose content reveals which object’s event handler was triggered and the tag name and ID of the object that received the event. The default behavior of the page is to allow event bubbling, but a checkbox enables you to turn off bubbling.  After you load the page, click the italic segment  a nested SPAN element  to  receive a series of three alert boxes. The first advises you that the SPAN element’s onClick event handler is processing the event and that the SPAN element  whose ID  elementObject.fireEvent     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 67  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   67  is mySPAN  is, indeed, the source element of the event. Because event bubbling is enabled by default, the event bubbles upward to the SPAN element’s next outermost container: the myP paragraph element.  However, mySPAN is still the source element.  Finally, the event reaches the BODY element. If you click in the H1 element at the top of the page, the event is not processed until it reaches the BODY element — although the H1 element is the source element because that’s what you clicked. In all cases, when you explicitly click something to generate the onclick event, the event’s  button property shows zero to signify the primary mouse button in IE.  Now onto the real purpose of this example: the fireEvent   method. Three but- tons enable you to direct a click event to each of the three elements that have event handlers defined for them. The events fired this way are artificial, generated via the createEventObject   method. For demonstration purposes, the button property of these scripted events is set to 3. This property value is assigned to the event object that eventually gets directed to an element. With event bubbling left on, the events sent via fireEvent   behave just like the physical clicks on the elements. Similarly, if you disable event bubbling, the first event handler to process the event cancels bubbling, and no further processing of that event occurs. Notice that event bubbling is cancelled within the event handlers that process the event. To prevent the clicks of the checkbox and action buttons from triggering the BODY element’s onClick event handlers, event bubbling is turned off for the buttons right away.  Listing 15-26: Using the fireEvent   Method        mySPAN {font-style:italic}        assemble a couple event object properties function getEventProps   {  var msg = “” var elem = event.srcElement msg += “event.srcElement.tagName: “ + elem.tagName + “\n” msg += “event.srcElement.id: “ + elem.id + “\n” msg += “event button: “ + event.button return msg  }     onClick event handlers for body, myP, and mySPAN function bodyClick   {  var msg = “Click event processed in BODY\n\n” msg += getEventProps   alert msg  checkCancelBubble    } function pClick   {  var msg = “Click event processed in P\n\n” msg += getEventProps   alert msg   Continued  elementObject.fireEvent     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 68  68  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 15-26  continued   checkCancelBubble    } function spanClick   {  var msg = “Click event processed in SPAN\n\n” msg += getEventProps   alert msg  checkCancelBubble    }  }  }     cancel event bubbling if check box is checked function checkCancelBubble   {  event.cancelBubble = document.controls.bubbleOn.checked     assign onClick event handlers to three elements function init   {  document.body.onclick = bodyClick document.all.myP.onclick = pClick document.all.mySPAN.onclick = spanClick     invoke fireEvent   on object whose ID is passed as parameter function doFire objID  {  var newEvt = document.createEventObject   newEvt.button = 3 document.all objID .fireEvent “onclick”, newEvt     don’t let button clicks bubble event.cancelBubble = true  }        fireEvent   Method     This is a paragraph   with a nested SPAN   that receives click events.

The afterBegin version returns the text frag- ment of the myP element up to, but not including, the EM element nested inside. The beforeEnd string picks up after the end of the nested EM element and returns all text to the end of myP.  Now, see what happens with the nested myEM element:  document.all.myEM.getAdjacentText “beforeBegin”  document.all.myEM.getAdjacentText “afterBegin”  document.all.myEM.getAdjacentText “beforeEnd”  document.all.myEM.getAdjacentText “afterEnd”  Because this element has no nested elements, the afterBegin and beforeEnd strings are identical: the same value as the innerText property of the element.  getAttribute “attributeName” [, caseSensitivity]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment with the  getAttribute   method for the elements in the page.

The Results TEXTAREA element provides several attributes to check out. Because the method returns an object, enter the fol- lowing statements into the bottom text field so you can view the properties of the attribute node object returned by the method: document.getElementById “output” .getAttributeNode “COLS”  document.getElementById “output” .getAttributeNode “ROWS”  document.getElementById “output” .getAttributeNode “wrap”  document.getElementById “output” .getAttributeNode “style”   All  except the last  statements display a list of properties for each attribute  node object. The last statement, however, returns nothing because the STYLE attribute is not specified for the element. getBoundingClientRect    NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Listing 15-27 employs both the getBoundingClientRect   and  getClientRects   methods in a demonstration of how they differ. A set of ele- ments is grouped within a SPAN element named main. The group consists of two paragraphs and an unordered list.  elementObject.getBoundingClientRect     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 71  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   71  Two controls enable you to set the position of an underlying highlight rectangle  to any line of your choice. A checkbox enables you to set whether the highlight rectangle should be only as wide as the line or the full width of the bounding rect- angle for the entire SPAN element.  All the code is located in the hilite   function. The SELECT and checkbox ele- ments invoke this function. Early in the function, the getClientRects   method is invoked for the main element to capture a snapshot of all TextRectangles for the entire element. This array comes in handy when the script needs to get the coordi- nates of a rectangle for a single line, as chosen in the SELECT element.  Whenever the user chooses a number from the SELECT list and the value is less  than the total number of TextRectangle objects in clientRects, the function begins calculating the size and location of the underlying yellow highlighter. When the Full Width checkbox is checked, the left and right coordinates are obtained from the getBoundingClientRect   method because the entire SPAN element’s rectangle is the space you’re interested in; otherwise, you pull the left and right properties from the chosen rectangle in the clientRects array.  Next comes the assignment of location and dimension values to the hiliter  object’s style property. The top and bottom are always pegged to whatever line is selected, so the clientRects array is polled for the chosen entry’s top and bottom properties. The previously calculated left value is assigned to the hiliter object’s pixelLeft property, while the width is calculated by subtracting the left from the right coordinates. Notice that the top and left coordinates also take into account any vertical or horizontal scrolling of the entire body of the document. If you resize the window to a smaller size, line wrapping throws off the original line count. However, an invocation of hilite   from the onResize event handler applies the currently chosen line number to whatever content falls in that line after resizing.

If you enter the following statement into the topmost text box: document.getElementById “myP” .hasChildNodes   the returned value is true. You can find out how many nodes there are by getting the length of the childNodes array: document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes.length  This expression reveals a total of three nodes: the two text nodes and the EM ele-  ment between them. Check out whether the first text node has any children: document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes[0].hasChildNodes    The response is false because text fragments do not have any nested nodes.  But check out the EM element, which is the second child node of the myP element: document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes[1].hasChildNodes    The answer is true because the EM element has a text fragment node nested  within it. Sure enough, the statement document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes[1].childNodes.length yields a node count of 1. You can also go directly to the EM element in your  references: document.getElementById “myEM” .hasChildNodes   document.getElementById “myEM” .childNodes.length  elementObject.hasChildNodes     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 75  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   75  If you want to see the properties of the text fragment node inside the EM ele-  ment, enter the following into the lower text box: document.getElementById “myEM” .childNodes[0] You can see that the data and nodeValue properties for the text fragment return the text “all”.  insertAdjacentElement “location”, elementObject   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in JavaScript Bible  to experiment with the  insertAdjacentElement   method. The goal of the experiment is to insert a new H1 element above the myP element.  All actions require you to enter a sequence of statements in the topmost text  box. Begin by storing a new element in the global variable a: a = document.createElement “H1”   Give the new object some text: a.innerText = “New Header” Now, insert this element before the start of the myP object: myP.insertAdjacentElement “beforeBegin”, a   Notice that you have not assigned an id property value to the new element. But because the element was inserted by reference, you can modify the inserted object by changing the object stored in the a variable: a.style.color = “red”  The inserted element is also part of the document hierarchy, so you can access it through hierarchy references such as myP.previousSibling.  The parent element of the newly inserted element is the BODY. Thus, you can  inspect the current state of the HTML for the rendered page by entering the follow- ing statement into the topmost text box: document.body.innerHTML If you scroll down past the first form, you can find the   element that you added along with the STYLE attribute.  elementObject.insertAdjacentElement     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 76  76  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  insertAdjacentHTML “location”, “HTMLtext”  insertAdjacentText “location”, “text”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment with these two methods. The example here demonstrates the result of employing both meth- ods in an attempt to add some HTML to the beginning of the myP element.  Begin by assigning a string of HTML code to the global variable a:  a = “ Important News! ” Because this HTML is to go on the same line as the start of the myP paragraph, use the afterBegin parameter for the insert method: myP.insertAdjacentHTML “afterBegin”, a   Notice that there is no space after the exclamation mark of the inserted HTML.  But to prove that the inserted HTML is genuinely part of the document’s object model, you can now insert the text of a space after the B element whose ID is myB: myB.insertAdjacentText “afterEnd”, “ “   Each time you evaluate the preceding statement  by repeatedly clicking the  Evaluate button or pressing Enter with the cursor in the topmost field , an addi- tional space is added.  You should also see what happens when the string to be inserted with  insertAdjacentText   contains HTML tags. Reload The Evaluator and enter the following two statements into the topmost field, evaluating each one in turn: a = “ Important News! ” myP.insertAdjacentText “afterBegin”, a   The HTML is not interpreted but is displayed as plain text. There is no object  named myB after executing this latest insert method.  insertBefore newChildNodeObject[, referenceChildNode]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   elementObject.insertBefore     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 77  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   77  Example  Listing 15-28 demonstrates how the insertBefore   method can insert child elements  LI  inside a parent  OL  at different locations, depending on the second parameter. A text box enables you to enter your choice of text and or HTML for insertion at various locations within the OL element. If you don’t specify a position, the second parameter of insertBefore   is passed as null — meaning that the new child node is added to the end of the existing children. But choose a spot from the select list where you want to insert the new item. The value of each SELECT list option is an index of one of the first three child nodes of the OL element.

So you can see the results as you go, I display the HTML for each input field in the field.  The doMerge   function begins by generating two new elements: a P and an  INPUT element. Because these newly created elements have no properties associ- ated with them, a unique ID is assigned to the INPUT element via the uniqueID property. Attributes from the field in the source code  field1  are merged into the new INPUT element. Thus, all attributes except name and id are copied to the new element. The INPUT element is inserted into the P element, and the P element is  elementObject.mergeAttributes     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 79  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   79  appended to the document’s form element. Finally, the outerHTML of the new ele- ment is displayed in its field. Notice that except for the NAME and ID attributes, all others are copied. This includes style sheet attributes and event handlers. To prove that the event handler works in the new elements, you can add a space to any one of them and press Tab to trigger the onChange event handler that changes the con- tent to all uppercase characters.

The fol- lowing sequence adds a text node adjacent to one in the myP element. A subsequent invocation of the normalize   method removes the division between the adjacent text nodes.  Begin by confirming the number of child nodes of the myP element:  document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes.length  Three nodes initially inhabit the element. Next, create a text node and append it as the last child of the myP element: a = document.createTextNode “This means you!”  document.getElementById “myP” .appendChild a   With the new text now rendered on the page, the number of child nodes  increases to four: document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes.length You can see that the last child node of myP is the text node you just created: document.getElementById “myP” .lastChild.nodeValue But by invoking normalize   on myP, all adjacent text nodes are accumulated into single nodes: document.getElementById “myP” .normalize   You can now see that the myP element is back to three child nodes, and the last child is a combination of the two previously distinct, but adjacent, text nodes: document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes.length document.getElementById “myP” .lastChild.nodeValue  releaseCapture   setCapture containerBoolean   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Listing 15-30 demonstrates the usage of setCapture   and releaseCapture   in a “quick-and-dirty” context menu for IE5+ Windows. The job of the context menu is to present a list of numbering styles for the ordered list of items on the page. Whenever the user brings up the context menu atop the OL element, the custom context menu appears. Event capture is turned on in the process to prevent mouse actions elsewhere on the page from interrupting the context menu choice. Even a click on the link set up as the title of the list is inhibited while the context menu is visible. A click anywhere outside of the context menu hides the menu. Clicking a  elementObject.releaseCapture     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 81  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   81  choice in the menu changes the listStyleType property of the OL object and hides the menu. Whenever the context menu is hidden, event capture is turned off so that clicking on the page  such as the link  works as normal.  For this design, onClick, onMouseOver, and onMouseOut event handlers are  assigned to the DIV element that contains the context menu. To trigger the display of the context menu, the OL element has an onContextMenu event handler. This handler invokes the showContextMenu   function. In this function, event capture is assigned to the context menu DIV object. The DIV is also positioned at the location of the click before it is set to be visible. To prevent the system’s regular context menu from also appearing, the event object’s returnValue property is set to false. The context menu is shown activated in Figure 1-2.  Figure 1-2: Displaying a customized context menu  Now that all mouse events on the page go through the contextMenu DIV object,  let’s examine what happens with different kinds of events triggered by user action. As the user rolls the mouse, a flood of mouseover and mouseout events fire. The event handlers assigned to the DIV manage these events. But notice that the two event han- dlers, highlight   and unhighlight  , perform action only when the srcElement property of the event is one of the menu items in the DIV. Because the page has no other onMouseOver or onMouseOut event handlers defined for elements up the con- tainment hierarchy, you do not have to cancel event bubbling for these events.  When a user clicks the mouse button, different things happen depending on  whether event capture is enabled. Without event capture, the click event bubbles up from wherever it occurred to the onClick event handler in the BODY element.  An alert dialog box displays to let you know when the event reaches the BODY.  But with event capture turned on  the context menu is showing , the handleClick   event handler takes over to apply the desired choice whenever the click is atop one of the context menu items. For all click events handled by this function, the context menu is hidden and the click event is canceled from bub- bling up any higher  no alert dialog box appears . This takes place whether the user makes a choice in the context menu or clicks anywhere else on the page. In the latter case, all you need is for the context menu to go away like the real context menu does. For added insurance, the onLoseCapture event handler hides the con- text menu when a user performs any of the actions just listed that cancel capture.  elementObject.releaseCapture     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 82  82  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 15-30: Using setCapture   and releaseCapture        contextMenu {position:absolute; background-color:cfcfcf;   border-style:solid; border-width:1px;  border-color:EFEFEF 505050 505050 EFEFEF;  padding:3px 10px; font-size:8pt; font-family:Arial, Helvetica;  line-height:150%; visibility:hidden}  .menuItem {color:black} .menuItemOn {color:white} OL {list-style-position:inside; font-weight:bold; cursor:nw-resize} LI {font-weight:normal}     function showContextMenu   { contextMenu.setCapture   contextMenu.style.pixelTop = event.clientY + document.body.scrollTop contextMenu.style.pixelLeft = event.clientX + document.body.scrollLeft contextMenu.style.visibility = “visible” event.returnValue = false  }  }  }  }  }  function revert   {  document.releaseCapture   hideMenu    function hideMenu   {  contextMenu.style.visibility = “hidden”  function handleClick   {  var elem = window.event.srcElement if  elem.id.indexOf “menuItem”  == 0  {  shapesList.style.listStyleType = elem.LISTTYPE  } revert   event.cancelBubble = true  function highlight   {  var elem = event.srcElement if  elem.className == “menuItem”  {  elem.className = “menuItemOn”  }  function unhighlight   {  var elem = event.srcElement if  elem.className == “menuItemOn”  {  elementObject.releaseCapture     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 83  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   83  elem.className = “menuItem”  }  }        Three-Dimensional Shapes   Circular Cylinder   Cube   Rectangular Prism   Regular Right Pyramid   Right Circular Cone   Sphere     <DIV ID=”contextMenu” onLoseCapture=”hideMenu  ” onClick=”handleClick  ” onMouseOver=”highlight  ” onMouseOut=”unhighlight  ”> <SPAN ID=”menuItem1” CLASS=”menuItem” LISTTYPE=”upper- alpha”>A,B,C,...   <SPAN ID=”menuItem2” CLASS=”menuItem” LISTTYPE=”lower- alpha”>a,b,c,...   <SPAN ID=”menuItem3” CLASS=”menuItem” LISTTYPE=”upper- roman”>I,II,III,...   <SPAN ID=”menuItem4” CLASS=”menuItem” LISTTYPE=”lower- roman”>i,ii,iii,...    1,2,3,...          removeAttribute “attributeName” [, caseSensitivity]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment with the  removeAttribute   method for the elements in the page.

Due to the NN6 bug that won’t allow the method to return a reference to the  newly inserted attribute node, you can artificially obtain such a reference: b = document.getElementById “myP” .getAttributeNode “style”   Finally, use the reference to the newly added attribute to remove it from the   element: document.getElementById “myP” .removeAttribute b   Upon removing the attribute, the paragraph resumes its initial color.

The following sequence adds an expression to a style sheet property of the myP element on the page and then removes it.  To begin, enter the number 24 in the bottom one-line text box in The Evaluator  but don’t press Enter or click the List Properties button . This is the value used in the expression to govern the fontSize property of the myP object. Next, assign an expression to the myP object’s style object by entering the following statement into the topmost text box: myP.style.setExpression “fontSize”,”document.forms[0].inspector.value”,”JScript”   You can now enter different font sizes into the lower text box and have the val- ues immediately applied to the fontSize property.  Keyboard events in the text box automatically trigger the recalculation.  The default unit is px, but you can also append other units  such as pt  to the value in the text field to see how different measurement units influence the same numeric value.  Before proceeding to the next step, enter a value other than 16  the default  fontSize value . Finally, enter the following statement in the topmost text box to disconnect the expression from the property: myP.style.removeExpression “fontSize”   elementObject.removeExpression     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 86  86  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Notice that although you can no longer adjust the font size from the lower text  box, the most recent value assigned to it still sticks to the element.

Therefore,  you may need to supply a trailing space, as shown here, if the fragment you replace has a space. document.all.myP.replaceAdjacentText “beforeEnd”, “ good people.”   This is another way to replace the text fragment following the myEM element, but it is also relative to the surrounding myP element. If you now attempt to replace text after the end of the myP block-level element, document.all.myP.replaceAdjacentText “afterEnd”, “Hooray!”  the text fragment is inserted after the end of the myP element’s tag set. The fragment is just kind of floating in the document object model as an unlabeled text node. replaceChild newNodeObject, oldNodeObject   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   You can see an example of replaceChild   as part of Listing 15-21 earlier in  replaceNode “newNodeObject”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Example  this chapter.  Compatibility  Example  Listing 15-31 demonstrates three node-related methods: removeNode  ,  replaceNode  , and swapNode  . These methods work in IE5+ only.  The page rendered from Listing 15-31 begins with a UL type list of four items. Four  buttons control various aspects of the node structure of this list element. The first button invokes the replace   function, which changes the UL type to OL. To do this, the function must temporarily tuck away all child nodes of the original UL element so that they can be added back into the new OL element. At the same time, the old UL node is stored in a global variable  oldNode  for restoration in another function.  To replace the UL node with an OL, the replace   function creates a new, empty OL element and assigns the myOL ID to it. Next, the children  LI elements  are stored en masse as an array in the variable innards. The child nodes are then inserted into the empty OL element, using the insertBefore   method. Notice that as each child element from the innards array is inserted into the OL element, the child ele- ment is removed from the innards array. That’s why the loop to insert the child nodes is a while loop that constantly inserts the first item of the innards array to  elementObject.replaceNode     4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 88  88  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  the new element. Finally, the replaceNode   method puts the new node in the old node’s place, while the old node  just the UL element  is stored in oldNode.  The restore   function operates in the inverse direction of the replace    function. The same juggling of nested child nodes is required.  The third button invokes the swap   function, whose script exchanges the first and last nodes. The swapNode   method, like the others in this discussion, oper- ates from the point of view of the node. Therefore, the method is attached to one of the swapped nodes, while the other node is specified as a parameter. Because of the nature of the OL element, the number sequence remains fixed but the text of the LI node swaps.  To demonstrate the removeNode   method, the fourth function removes the last  child node of the list. Each call to removeNode   passes the true parameter to guarantee that the text nodes nested inside each LI node are also removed. Experiment with this method by setting the parameter to false  the default . Notice how the parent–child relationship changes when you remove the LI node.

Also, if you shrink the window and try to scroll the top of the table to the top of the window, be aware that the TABLE element contains a CAPTION element so the cap- tion is flush with the top of the window.

At the same time, the innerHTML of SPAN elements to the right of each bar display the current numeric value for the bar.  The dynamically calculated values in this example are based on the creation of a new date object over and over again to get the current time from the client com- puter clock. It is from the date object  stored in the variable called now  that the hour, minute, and second values are retrieved. Some other calculations are  involved so that a value for one of these time components is converted into a pixel value for the width of the bars. The bars are divided into 24  for the hours  and 60  for the minutes and seconds  parts, so the scale for the two types differs. For the 60-increment bars in this application, each increment is set to 5 pixels  stored in shortWidth ; the 24-increment bars are 2.5 times the shortWidth.  As the document loads, the three SPAN elements for the colored bars are given  no width, which means that they assume the default width of zero. But after the page loads, the onLoad event handler invokes the init   function, which sets the initial values for each bar’s width and the text  innerHTML  of the three labeled spans. Once these initial values are set, the init   function invokes the updateClock   function.  In the updateClock   function, a new date object is created for the current instant. The document.recalc   method is called, instructing the browser to recalculate the expressions that were set in the init   function and assign the new values to the properties. To keep the clock “ticking,” the setTimeout   method is set to invoke this same updateClock   function in one second.  To see what the getExpression   method does, you can click the button on the page. It simply displays the returned value for one of the attributes that you assign using setExpression  .

Enter the following statements one at a time into the upper text box and study the results: document.all.tags “DIV”  document.all.tags “DIV” .length myTable.all.tags “TD” .length  Because the tags   method returns an array of objects, you can use one of  those returned values as a valid element reference: document.all.tags “FORM” [1].elements.tags “INPUT” .length  urns “behaviorURN”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  In case the urns   method is reconnected in the future, you can add a button and function to Listing 15-19b that reveals whether the makeHot.htc behavior is attached to the myP element.

To begin, set the myP element so it can accept focus: myP.tabIndex = 1  If you repeatedly press the Tab key, the myP paragraph will eventually receive focus — indicated by the dotted rectangle around it. To see how you can prevent the element from losing focus, assign an anonymous function to the onBeforeDeactivate event handler, as shown in the following statement: myP.onbeforedeactivate = new Function “event.returnValue=false”   Now you can press Tab all you like or click other focusable elements all you like,  and the myP element will not lose focus until you reload the page  which clears away the event handler . Please do not do this on your pages unless you want to infuriate and alienate your site visitors.  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   onBeforeCopy  Compatibility  Example  You can use the onBeforeCopy event handler to preprocess information prior to  an actual copy action. In Listing 15-33, the function invoked by the second para- graph element’s onBeforeCopy event handler selects the entire paragraph so that the user can select any character s  in the paragraph to copy the entire paragraph into the clipboard. You can paste the results into the textarea to verify the opera- tion. By assigning the paragraph selection to the onBeforeCopy event handler, the page notifies the user about what the copy operation will entail prior to making the menu choice. Had the operation been deferred to the onCopy event handler, the selection would have been made after the user chose Copy from the menu.

You can try this by editing a copy of Listing 15-33, changing the onBeforeCopy event handler to onBeforeCut. Notice that in its original form, the example does not activate the Cut item in either the context or Edit menu when you select some text in the second paragraph. But by assigning a function to the onBeforeCut event handler, the menu item is active, and the entire paragraph is selected from the function that is invoked.  onBeforeDeactivate  See onActivate.  onBeforeEditFocus  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   elementObject.onBeforeEditFocus   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 98  98  JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Example  Use The Evaluator to explore the onBeforeEditFocus in IE5.5+. In the following  sequence, you assign an anonymous function to the onBeforeEditFocus event handler of the myP element. The function turns the text color of the element to red when the event handler fires: myP.onbeforeeditfocus = new Function “myP.style.color=’red’”  Now turn on content editing for the myP element: myP.contentEditable = true  If you now click inside the myP element on the page to edit its content, the text turns to red before you begin editing. In a page scripted for this kind of user inter- face, you would include some control that turns off editing and changes the color to normal.

This is not a Web-friendly prac- tice, and it is one that I discourage because there are intelligent ways to ensure a field has something typed into it before a form is submitted  see Chapter 43 of the JavaScript Bible . Listing 15-34 simply demonstrates the impact of the TABINDEX attribute in an IE5 Windows element with respect to the onBlur and onFocus events. Notice that as you press the Tab key, only the second paragraph issues the events even though all three paragraphs have event handlers assigned to them.  elementObject.onBlur   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 99  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   99  Listing 15-34: onBlur and onFocus Event Handlers       onBlur and onBlur Event Handlers    function showBlur   {  var id = event.srcElement.id alert “Element \”” + id + “\” has blurred.”   } function showFocus   {  var id = event.srcElement.id alert “Element \”” + id + “\” has received focus.”   }        onBlur and onBlur Event Handlers     Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetaur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Listing 15-35  demonstrates its interaction with the onDblClick event handler and shows you how to prevent a link’s intrinsic action from activating when combined with click events. As you click and or double-click the link, the status bar displays a message associated with each event. Notice that if you double-click, the click event fires first with the first message immediately replaced by the second. For demonstration purposes, I show both backward-compatible ways of cancelling the link’s intrinsic action. In practice, decide on one style and stick with it.  Listing 15-35: Using onClick and onDblClick Event Handlers       onClick and onDblClick Event Handlers    var msg = “” function showClick   {  msg = “The element has been clicked. “ status = msg  } function showDblClick   {  msg = “The element has been double-clicked.” status = msg return false  }        onClick and onDblClick Event Handlers    <A HREF=”” onClick=”showClick  ;return false”  onDblClick=”return showDblClick  ”> A sample link.       onContextMenu  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   elementObject.onContextMenu   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 101  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   101  See Listing 15-30 earlier in this chapter for an example of using the onContextMenu  event handler with a custom context menu.

Notice how the handleCut   function not only stuffs the selected word into the clipboardData object, but it also erases the selected text from the table cell element from where it came. If you replace the onBeforeCut and onCut event handlers with onBeforeCopy and onCopy  and change handleCut   to not eliminate the inner text of the event source element , the operation works with copy and paste instead of cut and paste. I demonstrate this later in the chapter in Listing 15-45.

The page  resembles the example in Listing 15-36, but the scripting behind the page is quite different. In this example, the user is encouraged to select individual words from the Nouns and Adjectives columns and drag them to the blanks of the sentence. To beef up the demonstration, Listing 15-37 shows you how to pass the equivalent of array data from a drag source to a drag target. At the same time, the user has a fixed amount of time  two seconds  to complete each drag operation.  The onDragStart and onDrag event handlers are placed in the   tag  because those events bubble up from any element that the user tries to drag. The scripts invoked by these event handlers filter the events so that the desired action is triggered only by the “hot” elements inside the table. This approach to event han- dlers prevents you from having to duplicate event handlers  or IE   tags  for each table cell.  The onDragStart event handler invokes setupDrag  . This function cancels the onDragStart event except when the target element  in other words, the one about to be dragged  is one of the TD elements inside the table. To make this application smarter about what kind of word is dragged to which blank, it passes not only the word’s text, but also some extra information about the word. This lets another event handler verify that a noun has been dragged to the first blank, while an adjective has been dragged to the second blank. To help with this effort, class names are assigned to the TD elements to distinguish the words from the Nouns column from the words of the Adjectives column. The setupDrag   function generates an array consisting of the innerText of the event’s source element plus the element’s class name. But the event.dataTransfer object cannot store array data types, so the Array.join   method converts the array to a string with a colon separating the entries. This string, then, is stuffed into the event.dataTransfer object. The object is instructed to ren- der the cursor display during the drag-and-drop operation so that when the cursor is  elementObject.onDrag   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 104  104 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  atop a drop target, the cursor is the “copy” style. Figure 1-4 shows the cursor effect as the user drags a selected word from the columns to a blank field that is scripted as a drop target. Finally, the setupDrag   function is the first to execute in the drag operation, so a timer is set to the current clock time to time the drag operation.  Figure 1-4: The cursor turns to a “copy” icon atop a designated drop target  The onDrag event handler  in the BODY  captures the onDrag events that are  generated by whichever table cell element is the source element for the action. Each time the event fires  which is a lot during the action , the timeIt   function is invoked to compare the current time against the reference time  global timer  set when the drag starts. If the time exceeds two seconds  2,000 milliseconds , an alert dialog box notifies the user. To close the alert dialog box, the user must unclick the mouse button to end the drag operation.  To turn the blank SPAN elements into drop targets, their onDragEnter,  onDragOver, and onDrop event handlers must set event.returnValue to false; also, the event.dataTransfer.dropEffect property should be set to the desired effect  copy in this case . These event handlers are placed in the P element that contains the two SPAN elements, again for simplicity. Notice, however, that the cancelDefault   functions do their work only if the target element is one of the SPAN elements whose ID begins with “blank.”  As the user releases the mouse button, the onDrop event handler invokes the  handleDrop   function. This function retrieves the string data from event. dataTransfer and restores it to an array data type  using the String.split   method . A little bit of testing makes sure that the word type  “noun” or “adjec- tive”  is associated with the desired blank. If so, the source element’s text is set to the drop target’s innerText property; otherwise, an error message is assembled to help the user know what went wrong.  elementObject.onDrag   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 105  Chapter 1 ✦ Generic HTML Element Objects  Chapter 15   105  Listing 15-37: Using Drag-Related Event Handlers       Dragging Event Handlers    TD {text-align:center} TH {text-decoration:underline} .blanks {text-decoration:underline}     var timer function setupDrag   {  if  event.srcElement.tagName != “TD”  {     don’t allow dragging for any other elements event.returnValue = false  } else {     setup array of data to be passed to drop target var passedData = [event.srcElement.innerText,  event.srcElement.className]     store it as a string event.dataTransfer.setData “Text”, passedData.join “:”   event.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = “copy” timer = new Date    } function timeIt   {  if  event.srcElement.tagName == “TD” && timer  {  if   new Date    - timer > 2000  {  alert “Sorry, time is up.

No drop target is defined for this page, so when you drag the item, the cursor remains as the “no drop” cursor.  Listing 15-38: Using onDragEnter and onDragLeave Event  Handlers       onDragEnter and onDragLeave Event Handlers    function showEnter   {  status = “Entered at: “ + new Date   event.returnValue = false  } function clearMsg   {  status = “” event.returnValue = false  }         onDragEnter and onDragLeave Event Handlers      Select any character s  from this paragraph, and slowly drag it around the page. When the dragging action enters the large header above, the status bar displays when the onDragEnter event handler fires.

The actual code of the listing is less important than watching the page while you use it. For every key or key combination that you press, the page shows the keyCode value for the  elementObject.onKeyDown   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 112  112 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  onKeyDown, onKeyPress, and onKeyUp events. If you hold down one or more modi- fier keys while performing the key press, the modifier key name is highlighted for each of the three events. Note that when run in NN6, the keyCode value is not the character code  which doesn’t show up in this example for NN6 . Also, you may need to click the NN6 page for the document object to recognize the keyboard events.  The best way to watch what goes on during keyboard events is to press and hold  a key to see the key codes for the onKeyDown and onKeyPress events  see Figure 1-5 . Then release the key to see the code for the onKeyUp event. Notice, for instance, that if you press the A key without any modifier key, the onKeyDown event key code is 65  A  but the onKeyPress key code in IE  and the charCode property in NN6 if it were displayed here  is 97  a . If you then repeat the exercise but hold the Shift key down, all three events generate the 65  A  key code  and the Shift mod- ifier labels are highlighted . Releasing the Shift key causes the onKeyUp event to show the key code for the Shift key.  Figure 1-5: Pressing Ctrl+Alt+J in the keyboard event lab page   In another experiment, press any of the four arrow keys. No key code is passed for the onKeyPress event because those keys don’t generate those events. They do, however, generate onKeyDown and onKeyUp events.

Because the image object is not part of the docu- ment object model for NN2 or IE3  which reports itself as Navigator version 2 , the page is designed to accept all browsers. Only those browsers that support  precached images and image swapping  and thus pass the test for the presence of the document.images array  can execute those statements. For a browser with an image object, images are preloaded into the browser cache as the page loads so that response to the user is instantaneous the first time the user calls upon new versions of the images.

Wrapping images inside links is a backward compatibility approach that allows older browsers to respond to clicks on images for navigation or other scripting tasks.  onMouseEnter onMouseLeave  Compatibility  Example  onMouseMove  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3   You can modify Listing 15-43 with the IE5.5 syntax by substituting onMouseEnter  for onMouseOver and onMouseLeave for onMouseOut. The effect is the same.

See Chapter 31 of the JavaScript Bible for more dragging examples.  Three images are individu- ally positioned on the page. Most of the scripting code concerns itself with the geography of click locations, the stacking order of the images, and the management of the onMouseMove event handler so that it is active only when an item is dragged. Scripts assign the onMouseDown and onMouseUp event handlers to the document object, invoking the engage   and release   functions, respectively. When a user mouses down anywhere in the document, the engage   function starts by invoking setSelectedObj  . This function examines the target of the mouseDown event. If it is one of the map images, the selectedObj global variable is set to the image object and the element is brought to the front of the stacking order of images  any previously stacked image is returned to its normal position in the stack . MouseDown events on any other element simply make sure that the selectedObj variable is null. The presence of a value assigned to selectedObj serves as a kind of switch for other functions: When the variable contains a value, it means that the user is doing something associated with dragging an element.  Back at the engage   function — provided the user mouses down on one of the draggable images — the onMouseMove event handler is assigned to the document object, setting it to invoke the dragIt   function. For the sake of users, the offset of the mouse down event from the top-left corner of the image is preserved in the  elementObject.onMouseMove   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 118  118 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  offsetX and offsetY variables  minus any scrolling that the body is subject to at that instant . These offset values are necessary to let the scripts set the location of the image during dragging  the location is set for the top-left corner of the image  while keeping the cursor in the same location within the image as when the user first presses the mouse.  As the user drags the image, the onMouseDown event handler fires repeatedly, allowing the dragIt   function to continually update the location of the element relative to the current cursor position  the event.clientX and event.clientY properties . The global offset variables are subtracted from the cursor position to preserve the relation of the image’s top-left corner to the initial cursor position at mouse down.  Upon the user releasing the mouse button, the release   function turns off the onMouseMove event handler  setting it to null . This prevents the event from being processed at all during normal usage of the page. The selectedObj global variable is also set to null, turning off the “switch” that indicates dragging is in session.

Notice that for each link, the handler runs a general-purpose function that sets the window’s status mes- sage. The function returns a true value, which the event handler call evaluates to replicate the required return true statement needed for setting the status bar. In one status message, I supply a URL in parentheses to let you evaluate how helpful you think it is for users.

A table contains words to be copied  one column of nouns, one column of adjectives  and then pasted into blanks in a paragraph. The onBeforeCopy and onCopy event handlers are assigned to the TABLE element because the events from the TD elements bub- ble up to the TABLE container and there is less HTML code to contend with.  Inside the paragraph, two SPAN elements contain underscored blanks. To paste text into the blanks, the user must first select at least one character of the blanks.  See Listing 15-37, which gives a drag-and-drop version of this application.  The onBeforePaste event handler in the paragraph  which gets the event as it bubbles up from either SPAN  sets the event.returnValue property to false, thus allow- ing the Paste item to appear in the context and Edit menus  not a normal occur- rence in HTML body content .  At paste time, the innerHTML property of the target SPAN is set to the text data stored in the clipboard. The event.returnValue property is set to false here, as well, to prevent normal system pasting from interfering with the controlled version.   elementObject.onPaste   4855-7 ch01.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 122  122 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 15-45: Using onBeforePaste and onPaste Event  Handlers       onBeforePaste and onPaste Event Handlers    TD {text-align:center} TH {text-decoration:underline} .blanks {text-decoration:underline}     function selectWhole   {  var obj = window.event.srcElement var range = document.body.createTextRange   range.moveToElementText obj  range.select   event.returnValue = false  } function handleCopy   {  var rng = document.selection.createRange   clipboardData.setData “Text”,rng.text  event.returnValue = false  }  elem.innerHTML = clipboardData.getData “Text”   function handlePaste   {  var elem = window.event.srcElement if  elem.className == “blanks”  {  } event.returnValue = false  } function handleBeforePaste   {  var elem = window.event.srcElement if  elem.className == “blanks”  {  event.returnValue = false  }  }        onBeforePaste and onPaste Event Handlers     Your goal is to copy and paste one noun and one adjective from the following table into the blanks of the sentence.

The window object  has been scriptable in one form or another since the first scriptable browsers. Of course the object has gained numer- ous properties, methods, and event handlers over time, but you also often find many object-model-specific items that you probably wish were available across all browsers.   While scripts permit Web authors to manage multiple   windows — and many of the examples in this chapter support that facility — try to think about your visitors, too. Very often multiple windows get in the way of site navigation and con- tent, regardless of your good intentions. As some examples also demonstrate, you must include safety nets for your code to counteract the unpredictable actions of users who close or hide windows precisely when you don’t want them to do so. Therefore, do not regard the multi-window examples here as user interface recommendations; rather consider them as rec- ommended ways to handle a potentially tricky user-interface element.  Possible exceptions to my multi-window admonitions are the  modal and modeless dialog box windows provided by various versions of IE for Windows. For other platforms, a modal dialog box can be simulated  search for details at www. dannyg.com . IE5.5 for Windows also adds a popup type win- dow, which can be a helpful user interface element that exists between a tooltip and a modal dialog box.  Modern browsers, however, provide ample script control  over framesets. As examples in this chapter demonstrate, your scripts can hide and show frames, or completely rearchi- tect a frameset without loading a new frameset.   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 128  128 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ Listing 16-4 for the window.closed property demonstrates an industrial-  strength treatment of new window creation, which works with all scriptable browsers  taking into account shortcomings of earlier browsers .   ✦ NN4+ allows dynamic control over the presence of window chrome  statusbar,  toolbar, et al.  with the help of signed scripts, as shown in Listing 16-6. Without signed scripts, or for IE, you must use window.open   to create a separate window with the characteristics of your choice.  ✦ The example listings for the window.opener property show you how scripts  from a subwindow communicate with the window that opened it.   ✦ In the example listings for the window.parent property, you see how refer-  ences to the various synonyms for a window object within a frameset evaluate. Thus, you can see what the references window, top, parent, and self mean within a frameset.  ✦ Compare Listings 16-20, 16-23, and 16-29 to understand not only the different  looks of the three native dialog box windows  alert, confirm, and prompt , but also how values returned from two of them can influence script processing sequences.  ✦ A simple countdown timer in Listing 16-22 shows a practical application of the  window.clearTimeout   method. Here the method stops the looping timer when the count reaches zero.  ✦ Watch the browser window dance in Listing 16-24. The window.moveBy   and  window.moveTo   methods put window positioning through its paces.  ✦ Examples for window.setInterval   and window.setTimeout   apply  these two similar methods to applications that are ideal for each one. You find other applications of setTimeout   in examples for the window.closed property and window.open   method.  ✦ Internet Explorer’s modal and modeless dialog box windows get workouts in  Listings 16-39 through 16-42.   ✦ The composition of a frameset, including the sizes of the frames, can be con- trolled dynamically in IE4+ and NN6, as shown in examples for the FRAMESET. cols and FRAMESET.rows properties.   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 129  Window Object  Properties  clipboardData  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   129  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   See Listings 15-30 and 15-39  in Chapter 1 of this book  to see how the  clipboardData object is used with a variety of edit-related event handlers.

It takes into account the lack of the opener property in Navigator 2, the missing closed property in Navigator 2 and Internet Explorer 3, and it even pro- vides an ugly but necessary workaround for the inability of Internet Explorer 3 to gracefully see if a subwindow is still open.  The script begins by initializing a global variable, newWind, which is used to hold  the object reference to the second window. This value needs to be global so that other functions can reference the window for tasks, such as closing. Another global variable, isIE3, is a Boolean flag that lets the window closing routines know whether the visitor is using Internet Explorer 3  see details about the navigator. appVersion property in Chapter 28 of the JavaScript Bible .  For this example, the new window contains some HTML code written dynamically to it, rather than loading an existing HTML file into it. Therefore, the URL parameter of the window.open   method is left as an empty string. It is vital, however, to assign a name in the second parameter to accommodate the Internet Explorer 3 workaround for closing the window. After the new window is opened, an opener property is assigned to the object if one is not already assigned  this property is needed only for Navigator 2 . Next comes a brief delay to allow Internet Explorer  especially versions 3 and 4  to catch up with opening the window so that content  windowObject.closed   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 130  130 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  can be written to it. The delay  using the setTimeout   method described later in this chapter  invokes the finishNewWindow   function, which uses the global newWind variable to reference the window for writing. The document.close   method closes writing to the document — a different kind of close than a window close.  A separate function, closeWindow  , is responsible for closing the subwindow. To accommodate Internet Explorer 3, the script appears to create another window with the same characteristics as the one opened earlier in the script. This is the trick: If the earlier window exists  with exactly the same parameters and a name other than an empty string , Internet Explorer does not create a new window even with the window.open   method executing in plain sight. To the user, nothing unusual appears on the screen. Things look weird for Internet Explorer 3 users only if the user has closed the subwindow. The window.open   method momentarily creates that subwindow. This subwindow is necessary because a “living” window object must be available for the upcoming test of window existence.  Internet Explorer 3 displays a script error if you try to address a missing window, while NN2+ and IE4+ simply return friendly null values.   As a final test, an if condition looks at two conditions: 1  if the window object  has ever been initialized with a value other than null  in case you click the window closing button before ever having created the new window  and 2  if the window’s closed property is null or false. If either condition is true, the close   method is sent to the second window.  Listing 16-4: Checking Before Closing a Window       window.closed Property       initialize global var for new window object    so it can be accessed by all functions on the page var newWind     set flag to help out with special handling for window closing var isIE3 =  navigator.appVersion.indexOf “MSIE 3”  != -1  ? true : false    make the new window and put some stuff in it function newWindow   {  newWind = window.open “”,”subwindow”,”HEIGHT=200,WIDTH=200”     take care of Navigator 2 if  newWind.opener == null  {  newWind.opener = window  } setTimeout “finishNewWindow  ”, 100   } function finishNewWindow   {  var output = “” output += “   A Sub-window ” output += “ <INPUT TYPE=’button’ VALUE=’Close Main Window’” output +=”onClick=’window.opener.close  ’>   ”  windowObject.closed   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 131  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   131  newWind.document.write output  newWind.document.close    }    close subwindow, including ugly workaround for IE3 function closeWindow   {  if  isIE3  {     if window is already open, nothing appears to happen    but if not, the subwindow flashes momentarily  yech!  newWind = window.open “”,”subwindow”,”HEIGHT=200,WIDTH=200”   } if  newWind && !newWind.closed  {  newWind.close    }  }                     To complete the example of the window opening and closing, notice that the sub- window is given a button whose onClick event handler closes the main window. In Navigator 2 and Internet Explorer 3, this occurs without complaint. But in NN3+ and IE4+, the user is presented with an alert asking to confirm the closure of the main browser window.  defaultStatus  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Unless you plan to change the default statusbar text while a user spends time at  your Web page, the best time to set the property is when the document loads. In Listing 16-5, notice how I also read this property to reset the statusbar in an onMouseOut event handler. Setting the status property to empty also resets the statusbar to the defaultStatus setting.  windowObject.defaultStatus   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 132  132 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-5: Setting the Default Status Message       window.defaultStatus property    window.defaultStatus = “Welcome to my Web site.”       <A HREF=”http:  www.microsoft.com”  onMouseOver=”window.status = ‘Visit Microsoft\’s Home page.’;return true” onMouseOut=”window.status = ‘’;return true”>Microsoft   <A HREF=”http:  home.netscape.com”  onMouseOver=”window.status = ‘Visit Netscape\’s Home page.’;return true” onMouseOut=”window.status = window.defaultStatus;return true”>Netscape       If you need to display single or double quotes in the statusbar  as in the second link in Listing 16-5 , use escape characters  \’ and \”  as part of the strings being assigned to these properties.  dialogArguments  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   See Listing 16-38 for the window.showModalDialog   method to see how argu-  ments can be passed to a dialog box and retrieved via the dialogArguments property.

You can create a function that handles the toggle between two sizes. The following function assumes that the document in the dialog box has a button whose label also toggles between “Show Details” and “Hide Details.” The button’s onClick event handler invokes the function as toggleDetails this . function toggleDetails btn  {  if  dialogHeight == “200px”  {  dialogHeight = “350px” btn.value = “Hide Details”  } else {  dialogHeight = “200px” btn.value = “Show Details”  }  }  dialogLeft dialogTop  Compatibility  Example  In practice, you also have to toggle the display style sheet property of the extra material between none and block to make sure that the dialog box does not display scrollbars in the smaller dialog box version.

The following statements in a dialog box window document’s script recenter the dialog box window. dialogLeft =  screen.availWidth 2  -  parseInt dialogWidth  2  + “px” dialogHeight =  screen.availHeight 2  -  parseInt dialogHeight  2  + “px”  Note that the parseInt   functions are used to read the numeric portion of the  dialogWidth and dialogHeight properties so that the values can be used for arithmetic.  windowObject.dialogLeft   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 134  134 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  directories locationbar menubar personalbar scrollbars statusbar toolbar  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   Example  In Listing 16-6, you can experiment with the look of a browser window with any of the chrome elements turned on and off. To run this script, you must either sign the scripts or turn on codebase principals  see Chapter 46 of the JavaScript Bible . Java must also be enabled to use the signed script statements.  As the page loads, it stores the current state of each chrome element. One but-  ton for each chrome element triggers the toggleBar   function. This function inverts the visible property for the chrome object passed as a parameter to the function. Finally, the Restore button returns visibility to their original settings. Notice that the restore   function is also called by the onUnload event handler for the document. Also, if you load this example into NN6, non-fatal script errors occur when the scrollbars are turned on or off.

The same document is loaded into each frame. A script in that document extracts info about the current frame and the entire frame- set.

Listing 16-7: Framesetting Document for Listing 16-8       window.frames property                 A call to determine the number  length  of frames returns 0 from the point of  view of the current frame referenced. That’s because each frame here is a window that has no nested frames within it. But add the parent property to the reference, and the scope zooms out to take into account all frames generated by the parent window’s document.  windowObject.frames   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 137  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   137  Listing 16-8: Showing Various Window Properties       Window Revealer II    function gatherWindowData   {  var msg = “” msg += “ From the point of view of this frame:  ” msg += “window.frames.length: “ + window.frames.length + “ ” msg += “window.name: “ + window.name + “ ” msg += “ From the point of view of the framesetting document:  ” msg += “parent.frames.length: “ + parent.frames.length + “ ” msg += “parent.frames[0].name: “ + parent.frames[0].name return msg  }         document.write gatherWindowData           Figure 2-1: Property readouts from both frames loaded from Listing 16-7  windowObject.frames   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 138  138 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The last statement in the example shows how to use the array syntax  brackets  to refer to a specific frame.

One of the buttons restores the windows to these settings. Two parallel sets of but- tons set the inner and outer dimensions to the same pixel values so that you can see the effects on the overall window and document area when a script changes the various properties.  Because Navigator 4 displays different-looking buttons in different platforms  as well as other elements , the two buttons contain script instructions to size the win- dow to best display the window contents. Unfortunately, no measure of the active area of a document is available, so that the dimension values were determined by trial and error before being hard-wired into the script.  navigator  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  This book is littered with examples of using the navigator object, primarily for performing browser detection.

I’ve added an error-handling function to process the error so that it opens a separate window and fills in a textarea form element  see Figure 2-2 . If you load Listing 16-10 in NN6, some of the reporting categories report “undefined” because the browser unfortu- nately does not pass error properties to the handleError   function.

The doNew   function generates a small subwindow and loads the file in Listing 16-12 into the window. Notice the initial conditional statements in doNew   to make sure that if the new window already exists, it comes to the front by invoking the new window’s focus   method. You can see the results in Figure 2-3. Because the doNew   function in Listing 16-11 uses window methods and properties not avail- able in IE3, this example does not work correctly in IE3.  Listing 16-11: Contents of a Main Window Document That  Generates a Second Window       Master of all Windows    var myWind function doNew   {  if  !myWind  myWind.closed  {  myWind = window.open “lst16-12.htm”,”subWindow”,  “HEIGHT=200,WIDTH=350,resizable”      bring existing subwindow to the front myWind.focus    } else {  }  }         Select a color for a new window:  Red  Yellow  Blue     This field will be filled from an entry in another window:          windowObject.opener   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 143  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   143  The window.open   method doesn’t provide parameters for setting the new  window’s background color, so I let the getColor   function in the new window do the job as the document loads. The function uses the opener property to find out which radio button on the main page is selected.  Listing 16-12: References to the opener Property       New Window on the Block    function getColor   {     shorten the reference colorButtons = self.opener.document.forms[0].color    see which radio button is checked for  var i = 0; i < colorButtons.length; i++  {  if  colorButtons[i].checked  {  return colorButtons[i].value  }  } return “white”  }       document.write “ ”     This is a new window.    <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Who’s in the Main window?” onClick=”alert self.opener.document.title ”>  Type text here for the main window: <INPUT TYPE=”text” SIZE=25 onChange=”self.opener.document.forms[0].entry.value = this.value”>        In the getColor   function, the multiple references to the radio button array  can be very long. To simplify the references, the getColor   function starts out by assigning the radio button array to a variable I arbitrarily call colorButtons. That shorthand now stands in for lengthy references as I loop through the radio buttons to determine which button is checked and retrieve its value property.  A button in the second window simply fetches the title of the opener window’s document. Even if another document loads in the main window in the meantime, the opener reference still points to the main window: Its document object, however, will change.  windowObject.opener   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 144  144 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Figure 2-3: The main and subwindows, inextricably linked via the window.opener property  Finally, the second window contains a text input object. Enter any text there that you like and either tab or click out of the field. The onChange event handler updates the field in the opener’s document  provided that document is still loaded .  pageXOffset pageYOffset  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   Example  The script in Listing 16-13 is an unusual construction that creates a frameset  and creates the content for each of the two frames all within a single HTML docu- ment  see “Frame Object” in Chapter 16 of the JavaScript Bible for more details . The purpose of this example is to provide you with a playground to become famil- iar with the page offset concept and how the values of these properties correspond to physical activity in a scrollable document.  In the left frame of the frameset are two fields that are ready to show the pixel  values of the right frame’s pageXOffset and pageYOffset properties. The content  windowObject.pageXOffset   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 145  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   145  of the right frame is a 30-row table of fixed width  800 pixels . Mouse click events are captured by the document level  see Chapter 18 of the JavaScript Bible , allow- ing you to click any table or cell border or outside the table to trigger the showOffsets   function in the right frame. That function is a simple script that displays the page offset values in their respective fields in the left frame.  Listing 16-13: Viewing the pageXOffset and pageYOffset  Properties       Master of all Windows    function leftFrame   {  var output = “   Page Offset Values  \n” output += “ PageXOffset:  \n” output += “PageYOffset:  \n” output += “   ” return output  }  function rightFrame   {  var output = “   \n” output += “function showOffsets   {\n” output += “parent.readout.document.forms[0].xOffset.value =  output += “parent.readout.document.forms[0].yOffset.value =  self.pageXOffset\n”  self.pageYOffset\n}\n”  output += “document.captureEvents Event.CLICK \n” output += “document.onclick = showOffsets\n” output += “    Content Page \n” output += “Scroll this frame and click on a table border to view “ +  “page offset values.  \n”  output += “ ” var oneRow = “ Cell 1  Cell 2  Cell 3 ” +         “ Cell 4  Cell 5 ”  for  var i = 1; i <= 30; i++  {  output += “   Row “ + i + “  ” + oneRow + “ ”  } output += “   ” return output  }                  windowObject.pageXOffset   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 146  146 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  To gain an understanding of how the offset values work, scroll the window  slightly in the horizontal direction and notice that the pageXOffset value increases; the same goes for the pageYOffset value as you scroll down. Remember that these values reflect the coordinate in the document that is currently under the top-left corner of the window  frame  holding the document. You can see an IE4+ version of this example in Listing 18-20  in Chapter  4 of this book . A cross-browser version would require very little browser branching.

It, in turn, sets each of two equal-size frames to the same document: Listing 16-15. This document extracts the values of several window properties, plus the document.title properties of two different window references.  Listing 16-14: Framesetting Document for Listing 16-15       The Parent Property Example    self.name = “Framesetter”                  Listing 16-15: Revealing Various Window-Related Properties       Window Revealer II    function gatherWindowData   {  var msg = “”  windowObject.parent   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 147  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   147  msg = msg + “top name: “ + top.name + “ ” msg = msg + “parent name: “ + parent.name + “ ” msg = msg + “parent.document.title: “ + parent.document.title + “ ” msg = msg + “window name: “ + window.name + “ ” msg = msg + “self name: “ + self.name + “ ” msg = msg + “self.document.title: “ + self.document.title return msg  }         document.write gatherWindowData           In the two frames  Figure 2-4 , the references to the window and self object  names return the name assigned to the frame by the frameset definition  JustAKid1 for the left frame, JustAKid2 for the right frame . In other words, from each frame’s point of view, the window object is its own frame. References to self.document.title refer only to the document loaded into that window frame. But references to the top and parent windows  which are one and the same in this example  show that those object properties are shared between both frames.  Figure 2-4: Parent and top properties being shared by both frames  windowObject.parent   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 148  148 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  A couple other fine points are worth highlighting. First, the name of the frameset-  ting window is set as Listing 16-14 loads, rather than in response to an onLoad event handler in the   tag. The reason for this is that the name must be set in time for the documents loading in the frames to get that value. If I had waited until the frameset’s onLoad event handler, the name wouldn’t be set until after the frame documents had loaded. Second, I restore the parent window’s name to an empty string when the framesetting document unloads. This is to prevent future pages from getting confused about the window name.

The application of this reference is entirely optional, but it can be helpful for reading and debugging scripts if the HTML document is to appear in one frame of a multiframe window — especially if other JavaScript code in this document refers to documents in other frames. The self reference helps anyone reading the code know precisely which frame was being addressed.  windowObject.self   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 150  150 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-16: Using the self Property       self Property    self.defaultStatus = “Welcome to my Web site.”       <A HREF=”http:   www.microsoft.com”  onMouseOver=”self.status = ‘Visit Microsoft\’s Home page.’;return true” onMouseOut=”self.status = ‘’;return true”>Microsoft   <A HREF=”http:  home.netscape.com”  onMouseOver=”self.status = ‘Visit Netscape\’s Home page.’;return true” onMouseOut=”self.status = self.defaultStatus;return true”>Netscape       status  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   In Listing 16-17, the status property is set in a handler embedded in the  onMouseOver attribute of two HTML link tags. Notice that the handler requires a return true statement  or any expression that evaluates to return true  as the last statement of the handler. This statement is required or the status message will not display, particularly in early browsers.  Listing 16-17: Links with Custom Statusbar Messages       window.status Property      <A HREF=”http:  www.dannyg.com” onMouseOver=”window.status = ‘Go to my Home page.  www.dannyg.com ’; return true”>Home   <A HREF=”http:  home.netscape.com” onMouseOver=”window.status = ‘Visit Netscape Home page.  home.netscape.com ’; return true”>Netscape       windowObject.status   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 151  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   151  As a safeguard against platform-specific anomalies that affect the behavior of onMouseOver event handlers and the window.status property, you should also include an onMouseOut event handler for links and client-side image map area objects. Such onMouseOut event handlers should set the status property to an empty string. This setting ensures that the statusbar message returns to the defaultStatus setting when the pointer rolls away from these objects. If you want to write a generalizable function that handles all window status changes, you can do so, but word the onMouseOver attribute carefully so that the event handler eval- uates to return true. Listing 16-18 shows such an alternative.  Listing 16-18: Handling Status Message Changes       Generalizable window.status Property    function showStatus msg  {  window.status = msg return true  }       <A HREF=”http:   www.dannyg.com “ onMouseOver=”return showStatus ‘Go to my Home page  www.dannyg.com .’ ” onMouseOut=”return showStatus ‘’ ”>Home   <A HREF=”http:  home.netscape.com” onMouseOver=”return showStatus ‘Visit Netscape Home page.’ ” onMouseOut=”return showStatus ‘’ ”>Netscape       Notice how the event handlers return the results of the showStatus   method  to the event handler, allowing the entire handler to evaluate to return true.  One final example of setting the statusbar  shown in Listing 16-19  also demon-  strates how to create a simple scrolling banner in the statusbar.  Listing 16-19: Creating a Scrolling Banner       Message Scroller    <!-- var msg = “Welcome to my world...” var delay = 150 var timerId var maxCount = 0 var currCount = 1  Continued  windowObject.status   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 152  152 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-19  continued   function scrollMsg   {     set the number of times scrolling message is to run if  maxCount == 0  {  maxCount = 3 * msg.length  } window.status = msg    keep track of how many characters have scrolled currCount++    shift first character of msg to end of msg msg = msg.substring  1, msg.length  + msg.substring  0, 1     test whether we’ve reached maximum character count if  currCount >= maxCount  {  timerID = 0           zero out the timer window.status = “”       clear the status bar return               break out of function  } else {     recursive call to this function timerId = setTimeout “scrollMsg  ”, delay   }  }    -->            Because the statusbar is being set by a standalone function  rather than by an  onMouseOver event handler , you do not have to append a return true statement to set the status property. The scrollMsg   function uses more advanced JavaScript concepts, such as the window.setTimeout   method  covered later in this chapter  and string methods  covered in Chapter 34 of the JavaScript Bible . To speed the pace at which the words scroll across the statusbar, reduce the value of delay.  Many Web surfers  myself included  don’t care for these scrollers that run for-  ever in the statusbar. Rolling the mouse over links disturbs the banner display. Scrollers can also crash earlier browsers, because the setTimeout   method eats application memory in Navigator 2. Use scrolling bars sparingly or design them to run only a few times after the document loads.  Tip  Setting the status property with onMouseOver event handlers has had a check- ered career along various implementations in Navigator. A script that sets the sta- tusbar is always in competition against the browser itself, which uses the statusbar to report loading progress. When a “hot” area on a page is at the edge of a frame, many times the onMouseOut event fails to fire, thus preventing the statusbar from clearing itself. Be sure to torture test any such implementations before declaring your page ready for public access.  windowObject.status   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 153  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   153  Methods  alert “message”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The parameter for the example in Listing 16-20 is a concatenated string.

Whenever the window is capturing click events, the flash   function runs. In that function, the event is examined so that only if the Control key is also being held down and the name of the button starts with “button” does the document background color flash red. For all click events  that is, those directed at objects on the page capable of their own onClick event handlers , the click is pro- cessed with the routeEvent   method to make sure the target buttons execute their own onClick event handlers.  Listing 16-21: Capturing Click Events in the Window       Window Event Capture       function to run when window captures a click event function flash e  {  if  e.modifiers = Event.CONTROL_MASK &&  e.target.name.indexOf “button”  == 0  {  document.bgColor = “red” setTimeout “document.bgColor = ‘white’”, 500   }    let event continue to target routeEvent e   }    default setting to capture click events window.captureEvents Event.CLICK     assign flash   function to click events captured by window window.onclick = flash          Turn window click event capture on or off  Default is “On”    <INPUT NAME=”captureOn” TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Capture On” onClick=”window.captureEvents Event.CLICK ”>&nbsp; <INPUT NAME=”captureOff” TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Capture Off” onClick=”window.releaseEvents Event.CLICK ”>    Ctrl+Click on a button to see if clicks are being captured by the window  background color will flash red :      windowObject.captureEvents     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 155  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   155   <INPUT NAME=”button1” TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Informix” onClick=”alert ‘You clicked on Informix.’ ”>  <INPUT NAME=”button2” TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Oracle” onClick=”alert ‘You clicked on Oracle.’ ”>  <INPUT NAME=”button3” TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Sybase” onClick=”alert ‘You clicked on Sybase.’ ”>          When you try this page, also turn off window event capture.

These values are needed inside multiple functions, so they are initialized outside of the functions.  Figure 2-6: The countdown timer page as it displays the time remaining  In the startTimer   function, you switch the running flag on, meaning that the timer should be going. Using some date functions  see Chapter 36 of the JavaScript Bible , you extract the current time in milliseconds and add the number of millisec- onds for the next minute  the extra multiplication by one is the place where you can change the amount to the desired number of minutes . With the end time stored in a global variable, the function now calls another function that compares the current and end times and displays the difference in the text field.  Early in the showCountDown   function, check to see if the timer has wound  down. If so, you stop the timer and alert the user. Otherwise, the function continues to calculate the difference between the two times and formats the time in mm:ss format. As long as the running flag is set to true, the function sets the one-second timeout timer before repeating itself. To stop the timer before it has run out  in the stopTimer   function , the most important step is to cancel the timeout running inside the browser. The clearTimeout   method uses the global timerID value to do that. Then the function turns off the running switch and zeros out the display. When you run the timer, you may occasionally notice that the time skips a sec-  ond. It’s not cheating. It just takes slightly more than one second to wait for the timeout and then finish the calculations for the next second’s display. What you’re seeing is the display catching up with the real time left.  close    NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   windowObject.close     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 158  158 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Example  See Listing 16-4  for the window.closed property , which provides an elaborate,  cross-platform, bug-accommodating example of applying the window.close   method across multiple windows. confirm “message”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The example in Listing 16-23 shows the user interface part of how you can use a confirm dialog box to query a user before clearing a table full of user-entered data.

The moveOffScreen   function momentarily moves the window entirely out of view. Notice how the script determines the size of the screen before deciding where to move the window. After the journey off screen, the window comes back into view at the upper-left corner of the screen.  If using the Web sometimes seems like going around in circles, then the second function, revolve  , should feel just right. After reducing the size of the window and positioning it near the top center of the screen, the script uses a bit of math to position the window along 36 places around a perfect circle  at 10-degree incre- ments . This is an example of how to control a window’s position dynamically based on math calculations. IE complicates the job a bit by not providing proper- ties that reveal the outside dimensions of the browser window.  To demonstrate the moveBy   method, the third function, zigzag  , uses a for loop to increment the coordinate points to make the window travel in a saw tooth pattern across the screen. The x coordinate continues to increment linearly until the window is at the edge of the screen  also calculated on the fly to accommodate any size monitor . The y coordinate must increase and decrease as that parameter changes direction at various times across the screen.  In the fourth function, you see some practical code  finally  that demonstrates  how best to simulate maximizing the browser window to fill the entire available screen space on the visitor’s monitor.  navigate “URL”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Supply any valid URL as the parameter to the method, as in  window.navigate “http:  www.dannyg.com”   open “URL”, “windowName” [, “windowFeatures”][,replaceFlag]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The page rendered by Listing 16-26 displays a single button that generates a new  window of a specific size that has only the statusbar turned on. The script here  windowObject.open     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 164  164 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  shows all the elements necessary to create a new window that has all the right stuff on most platforms. The new window object reference is assigned to a global vari- able, newWindow. Before a new window is generated, the script looks to see if the window has never been generated before  in which case newWindow would be null  or, for newer browsers, the window is closed. If either condition is true, the window is created with the open   method. Otherwise, the existing window is brought forward with the focus   method  NN3+ and IE4+ .  As a safeguard against older browsers, the script manually adds an opener prop-  erty to the new window if one is not already assigned by the open   method. The current window object reference is assigned to that property.  Due to the timing problem that afflicts all IE generations, the HTML assembly and writing to the new window is separated into its own function that is invoked after a 50 millisecond delay  NN goes along for the ride, but it could accommodate the assembly and writing without the delay . To build the string that is eventually writ- ten to the document, I use the +=  add-by-value  operator, which appends the string on the right side of the operator to the string stored in the variable on the left side. In this example, the new window is handed an  -level line of text to display.  Listing 16-26: Creating a New Window       New Window    var newWindow function makeNewWindow   {  if  !newWindow  newWindow.closed  {  newWindow = window.open “”,””,”status,height=200,width=300”  if  !newWindow.opener  { newWindow.opener = window }    force small delay for IE to catch up setTimeout “writeToWindow  ”, 50   } else {  }     window’s already open; bring to front newWindow.focus    } function writeToWindow   {     assemble content for new window var newContent = “   One Sub Window  ” newContent += “  This window is brand new. ” newContent += “  ”    write HTML to new window document newWindow.document.write newContent  newWindow.document.close      close layout stream  }          windowObject.open     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 165  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   165  <INPUT TYPE=”button” NAME=”newOne” VALUE=”Create New Window” onClick=”makeNewWindow  ”>        If you need to create a new window for the lowest common denominator of  scriptable browser, you will have to omit the focus   method and the window.closed property from the script  as well as add the NN2 bug workaround described earlier . Or you may prefer to forego a subwindow for all browsers below a certain level. See Listing 16-3  in the window.closed property discussion  for other ideas about cross-browser authoring for subwindows.

The function first checks to make sure that the returned value is neither null  Cancel  nor an empty string  the user clicked OK without entering any values . See Chapter 43 of the JavaScript Bible for more about data-entry validation.

Because clicking the button leads to a dialog box that requires more information from the user, the button’s label ends in an ellipsis  or, rather, three periods acting as an ellipsis char- acter . The ellipsis is a common courtesy to let users know that a user interface ele- ment leads to a dialog box of some sort. As in similar situations in Windows and Macintosh programs, the user should be able to cancel out of that dialog box and return to the same screen state that existed before the button was clicked.  resizeBy deltaX,deltaY  resizeTo outerwidth,outerheight   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  You can experiment with the resize methods with the page in Listing 16-30.

A series of buttons and text fields in the control panel frame directs the scrolling of the document. I’ve selected an arbitrary, large GIF image to use in the example. To see results of some horizontal scrolling values, you may need to shrink the width of the browser window until a horizontal scrollbar appears in the top frame. Figure 2-9 shows the results in a shrunken window with modest horizon- tal and vertical scroll values entered into the bottom text boxes. If you substitute scrollTo   for the scroll   methods in Listing 16-33, the results will be the same, but you will need version browsers at a minimum to run it.

Nonnumeric data can produce very odd results. Also be aware that although this example shows how to adjust the scroll values in another frame, you can set such values in the same frame or window as the script, as well as in subwindows, provided that you use the correct object references to the window.  scrollBy deltaX,deltaY  scrollTo x,y   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   windowObject.scrollBy     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 172  172 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Example  To work with the scrollTo   method, you can use Listings 16-31 through 16-33  the window.scroll   method  but substitute window.scrollTo   for window. scroll  .

The framesetting document is shown in Listing 16-36.  windowObject.setInterval     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 174  174 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-36: setInterval   Demonstration Frameset       setInterval   Method                  In the top frame is a control panel with several buttons that control the automatic scrolling of the Bill of Rights text document in the bottom frame. Listing 16-37 shows the control panel document. Many functions here control the interval, scrolling jump size, and direction, and they demonstrate several aspects of applying setInterval  .  Notice that in the beginning the script establishes a number of global variables.  Three of them are parameters that control the scrolling; the last one is for the ID value returned by the setInterval   method. The script needs that value to be a global value so that a separate function can halt the scrolling with the clearInterval   method.  All scrolling is performed by the autoScroll   function. For the sake of simplic- ity, all controlling parameters are global variables. In this application, placement of those values in global variables helps the page restart autoscrolling with the same parameters as it had when it last ran.  Listing 16-37: setInterval   Control Panel       ScrollBy Controller    var scrollSpeed = 500 var scrollJump = 1 var scrollDirection = “down” var intervalID  function autoScroll   {  if  scrollDirection == “down”  {  scrollJump = Math.abs scrollJump   } else if  scrollDirection == “up” && scrollJump > 0  {  scrollJump = -scrollJump  } parent.display.scrollBy 0, scrollJump  if  parent.display.pageYOffset <= 0  {  windowObject.setInterval     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 175  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   175  clearInterval intervalID   }  }  function reduceInterval   {  stopScroll   scrollSpeed -= 200 startScroll    } function increaseInterval   {  stopScroll   scrollSpeed += 200 startScroll    } function reduceJump   {  scrollJump -= 2  } function increaseJump   {  scrollJump += 2  } function swapDirection   {  } function startScroll   {  scrollDirection =  scrollDirection == “down”  ? “up” : “down”  parent.display.scrollBy 0, scrollJump  if  intervalID  {  clearInterval intervalID   } intervalID = setInterval “autoScroll  ”,scrollSpeed   } function stopScroll   {  clearInterval intervalID   }        AutoScroll by setInterval   Controller           <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Longer Time Interval” onClick=”increaseInterval  ”>                 windowObject.setInterval     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 176  176 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The setInterval   method is invoked inside the startScroll   function.  This function initially “burps” the page by one scrollJump interval so that the test in autoScroll   for the page being scrolled all the way to the top doesn’t halt a page from scrolling before it gets started. Notice, too, that the function checks for the existence of an interval ID. If one is there, it is cleared before the new one is set. This is crucial within the design of the example page, because repeated clicking of the Start Scrolling button triggers multiple interval timers inside the browser. Only the most recent one’s ID would be stored in intervalID, allowing no way to clear the older ones. But this little side trip makes sure that only one interval timer is running. One of the global variables, scrollSpeed, is used to fill the delay parame- ter for setInterval  . To change this value on the fly, the script must stop the current interval process, change the scrollSpeed value, and start a new process. The intensely repetitive nature of this application is nicely handled by the setInterval   method.  setTimeout “expr”, msecDelay [, language]  setTimeout functionRef, msecDelay [,  funcarg1, ..., funcargn]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  When you load the HTML page in Listing 16-38, it triggers the updateTime    function, which displays the time  in hh:mm am pm format  in the statusbar. Instead of showing the seconds incrementing one by one  which may be distracting to someone trying to read the page , this function alternates the last character of the display between an asterisk and nothing, like a visual “heartbeat.”  Listing 16-38: Display the Current Time       Status Bar Clock    <!-- var flasher = false    calculate current time, determine flasher state,    and insert time into status bar every second function updateTime   { var now = new Date   var theHour = now.getHours   var theMin = now.getMinutes   var theTime = “” +   theHour > 12  ? theHour - 12 : theHour  theTime +=   theMin < 10  ? “:0” : “:”  + theMin  windowObject.setTimeout     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 177  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   177  theTime  +=  theHour >= 12  ? “ pm” : “ am” theTime +=   flasher  ? “ “ : “*”  flasher = !flasher window.status = theTime    recursively call this function every second to keep timer going timerID = setTimeout “updateTime  ”,1000   }   -->             In this function, the setTimeout   method works in the following way: Once the  current time  including the flasher status  appears in the statusbar, the function waits approximately one second  1,000 milliseconds  before calling the same func- tion again. You don’t have to clear the timerID value in this application because JavaScript does it for you every time the 1,000 milliseconds elapse.  A logical question to ask is whether this application should be using  setInterval   instead of setTimeout  . This is a case in which either one does the job. To use setInterval   here would require that the interval process start outside of the updateTime   function, because you need only one process running that repeatedly calls updateTime  . It would be a cleaner implementation in that regard, instead of the tons of timeout processes spawned by Listing 16-38. On the other hand, the application would not run in any browsers before NN4 or IE4, as Listing 16-38 does.  To demonstrate passing parameters, you can modify the updateTime   function  to add the number of times it gets invoked to the display in the statusbar. For that to work, the function must have a parameter variable so that it can catch a new value each time it is invoked by setTimeout  ’s expression. For all browsers, the function would be modified as follows  unchanged lines are represented by the ellipsis : function updateTime i  {  ... window.status = theTime + “   “ + i + “ ”    pass updated counter value with next call to this function timerID = setTimeout “updateTime “ + i+1 + “ ”,1000   }  If you were running this exclusively in NN4+, you could use its more convenient way of passing parameters to the function: timerID = setTimeout updateTime,1000, i+1  In either case, the onLoad event handler would also have to be modified to get the ball rolling with an initial parameter: onLoad = “updateTime 0 ”  windowObject.setTimeout     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 178  178 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Caution  One  warning  about  setTimeout   functions  that  dive  into  themselves  as  fre- quently as this one does: Each call eats up a bit more memory for the browser application in Navigator 2. If you let this clock run for a while, some browsers may encounter  memory  difficulties,  depending  on  which  operating  system  they’re using. But considering the amount of time the typical user spends on Web pages  even if only 10 or 15 minutes , the function shouldn’t present a problem. And any reloading  invoked  by  the  user   such  as  by  resizing  the  window  in  Navigator  2  frees up memory once again.  showModalDialog “URL”[, arguments] [, features]  showModelessDialog “URL”[, arguments] [, features]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE5  IE5.5  IE4    cid:3     cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  To demonstrate the two styles of dialog boxes, I have implemented the same  functionality  setting some session visual preferences  for both modal and mode- less dialog boxes. This tactic shows you how to pass data back and forth between the main page and both styles of dialog box windows.  The first example demonstrates how to use a modal dialog box. In the process, data is passed into the dialog box window and values are returned. Listing 16-39 is the HTML and scripting for the main page. A button’s onClick event handler invokes a function that opens the modal dialog box. The dialog box’s document  Listing 16-40  contains several form elements for entering a user name and selecting a few color styles for the main page.  Data from the dialog is fashioned into an array to be sent back to the main window. That array is initially assigned to a local variable, prefs, as the dialog box closes. If the user cancels the dialog box, the returned value is an empty string, so nothing more in getPrefsData   executes. But when the user clicks OK, the array comes back. Each of the array items is read and assigned to its respective form value or style property. These values are also preserved in the global currPrefs array. This allows the settings to be sent to the modal dialog box  as the second parameter to showModalDialog    the next time the dialog box is opened.  Listing 16-39: Main Page for showModalDialog         window.setModalDialog   Method    var currPrefs = new Array    windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 179  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   179  function getPrefsData   {  var prefs = showModalDialog “lst16-40.htm”, currPrefs,  “dialogWidth:400px; dialogHeight:300px”   if  prefs  {  if  prefs[“name”]  {  document.all.firstName.innerText = prefs[“name”] currPrefs[“name”] = prefs[“name”]  } if  prefs[“bgColor”]  {  } if  prefs[“textColor”]  {  } if  prefs[“h1Size”]  {  document.body.style.backgroundColor = prefs[“bgColor”] currPrefs[“bgColor”] = prefs[“bgColor”]  document.body.style.color = prefs[“textColor”] currPrefs[“textColor”] = prefs[“textColor”]  document.all.welcomeHeader.style.fontSize = prefs[“h1Size”] currPrefs[“h1Size”] = prefs[“h1Size”]  }  }  } function init   {  }    document.all.firstName.innerText = “friend”       window.setModalDialog   Method     Welcome,  &nbsp; !     Use this button to set style preferences for this page:   Preferences        The dialog box’s document, shown in Listing 16-40, is responsible for reading the  incoming data  and setting the form elements accordingly  and assembling form data for return to the main window’s script. Notice when you load the example that the TITLE element of the dialog box’s document appears in the dialog box window’s title bar.  When the page loads into the dialog box window, the init   function examines the window.dialogArguments property. If it has any data, the data is used to pre- set the form elements to mirror the current settings of the main page. A utility func- tion, setSelected  , pre-selects the option of a SELECT element to match the current settings.  windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 180  180 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Buttons at the bottom of the page are explicitly positioned to be at the lower- right corner of the window. Each button invokes a function to do what is needed to close the dialog box. In the case of the OK button, the handleOK   function sets the window.returnValue property to the data that come back from the getFormData   function. This latter function reads the form element values and packages them in an array using the form elements’ names as array indices. This helps keep everything straight back in the main window’s script, which uses the index names, and is therefore not dependent upon the precise sequence of the form elements in the dialog box window.

The function it invokes looks for the Enter key. If that key is pressed while the box has focus, the same handleOK   function is invoked, as if the user had clicked the OK button. This feature makes the dialog box behave as if the OK button is an automatic default, just as “real” dialog boxes.  You should observe several important structural changes that were made to turn  the modal approach into a modeless one. Listing 16-41 shows the version of the main window modified for use with a modeless dialog box. Another global variable, prefsDlog, is initialized to eventually store the reference to the modeless window  windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 183  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   183  returned by the showModelessWindow   method. The variable gets used to invoke the init   function inside the modeless dialog box, but also as conditions in an if construction surrounding the generation of the dialog box. The reason this is needed is to prevent multiple instances of the dialog box being created  the button is still alive while the modeless window is showing . The dialog box won’t be created again as long as there is a value in prefsDlog, and the dialog box window has not been closed  picking up the window.closed property of the dialog box window . The showModelessDialog   method’s second parameter is a reference to the  function in the main window that updates the main document. As you see in a moment, that function is invoked from the dialog box when the user clicks the OK or Apply buttons.  Listing 16-41: Main Page for showModelessDialog         window.setModelessDialog   Method    var currPrefs = new Array   var prefsDlog function getPrefsData   {  if  !prefsDlog  prefsDlog.closed  {  prefsDlog = showModelessDialog “lst16-42.htm”, setPrefs, “dialogWidth:400px; dialogHeight:300px”  prefsDlog.init currPrefs   }  }  function setPrefs prefs  { if  prefs[“bgColor”]  {  document.body.style.backgroundColor = prefs[“bgColor”] currPrefs[“bgColor”] = prefs[“bgColor”]  } if  prefs[“textColor”]  {  document.body.style.color = prefs[“textColor”] currPrefs[“textColor”] = prefs[“textColor”]  } if  prefs[“h1Size”]  {  } if  prefs[“name”]  {  document.all.welcomeHeader.style.fontSize = prefs[“h1Size”] currPrefs[“h1Size”] = prefs[“h1Size”]  document.all.firstName.innerText = prefs[“name”] currPrefs[“name”] = prefs[“name”]  }  }  function init   {  }    document.all.firstName.innerText = “friend”  Continued  windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 184  184 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-41  continued        window.setModelessDialog   Method     Welcome,  &nbsp; !     Use this button to set style preferences for this page:   Preferences        Changes to the dialog box window document for a modeless version  Listing 16-42  are rather limited. A new button is added to the bottom of the screen for an Apply but- ton. As in many dialog box windows you see in Microsoft products, the Apply button lets current settings in dialog boxes be applied to the current document but without closing the dialog box. This approach makes experimenting with settings easier.  The Apply button invokes a handleApply   function, which works the same as handleOK  , except the dialog box is not closed. But these two functions communi- cate back to the main window differently than a modal dialog box. The main window’s processing function is passed as the second parameter of showModelessDialog   and is available as the window.dialogArguments property in the dialog box win- dow’s script. That function reference is assigned to a local variable in both functions, and the remote function is invoked, passing the results of the getFormData   func- tion as parameter values back to the main window.

Some designers insist that modality has no place in a graphical user interface; others say that there are times when you need to focus the user on a very specific task before any further processing can take place. That’s where a modal dialog box makes perfect sense.  sizeToContent    NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  in NN6 to try the  sizeToContent   method.

You can get the reference to the document object via a statement, such as the following: var doc = document.getElementById “FRAME3” .contentDocument  Then your script can, for example, dive into a form in the document:  var val = doc.mainForm.entry.value  FRAME.contentDocument   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 191  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   191  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Document  Compatibility  Example  While you have far easier ways to reach the document object of another frame   parent.otherFrameName.document , the following statement takes the long way to get there to retrieve the number of forms in the document of another frame: var formCount = parent.document.all.contentsFrame.Document.forms.length  Using the Document property only truly makes sense when a function is passed a  FRAME or IFRAME element object reference as a parameter, and the script must, among other things more related to those objects, access the document contained by those elements. frameBorder  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The default value for the frameBorder property is yes. You can use this setting to create a toggle script  which, unfortunately, does not change the appearance in IE . The W3C-compatible version looks like the following: function toggleFrameScroll frameID  {  var theFrame = document.getElementById frameID  if  theFrame.frameBorder == “yes”  {  theFrame.frameBorder = “no”  } else {  theFrame.frameBorder    = “yes”  }  }  height width  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   FRAME.height   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 192  192 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Example  The following fragment assumes a frameset defined with two frames set up as  two columns within the frameset. The statements here live in the framesetting doc- ument. They retrieve the current width of the left frame and increase the width of that frame by ten percent. Syntax shown here is for the W3C DOM, but can be easily adapted to IE-only terminology. var frameWidth = document.getElementById “leftFrame” .width document.getElementById “mainFrameset” .cols =  Math.round frameWidth * 1.1   + “,*”  Notice how the numeric value of the existing frame width is first increased by ten  percent and then concatenated to the rest of the string property assigned to the frameset’s cols property. The asterisk after the comma means that the browser should figure out the remaining width and assign it to the right-hand frame.  noResize  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The following statement turns off the ability for a frame to be resized:  parent.document.getElementById “myFrame1” .noResize = true  Because of the negative nature of the property name, it may be difficult to keep the logic straight  setting noResize to true means that resizability is turned off . Keep a watchful eye on your Boolean values.  scrolling  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Listing 16-45 produces a frameset consisting of eight frames. The content for the frames is generated by a script within the frameset  via the fillFrame   function . Event handlers in the Body of each frame invoke the toggleFrameScroll   func- tion. Both ways of referencing the FRAME element object are shown, with the IE- only version commented out.

This allows the condition to evaluate to true if the property is set to either auto  the first time  or yes  as set by the func- tion . Note that the scrollbars don’t disappear from the frames in IE5.5 or NN6.

The final document is an HTML version of the U.S. Bill of Rights, which is serving here as a content frame for the demonstration.  The frameset listing  16-46  shows a three-frame setup. Down the left column is a table of contents  16-47 . The right column is divided into two rows. In the top row is a simple control  16-48  that hides and shows the table of contents frame. As the user clicks the hot text of the control  located inside a SPAN element , the onClick event handler invokes the toggleTOC   function in the frameset. Figure 2-10 shows the frameset with the menu exposed.  Figure 2-10: Frameset specifications are modified on the fly when you click on the top control link.

To modify this for IE-only, you replace document.getElementById “outerFrameset”  with document.all. outerFrameset and elem.firstChild.nodeValue to elem.innerText. You can also branch within the scripts to accommodate both styles.

The variable is used in showTOC   to restore the frameset to its original proportions. This allows a designer to modify the HTML for the frameset without also having to dig into scripts to hard-wire the restored size.

A click of the button on the page invokes the selfTimer   function, which acts as the main routine for this page. The goal is to produce a pop-up window that “self-destructs” five seconds after it appears. Along the way, a message in the pop- up counts down the seconds.  A reference to the pop-up window is preserved as a global variable, called  popup. After the popup object is created, the initContent   function stuffs the content into the pop-up by way of assigning style properties and some innerHTML for the body of the document that is automatically created when the pop-up is gen- erated. A SPAN element is defined so that another function later on can modify the content of just that segment of text in the pop-up. Notice that the assignment of content to the pop-up is predicated on the pop-up window having been initialized  by virtue of the popup variable having a value assigned to it  and that the pop-up window is not showing. While invoking initContent   under any other circum- stances is probably impossible, the validation of the desired conditions is good pro- gramming practice.  Back in selfTimer  , the popup object is displayed. Defining the desired size  requires some trial and error to make sure the pop-up window comfortably accom- modates the text that is put into the pop-up in the initContent   function.  With the pop-up window showing, now is the time to invoke the countDown   function. Before the function performs any action, it validates that the pop-up has been initialized and is still visible. If a user clicks the main window while the counter is counting down, this changes the value of the isOpen property to false, and nothing inside the if condition executes.  This countDown   function grabs the inner text of the SPAN and uses  paresInt   to extract just the integer number  using base 10 numbering, because we’re dealing with zero-leading numbers that can potentially be regarded as octal values . The condition of the if construction decreases the retrieved integer by one. If the decremented value is zero, then the time is up, and the pop-up window is  popupObject.hide     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 203  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   203  hidden with the popup global variable returned to its original, null value. But if the value is other than zero, then the inner text of the SPAN is set to the decremented value  with a leading zero , and the setTimeout   method is called upon to rein- voke the countDown   function in one second  1000 milliseconds .  Listing 16-49: Hiding and Showing a Pop-up       popup Object    var popup function initContent   {  if  popup && !popup.isOpen  {  var popBody = popup.document.body popBody.style.border = “solid 3px red” popBody.style.padding = “10px” popBody.style.fontSize = “24pt” popBody.style.textAlign = “center” var bodyText = “ This popup will self-destruct in “ bodyText += “ 05 ” bodyText += “ seconds... ” popBody.innerHTML = bodyText  }  } function countDown   {  if  popup && popup.isOpen  {  popup.hide   popup = null  } else {  }  }  } function selfTimer   {  var currCount = parseInt popup.document.all.counter.innerText, 10  if  --currCount == 0  {  popup.document.all.counter.innerText = “0” + currCount setTimeout “countDown  ”, 1000   popup = window.createPopup   initContent   popup.show 200,200,400,100,document.body  setTimeout “countDown  ”, 1000   }                  popupObject.hide     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 204  204 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The hide   method here is invoked by a script that is running while the pop-up  window is showing. Because a pop-up window automatically goes away if a user clicks the main window, it is highly unlikely that the hide   method would ever be invoked by itself in response to user action in the main window. If you want a script in the pop-up window to close the pop-up, use parentWindow.close  .  ✦  ✦  ✦  popupObject.hide     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 127  22C H A P T E R  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  In This Chapter  Scripting communication among multiple frames  Creating and managing new windows  Controlling the size, position, and appearance of the browser window  Dynamically adjusting frame sizes and frameset compositions  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16  As physical containers of documents, window and frame  objects play huge rolls in scripting. The window object  has been scriptable in one form or another since the first scriptable browsers. Of course the object has gained numer- ous properties, methods, and event handlers over time, but you also often find many object-model-specific items that you probably wish were available across all browsers.   While scripts permit Web authors to manage multiple   windows — and many of the examples in this chapter support that facility — try to think about your visitors, too. Very often multiple windows get in the way of site navigation and con- tent, regardless of your good intentions. As some examples also demonstrate, you must include safety nets for your code to counteract the unpredictable actions of users who close or hide windows precisely when you don’t want them to do so. Therefore, do not regard the multi-window examples here as user interface recommendations; rather consider them as rec- ommended ways to handle a potentially tricky user-interface element.  Possible exceptions to my multi-window admonitions are the  modal and modeless dialog box windows provided by various versions of IE for Windows. For other platforms, a modal dialog box can be simulated  search for details at www. dannyg.com . IE5.5 for Windows also adds a popup type win- dow, which can be a helpful user interface element that exists between a tooltip and a modal dialog box.  Modern browsers, however, provide ample script control  over framesets. As examples in this chapter demonstrate, your scripts can hide and show frames, or completely rearchi- tect a frameset without loading a new frameset.   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 128  128 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ Listing 16-4 for the window.closed property demonstrates an industrial-  strength treatment of new window creation, which works with all scriptable browsers  taking into account shortcomings of earlier browsers .   ✦ NN4+ allows dynamic control over the presence of window chrome  statusbar,  toolbar, et al.  with the help of signed scripts, as shown in Listing 16-6. Without signed scripts, or for IE, you must use window.open   to create a separate window with the characteristics of your choice.  ✦ The example listings for the window.opener property show you how scripts  from a subwindow communicate with the window that opened it.   ✦ In the example listings for the window.parent property, you see how refer-  ences to the various synonyms for a window object within a frameset evaluate. Thus, you can see what the references window, top, parent, and self mean within a frameset.  ✦ Compare Listings 16-20, 16-23, and 16-29 to understand not only the different  looks of the three native dialog box windows  alert, confirm, and prompt , but also how values returned from two of them can influence script processing sequences.  ✦ A simple countdown timer in Listing 16-22 shows a practical application of the  window.clearTimeout   method. Here the method stops the looping timer when the count reaches zero.  ✦ Watch the browser window dance in Listing 16-24. The window.moveBy   and  window.moveTo   methods put window positioning through its paces.  ✦ Examples for window.setInterval   and window.setTimeout   apply  these two similar methods to applications that are ideal for each one. You find other applications of setTimeout   in examples for the window.closed property and window.open   method.  ✦ Internet Explorer’s modal and modeless dialog box windows get workouts in  Listings 16-39 through 16-42.   ✦ The composition of a frameset, including the sizes of the frames, can be con- trolled dynamically in IE4+ and NN6, as shown in examples for the FRAMESET. cols and FRAMESET.rows properties.   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 129  Window Object  Properties  clipboardData  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   129  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   See Listings 15-30 and 15-39  in Chapter 1 of this book  to see how the  clipboardData object is used with a variety of edit-related event handlers.

It takes into account the lack of the opener property in Navigator 2, the missing closed property in Navigator 2 and Internet Explorer 3, and it even pro- vides an ugly but necessary workaround for the inability of Internet Explorer 3 to gracefully see if a subwindow is still open.  The script begins by initializing a global variable, newWind, which is used to hold  the object reference to the second window. This value needs to be global so that other functions can reference the window for tasks, such as closing. Another global variable, isIE3, is a Boolean flag that lets the window closing routines know whether the visitor is using Internet Explorer 3  see details about the navigator. appVersion property in Chapter 28 of the JavaScript Bible .  For this example, the new window contains some HTML code written dynamically to it, rather than loading an existing HTML file into it. Therefore, the URL parameter of the window.open   method is left as an empty string. It is vital, however, to assign a name in the second parameter to accommodate the Internet Explorer 3 workaround for closing the window. After the new window is opened, an opener property is assigned to the object if one is not already assigned  this property is needed only for Navigator 2 . Next comes a brief delay to allow Internet Explorer  especially versions 3 and 4  to catch up with opening the window so that content  windowObject.closed   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 130  130 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  can be written to it. The delay  using the setTimeout   method described later in this chapter  invokes the finishNewWindow   function, which uses the global newWind variable to reference the window for writing. The document.close   method closes writing to the document — a different kind of close than a window close.  A separate function, closeWindow  , is responsible for closing the subwindow. To accommodate Internet Explorer 3, the script appears to create another window with the same characteristics as the one opened earlier in the script. This is the trick: If the earlier window exists  with exactly the same parameters and a name other than an empty string , Internet Explorer does not create a new window even with the window.open   method executing in plain sight. To the user, nothing unusual appears on the screen. Things look weird for Internet Explorer 3 users only if the user has closed the subwindow. The window.open   method momentarily creates that subwindow. This subwindow is necessary because a “living” window object must be available for the upcoming test of window existence.  Internet Explorer 3 displays a script error if you try to address a missing window, while NN2+ and IE4+ simply return friendly null values.   As a final test, an if condition looks at two conditions: 1  if the window object  has ever been initialized with a value other than null  in case you click the window closing button before ever having created the new window  and 2  if the window’s closed property is null or false. If either condition is true, the close   method is sent to the second window.  Listing 16-4: Checking Before Closing a Window       window.closed Property       initialize global var for new window object    so it can be accessed by all functions on the page var newWind     set flag to help out with special handling for window closing var isIE3 =  navigator.appVersion.indexOf “MSIE 3”  != -1  ? true : false    make the new window and put some stuff in it function newWindow   {  newWind = window.open “”,”subwindow”,”HEIGHT=200,WIDTH=200”     take care of Navigator 2 if  newWind.opener == null  {  newWind.opener = window  } setTimeout “finishNewWindow  ”, 100   } function finishNewWindow   {  var output = “” output += “   A Sub-window ” output += “ <INPUT TYPE=’button’ VALUE=’Close Main Window’” output +=”onClick=’window.opener.close  ’>   ”  windowObject.closed   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 131  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   131  newWind.document.write output  newWind.document.close    }    close subwindow, including ugly workaround for IE3 function closeWindow   {  if  isIE3  {     if window is already open, nothing appears to happen    but if not, the subwindow flashes momentarily  yech!  newWind = window.open “”,”subwindow”,”HEIGHT=200,WIDTH=200”   } if  newWind && !newWind.closed  {  newWind.close    }  }                     To complete the example of the window opening and closing, notice that the sub- window is given a button whose onClick event handler closes the main window. In Navigator 2 and Internet Explorer 3, this occurs without complaint. But in NN3+ and IE4+, the user is presented with an alert asking to confirm the closure of the main browser window.  defaultStatus  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Unless you plan to change the default statusbar text while a user spends time at  your Web page, the best time to set the property is when the document loads. In Listing 16-5, notice how I also read this property to reset the statusbar in an onMouseOut event handler. Setting the status property to empty also resets the statusbar to the defaultStatus setting.  windowObject.defaultStatus   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 132  132 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-5: Setting the Default Status Message       window.defaultStatus property    window.defaultStatus = “Welcome to my Web site.”       <A HREF=”http:  www.microsoft.com”  onMouseOver=”window.status = ‘Visit Microsoft\’s Home page.’;return true” onMouseOut=”window.status = ‘’;return true”>Microsoft   <A HREF=”http:  home.netscape.com”  onMouseOver=”window.status = ‘Visit Netscape\’s Home page.’;return true” onMouseOut=”window.status = window.defaultStatus;return true”>Netscape       If you need to display single or double quotes in the statusbar  as in the second link in Listing 16-5 , use escape characters  \’ and \”  as part of the strings being assigned to these properties.  dialogArguments  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   See Listing 16-38 for the window.showModalDialog   method to see how argu-  ments can be passed to a dialog box and retrieved via the dialogArguments property.

To run this script, you must either sign the scripts or turn on codebase principals  see Chapter 46 of the JavaScript Bible . Java must also be enabled to use the signed script statements.  As the page loads, it stores the current state of each chrome element. One but-  ton for each chrome element triggers the toggleBar   function. This function inverts the visible property for the chrome object passed as a parameter to the function. Finally, the Restore button returns visibility to their original settings. Notice that the restore   function is also called by the onUnload event handler for the document. Also, if you load this example into NN6, non-fatal script errors occur when the scrollbars are turned on or off.

The same document is loaded into each frame. A script in that document extracts info about the current frame and the entire frame- set. Figure 2-1 shows the results after loading the HTML document in Listing 16-7.  Listing 16-7: Framesetting Document for Listing 16-8       window.frames property                 A call to determine the number  length  of frames returns 0 from the point of  view of the current frame referenced. That’s because each frame here is a window that has no nested frames within it. But add the parent property to the reference, and the scope zooms out to take into account all frames generated by the parent window’s document.  windowObject.frames   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 137  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   137  Listing 16-8: Showing Various Window Properties       Window Revealer II    function gatherWindowData   {  var msg = “” msg += “ From the point of view of this frame:  ” msg += “window.frames.length: “ + window.frames.length + “ ” msg += “window.name: “ + window.name + “ ” msg += “ From the point of view of the framesetting document:  ” msg += “parent.frames.length: “ + parent.frames.length + “ ” msg += “parent.frames[0].name: “ + parent.frames[0].name return msg  }         document.write gatherWindowData           Figure 2-1: Property readouts from both frames loaded from Listing 16-7  windowObject.frames   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 138  138 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The last statement in the example shows how to use the array syntax  brackets  to refer to a specific frame. All array indexes start with 0 for the first entry. Because the document asks for the name of the first frame  parent.frames[0] , the response is JustAKid1 for both frames.  innerHeight innerWidth outerHeight outerWidth  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   Example  In Listing 16-9, a number of buttons let you see the results of setting the  innerHeight, innerWidth, outerHeight, and outerWidth properties.

One of the buttons restores the windows to these settings. Two parallel sets of but- tons set the inner and outer dimensions to the same pixel values so that you can see the effects on the overall window and document area when a script changes the various properties.  Because Navigator 4 displays different-looking buttons in different platforms  as well as other elements , the two buttons contain script instructions to size the win- dow to best display the window contents. Unfortunately, no measure of the active area of a document is available, so that the dimension values were determined by trial and error before being hard-wired into the script.  navigator  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  This book is littered with examples of using the navigator object, primarily for performing browser detection.

I’ve added an error-handling function to process the error so that it opens a separate window and fills in a textarea form element  see Figure 2-2 . If you load Listing 16-10 in NN6, some of the reporting categories report “undefined” because the browser unfortu- nately does not pass error properties to the handleError   function. A Submit button is also provided to mail the bug information to a support center e-mail address — an example of how to handle the occurrence of a bug in your scripts.

With error dialog boxes turned off, the error- handling function does not run.  windowObject.onerror   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 142  142 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  opener  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   To demonstrate the importance of the opener property, take a look at how a new  window can define itself from settings in the main window  Listing 16-11 . The doNew   function generates a small subwindow and loads the file in Listing 16-12 into the window. Notice the initial conditional statements in doNew   to make sure that if the new window already exists, it comes to the front by invoking the new window’s focus   method. You can see the results in Figure 2-3. Because the doNew   function in Listing 16-11 uses window methods and properties not avail- able in IE3, this example does not work correctly in IE3.  Listing 16-11: Contents of a Main Window Document That  Generates a Second Window       Master of all Windows    var myWind function doNew   {  if  !myWind  myWind.closed  {  myWind = window.open “lst16-12.htm”,”subWindow”,  “HEIGHT=200,WIDTH=350,resizable”      bring existing subwindow to the front myWind.focus    } else {  }  }         Select a color for a new window:  Red  Yellow  Blue     This field will be filled from an entry in another window:          windowObject.opener   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 143  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   143  The window.open   method doesn’t provide parameters for setting the new  window’s background color, so I let the getColor   function in the new window do the job as the document loads. The function uses the opener property to find out which radio button on the main page is selected.  Listing 16-12: References to the opener Property       New Window on the Block    function getColor   {     shorten the reference colorButtons = self.opener.document.forms[0].color    see which radio button is checked for  var i = 0; i < colorButtons.length; i++  {  if  colorButtons[i].checked  {  return colorButtons[i].value  }  } return “white”  }       document.write “ ”     This is a new window.    <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Who’s in the Main window?” onClick=”alert self.opener.document.title ”>  Type text here for the main window: <INPUT TYPE=”text” SIZE=25 onChange=”self.opener.document.forms[0].entry.value = this.value”>        In the getColor   function, the multiple references to the radio button array  can be very long. To simplify the references, the getColor   function starts out by assigning the radio button array to a variable I arbitrarily call colorButtons. That shorthand now stands in for lengthy references as I loop through the radio buttons to determine which button is checked and retrieve its value property.  A button in the second window simply fetches the title of the opener window’s document. Even if another document loads in the main window in the meantime, the opener reference still points to the main window: Its document object, however, will change.  windowObject.opener   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 144  144 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Figure 2-3: The main and subwindows, inextricably linked via the window.opener property  Finally, the second window contains a text input object. Enter any text there that you like and either tab or click out of the field. The onChange event handler updates the field in the opener’s document  provided that document is still loaded .  pageXOffset pageYOffset  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3   Example  The script in Listing 16-13 is an unusual construction that creates a frameset  and creates the content for each of the two frames all within a single HTML docu- ment  see “Frame Object” in Chapter 16 of the JavaScript Bible for more details . The purpose of this example is to provide you with a playground to become famil- iar with the page offset concept and how the values of these properties correspond to physical activity in a scrollable document.  In the left frame of the frameset are two fields that are ready to show the pixel  values of the right frame’s pageXOffset and pageYOffset properties. The content  windowObject.pageXOffset   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 145  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   145  of the right frame is a 30-row table of fixed width  800 pixels . Mouse click events are captured by the document level  see Chapter 18 of the JavaScript Bible , allow- ing you to click any table or cell border or outside the table to trigger the showOffsets   function in the right frame. That function is a simple script that displays the page offset values in their respective fields in the left frame.  Listing 16-13: Viewing the pageXOffset and pageYOffset  Properties       Master of all Windows    function leftFrame   {  var output = “   Page Offset Values  \n” output += “ PageXOffset:  \n” output += “PageYOffset:  \n” output += “   ” return output  }  function rightFrame   {  var output = “   \n” output += “function showOffsets   {\n” output += “parent.readout.document.forms[0].xOffset.value =  output += “parent.readout.document.forms[0].yOffset.value =  self.pageXOffset\n”  self.pageYOffset\n}\n”  output += “document.captureEvents Event.CLICK \n” output += “document.onclick = showOffsets\n” output += “    Content Page \n” output += “Scroll this frame and click on a table border to view “ +  “page offset values.  \n”  output += “ ” var oneRow = “ Cell 1  Cell 2  Cell 3 ” +         “ Cell 4  Cell 5 ”  for  var i = 1; i <= 30; i++  {  output += “   Row “ + i + “  ” + oneRow + “ ”  } output += “   ” return output  }                  windowObject.pageXOffset   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 146  146 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  To gain an understanding of how the offset values work, scroll the window  slightly in the horizontal direction and notice that the pageXOffset value increases; the same goes for the pageYOffset value as you scroll down. Remember that these values reflect the coordinate in the document that is currently under the top-left corner of the window  frame  holding the document. You can see an IE4+ version of this example in Listing 18-20  in Chapter  4 of this book . A cross-browser version would require very little browser branching.

It, in turn, sets each of two equal-size frames to the same document: Listing 16-15. This document extracts the values of several window properties, plus the document.title properties of two different window references.  Listing 16-14: Framesetting Document for Listing 16-15       The Parent Property Example    self.name = “Framesetter”                  Listing 16-15: Revealing Various Window-Related Properties       Window Revealer II    function gatherWindowData   {  var msg = “”  windowObject.parent   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 147  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   147  msg = msg + “top name: “ + top.name + “ ” msg = msg + “parent name: “ + parent.name + “ ” msg = msg + “parent.document.title: “ + parent.document.title + “ ” msg = msg + “window name: “ + window.name + “ ” msg = msg + “self name: “ + self.name + “ ” msg = msg + “self.document.title: “ + self.document.title return msg  }         document.write gatherWindowData           In the two frames  Figure 2-4 , the references to the window and self object  names return the name assigned to the frame by the frameset definition  JustAKid1 for the left frame, JustAKid2 for the right frame . In other words, from each frame’s point of view, the window object is its own frame. References to self.document.title refer only to the document loaded into that window frame. But references to the top and parent windows  which are one and the same in this example  show that those object properties are shared between both frames.  Figure 2-4: Parent and top properties being shared by both frames  windowObject.parent   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 148  148 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  A couple other fine points are worth highlighting. First, the name of the frameset-  ting window is set as Listing 16-14 loads, rather than in response to an onLoad event handler in the   tag. The reason for this is that the name must be set in time for the documents loading in the frames to get that value. If I had waited until the frameset’s onLoad event handler, the name wouldn’t be set until after the frame documents had loaded. Second, I restore the parent window’s name to an empty string when the framesetting document unloads. This is to prevent future pages from getting confused about the window name.

The application of this reference is entirely optional, but it can be helpful for reading and debugging scripts if the HTML document is to appear in one frame of a multiframe window — especially if other JavaScript code in this document refers to documents in other frames. The self reference helps anyone reading the code know precisely which frame was being addressed.  windowObject.self   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 150  150 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-16: Using the self Property       self Property    self.defaultStatus = “Welcome to my Web site.”       <A HREF=”http:   www.microsoft.com”  onMouseOver=”self.status = ‘Visit Microsoft\’s Home page.’;return true” onMouseOut=”self.status = ‘’;return true”>Microsoft   <A HREF=”http:  home.netscape.com”  onMouseOver=”self.status = ‘Visit Netscape\’s Home page.’;return true” onMouseOut=”self.status = self.defaultStatus;return true”>Netscape       status  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   In Listing 16-17, the status property is set in a handler embedded in the  onMouseOver attribute of two HTML link tags. Notice that the handler requires a return true statement  or any expression that evaluates to return true  as the last statement of the handler. This statement is required or the status message will not display, particularly in early browsers.  Listing 16-17: Links with Custom Statusbar Messages       window.status Property      <A HREF=”http:  www.dannyg.com” onMouseOver=”window.status = ‘Go to my Home page.  www.dannyg.com ’; return true”>Home   <A HREF=”http:  home.netscape.com” onMouseOver=”window.status = ‘Visit Netscape Home page.  home.netscape.com ’; return true”>Netscape       windowObject.status   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:34 AM  Page 151  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   151  As a safeguard against platform-specific anomalies that affect the behavior of onMouseOver event handlers and the window.status property, you should also include an onMouseOut event handler for links and client-side image map area objects. Such onMouseOut event handlers should set the status property to an empty string. This setting ensures that the statusbar message returns to the defaultStatus setting when the pointer rolls away from these objects. If you want to write a generalizable function that handles all window status changes, you can do so, but word the onMouseOver attribute carefully so that the event handler eval- uates to return true. Listing 16-18 shows such an alternative.  Listing 16-18: Handling Status Message Changes       Generalizable window.status Property    function showStatus msg  {  window.status = msg return true  }       <A HREF=”http:   www.dannyg.com “ onMouseOver=”return showStatus ‘Go to my Home page  www.dannyg.com .’ ” onMouseOut=”return showStatus ‘’ ”>Home   <A HREF=”http:  home.netscape.com” onMouseOver=”return showStatus ‘Visit Netscape Home page.’ ” onMouseOut=”return showStatus ‘’ ”>Netscape       Notice how the event handlers return the results of the showStatus   method  to the event handler, allowing the entire handler to evaluate to return true.  One final example of setting the statusbar  shown in Listing 16-19  also demon-  strates how to create a simple scrolling banner in the statusbar.

The scrollMsg   function uses more advanced JavaScript concepts, such as the window.setTimeout   method  covered later in this chapter  and string methods  covered in Chapter 34 of the JavaScript Bible . To speed the pace at which the words scroll across the statusbar, reduce the value of delay.  Many Web surfers  myself included  don’t care for these scrollers that run for-  ever in the statusbar. Rolling the mouse over links disturbs the banner display. Scrollers can also crash earlier browsers, because the setTimeout   method eats application memory in Navigator 2. Use scrolling bars sparingly or design them to run only a few times after the document loads.  Tip  Setting the status property with onMouseOver event handlers has had a check- ered career along various implementations in Navigator. A script that sets the sta- tusbar is always in competition against the browser itself, which uses the statusbar to report loading progress. When a “hot” area on a page is at the edge of a frame, many times the onMouseOut event fails to fire, thus preventing the statusbar from clearing itself. Be sure to torture test any such implementations before declaring your page ready for public access.  windowObject.status   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 153  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   153  Methods  alert “message”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The parameter for the example in Listing 16-20 is a concatenated string.

Whenever the window is capturing click events, the flash   function runs. In that function, the event is examined so that only if the Control key is also being held down and the name of the button starts with “button” does the document background color flash red. For all click events  that is, those directed at objects on the page capable of their own onClick event handlers , the click is pro- cessed with the routeEvent   method to make sure the target buttons execute their own onClick event handlers.

One  button starts a countdown timer coded to last one minute  easily modifiable for other durations ; the other button interrupts the timer at any time while it is run- ning. When the minute is up, an alert dialog box lets you know.

These values are needed inside multiple functions, so they are initialized outside of the functions.  Figure 2-6: The countdown timer page as it displays the time remaining  In the startTimer   function, you switch the running flag on, meaning that the timer should be going. Using some date functions  see Chapter 36 of the JavaScript Bible , you extract the current time in milliseconds and add the number of millisec- onds for the next minute  the extra multiplication by one is the place where you can change the amount to the desired number of minutes . With the end time stored in a global variable, the function now calls another function that compares the current and end times and displays the difference in the text field.  Early in the showCountDown   function, check to see if the timer has wound  down. If so, you stop the timer and alert the user. Otherwise, the function continues to calculate the difference between the two times and formats the time in mm:ss format. As long as the running flag is set to true, the function sets the one-second timeout timer before repeating itself. To stop the timer before it has run out  in the stopTimer   function , the most important step is to cancel the timeout running inside the browser. The clearTimeout   method uses the global timerID value to do that. Then the function turns off the running switch and zeros out the display. When you run the timer, you may occasionally notice that the time skips a sec-  ond. It’s not cheating. It just takes slightly more than one second to wait for the timeout and then finish the calculations for the next second’s display. What you’re seeing is the display catching up with the real time left.  close    NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   windowObject.close     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 158  158 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Example  See Listing 16-4  for the window.closed property , which provides an elaborate,  cross-platform, bug-accommodating example of applying the window.close   method across multiple windows. confirm “message”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The example in Listing 16-23 shows the user interface part of how you can use a confirm dialog box to query a user before clearing a table full of user-entered data.

The moveOffScreen   function momentarily moves the window entirely out of view. Notice how the script determines the size of the screen before deciding where to move the window. After the journey off screen, the window comes back into view at the upper-left corner of the screen.  If using the Web sometimes seems like going around in circles, then the second function, revolve  , should feel just right. After reducing the size of the window and positioning it near the top center of the screen, the script uses a bit of math to position the window along 36 places around a perfect circle  at 10-degree incre- ments . This is an example of how to control a window’s position dynamically based on math calculations. IE complicates the job a bit by not providing proper- ties that reveal the outside dimensions of the browser window.  To demonstrate the moveBy   method, the third function, zigzag  , uses a for loop to increment the coordinate points to make the window travel in a saw tooth pattern across the screen. The x coordinate continues to increment linearly until the window is at the edge of the screen  also calculated on the fly to accommodate any size monitor . The y coordinate must increase and decrease as that parameter changes direction at various times across the screen.  In the fourth function, you see some practical code  finally  that demonstrates  how best to simulate maximizing the browser window to fill the entire available screen space on the visitor’s monitor.  navigate “URL”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Supply any valid URL as the parameter to the method, as in  window.navigate “http:  www.dannyg.com”   open “URL”, “windowName” [, “windowFeatures”][,replaceFlag]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The page rendered by Listing 16-26 displays a single button that generates a new  window of a specific size that has only the statusbar turned on. The script here  windowObject.open     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 164  164 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  shows all the elements necessary to create a new window that has all the right stuff on most platforms. The new window object reference is assigned to a global vari- able, newWindow. Before a new window is generated, the script looks to see if the window has never been generated before  in which case newWindow would be null  or, for newer browsers, the window is closed. If either condition is true, the window is created with the open   method. Otherwise, the existing window is brought forward with the focus   method  NN3+ and IE4+ .  As a safeguard against older browsers, the script manually adds an opener prop-  erty to the new window if one is not already assigned by the open   method. The current window object reference is assigned to that property.  Due to the timing problem that afflicts all IE generations, the HTML assembly and writing to the new window is separated into its own function that is invoked after a 50 millisecond delay  NN goes along for the ride, but it could accommodate the assembly and writing without the delay . To build the string that is eventually writ- ten to the document, I use the +=  add-by-value  operator, which appends the string on the right side of the operator to the string stored in the variable on the left side. In this example, the new window is handed an  -level line of text to display.  Listing 16-26: Creating a New Window       New Window    var newWindow function makeNewWindow   {  if  !newWindow  newWindow.closed  {  newWindow = window.open “”,””,”status,height=200,width=300”  if  !newWindow.opener  { newWindow.opener = window }    force small delay for IE to catch up setTimeout “writeToWindow  ”, 50   } else {  }     window’s already open; bring to front newWindow.focus    } function writeToWindow   {     assemble content for new window var newContent = “   One Sub Window  ” newContent += “  This window is brand new. ” newContent += “  ”    write HTML to new window document newWindow.document.write newContent  newWindow.document.close      close layout stream  }          windowObject.open     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 165  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   165  <INPUT TYPE=”button” NAME=”newOne” VALUE=”Create New Window” onClick=”makeNewWindow  ”>        If you need to create a new window for the lowest common denominator of  scriptable browser, you will have to omit the focus   method and the window.closed property from the script  as well as add the NN2 bug workaround described earlier . Or you may prefer to forego a subwindow for all browsers below a certain level. See Listing 16-3  in the window.closed property discussion  for other ideas about cross-browser authoring for subwindows.

Because clicking the button leads to a dialog box that requires more information from the user, the button’s label ends in an ellipsis  or, rather, three periods acting as an ellipsis char- acter . The ellipsis is a common courtesy to let users know that a user interface ele- ment leads to a dialog box of some sort. As in similar situations in Windows and Macintosh programs, the user should be able to cancel out of that dialog box and return to the same screen state that existed before the button was clicked.  resizeBy deltaX,deltaY  resizeTo outerwidth,outerheight   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  You can experiment with the resize methods with the page in Listing 16-30.

A series of buttons and text fields in the control panel frame directs the scrolling of the document. I’ve selected an arbitrary, large GIF image to use in the example. To see results of some horizontal scrolling values, you may need to shrink the width of the browser window until a horizontal scrollbar appears in the top frame. Figure 2-9 shows the results in a shrunken window with modest horizon- tal and vertical scroll values entered into the bottom text boxes. If you substitute scrollTo   for the scroll   methods in Listing 16-33, the results will be the same, but you will need version browsers at a minimum to run it.

Listing 16-37 shows the control panel document. Many functions here control the interval, scrolling jump size, and direction, and they demonstrate several aspects of applying setInterval  .  Notice that in the beginning the script establishes a number of global variables.  Three of them are parameters that control the scrolling; the last one is for the ID value returned by the setInterval   method. The script needs that value to be a global value so that a separate function can halt the scrolling with the clearInterval   method.  All scrolling is performed by the autoScroll   function. For the sake of simplic- ity, all controlling parameters are global variables. In this application, placement of those values in global variables helps the page restart autoscrolling with the same parameters as it had when it last ran.  Listing 16-37: setInterval   Control Panel       ScrollBy Controller    var scrollSpeed = 500 var scrollJump = 1 var scrollDirection = “down” var intervalID  function autoScroll   {  if  scrollDirection == “down”  {  scrollJump = Math.abs scrollJump   } else if  scrollDirection == “up” && scrollJump > 0  {  scrollJump = -scrollJump  } parent.display.scrollBy 0, scrollJump  if  parent.display.pageYOffset <= 0  {  windowObject.setInterval     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 175  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   175  clearInterval intervalID   }  }  function reduceInterval   {  stopScroll   scrollSpeed -= 200 startScroll    } function increaseInterval   {  stopScroll   scrollSpeed += 200 startScroll    } function reduceJump   {  scrollJump -= 2  } function increaseJump   {  scrollJump += 2  } function swapDirection   {  } function startScroll   {  scrollDirection =  scrollDirection == “down”  ? “up” : “down”  parent.display.scrollBy 0, scrollJump  if  intervalID  {  clearInterval intervalID   } intervalID = setInterval “autoScroll  ”,scrollSpeed   } function stopScroll   {  clearInterval intervalID   }        AutoScroll by setInterval   Controller           <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Longer Time Interval” onClick=”increaseInterval  ”>                 windowObject.setInterval     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 176  176 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The setInterval   method is invoked inside the startScroll   function.  This function initially “burps” the page by one scrollJump interval so that the test in autoScroll   for the page being scrolled all the way to the top doesn’t halt a page from scrolling before it gets started. Notice, too, that the function checks for the existence of an interval ID. If one is there, it is cleared before the new one is set. This is crucial within the design of the example page, because repeated clicking of the Start Scrolling button triggers multiple interval timers inside the browser. Only the most recent one’s ID would be stored in intervalID, allowing no way to clear the older ones. But this little side trip makes sure that only one interval timer is running. One of the global variables, scrollSpeed, is used to fill the delay parame- ter for setInterval  . To change this value on the fly, the script must stop the current interval process, change the scrollSpeed value, and start a new process. The intensely repetitive nature of this application is nicely handled by the setInterval   method.  setTimeout “expr”, msecDelay [, language]  setTimeout functionRef, msecDelay [,  funcarg1, ..., funcargn]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  When you load the HTML page in Listing 16-38, it triggers the updateTime    function, which displays the time  in hh:mm am pm format  in the statusbar. Instead of showing the seconds incrementing one by one  which may be distracting to someone trying to read the page , this function alternates the last character of the display between an asterisk and nothing, like a visual “heartbeat.”  Listing 16-38: Display the Current Time       Status Bar Clock    <!-- var flasher = false    calculate current time, determine flasher state,    and insert time into status bar every second function updateTime   { var now = new Date   var theHour = now.getHours   var theMin = now.getMinutes   var theTime = “” +   theHour > 12  ? theHour - 12 : theHour  theTime +=   theMin < 10  ? “:0” : “:”  + theMin  windowObject.setTimeout     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 177  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   177  theTime  +=  theHour >= 12  ? “ pm” : “ am” theTime +=   flasher  ? “ “ : “*”  flasher = !flasher window.status = theTime    recursively call this function every second to keep timer going timerID = setTimeout “updateTime  ”,1000   }   -->             In this function, the setTimeout   method works in the following way: Once the  current time  including the flasher status  appears in the statusbar, the function waits approximately one second  1,000 milliseconds  before calling the same func- tion again. You don’t have to clear the timerID value in this application because JavaScript does it for you every time the 1,000 milliseconds elapse.  A logical question to ask is whether this application should be using  setInterval   instead of setTimeout  . This is a case in which either one does the job. To use setInterval   here would require that the interval process start outside of the updateTime   function, because you need only one process running that repeatedly calls updateTime  . It would be a cleaner implementation in that regard, instead of the tons of timeout processes spawned by Listing 16-38. On the other hand, the application would not run in any browsers before NN4 or IE4, as Listing 16-38 does.  To demonstrate passing parameters, you can modify the updateTime   function  to add the number of times it gets invoked to the display in the statusbar. For that to work, the function must have a parameter variable so that it can catch a new value each time it is invoked by setTimeout  ’s expression. For all browsers, the function would be modified as follows  unchanged lines are represented by the ellipsis : function updateTime i  {  ... window.status = theTime + “   “ + i + “ ”    pass updated counter value with next call to this function timerID = setTimeout “updateTime “ + i+1 + “ ”,1000   }  If you were running this exclusively in NN4+, you could use its more convenient way of passing parameters to the function: timerID = setTimeout updateTime,1000, i+1  In either case, the onLoad event handler would also have to be modified to get the ball rolling with an initial parameter: onLoad = “updateTime 0 ”  windowObject.setTimeout     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 178  178 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Caution  One  warning  about  setTimeout   functions  that  dive  into  themselves  as  fre- quently as this one does: Each call eats up a bit more memory for the browser application in Navigator 2. If you let this clock run for a while, some browsers may encounter  memory  difficulties,  depending  on  which  operating  system  they’re using. But considering the amount of time the typical user spends on Web pages  even if only 10 or 15 minutes , the function shouldn’t present a problem. And any reloading  invoked  by  the  user   such  as  by  resizing  the  window  in  Navigator  2  frees up memory once again.  showModalDialog “URL”[, arguments] [, features]  showModelessDialog “URL”[, arguments] [, features]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE5  IE5.5  IE4    cid:3     cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  To demonstrate the two styles of dialog boxes, I have implemented the same  functionality  setting some session visual preferences  for both modal and mode- less dialog boxes. This tactic shows you how to pass data back and forth between the main page and both styles of dialog box windows.  The first example demonstrates how to use a modal dialog box. In the process, data is passed into the dialog box window and values are returned. Listing 16-39 is the HTML and scripting for the main page. A button’s onClick event handler invokes a function that opens the modal dialog box. The dialog box’s document  Listing 16-40  contains several form elements for entering a user name and selecting a few color styles for the main page.  Data from the dialog is fashioned into an array to be sent back to the main window. That array is initially assigned to a local variable, prefs, as the dialog box closes. If the user cancels the dialog box, the returned value is an empty string, so nothing more in getPrefsData   executes. But when the user clicks OK, the array comes back. Each of the array items is read and assigned to its respective form value or style property. These values are also preserved in the global currPrefs array. This allows the settings to be sent to the modal dialog box  as the second parameter to showModalDialog    the next time the dialog box is opened.  Listing 16-39: Main Page for showModalDialog         window.setModalDialog   Method    var currPrefs = new Array    windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 179  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   179  function getPrefsData   {  var prefs = showModalDialog “lst16-40.htm”, currPrefs,  “dialogWidth:400px; dialogHeight:300px”   if  prefs  {  if  prefs[“name”]  {  document.all.firstName.innerText = prefs[“name”] currPrefs[“name”] = prefs[“name”]  } if  prefs[“bgColor”]  {  } if  prefs[“textColor”]  {  } if  prefs[“h1Size”]  {  document.body.style.backgroundColor = prefs[“bgColor”] currPrefs[“bgColor”] = prefs[“bgColor”]  document.body.style.color = prefs[“textColor”] currPrefs[“textColor”] = prefs[“textColor”]  document.all.welcomeHeader.style.fontSize = prefs[“h1Size”] currPrefs[“h1Size”] = prefs[“h1Size”]  }  }  } function init   {  }    document.all.firstName.innerText = “friend”       window.setModalDialog   Method     Welcome,  &nbsp; !     Use this button to set style preferences for this page:   Preferences        The dialog box’s document, shown in Listing 16-40, is responsible for reading the  incoming data  and setting the form elements accordingly  and assembling form data for return to the main window’s script. Notice when you load the example that the TITLE element of the dialog box’s document appears in the dialog box window’s title bar.  When the page loads into the dialog box window, the init   function examines the window.dialogArguments property. If it has any data, the data is used to pre- set the form elements to mirror the current settings of the main page. A utility func- tion, setSelected  , pre-selects the option of a SELECT element to match the current settings.  windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 180  180 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Buttons at the bottom of the page are explicitly positioned to be at the lower- right corner of the window. Each button invokes a function to do what is needed to close the dialog box. In the case of the OK button, the handleOK   function sets the window.returnValue property to the data that come back from the getFormData   function. This latter function reads the form element values and packages them in an array using the form elements’ names as array indices. This helps keep everything straight back in the main window’s script, which uses the index names, and is therefore not dependent upon the precise sequence of the form elements in the dialog box window.  Listing 16-40: Document for the Modal Dialog       User Preferences       Close the dialog function closeme   {  window.close       Handle click of OK button function handleOK   {  window.returnValue = getFormData   closeme       Handle click of Cancel button function handleCancel   {  window.returnValue = “” closeme    }  }  }  }    Generic function converts form element name-value pairs    into an array function getFormData   {  var form = document.prefs var returnedData = new Array      Harvest values for each type of form element for  var i = 0; i < form.elements.length; i++  {  if  form.elements[i].type == “text”  {  returnedData[form.elements[i].name] = form.elements[i].value  } else if  form.elements[i].type.indexOf “select”  != -1  {  returnedData[form.elements[i].name] =  form.elements[i].options[form.elements[i].selectedIndex].value  } else if  form.elements[i].type == “radio”  {  returnedData[form.elements[i].name] = form.elements[i].value  } else if  form.elements[i].type == “checkbox”  {  returnedData[form.elements[i].name] = form.elements[i].value  } else continue  } return returnedData  windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 181  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   181     Initialize by setting form elements from passed data function init   {  if  window.dialogArguments  {  var args = window.dialogArguments var form = document.prefs if  args[“name”]  {  form.name.value = args[“name”]  } if  args[“bgColor”]  {  setSelected form.bgColor, args[“bgColor”]   } if  args[“textColor”]  {  } if  args[“h1Size”]  {  setSelected form.textColor, args[“textColor”]   setSelected form.h1Size, args[“h1Size”]   }    Utility function to set a SELECT element to one value function setSelected select, value  {  for  var i = 0; i < select.options.length; i++  {  if  select.options[i].value == value  {  select.selectedIndex = i break  }  }  }      } return  }    Utility function to accept a press of the    Enter key in the text field as a click of OK function checkEnter   {  if  window.event.keyCode == 13  {  handleOK        }  }         Web Site Preferences           Enter your first name:<INPUT NAME=”name” TYPE=”text” VALUE=”” SIZE=20 onKeyDown=”checkEnter  ”>       Select a background color:     Beige  Antique White  Continued  windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 182  182 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-40  continued    Goldenrod  Lime  Powder Blue  Slate Gray          Select a text color:     Black  White  Navy Blue  Dark Orange  Sea Green  Teal          Select “Welcome” heading font point size:     12  14  18  24  32  48             OK &nbsp;&nbsp;  Cancel         One last convenience feature of the dialog box window is the onKeyPress event handler in the text box. The function it invokes looks for the Enter key. If that key is pressed while the box has focus, the same handleOK   function is invoked, as if the user had clicked the OK button. This feature makes the dialog box behave as if the OK button is an automatic default, just as “real” dialog boxes.  You should observe several important structural changes that were made to turn  the modal approach into a modeless one. Listing 16-41 shows the version of the main window modified for use with a modeless dialog box. Another global variable, prefsDlog, is initialized to eventually store the reference to the modeless window  windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 183  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   183  returned by the showModelessWindow   method. The variable gets used to invoke the init   function inside the modeless dialog box, but also as conditions in an if construction surrounding the generation of the dialog box. The reason this is needed is to prevent multiple instances of the dialog box being created  the button is still alive while the modeless window is showing . The dialog box won’t be created again as long as there is a value in prefsDlog, and the dialog box window has not been closed  picking up the window.closed property of the dialog box window . The showModelessDialog   method’s second parameter is a reference to the  function in the main window that updates the main document. As you see in a moment, that function is invoked from the dialog box when the user clicks the OK or Apply buttons.  Listing 16-41: Main Page for showModelessDialog         window.setModelessDialog   Method    var currPrefs = new Array   var prefsDlog function getPrefsData   {  if  !prefsDlog  prefsDlog.closed  {  prefsDlog = showModelessDialog “lst16-42.htm”, setPrefs, “dialogWidth:400px; dialogHeight:300px”  prefsDlog.init currPrefs   }  }  function setPrefs prefs  { if  prefs[“bgColor”]  {  document.body.style.backgroundColor = prefs[“bgColor”] currPrefs[“bgColor”] = prefs[“bgColor”]  } if  prefs[“textColor”]  {  document.body.style.color = prefs[“textColor”] currPrefs[“textColor”] = prefs[“textColor”]  } if  prefs[“h1Size”]  {  } if  prefs[“name”]  {  document.all.welcomeHeader.style.fontSize = prefs[“h1Size”] currPrefs[“h1Size”] = prefs[“h1Size”]  document.all.firstName.innerText = prefs[“name”] currPrefs[“name”] = prefs[“name”]  }  }  function init   {  }    document.all.firstName.innerText = “friend”  Continued  windowObject.showModalDialog     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 184  184 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 16-41  continued        window.setModelessDialog   Method     Welcome,  &nbsp; !     Use this button to set style preferences for this page:   Preferences        Changes to the dialog box window document for a modeless version  Listing 16-42  are rather limited. A new button is added to the bottom of the screen for an Apply but- ton. As in many dialog box windows you see in Microsoft products, the Apply button lets current settings in dialog boxes be applied to the current document but without closing the dialog box. This approach makes experimenting with settings easier.  The Apply button invokes a handleApply   function, which works the same as handleOK  , except the dialog box is not closed. But these two functions communi- cate back to the main window differently than a modal dialog box. The main window’s processing function is passed as the second parameter of showModelessDialog   and is available as the window.dialogArguments property in the dialog box win- dow’s script. That function reference is assigned to a local variable in both functions, and the remote function is invoked, passing the results of the getFormData   func- tion as parameter values back to the main window.

Some designers insist that modality has no place in a graphical user interface; others say that there are times when you need to focus the user on a very specific task before any further processing can take place. That’s where a modal dialog box makes perfect sense.  sizeToContent    NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  in NN6 to try the  sizeToContent   method. Assuming that you are running The Evaluator from the Chap13 directory on the CD-ROM  or the directory copied as-is to your hard disk , you can open a subwindow with one of the other files in the directory, and then size the subwindow. Enter the following statements into the top text box: a = window.open “lst13-02.htm”,””  a.sizeToContent    The resized subwindow is at the minimum recommended width for a browser win-  dow, and at a height tall enough to display the little bit of content in the document.  windowObject.sizeToContent     4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 188  188 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Event handlers  onAfterPrint onBeforePrint  Compatibility  Example  onBeforeUnload  Compatibility  Example  on the page.

If  the script is executing in one of the frames of the frameset, add a reference to parent in the preceding statements. contentDocument  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  A framesetting document script might be using the ID of a FRAME element to  read or adjust one of the element properties, and then need to perform some action on the content of the page through its document object. You can get the reference to the document object via a statement, such as the following: var doc = document.getElementById “FRAME3” .contentDocument  Then your script can, for example, dive into a form in the document:  var val = doc.mainForm.entry.value  FRAME.contentDocument   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 191  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   191  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Document  Compatibility  Example  While you have far easier ways to reach the document object of another frame   parent.otherFrameName.document , the following statement takes the long way to get there to retrieve the number of forms in the document of another frame: var formCount = parent.document.all.contentsFrame.Document.forms.length  Using the Document property only truly makes sense when a function is passed a  FRAME or IFRAME element object reference as a parameter, and the script must, among other things more related to those objects, access the document contained by those elements. frameBorder  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The default value for the frameBorder property is yes. You can use this setting to create a toggle script  which, unfortunately, does not change the appearance in IE . The W3C-compatible version looks like the following: function toggleFrameScroll frameID  {  var theFrame = document.getElementById frameID  if  theFrame.frameBorder == “yes”  {  theFrame.frameBorder = “no”  } else {  theFrame.frameBorder    = “yes”  }  }  height width  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   FRAME.height   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 192  192 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Example  The following fragment assumes a frameset defined with two frames set up as  two columns within the frameset. The statements here live in the framesetting doc- ument. They retrieve the current width of the left frame and increase the width of that frame by ten percent. Syntax shown here is for the W3C DOM, but can be easily adapted to IE-only terminology. var frameWidth = document.getElementById “leftFrame” .width document.getElementById “mainFrameset” .cols =  Math.round frameWidth * 1.1   + “,*”  Notice how the numeric value of the existing frame width is first increased by ten  percent and then concatenated to the rest of the string property assigned to the frameset’s cols property. The asterisk after the comma means that the browser should figure out the remaining width and assign it to the right-hand frame.  noResize  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The following statement turns off the ability for a frame to be resized:  parent.document.getElementById “myFrame1” .noResize = true  Because of the negative nature of the property name, it may be difficult to keep the logic straight  setting noResize to true means that resizability is turned off . Keep a watchful eye on your Boolean values.  scrolling  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Listing 16-45 produces a frameset consisting of eight frames. The content for the frames is generated by a script within the frameset  via the fillFrame   function . Event handlers in the Body of each frame invoke the toggleFrameScroll   func- tion. Both ways of referencing the FRAME element object are shown, with the IE- only version commented out.  FRAME.scrolling   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 193  Chapter 2 ✦ Window and Frame Objects  Chapter 16   193  In the toggleFrameScroll   function, the if condition checks whether the  property is set to something other than no. This allows the condition to evaluate to true if the property is set to either auto  the first time  or yes  as set by the func- tion . Note that the scrollbars don’t disappear from the frames in IE5.5 or NN6.

The final document is an HTML version of the U.S. Bill of Rights, which is serving here as a content frame for the demonstration.  The frameset listing  16-46  shows a three-frame setup. Down the left column is a table of contents  16-47 . The right column is divided into two rows. In the top row is a simple control  16-48  that hides and shows the table of contents frame. As the user clicks the hot text of the control  located inside a SPAN element , the onClick event handler invokes the toggleTOC   function in the frameset. Figure 2-10 shows the frameset with the menu exposed.  Figure 2-10: Frameset specifications are modified on the fly when you click on the top control link.    FRAMESET.cols   4855-7 ch02.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 196  196 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Syntax used in this example is W3C-compatible. To modify this for IE-only, you replace document.getElementById “outerFrameset”  with document.all. outerFrameset and elem.firstChild.nodeValue to elem.innerText. You can also branch within the scripts to accommodate both styles.  Listing 16-46: Frameset and Script for Hiding Showing a  Frame       Hide Show Frame Example      var origCols function toggleTOC elem, frm  {  if  origCols  {  showTOC elem   } else {  hideTOC elem, frm   } function hideTOC elem, frm  {  }  }  var frameset = document.getElementById “outerFrameset”  origCols = frameset.cols frameset.cols = “0,*”  } function showTOC elem  {  if  origCols  {  document.getElementById “outerFrameset” .cols = origCols origCols = null  }                        When a user clicks the hot spot to hide the frame, the script copies the original cols property settings to a global variable. The variable is used in showTOC   to restore the frameset to its original proportions. This allows a designer to modify the HTML for the frameset without also having to dig into scripts to hard-wire the restored size.

A click of the button on the page invokes the selfTimer   function, which acts as the main routine for this page. The goal is to produce a pop-up window that “self-destructs” five seconds after it appears. Along the way, a message in the pop- up counts down the seconds.  A reference to the pop-up window is preserved as a global variable, called  popup. After the popup object is created, the initContent   function stuffs the content into the pop-up by way of assigning style properties and some innerHTML for the body of the document that is automatically created when the pop-up is gen- erated. A SPAN element is defined so that another function later on can modify the content of just that segment of text in the pop-up. Notice that the assignment of content to the pop-up is predicated on the pop-up window having been initialized  by virtue of the popup variable having a value assigned to it  and that the pop-up window is not showing. While invoking initContent   under any other circum- stances is probably impossible, the validation of the desired conditions is good pro- gramming practice.  Back in selfTimer  , the popup object is displayed. Defining the desired size  requires some trial and error to make sure the pop-up window comfortably accom- modates the text that is put into the pop-up in the initContent   function.  With the pop-up window showing, now is the time to invoke the countDown   function. Before the function performs any action, it validates that the pop-up has been initialized and is still visible. If a user clicks the main window while the counter is counting down, this changes the value of the isOpen property to false, and nothing inside the if condition executes.  This countDown   function grabs the inner text of the SPAN and uses  paresInt   to extract just the integer number  using base 10 numbering, because we’re dealing with zero-leading numbers that can potentially be regarded as octal values . The condition of the if construction decreases the retrieved integer by one.

But if the value is other than zero, then the inner text of the SPAN is set to the decremented value  with a leading zero , and the setTimeout   method is called upon to rein- voke the countDown   function in one second  1000 milliseconds .

Because a pop-up window automatically goes away if a user clicks the main window, it is highly unlikely that the hide   method would ever be invoked by itself in response to user action in the main window. If you want a script in the pop-up window to close the pop-up, use parentWindow.close  .  ✦  ✦  ✦  popupObject.hide     4855-7 ch03.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 205  33C H A P T E R  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  In This Chapter  Loading new pages and other media types via the location object  Passing data between pages via URLs  Navigating through the browser history under script control  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  Location and History Objects  Chapter 17  While both the location and history objects contain  valuable information about the user’s Web surfing  habits and even the content of forms, they could also be abused by nefarious scripts that wish to invade the privacy of unsuspecting site visitors. As a result, browsers do not expose the private details to scripts  except in NN4+ via signed scripts and the user’s express permission .   The location object, however, is still an important object to know and exploit. As shown in the examples here, you can use it as one cookie-free way to pass text data from one page to another. And the object remains the primary way scripts load a new page into the browser.  Examples Highlights  ✦ The frameset listing for the location.host property  demonstrates several location object properties. You also find an example of how signed scripts can be used in NN4+ to access location object properties for pages served by a different domain.  ✦ Listings for the location.search property pass data  from one page to another via a URL. In this case, a script in a page not only makes sure that your site gets served within the prescribed frameset, but the specific page also gets loaded into one of the frames, even if it is not the page specified in the frameset’s definition.   ✦ Observe the location.replace   method’s example. This method comes in handy when you don’t want one of your pages to become part of the browser’s history: Clicking the Back button skips over the replaced page.   ✦ Run Listings 17-12 and 17-13 for the history.back   method to see how the behavior of this method varies among browsers. Consult the JavaScript Bible text for details on the evolution of this method.   4855-7 ch03.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 206  206 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Location Object  Properties  hash  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  When you load the script in Listing 17-1, adjust the size of the browser window so only one section is visible at a time.

Instead of going through the work of assembling a window.location value in the function by appending a literal hash mark and the value for the anchor, here I simply modify the hash property of the current window’s location. This is the pre- ferred, cleaner method.  If you attempt to read back the window.location.hash property in an added line of script, however, the window’s actual URL probably will not have been updated yet, and the browser will appear to be giving your script false information. To prevent this problem in subsequent statements of the same function, construct the URLs of those statements from the same variable values you use to set the window.location.hash property — don’t rely on the browser to give you the values you expect.

But with the help of the search string, you can reuse the same framesetting document to accommodate any number of content pages that go into one of the frames  rather than specifying a separate frameset for each possible combination of pages in the frameset . The listings in this section create a simple example of how to force a page to load in a frameset by passing some information about the page to the frameset. Thus, if a user has a URL to one of the content frames  perhaps it has been bookmarked by right-clicking the frame or it comes up as a search engine result , the page appears in its designated frameset the next time the user visits the page.  The fundamental task going on in this scheme has two parts. The first is in each  of the content pages where a script checks whether the page is loaded inside a frameset. If the frameset is missing, then a search string is composed and appended  windowObject.location.search   4855-7 ch03.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 214  214 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  to the URL for the framesetting document. The framesetting document has its own short script that looks for the presence of the search string. If the string is there, then the script extracts the search string data and uses it to load that specific page into the content frame of the frameset.  Listing 17-6 is the framesetting document. The getSearchAsArray   function is more complete than necessary for this simple example, but you can use it in other instances to convert any number of name value pairs passed in the search string  in traditional format of name1=value1&name2=value2&etc.  into an array whose indexes are the names  making it easier for scripts to extract a specific piece of passed data . Version branching takes place because, for convenience, the getSearchAsArray   function uses text and array methods that don’t exist in browsers prior to NN3 or IE4.  Listing 17-6: A Smart Frameset       Example Frameset       Convert location.search into an array of values    indexed by name. function getSearchAsArray   {  var minNav3 =  navigator.appName == “Netscape” &&   parseInt navigator.appVersion  >= 3   var minIE4 =  navigator.appName.indexOf “Microsoft”  >= 0 &&  parseInt navigator.appVersion  >= 4   var minDOM = minNav3  minIE4      baseline DOM required for this function var results = new Array   if  minDOM  {  var input = unescape location.search.substr 1   if  input  {  var srchArray = input.split “&”  var tempArray = new Array   for  var i = 0; i < srchArray.length; i++  {  tempArray = srchArray[i].split “=”  results[tempArray[0]] = tempArray[1]  } return results  } function loadFrame   {  if  location.search  {  }  }  }  }  }      windowObject.location.search  var srchArray = getSearchAsArray   if  srchArray[“content”]  {  self.content.location.href = srchArray[“content”]   4855-7 ch03.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 215  Chapter 3 ✦ Location and History Objects  Chapter 17   215               Listing 17-7 is the HTML for the table of contents frame. Nothing elaborate goes on here, but you can see how normal navigation works for this simplified frameset.  Listing 17-7: The Table of Contents       Table of Contents       Table of Contents        Page 1     Page 2     Page 3          Listing 17-8 shows one of the content pages. As the page loads, the  checkFrameset   function is invoked. If the window does not load inside a frame- set, then the script navigates to the framesetting page, passing the current content URL as a search string. Notice that for browsers that support the location. replace   method, the loading of this page on its own does not get recorded to the browser’s history and isn’t accessed if the user hits the Back button.  Listing 17-8: A Content Page       Page 1    function checkFrameset   {  var minNav3 =  navigator.appName == “Netscape” &&   parseInt navigator.appVersion  >= 3   var minIE4 =  navigator.appName.indexOf “Microsoft”  >= 0 &&  parseInt navigator.appVersion  >= 4   Continued  windowObject.location.search   4855-7 ch03.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 216  216 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 17-8  continued   var minDOM = minNav3  minIE4      baseline DOM required for this function var isNav4 =  navigator.appName == “Netscape” &&   parseInt navigator.appVersion  == 4   if  parent == window  {     Don’t do anything if running NN4     so that the frame can be printed on its own if  isNav4 && window.innerWidth == 0  {     Use replace   to keep current page out of history location.replace “lst17-06.htm?content=” + escape location.href    location.href = “ lst17-06.htm?content=” + escape location.href   return  } if  minDOM  {  } else {  }  }  }    Invoke the function checkFrameset          Page 1         In practice, I recommend placing the code for the checkFrameset   function and call to it inside an external .js library and linking that library into each content doc- ument of the frameset. That’s why the function assigns the generic location.href property to the search string — you can use it on any content page.

It also preserves the visible properties of form elements. The Hard Reload button invokes the location.reload   method, which resets all objects to their default settings.

The document object has been with us since the beginning. Even though it is an abstract object  that is to say, the object exists simply by virtue of a page loading into the browser, rather than associated with any HTML tag , a number of its properties reflect attributes that are defined in a page’s   tag. For instance, the prop- erties for link colors and background images, whose behaviors are set in BODY element attributes, have been exposed via the document object since the earliest days.  In more modern object models  IE4+ and W3C DOM , the  BODY element is its own object. The document object strengthens its role as a “super-container” of all the HTML ele- ment objects in the page. Thus, the BODY element object is a child element of the root document object  see Chapter 14 of the JavaScript Bible for more details . But now that the BODY element object can expose its own attributes as properties, the document object no longer needs to play that role, except for the sake of backward compatibility with scripts written for older browsers. Instead, the document object assumes an even greater role, especially in the W3C DOM, by providing critical properties and methods of a global nature for the entire document.   4855-7 ch04.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 224  224 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  It is clear, of course, that the BODY element has an important role to play. Both the IE4+ and W3C DOMs expose the document.body property, which returns a ref- erence to the BODY element of the current document. The IE4+ DOM, however, bestows even more importance to the BODY element, by forcing it to be the frame of reference for how much a document’s content scrolls inside a window or frame. All other DOMs put that control into the hands of the window  that is, scrolling the window rather than the BODY element inside the window .  Examples Highlights  ✦ Observe in Listing 18-1 how  backward-compatible  document object proper- ties for various colors  alinkColor and the like  impact the look of the page. It may be even more important to experience the lack of dynamic control that these properties provide in a variety of browsers.  ✦ See how IE4+ Windows exposes date information about the document in  Listing 18-4.  ✦ Listings 18-11 and 18-12 provide a workshop to let you test how well your tar- get browsers support the document.referrer property. You may need to put them on your server for the real test. Unfortunately, IE Windows doesn’t always provide the desired information.  ✦ If you script for W3C-DOM compatibility, be sure to grasp the  document.getElementById   and document.getElementsByName   meth- ods with the help of the example steps provided.  ✦ The document.write   method is one of the most important ones in the  vocabulary. Listings 18-16 through 18-18 demonstrate its power.  ✦ See examples for document.body.scrollLeft and  document.body.doScroll   to control document scrolling in IE, and the onScroll event handler example  Listing 18-21  to see how to keep a page scrolled at a fixed position.

The smaller window displays a dummy button so that you can see how its display contrasts with color settings. Notice that the script sets the colors of the smaller window by rewriting the entire window’s HTML code. After changing colors, the script displays the color values in the original window’s textarea. Even though some colors are set with the color constant values, proper- ties come back in the hexadecimal triplet values. You can experiment to your heart’s content by changing color values in the listing. Every time you change the values in the script, save the HTML file and reload it in the browser.

If you’re running browsers and versions capa- ble of this power  see Table 18-1 , everything will look fine; but in other platforms or earlier versions, you may lose the buttons and other document content behind the color. You can still click and activate these items, but the color obscures them. Unless you know for sure that users of your Web page use only browsers and clients empowered for background color changes, do not change colors by setting properties of an existing document.  Note  If you are using Internet Explorer 3 for the Macintosh, you will experience some difficulties with Listing 18-1. The script in the main document loses its connection with the subwindow; it does not redraw the second window with other colors. You can, however, change the colors in the main document. The significant flicker you may experience is related to the way the Mac version redraws content after changing colors.  anchors  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   In Listing 18-2, I append an extra script to Listing 17-1  in Chapter 3 of this  book  to demonstrate how to extract the number of anchors in the document.

In the case of Listing 18-4, the calculation is the number of full days between the creation date and the day someone views the file.

For example, you can see that only one SCRIPT element object is in The Evaluator page if you enter the following statement into the top text field: document.scripts.length  If you want to view all of the properties of that lone SCRIPT element object, enter the following statement into the bottom text field: document.scripts[0]  Among the properties are both innerText and text. If you assign an empty  string to either property, the scripts are wiped out from the object model, but not from the browser. The scripts disappear because after the scripts loaded, they were cached outside of the object model. Therefore, if you enter the following statement into the top field: document.scripts[0].text = “”  the script contents are gone from the object model, yet subsequent clicks of the Evaluate and List Properties buttons  which invoke functions of the SCRIPT element object  still work.

In that example, you can substitute the document reference for the window reference to see how the document version of the method works just like the win- dow version.

After that, make a separate set of the three documents for that method’s example  Listings 18-16 through 18-18 in a different directory or folder .

You see that each click of the upper button  appends text to the bottom frame, without first removing the previous text. The reason is that the previous layout stream was never closed. The document thinks that you’re still writing to it. Also, without properly closing the stream, the last line of text may not appear in the most recently written batch. createAttribute “attributeName”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  Unfortunately, the setAttributeNode   method in NN6 does not yet work with attributes generated by the createAttribute   method. This will be fixed eventu- ally, and you can experiment adding attributes to sample elements in The Evaluator. In the meantime, you can still create an attribute and inspect its properties. Enter the following text into the top text box: a = document.createAttribute “author”  Now enter a into the bottom text box to inspect the properties of an Attr object.  createElement “tagName”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Chapter 15 of the JavaScript Bible contains numerous examples of the document. createElement   method in concert with methods that add or replace content to a document.

For the internal addition, the addStyle1   function invokes document. createStyleSheet   and adds a rule governing the P elements of the page  not available for IE5 Mac . In the addStyle2   function, an external file is loaded. That file contains the following two style rules: H2 {font-size:20pt; color:blue} P  {color:blue}  Notice that by specifying a position of zero for the imported style sheet, the   addition of the internal style sheet always comes afterward in styleSheet object sequence. Thus, except when you deploy only the external style sheet, the red text color of the P elements overrides the blue color of the external style sheet. If you remove the second parameter of the createStyleSheet   method in addStyle2  , the external style sheet is appended to the end of the list. If it is the last style sheet to be added, the blue color prevails. Repeatedly clicking the buttons in this example continues to add the style sheets to the document.

You can use one of the built-in global variables of The Evaluator to hold a reference to a newly generated text node by entering the following statement into the top text field: a = document.createTextNode “Hello”   document.createTextNode     4855-7 ch04.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 247  Chapter 4 ✦ The Document and Body Objects  Chapter 18   247  The Results box shows that an object was created. Now, look at the properties of  the object by typing a into the bottom text field. The precise listings of properties varies between IE5+ and NN6, but the W3C DOM properties that they share in com- mon indicate that the object is a node type 3 with a node name of text. No par- ents, children, or siblings exist yet because the object created here is not part of the document hierarchy tree until it is explicitly added to the document.   To see how insertion works, enter the following statement into the top text field  to append the text node to the myP paragraph: document.getElementById “myP” .appendChild a   The word “Hello” appears at the end of the simple paragraph lower on the page. Now you can modify the text of that node either via the reference from the point of view of the containing P element or via the global variable reference for the newly created node: document.getElementById “myP” .lastChild.nodeValue = “Howdy”  or a.nodeValue = “Howdy”  elementFromPoint x, y   Compatibility  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Listing 18-14 is a document that contains many different types of elements, each of which has an ID attribute assigned to it. The onMouseOver event handler for the document object invokes a function that finds out which element the cursor is over when the event fires. Notice that the event coordinates are event.clientX and event.clientY, which use the same coordinate plane as the page for their point of reference. As you roll the mouse over every element, its ID appears on the page. In Figure 4-1, the pointer is inside a table cell, whose ID appears in bold at the end of the first paragraph. Some elements, such as BR and TR, occupy no space in the doc- ument, so you cannot get their IDs to appear. On a typical browser screen size, a positioned element rests atop one of the paragraph elements so that you can see how the elementFromPoint   method handles overlapping elements. If you scroll the page, the coordinates for the event and the page’s elements stay in sync.  document.elementFromPoint     4855-7 ch04.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 248  248 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Figure 4-1: Revealing the object located at an event screen position  Listing 18-14: Using the elementFromPoint   Method       document.elementFromPoint   Method    function showElemUnderneath   {  var elem = document.elementFromPoint event.clientX, event.clientY  document.all.mySpan.innerText = elem.id  } document.onmouseover = showElemUnderneath         document.elementFromPoint   Method     Roll the mouse around the page.

Try each of the following statements in the top text box and click the Evaluate button: document.execCommand “Refresh”  document.execCommand “SelectAll”  document.execCommand “Unselect”  All methods return true in the Results box.  Because any way you can evaluate a statement in The Evaluator forces a body  selection to become deselected before the evaluation takes place, you can’t experi- ment this way with the selection-oriented commands.   document.execCommand     4855-7 ch04.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 250  250 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  getElementById “elementID”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  You can find many examples of this method in use throughout this book, but you can take a closer look at how it works by experimenting in The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible . A number of elements in The Evaluator have IDs assigned to them, so that you can use the method to inspect the objects and their properties. Enter the following statements into both the top and bottom text fields of The Evaluator. Results from the top field are references to the objects; results from the bottom field are lists of properties for the particular object. document.getElementById “myP”  document.getElementById “myEM”  document.getElementById “myTitle”  document.getElementById “myScript”   As you see in the Results field, NN6 is more explicit about the type of HTML ele- ment object being referenced in the top text field than IE5. But nevertheless, both browsers are pointing to the same objects.  getElementsByName “elementName”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Use The Evaluator to test out the getElementsByName   method.

First is the fact that you can write any HTML code to a frame, and the browser accepts it as if the source code came from an HTML file somewhere. In the example, I assemble a complete HTML document, including basic HTML tags for completeness.  Listing 18-16: Frameset for document.write   Example       Writin’ to the doc                 document.write     4855-7 ch04.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 254  254 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 18-17: document.write   Example       Document Write Controller    function takePulse form  {  var msg = “   On The Fly with “ + form.yourName.value +   msg += “  Good Day “ + form.yourName.value +   “  ”  “!  ”  for  var i = 0; i < form.how.length; i++  {  if  form.how[i].checked  {  msg += form.how[i].value break  }  } msg += “ Make it a great day!  ” parent.Frame2.document.write msg  parent.Frame2.document.close    } function getTitle   {  }      alert “Lower frame document.title is now:” + parent.Frame2.document.title     Fill in a name, and select how that person feels today. Then click “Write To Below”  to see the results in the bottom frame.   Enter your first name:   How are you today? <INPUT TYPE=”radio” NAME=”how”  VALUE=”I hope that feeling continues forever.” CHECKED>Swell   Pretty Good   So-So  <INPUT TYPE=”button” NAME=”enter” VALUE=”Write To Below”   onClick=”takePulse this.form ”>    <INPUT TYPE=”button” NAME=”peek” VALUE=”Check Lower Frame Title”   onClick=”getTitle  ”>       document.write     4855-7 ch04.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 255  Chapter 4 ✦ The Document and Body Objects  Chapter 18   255  Listing 18-18: Placeholder for Listing 18-16       Placeholder         Figure 4-2 shows an example of the frame written by the script.  Figure 4-2: Clicking the Write To Below button in the upper frame causes a script to assemble and write HTML for the bottom frame.  A second point to note is that this example customizes the content of the docu-  ment based on user input. This customization makes the experience of working with your Web page feel far more interactive to the user — yet you’re doing it with- out any CGI programs running on the server.  The third point I want to bring home is that the document created in the separate frame by the document.write   method is a genuine document object. In this exam- ple, for instance, the   tag of the written document changes if you redraw the lower frame after changing the entry of the name field in the upper frame. If you click the lower button after updating the bottom frame, you see that the document.title property has, indeed, changed to reflect the   tag written to the browser in  document.write     4855-7 ch04.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 256  256 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  the course of displaying the frame’s page  except in NN4 Mac, which exhibits a bug for this property in a dynamically written document . The fact that you can artificially create full-fledged JavaScript document objects on the fly represents one of the most important powers of serverless CGI scripting  for information delivery to the user  with JavaScript. You have much to take advantage of here if your imagination is up to the task.  Notice that except for NN2, you can easily modify Listing 18-17 to write the  results to the same frame as the document containing the field and buttons. Instead of specifying the lower frame parent.frames[1].document.open   parent.frames[1].document.write msg  parent.frames[1].document.close    the code simply can use  document.open   document.write msg  document.close    This code would replace the form document with the results and not require any frames in the first place. Because the code assembles all of the content for the new document into one variable value, that data survives the one document.write   method.  The frameset document  Listing 18-18  creates a blank frame by loading a blank document  Listing 18-18 . An alternative I highly recommend is to have the frame- setting document fill the frame with a blank document of its own creation. See “Blank Frames” in Chapter 16 of the JavaScript Bible for further details about this technique for NN3+ and IE3+.

Size the browser window so that at least the vertical scrollbar is active  meaning it has a thumb region . Enter the following statement into the top text field and press Enter a few times to simulate clicking the PgDn key: document.body.doScroll    Return to the top of the page and now do the same for scrolling by the increment of the scrollbar down arrow: document.body.doScroll “down”   You can also experiment with upward scrolling. Enter the desired statement in the top text field and leave the text cursor in the field. Manually scroll to the bot- tom of the page and then press Enter to activate the command.

If scrolling of the content would destroy the appearance or value of the content, then you want to make sure that the page always zips back to the top. The onScroll event handler in Listing 18-21 does just that. Notice that the event handler is set as a property of the document.body object after the page has loaded. While the event handler can also be set as an attribute of the   tag, to assign it as a property requires the page to load first. Until then, the document.body object does not yet officially exist in the object model for this page.  Listing 18-21: Forcing Scrolling to Stay at the Page Top       onScroll Event Handler    function zipBack   {  window.scroll 0,0   } function init   {  document.body.onscroll = zipBack  }         onScroll Event Handler    This page always zips back to the top if you try to scroll it.             ✦  ✦  ✦  document.body.onScroll   4855-7 ch04.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 264   4855-7 ch05.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 265  55C H A P T E R  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  In This Chapter  Using the NN Range and IE TextRange objects  Working with text selections  Scripting search and replace actions  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  Body Text Objects  Chapter 19  The subject of body text objects encompasses both HTML  element objects and several abstract DOM objects that  make it easier for scripts to manipulate text-oriented body content that may not be contained within its own element tag. While the HTML element objects are easy to grasp, the abstract objects that work with stretches of visible body text have their own vocabularies and peculiarities.  Many HTML element objects in this category may become obsolete when the installed base of browsers capable of sup- porting Cascading Style Sheets reaches critical mass. CSS adherents would much rather use style sheets for font specifi- cations in place of the old-fashioned   tag. But other elements in this group, such as the header elements  H1, H2, and so on , provide context for content that scripts may find useful for tasks such as creating a table of contents on the fly.  More intriguing is the concept of a text range, which is  essentially an object that represents an arbitrary series of text characters within a document. A text ranges can work within an element  or text node  or extend beyond element borders, just as if a user selected a bunch of text that includes portions of what are HTML elements behind the scenes.  Unfortunately for scripters, the vocabulary for text range manipulation is very different for the IE4+ Windows and W3C object models. Moreover, the two objects do not always share the same functionality, making it even more difficult to pro- gram cross-browser implementations using text ranges. Be alert to the compatibility ratings for each example before try- ing out a listing or step-by-step sequence.   4855-7 ch05.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 266  266 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ Many site visitors  this author included  frown on the application of the  scrolling MARQUEE element because it tends to distract visitors, rather than convey meaningful information. But if you insist on using it, Listing 19-3 demonstrates how scripts can control numerous behaviors.  ✦ Listing 19-4 lets you examine how the NN6  W3C DOM  Range object treats  boundary points within the node hierarchy of a document.  ✦ To insert a node into an arbitrary point within another, see Listing 19-5’s appli-  cation of the Range.insertNode   method.  ✦ Walk through the steps for Range.selectNode   method to see how to set a  range to encompass an entire node or its contents.  ✦ Run Listing 19-8 to see how NN6  W3C DOM  provides additional facilities  for manipulating text content within a node. The listing also demonstrates try-catch error handling.  ✦ Listing 19-10 shows the IE4+ Windows TextRange object’s way of comparing  range boundaries  the IE version of Listing 19-4 .  ✦ The TextRange object provides practical text search facilities, which are  demonstrated in Listing 19-11. In the process, several TextRange properties and methods get a workout, including the use of bookmarks within a range. A simple undo buffer adds to the user friendliness of the application.

Along the way, you can see an eco- nomical use of the setAttribute   method to do the work for all of the property changes. This page loads successfully in all browsers, but the SELECT lists make changes to the text only in IE4+ and NN6+.   A P element contains a nested FONT element that encompasses three words  whose appearance is controlled by three select lists. Each list controls one of the  FONT.color   4855-7 ch05.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 267  Chapter 5 ✦ Body Text Objects  Chapter 19   267  three FONT object properties, and their NAME attributes are strategically assigned the names of the properties  as you see in a moment . VALUE attributes for OPTION elements contain strings that are to be assigned to the various properties. Each SELECT element invokes the same setFontAttr   function, passing a reference to itself so that the function can inspect details of the element.  The first task of the setFontAttr   function is to make sure that only browsers  capable of treating the FONT element as an object get to the meat of the function. The test for the existence of document.all and the myFONT element blocks all older browsers from changing the font characteristics. As the page loads, the  document.all property is set for NN6 by using a variation of the normalization technique described in Chapter 14 of the JavaScript Bible.  For suitably equipped browsers, the function next extracts the string from the  value property of the SELECT object that was passed to the function. If a selection is made  meaning other than the first, empty one , then the single nested statement uses the setAttribute   method to assign the value to the attribute whose name matches the name of the SELECT element.  Note  An odd bug in IE5 Mac doesn’t let the rendered color change when changing the color property. But the setting is valid, as proven by selecting any of the other two property choices.

The bottom paragraph contains a SPAN element that has a Range object assigned to its nested text node after the page loads  in the init   func- tion . That fixed range becomes a solid reference point for you to use while you select text in the paragraph.   Note  Unfortunately, the window object method that converts a user selection into an object is not connected correctly in the first release of NN6. Even if it were, the inverted  values  returned  by  the  compareBoundaryPoints   method  would give you incorrect results. Try this example on subsequent versions of NN6.  After you make a selection, all four versions of the compareBoundaryPoints    method run to compare the start and end points of the fixed range against your selection. One column of the results table shows the raw value returned by the compareBoundaryPoints   method, while the third column puts the results into plain language.  To see how this page works, begin by selecting the first word of the fixed text range  carefully drag the selection from the first red character . You can see that the starting positions of both ranges are the same, because the returned value is 0. Because all of the invocations of the compareBoundaryPoints   method are on the fixed text range, all comparisons are from the point of view of that range. Thus, the first row of the table for the START_TO_END parameter indicates that the start point of the fixed range comes before the end point of the selection, yielding a return value of -1.  Other selections to make include: ✦ Text that starts before the fixed range and ends inside the range ✦ Text that starts inside the fixed range and ends beyond the range ✦ Text that starts and ends precisely at the fixed range boundaries ✦ Text that starts and ends before the fixed range ✦ Text that starts after the fixed range  Study the returned values and the plain language results and see how they align  with the selection you made.

Begin by creat- ing the range and fragment: a = document.createRange   a.selectNode document.body  b = a.createContextualFragment “ a bunch of  ”   This fragment consists of a SPAN element node with a text node nested inside. At  this point, you can inspect the properties of the document fragment by entering b into the bottom text box.  To replace the myEM element on the page with this new fragment, use the  replaceChild   method on the enclosing myP element: document.getElementById “myP” .replaceChild b, document.getElementById “myEM”   The fragment now becomes a legitimate child node of the myP element and can be referenced like any node in the document tree. For example, if you enter the follow- ing statement into the top text box of The Evaluator, you can retrieve a copy of the text node inside the new SPAN element: document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes[1].firstChild.nodeValue  Range.createContextualFragment     4855-7 ch05.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 284  284 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  deleteContents    NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment with delet- ing contents of both a text node and a complete element node. Begin by creating a text range for the text node inside the myEM element  enter the third statement, which wraps below, as one continuous expression : a = document.createRange   a.setStart document.getElementById “myEM” .firstChild, 0  a.setEnd document.getElementById “myEM” .lastChild,  document.getElementById “myEM” .lastChild.length  Verify the makeup of the range by entering a into the bottom text box and  inspect its properties. Both containers are text nodes  they happen to be the same text node , and offsets are measured by character positions.  Now, delete the contents of the range:  a.deleteContents   The italicized word “all” is gone from the tree, but the myEM element is still there. To prove it, put some new text inside the element: document.getElementById “myEM” .innerHTML = “a band of “  The italic style of the EM element applies to the text, as it should.  Next, adjust the range boundaries to include the myEM element tags, as well:  a.selectNode document.getElementById “myEM”    Inspect the Range object’s properties again by entering a into the bottom text  box. The container nodes are the P element that surrounds the EM element; the off- set values are measured in nodes. Delete the range’s contents: a.deleteContents    Not only is the italicized text gone, but the myEM element is gone, too. The myP element now has but one child node, the text node inside. The following entries into the top text box of The Evaluator verify this fact: document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes.length document.getElementById “myP” .childNodes[0].nodeValue  If you try this example in early versions of NN6, however, you see that the  deleteContents   method also removes the text node following the myEM ele- ment. This is buggy behavior, demonstrating that the method works best on text nodes, rather than elements.

Begin by creating a new range object that contains the text of the myP para- graph element. a = document.createRange   a.selectNode document.getElementById “myP”    Next, extract the original range’s content and preserve the copy in variable b:  b = a.extractContents    Move the original range so that it is an insertion point at the end of the body by first expanding it to encompass the entire body and then collapse it to the end a.selectNode document.body  a.collapse false   Now, insert the extracted fragment at the very end of the body:  a.insertNode b   If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you see a copy of the text.  insertNode nodeReference   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  Listing 19-5, which relies on selection and Range object features not imple- mented in the first release of NN6, demonstrates the insertNode   method plus some additional items from the NN6 selection object. The example even includes a rudimentary undo buffer for scripted changes to a text range. In the page gener- ated by this listing, users can select any text in a paragraph and have the script automatically convert the text to all uppercase characters. The task of replacing a selection with other text requires several steps, starting with the selection, which is retrieved via the window.getSelection   method. After making sure the selection contains some text  that is, the selection isn’t collapsed , the selection is preserved as a range object so that the starting text can be stored in a global variable  as a  Range.insertNode     4855-7 ch05.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 286  286 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  property of the undoBuffer global variable object . After that, the selection is deleted from the document tree, leaving the selection as a collapsed insertion point. A copy of that selection in the form of a range object is preserved in the undoBuffer object so that the undo script knows where to reinsert the original text. A new text node is created with an uppercase version of the original text, and, finally, the insertNode   method is invoked to stick the converted text into the collapsed range.  Undoing this operation works in reverse. Original locations and strings are  copied from the undoBuffer object. After creating the range with the old start and end points  which represent a collapsed insertion point , the resurrected text  con- verted to a text node  is inserted into the collapsed range. For good housekeeping, the undoBuffer object is restored to its unused form.

You will discover, however, that the object model can make a document fragment out of just about any string. For instance, if you attempt to create a document fragment out of some random text and an end tag, the document fragment will consist of a text node and an element node of the type indicated by the end tag.  selectNode nodeReference  selectNodeContents nodeReference   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Compatibility  Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to see the behavior of  both the selectNode   and selectNodeContents   methods work.

Begin by creating a new range object. a = document.createRange    For the first range, set the start and end points to encompass the second node   the myEM element  inside the myP element: a.setStart document.getElementById “myP” , 1  a.setEnd document.getElementById “myP” , 2   The text encompassed by the range consists of the word “all” plus the trailing space that is contained by the myEM element. Prove this by entering the following statement into the top text box: a.toString    If you then click the Results box to the right of the word “all,” you see that the results contain the trailing space. Yet, if you examine the properties of the range  enter a into the bottom text box , you see that the range is defined as actually starting before the myEM element and ending after it.  Next, adjust the start point of the range to a character position inside the first  text node of the myP element: a.setStart document.getElementById “myP” .firstChild, 11  Click the List Properties button to see that the startContainer property of the range is the text node, and that the startOffset measures the character position. All end boundary properties, however, have not changed. Enter a.toString   in the top box again to see that the range now encompasses text from two of the nodes inside the myP element.

As the page loads, a global variable  newSpan  stores a SPAN element that is used as a prototype for elements to be used as new surrounding parent nodes. When you select text in either of the two paragraphs, the selection is converted to a range. The surroundContents   method then wraps the range with the newSpan element. Because that SPAN ele- ment has a class name of hilite, the element and its contents pick up the style sheet properties as defined for that class selector.  Listing 19-6: Using the Range.surroundContents   Method       Range.surroundContents   Method    .hilite {background-color:yellow; color:red; font-weight:bold}     var newSpan = document.createElement “SPAN”  newSpan.className = “hilite”  function highlightSelection   {  var sel, rng try {  sel = window.getSelection   if  !sel.isCollapsed  {  rng = sel.getRangeAt 0  rng.surroundContents newSpan.cloneNode false    }  } catch err  {  browser.”   }  }        Range.surroundContents   Method     These paragraphs  contain text that you can select.

The text node that invokes the methods is a simple sentence in a P element. Each method has its own clickable button, followed by two or three text boxes into which you enter values for method parameters. Don’t be put off by the length of the listing. Each method’s operation is confined to its own function and is fairly simple.  Each of the data-related methods throws exceptions of different kinds. To help handle these errors gracefully, the method calls are wrapped inside a try catch construction.

The bottom paragraph contains a SPAN element that has a TextRange object assigned to its text after the page loads  in the init   function . That fixed range becomes a solid reference point for you to use while you select text in the  TextRange.compareEndPoints     4855-7 ch05.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 301  Chapter 5 ✦ Body Text Objects  Chapter 19   301  paragraph. After you make a selection, all four versions of the compareEndPoints   method run to compare the start and end points of the fixed range against your selection. One column of the results table shows the raw value returned by the compareEndPoints   method, while the third column puts the results into plain language.  To see how this page works, begin by selecting the first word of the fixed text  range  double-click the word . You can see that the starting positions of both ranges are the same, because the returned value is 0. Because all of the invocations of the compareEndPoints   method are on the fixed text range, all comparisons are from the point of view of that range. Thus, the first row of the table for the StartToEnd parameter indicates that the start point of the fixed range comes before the end point of the selection, yielding a return value of -1.  Other selections to make include: ✦ Text that starts before the fixed range and ends inside the range ✦ Text that starts inside the fixed range and ends beyond the range ✦ Text that starts and ends precisely at the fixed range boundaries ✦ Text that starts and ends before the fixed range ✦ Text that starts after the fixed range  Study the returned values and the plain language results and see how they align with the selection you make.

Both approaches begin by creating a TextRange for the entire body, but they immediately shift the starting point to the beginning of the DIV element that contains the text to search.  One search-and-replace function prompts the user to accept or decline replace-  ment for each instance of a found string. The select   and scrollIntoView   methods are invoked to help the user see what is about to be replaced. Notice that even when the user declines to accept the replacement, the text range is collapsed to the end of the found range so that the next search can begin after the previously found text. Without the collapse   method, the search can get caught in an infi- nite loop as it keeps finding the same text over and over  with no replacement made . Because no counting is required, this search-and-replace operation is imple- mented inside a while repeat loop.  The other search-and-replace function goes ahead and replaces every match and  then displays the number of replacements made. After the loop exits  because there are no more matches , the loop counter is used to display the number of replacements made.

[The rest of the text is snipped for printing here, but it is on the CD-ROM version.]        Having a search-and-replace function available in a document is only one-half of the battle. The other half is offering the facilities to undo the changes. To that end,  TextRange.findText     4855-7 ch05.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 308  308 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 19-11 includes an undo buffer that accurately undoes only the changes made in the initial replacement actions.  The undo buffer stores its data in two global variables. The first,  origSearchString, is simply the string used to perform the original search. This variable is the string that has to be put back in the places where it had been replaced. The second global variable is an array that stores TextRange bookmarks  see getBookmark   later in this chapter . These references are string values that don’t mean much to humans, but the browser can use them to recreate a range with its desired start and end points. Values for both the global search string and bookmark specifications are stored in calls to the pushUndoNew   method each time text is replaced.  A perhaps unexpected action of setting the text property of a text range is that  the start and end points collapse to the end of the new text. Because the stored bookmark must include the replaced text as part of its specification, the start point of the current range must be adjusted back to the beginning of the replacement text before the bookmark can be saved. Thus, the pushUndoNew   function receives the replacement text string so that the moveStart   method can be adjusted by the number of characters matching the length of the replacement string.  After all of the bookmarks are stored in the array, the undo action can do its job in a rather simple for loop inside the undoReplace   function. After verifying that the undo buffer has data stored in it, the function loops through the array of book- marks and replaces the bookmarked text with the old string. The benefit of using the bookmarks rather than using the replacement function again is that only those ranges originally affected by the search-and-replace operation are touched in the undo operation. For example, in this document if you replace a case-sensitive “states” with “States” two replacements are performed. At that point, however, the document has four instances of “States,” two of which existed before. Redoing the replacement function by inverting the search-and-replace strings would convert all four back to the lowercase version — not the desired effect.

The following statements generate two distinct text ranges, one for the myP paragraph element and the other for the myEM element nested within. a = document.body.createTextRange   a.moveToElementText myP  b = document.body.createTextRange   b.moveToElementText myEM   Because the myP text range is larger than the other, invoke the inRange    method on it, fully expecting the return value of true a.inRange b   But if you switch the references, you see that the larger text range is not “in” the smaller one: b.inRange a   isEqual otherRangeRef   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to try the isEqual   method. Begin by creating two separate TextRange objects, one for the myP ele- ment and one for myEM. a = document.body.createTextRange   a.moveToElement myP  b = document.body.createTextRange   b.moveToElement myEM   Because these two ranges encompass different sets of text, they are not equal, as  the results show from the following statement: a.isEqual b   TextRange.isEqual     4855-7 ch05.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 310  310 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  But if you now adjust the first range boundaries to surround the myEM element, both ranges are the same values: a.moveToElement myEM  a.isEqual b   move “unit”[, count]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment with the  move   method. To see how the method returns just the number of units it moves the pointer, begin by creating a text range and set it to enclose the myP element: a = document.body.createTextRange   a.moveToElementText myP   Now enter the following statement to collapse and move the range backward by  20 words. a.move “word”, -20   Continue to click the Evaluate button and watch the returned value in the Results box. The value shows 20 while it can still move backward by 20 words. But eventu- ally the last movement will be some other value closer to zero. And after the range is at the beginning of the BODY element, the range can move no more in that direc- tion, so the result is zero.  moveEnd “unit”[, count]  moveStart “unit”[, count]   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment with the  moveEnd   and moveStart   methods.

Note especially the htmlText and text properties. Now enter the following state- ment to move the end of the range forward by one word. a.moveEnd “word”   Click on the List Properties button to see that the text of the range now includes the word following the EM element. Try each of the following statements in the top text box and examine both the integer results and  by clicking the List Properties button  the properties of the range after each statement: a.moveStart “word”, -1  a.moveEnd “sentence”   Notice that for a sentence, a default unit of 1 expands to the end of the current  sentence. And if you move the start point backward by one sentence, you’ll see that the lack of a period-ending sentence prior to the myP element causes strange results.  Finally, force the start point backward in increments of 20 words and watch the  results as the starting point nears and reaches the start of the BODY: a.moveStart “word”, -20   Eventually the last movement will be some other value closer to zero. And as soon as the range is at the beginning of the BODY element, the range can move no more in that direction, so the result is zero.  moveToBookmark “bookmarkString”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Listing 19-11 earlier in this chapter shows how to use the moveToBookmark    method to restore a text range so that changes that created the state saved by the bookmark can be undone.

Listings 19-10 and 19-11 earlier in this chapter show the method within an application context.  moveToPoint x, y   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Use The Evaluator to see the moveToPoint   method in action. Begin by creat-  ing a text range for the entire BODY element: a = document.body.createTextRange   Now, invoke the moveToPoint   method to a location 100, 100, which turns out to be in the rectangle space of the Results textarea: a.moveToPoint 100,100   If you type a into the bottom text box and view the properties, both the  htmlText and text properties are empty because the insertion point represents no visible text content. But if you gradually move, for example, the start point back- ward one character at a time, you will see the htmlText and text properties begin to fill in with the body text that comes before the TEXTAREA element, namely the “Results:” label and the   tag between it and the TEXTAREA element. Enter the following statement into the top text box and click the Evaluate button several times.  a.moveStart “character”, -1  Enter a into the bottom text box after each evaluation to list the properties of the range.

Next, extend the end point of the text range by one word:  a.moveEnd “word”  Because part of the text range now contains text of the myP object, the outerHTML property of a.parentElement   shows the entire myP element and tags.  pasteHTML “HTMLText”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility  Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to experiment with the  pasteHTML   method. The goal of the following sequence is to change the   tag to a   tag whose STYLE attribute sets the color of the original text that was in the EM element.  Begin by creating the text range and setting the boundaries to the myEM element:  a = document.body.createTextRange   a.moveToElementText myEM  While you can pass the HTML string directly as a parameter to pasteHTML  , stor- ing the HTML string in its own temporary variable may be more convenient  and more easily testable , such as: b = “ ” + a.text + “ ”  Notice that we concatenate the text of the current text range, because it has not  yet been modified. Now we can paste the new HTML string into the current text range a.pasteHTML b   At this point the EM element is gone from the object model, and the SPAN ele-  ment is in its place. Prove it to yourself by looking at the HTML for the myP element: myP.innerHTML  As noted earlier, the pasteHTML   method is not the only way to insert or  replace HTML in a document. This method makes excellent sense when the user selects some text in the document to be replaced, because you can use the document.selection.createRange   method to get the text range for the selec- tion. But if you’re not using text ranges for other related operations, consider the other generic object properties and methods available to you.

Compatibility  Example  Use The Evaluator to experiment with the setEndPoint   method. Begin by cre-  ating two independent text ranges, one for the myP element and one for myEM: a = document.body.createTextRange   a.moveToElementText myP  b = document.body.createTextRange   b.moveToElementText myEM   Before moving any end points, compare the HTML for each of those ranges:  a.htmlText b.htmlText Now, move the start point of the a text range to the end point of the b text range: a.setEndPoint “StartToEnd”, b   If you now view the HTML for the a range,  a.htmlText you see that the   tag of the original a text range is nowhere to be found. This demonstration is a good lesson to use the setEndPoint   method primarily if you are concerned only with visible body text being inside ranges, rather than an ele- ment with its tags.

When you click one of the elements, that element’s TextRectangle dimension properties are used to set the size of a positioned ele- ment that highlights the space of the rectangle. Be careful not to confuse the visible rectangle object that you see on the page with the abstract TextRectangle object that is associated with each of the clicked elements.  An important part of the listing is the way the action of sizing and showing the positioned element is broken out as a separate function  setHiliter    from the one that is the onClick event handler function  handleClick   . This is done so that the onResize event handler can trigger a script that gets the current rectangle for the last element clicked, and the positioned element can be sized and moved to maintain the highlight of the same text. As an experiment, try removing the onResize event handler from the   tag and watch what happens to the high- lighted rectangle after you resize the browser window: the rectangle that represents the TextRectangle remains unchanged and loses track of the abstract TextRectangle associated with the actual element object.

Moreover, the element’s scriptability extends backward in time to all but the very first generation of script- able browsers. Playing a supporting role in image rollovers is the abstract Image object, which scripts use to pre-load images into the browser’s cache for instantaneous image swapping. Even though the two objects manifest themselves differently within script operations, they share properties and methods, making it easy to learn their capabilities side by side.  AREA and MAP element objects work closely with each  other. In practice, an AREA element resembles an A element that is set to work as a link. Both elements create clickable “hot spots” on the page that typically lead the user to other locations within the site or elsewhere on the Web. They also share a number of URL-related properties.  Examples Highlights  ✦ Most IE browsers can load both still and motion images  such as MPEG movies  into an IMG element. Listing 22-3 shows how to swap between still and motion images via the dynsrc property.  ✦ The page created from Listing 22-4 lets you compare the performance of swapping images with and without pre- caching. You also see how to have scripts rotate images on a timed schedule.  ✦ Watch how the IMG element’s onLoad event handler can  trigger actions in Listing 22-5.  ✦ A powerful Listing 22-7 demonstrates how scripts can fashion new client-side area maps when a different pic- ture file loads into an IMG element.    4855-7 ch06.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 318  318 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Image and IMG Element Objects  Properties  align  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5   cid:3   IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   Compatibility   cid:3   Example  Listing 22-1 enables you to choose from the different align property values as they influence the layout of an image whose HTML is embedded inline with some other text.

As each image loads, click the “Is it loaded yet?” button to see the status of the com- plete property for the image object. The value is false until the loading finishes; then, the value becomes true. The arch image is the bigger  of the two image files. You may have to quit and relaunch your browser between trials to clear the arch image from the cache  or empty the browser’s memory cache . If you experience difficulty with this property in your scripts, try adding an onLoad event handler  even if it is empty, as in Listing 22-2  to your   tag.

Of prime importance is a comparison of how precached and regular images feel to the user. As a bonus, you see an example of how to set a timer to automati- cally change the images displayed in an image object. This feature is a popular request among sites that display advertising banners.  As the page loads, a global variable is handed an array of image objects. Entries of the array are assigned string names as index values  “desk1”, “desk2”, and so on . The intention is that these names ultimately will be used as addresses to the array entries. Each image object in the array has a URL assigned to it, which pre- caches the image.  IMG.src   4855-7 ch06.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 326  326 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The page  see Figure 6-1  includes two IMG elements: one that displays non-  cached images and one that displays cached images. Under each image is a SELECT element that you can use to select one of four possible image files for each element. The onChange event handler for each SELECT list invokes a different function to change the noncached  loadIndividual    or cached  loadCached    images. Both of these functions take as their single parameter a reference to the form that contains the SELECT elements.  To cycle through images at five-second intervals, the checkTimer   function  looks to see if the timer check box is checked. If so, the selectedIndex property of the cached image SELECT control is copied and incremented  or reset to zero if the index is at the maximum value . The SELECT element is adjusted, so you can now invoke the loadCached   function to read the currently selected item and set the image accordingly.  For some extra style points, the   tag includes an onUnload event handler  that invokes the resetSelects   function. This general-purpose function loops through all forms on the page and all elements within each form. For every SELECT element, the selectedIndex property is reset to zero. Thus, if a user reloads the page, or returns to the page via the Back button, the images start in their original sequence. An onLoad event handler makes sure that the images are in sync with the SELECT choices and the checkTimer   function is invoked with a five-second delay.

The scenario is that the page loads with one image of a computer keyboard. This image is linked to the keyboardMap client-side image map, which specifies details for three hot spots on the image. If you then switch the  MAP.areas   4855-7 ch06.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 332  332 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  image displayed in that IMG element, scripts change the useMap property of the IMG element object to point to a second MAP that has specifications more suited to the desk lamp in the second image. Roll the mouse pointer atop the images, and view the URLs associated with each area in the statusbar  for this example, the URLs do not lead to other pages .  Another button on the page, however, invokes the makeAreas   function  not working in IE5 Mac , which creates four new AREA element objects and  through DOM-specific pathways  adds those new area specifications to the image. If you roll the mouse atop the image after the function executes, you can see that the URLs now reflect those of the new areas. Also note the addition of a fourth area, whose status bar message appears in Figure 6-2.

Even though the FORM element is primarily the container of the interactive form controls  covered in succeeding chapters , it’s not uncommon to find scripts modifying the action property  corresponding to the ACTION attribute  based on user input. Moreover, the onSubmit event handler is a vital trigger for batch validation just before the form data goes up to the server.  The other HTML element for which this chapter contains an  example is the LABEL element object. A LABEL element is a container of text that is associated with a form control. This is a practical user interface enhancement in modern browsers in that such labels can essentially forward mouse events to their controls, thus widening the physical target for mouse clicks of radio buttons and checkboxes, much like “real” applications. The value of scriptability for this element, however, accrues predominantly when scripts dynamically modify page content.   Examples Highlights  ✦ Listing 23-2 puts the form.elements array to work in a  generic function that resets all text fields in a form to empty, without touching the settings of other types of controls.  ✦ If you prefer to use images for your form’s reset and sub-  mit actions, Listing 22-3 shows you how to do just that with the form.reset   and form.submit   methods.   4855-7 ch07.F  6 26 01  8:35 AM  Page 336  336 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  ✦ While batch form validations are shown in several places throughout the  JavaScript Bible, Listing 23-4 demonstrates how both the onReset and onSubmit event handlers, in concert with the window.confirm   method, let scripts permit or prevent a form from being reset or submitted.

A form contains four fields and some other elements mixed in between  see Figure 7-1 . The first part of the function that acts on these items repeats through all the elements in the form to find out which ones are text box objects and which text box objects are empty. Notice how I use the type property to separate text box objects from the rest, even when radio buttons appear amid the fields. If one field has nothing in it, I alert the user and use that same index value to place the insertion point at the field with the field’s focus   method.

For example, radio buttons should be presented in groups offering two or more mutually exclusive choices. A checkbox, on the other hand, is used to signify an “on” or “off” setting related to whatever label is associated with the button. The only tricky part of these special behaviors is that radio buttons assigned to a  single group must share the same name, and the document object model provides access to single buttons within the group by way of an array of objects that share the name. For a script to determine which radio button is currently selected, a for loop through the array then allows the script to inspect the checked property of each button to find the one whose value is true.  Then there are what appear to be plain old rounded rectan- gle buttons. Two versions — the INPUT element of type button and the newer BUTTON element — work very much alike, although the latter is not obligated to appear nested inside a FORM element. A common mistake among newcomers, how- ever, is to use the INPUT element of type submit to behave as a button whose sole job is to trigger some script function without any form submission. Genuine submit buttons force the form to submit itself, even if the button’s onClick event handler invokes a script function. If the form has no ACTION attribute assigned to it, then the default action of the submis- sion causes the page to reload, probably destroying whatever tentative script variable values and other data have been gathered on the page.  Examples Highlights  ✦ If a button’s event handler passes that button object’s  reference to the handler function, the object’s form property provides the function with a valid reference to the containing form, allowing the script an easy way to access information about the form or create references to other form controls.   4855-7 ch08.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 344  344 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  ✦ Of course, the onClick event handler is the most important for button con- trols. Listing 24-1 demonstrates passing button references to event handler functions.  ✦ Listing 24-4 shows how a checkbox setting can influence the URL of the form’s  action.  ✦ Sometimes a complex form requires that checking a checkbox makes other  items in the form visible. Listing 24-5 employs scriptable style sheets to assist in the job.  ✦ Use Listing 24-6 as a model for how to find which radio button among those of  a single group is checked.

The button reference is needed to decide which branch to follow; then the form is submitted. function setAction btn  {  if  btn.name == “normal”  {  btn.form.action = “cgi-bin normal.pl”  } else if  btn.name == “special”  {  btn.form.action = “cgi-bin specialHandling.pl”  } btn.form.submit    }  Notice how this function doesn’t have to worry about the form reference,  because its job is to work with whatever form encloses the button that triggers this function. Down in the form, two buttons invoke the same function.

In this case, each button passes its own object as a parameter to the displayTeam   function. The function then displays the results in an alert dialog box. A real-world application would probably use a more complex if...else decision tree to perform more sophisticated actions based on the button clicked  or use a switch construction on the btn.value expression for NN4+ and IE4+ .  Listing 24-1: Three Buttons Sharing One Function       Button Click    function displayTeam btn  {  }      if  btn.value == “Abbott”  {alert “Abbott & Costello” } if  btn.value == “Rowan”  {alert “Rowan & Martin” } if  btn.value == “Martin”  {alert “Martin & Lewis” }    Click on your favorite half of a popular comedy team:                 document.formObject.buttonObject.onClick   4855-7 ch08.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 347  Chapter 8 ✦ Button Objects  Chapter 24   347  Checkbox Input Object  Properties  checked  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   IE5   cid:3   IE5.5   cid:3   Example  The simple example in Listing 24-2 passes a form object reference to the  JavaScript function. The function, in turn, reads the checked value of the form’s checkbox object  checkThis.checked  and uses its Boolean value as the test result for the if...else construction.

The if construction compares the current status of the box against its default status. Both are Boolean values, so they can be compared against each other. If the current and default settings don’t match, the function goes on to handle the case in which the current setting is other than the default.

After the user clicks the Submit button, a JavaScript function examines the checkbox’s checked property. If the property is true  the button is checked , the script sets the action property for the entire form to the content of the value property — thus influencing where the form goes on the server side. If you try this listing on your computer, the result you see varies widely with the browser version you use. For most browsers, you see some indication  an error alert or other screen notation  that a file with the name primaryURL or alternateURL doesn’t exist. Unfortunately, IE5.5 Windows does not display the name of the file that can’t be opened. Try the example in another browser if you have one. The names and the error message come from the submission process for this demonstration.  document.formObject.checkboxObject.value   4855-7 ch08.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 349  Chapter 8 ✦ Button Objects  Chapter 24   349  Listing 24-4: Adjusting a CGI Submission Action       Checkbox Submission    function setAction form  {  if  form.checkThis.checked  {  form.action = form.checkThis.value  form.action = “file:  primaryURL”  } else {  } return true  }          Use alternate           Event handlers  onClick  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   IE5   cid:3   IE5.5   cid:3   Example  The page in Listing 24-5 shows how to trap the click event in one checkbox to influence the visibility and display of other form controls. After you turn on the Monitor checkbox, a list of radio buttons for monitor sizes appears. Similarly, engaging the Communications checkbox makes two radio buttons visible. Your choice of radio button brings up one of two further choices within the same table cell  see Figure 8-1 .  document.formObject.checkboxObject.onClick   4855-7 ch08.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 350  350 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Figure 8-1: Clicking on button choices reveals additional relevant choices  Notice how the toggle   function was written as a generalizable function. This function can accept a reference to any checkbox object and any related span. If five more groups like this were added to the table, no additional functions would be needed.  In the swap   function, an application of a nested if...else shortcut construc-  tion is used to convert the Boolean values of the checked property to the strings needed for the display style property. The nesting is used to allow a single state- ment to take care of two conditions: the group of buttons to be controlled and the checked property of the button invoking the function. This function is not general- izable, because it contains explicit references to objects in the document. The swap   function can be made generalizable, but due to the special relationships between pairs of span elements  meaning one has to be hidden while the other dis- played in its place , the function would require more parameters to fill in the blanks where explicit references are needed.  Note  A rendering bug in NN6 causes the form controls in the lower right frame to lose their settings when the elements have their display style property set to none. The  problem  is  related  to  the  inclusion  of  P  or  similar  block  elements  inside  a table  cell  that  contains  controls.  Therefore,  if  you  uncheck  and  recheck  the Communications  checkbox  in  the  example  page,  the  previously  displayed  sub- group shows up even though no radio buttons are selected. You can script around this bug by preserving radio button settings in a global variable as you hide the group, and restoring the settings when you show the group again.  document.formObject.checkboxObject.onClick   4855-7 ch08.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 351  Chapter 8 ✦ Button Objects  Chapter 24   351  Syntax used to address elements here is the W3C DOM-compatible form, so this  listing runs as is with IE5+ and NN6+.

In one instance, that index value is used to extract the value property for display in the alert dialog box; in the other instance, the value helps determine which button in the group is next in line to have its checked property set to true.

The goal is to see, in as general a way as possible  supplying the radio group name where needed , if the user changed the default setting. Looping through each of the radio buttons, you look for the one whose CHECKED attribute is set in the   defini- tion.

Whether you specify the one-line INPUT element or the multi-line TEXTAREA ele- ment, this is where visitors can not only express themselves, but also enter information in formats that might cause your carefully constructed back-end database to go haywire. More often than not, it is the text box that benefits most from client- side form validation.  Despite the fact that the primary user action in a text box is typing, keyboard events became available to scripters only starting with the version 4 browsers from both Microsoft and Netscape. But they arrived fully formed, with a suite of events for the downstroke, upstroke, and complete press-and-release action of typing a character. From there, the event object takes over to help scripts uncover the character code and whether the user held down any modifier keys while typing the character. You can find examples of this kind of event han- dling in the examples for Chapters 1 and 13 of this book.  Text boxes are not always as scriptable as you might like  them to be. Modern browsers can apply style sheets to adjust font characteristics of the complete text box, but you cannot, say, set some of the words inside a text box to bold. Even something as common  in other programs  as having the text insertion pointer automatically plant itself at the end of exist- ing text is possible so far only in IE4+ Windows via the TEXTAREA’s createTextRange   method and associated TextRange object methods  see TextRange object examples in Chapter 5 of this book . The moral of the story is to keep your expectations for the powers of text fields at moderate levels.   4855-7 ch09.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 358  358 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ Because the value property holds the string value of the text box, it is also  the property you use to dump new text into a box. Listings 25-2 and 25-3 read from and write to a text box, transforming the entered contents along the way. You see three different approaches to the task.  ✦ During client-side validation, you help the visitor by directing the text inser-  tion pointer to the text field that failed a validation. Listing 25-4 shows how to use the focus   and select   methods along with a workaround for an IE Windows timing problem that normally gets in the way.  ✦ Use the onChange event handler  not onBlur  as a trigger for real-time data validation, as demonstrated in Listing 25-6. You also see the syntax that pre- vents form submission when validation fails.  ✦ In IE4+ and NN6, you can adjust the size of a TEXTAREA element after the page  has loaded. The example for the cols and rows properties lets you see the results in The Evaluator.

The rules of HTML forms say that such a form submits itself if the user presses the Enter key whenever the field has focus. Such a submission to a form whose action is undefined causes the page to reload, thus stopping any scripts that are running at the time. FORM elements for of these example listings contain an onSubmit event handler that both blocks the submission and attempts to trigger the text box onChange event handler to run the demonstration script. In some browsers, such as IE5 Mac, you may have to press the Tab key or click outside of the text box to trigger the onChange event handler after you enter a new value.  Listing 25-1 has a simple form with a single field that has a default value set in its tag. A function  resetField    restores the contents of the page’s lone field to the value assigned to it in the   definition. For a single-field page such as this, defining a TYPE=”reset” button or calling form.reset   works the same way because such buttons reestablish default values of all elements of a form.

Enter any lowercase letters into the field and click out of the field. I pass a reference to the entire form object as a parameter to the event handler. The function extracts the value, converts it to uppercase  using one of the JavaScript string object methods , and assigns it back to the same field in that form.  Listing 25-2: Getting and Setting a Text Object’s Value       Text Object Value    function upperMe form  {  inputStr = form.converter.value form.converter.value = inputStr.toUpperCase    }      Continued  document.formObject.textObject.value   4855-7 ch09.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 362  362 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 25-2  continued       Enter lowercase letters for conversion to uppercase: <INPUT TYPE=”text” NAME=”converter” VALUE=”sample” onChange=”upperMe this.form ”>        I also show two other ways to accomplish the same task, each one more efficient  than the previous example. Both utilize the shortcut object reference to get at the heart of the text object. Listing 25-3 passes the text object — contained in the this reference — to the function handler. Because that text object contains a complete reference to it  out of sight, but there just the same , you can access the value property of that object and assign a string to that object’s value property in a sim- ple assignment statement.  Listing 25-3: Passing a Text Object  as this  to the Function       Text Object Value    function upperMe field  {  field.value = field.value.toUpperCase    }          Enter lowercase letters for conversion to uppercase: <INPUT TYPE=”text” NAME=”converter” VALUE=”sample” onChange=”upperMe this ”>        Yet another way is to deal with the field values directly in an embedded event  handler — instead of calling an external function  which is easier to maintain because all scripts are grouped together in the Head . With the function removed from the document, the event handler attribute of the   tag changes to do all the work: <INPUT TYPE=”text” NAME=”converter” VALUE=”sample” onChange=”this.value = this.value.toUpperCase  ”>  document.formObject.textObject.value   4855-7 ch09.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 363  Chapter 9 ✦ Text-Related Form Objects  Chapter 25   363  The right-hand side of the assignment expression extracts the current contents of the field and  with the help of the toUpperCase   method of the string object  converts the original string to all uppercase letters. The result of this operation is assigned to the value property of the field.  The application of the this keyword in the previous examples may be confusing at first, but these examples represent the range of ways in which you can use such references effectively. Using this by itself as a parameter to an object’s event han- dler refers only to that single object — a text object in Listing 25-3. If you want to pass along a broader scope of objects that contain the current object, use the this keyword along with the outer object layer that you want. In Listing 25-2, I sent a ref- erence to the entire form along by specifying this.form — meaning the form that contains “this” object, which is being defined in the line of HTML code.  At the other end of the scale, you can use similar-looking syntax to specify a par- ticular property of the this object. Thus, in the last example, I zeroed in on just the value property of the current object being defined — this.value. Although the formats of this.form and this.value appear the same, the fact that one is a ref- erence to an object and the other just a value can influence the way your functions work. When you pass a reference to an object, the function can read and modify properties of that object  as well as invoke its functions ; but when the parameter passed to a function is just a property value, you cannot modify that value without building a complete reference to the object and its value.

All work is controlled by the checkNumeric   function, which receives a reference to the field needing inspection as a parameter. Because of the way the delayed call to the doSelection   function has to be configured, various parts of what will become a valid reference to the form are extracted from the field’s and form’s properties. If the validation  performed in the isNumber   function  fails, the setSelection   method is invoked after an artificial delay of zero milliseconds. As goofy as this sounds, this method is all that IE needs to recover from the display and closure of the alert dia- log box. Because the first parameter of the setTimeout   method must be a string, the example assembles a string invocation of the setSelection   function via string versions of the form and field names. All that the setSelection   function does is focus and select the field whose reference is passed as a parameter. This function is now generalizable to work with multiple text boxes in a more complex form.

When the user tabs to or clicks on a field, the prompt message asso- ciated with that field appears in the statusbar. In Figure 9-1, the user has tabbed to the second text box, which caused the statusbar message to display a prompt for the field.

Because the form in Listing 25-6 has only one field, the example demonstrates a technique you can use that prevents a form from being “submitted” if the user acci- dentally presses the Enter key. The technique is as simple as defeating the submis- sion via the onSubmit event handler of the form. At the same time, the onSubmit event handler invokes the checkIt   function, so that pressing the Enter key  as well as pressing Tab or clicking outside the field  triggers the function.

Whether you choose the pop-up  menu or scrolling list display style, your page can provide vis- itors with a visually compact list of literally hundreds of items from which to choose. From a scripter’s point of view, how- ever, it is a complex item to manage, especially in older browsers.  In truth, the SELECT element is an outer wrapper for the OPTION element items nested within. Each OPTION element contains the text that the user sees in the list, as well as a hid- den value that may be more meaningful to a server database or client script. The difficulty with browsers prior to IE4 and NN6 is that reading the hidden value of the currently chosen item in the list requires an extensive reference to not only the SELECT element, but to the item in the array of OPTION ele- ment objects. To reach that specific item, the script uses a ref- erence to the SELECT object’s selectedIndex property as the options array index. Newer browsers simplify the matter by providing a single value property for the SELECT object that returns the value of the currently selected item  or of the first item when multiple choices are allowed .  Many browser versions provide script facilities for modify- ing the content of a SELECT list. But the effect is not perfect in browsers that don’t also reflow the page to reflect the poten- tially resized width of the list.  A user interface debate rages about whether a SELECT list, whose purpose is obviously intended to direct site navigation, should navigate immediately upon making a choice or if the user should also click on an explicit “Go” button next to the list. The former is faster for the impatient visitor, but the lat- ter doesn’t shoot off to an undesired page when the user makes a wrong selection. Good luck with that decision.   4855-7 ch10.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 370  370 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ To harvest the values of all selected items in a multiple list, your script needs  to cycle through the SELECT element’s options array and inspect the selected property of each, as shown in Listing 26-4.  ✦ Scripts can also retrieve the text of the selected item, instead of the hidden  value. Compare two similar applications that work with the text  Listing 26-5  and value  Listing 26-6  properties.  ✦ Listings 26-5 and 26-6 show the backward-compatible, long reference to  retrieve a chosen option’s details. The modern alternative accompanies the example for the SELECT.value property.  ✦ See Listing 26-8 for another example of triggering a script via the onChange  event handler of a SELECT object.  ✦ Implementations of the OPTGROUP element object may need improvement  before Listing 26-9 behaves as it should to modify hierarchical labels within a SELECT list.

The text of each item whose selected property is true is appended to the list. I add the “\n “ inline carriage returns and spaces to make the list in the alert dialog box look nice and indented. If you assign other values to the VALUE attributes of each option, the script can extract the options[index].value property to collect those values instead.

The color names are part of the collection built into all scriptable browsers; fortunately, the values are case-insensitive so that you can capitalize the color names displayed and assign them to the property.

But to set the color using the browser’s built-in color palette, you must use the one-word form. Those one-word values are stored in the VALUE attributes of each   definition. The function then reads the value property, assigning it to the bgColor of the current document. If you prefer to use the hexadecimal triplet form of color specifications, those values are assigned to the VALUE attributes   Dark Salmon .

Because this property always returns an integer value, it fulfills the needs of the index value for the options property. Therefore, if you select Green in the pop-up menu, form.colorsList.selectedIndex returns a value of 1; that reduces the rest of the reference to form.colorsList.options[1].text, which equals “Green.”  Listing 26-7: Using the selectedIndex Property  alert form.colorsList.options[form.colorsList.selectedIndex].text        Select Inspector    function inspect form  {  }               Red   Green   Blue                SELECT.selectedIndex   4855-7 ch10.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 376  376 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible   cid:3    cid:3   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5   cid:3   IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   size  Compatibility  Example  value  Compatibility  Example  }  Methods  The following statement sets the number of visible items to 5:  document.forms[0].mySelect.size = 5  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5   cid:3   IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3   The function in Listing 26-6 that accesses the chosen value the long way can be  simplified for newer browsers only with the following construction: function seeColor form  {  document.bgColor = form.colorsList.value  item index  namedItem “optionID”   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  The following statement assigns an OPTION element reference to a variable:  var oneOption = document.forms[0].mySelect.namedItem “option3_2”   SELECT.item     4855-7 ch10.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 377  Chapter 10 ✦ Select, Option, and Optgroup Objects  Chapter 26   377  Event handlers  onChange  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   IE5   cid:3   IE5.5   cid:3   Example  Listing 26-8 is a version of Listing 26-6 that invokes all action as the result of a  user making a selection from the pop-up menu. The onChange event handler in the   tag replaces the action button. For this application — when you desire a direct response to user input — an appropriate method is to have the action trig- gered from the pop-up menu rather than by a separate action button.  Notice two other important changes. First, the SELECT element now contains a  blank first option. When a user visits the page, nothing is selected yet, so you should present a blank option to encourage the user to make a selection. The func- tion also makes sure that the user selects one of the color-valued items before it attempts to change the background color.  Second, the BODY element contains an onUnload event handler that resets the  form. The purpose behind this is that if the user navigates to another page and uses the Back button to return to the page, the script-adjusted background color does not persist. I recommend you return the SELECT element to its original setting. Unfortunately, the reset does not stick to the form in IE4 and IE5 for Windows  although this problem appears to be repaired in IE5.5 . Another way to approach this issue is to use the onLoad event handler to invoke seeColor  , passing as a parameter a reference to the SELECT element. Thus, if the SELECT element choice persists, the background color is adjusted accordingly after the page loads.

Nowhere is that more apparent than in the TABLE element object and all the other objects that nest within  TR, TH, TD, and so on . Not only is it possible to swap the content of a table cell at any time, but the object models provide pow- erful methods for completely remolding the composition of a table on the fly.  HTML tables are at once elegant because they provide a lot  of pleasing organization to a page with little code, and also complex due to the large number of related elements and sub- stantial list of attributes for each element. Those attributes become object properties in the modern object model, so it means that scripters have much to choose from  and be con- fused by  when bringing tables to life.  Using the special-purpose methods that insert rows and cells also takes some initial adjustment for many scripters. For example, inserting a row has almost no visual effect on an existing table until you not only insert cells into the row, but also plant content in the cells. Code examples for these opera- tions are part of the general discussion of the TABLE object in the JavaScript Bible.  Designers whose browser targets are IE4+ Windows can also take advantage of Microsoft’s data binding technology. Data from external sources can fill tables with only the slight- est bit of HTML markup. Chapter 15 contains examples of this in its discussion of the dataFld and related properties.  This chapter also includes objects for ordered and  unordered lists  and list items nested within . In concert with style sheets that can include or exclude elements from page rendering, these objects provide additional layout opportuni- ties for clever designers.   4855-7 ch11.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 382  382 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ Scripts can adjust the value of a TABLE object’s width property, including  switching between a fixed pixel size and a percentage of the table container’s width.  ✦ Compare the examples for the IE5 Windows TABLE.cells property and the  TR.cells property for IE4+ and NN6.  ✦ Follow the example for the TD.colSpan property to observe how a table  responds to such changes in real time.  ✦ Examples for list-related elements show how to set the list types for script-  generated lists.

But you can shift the table to right-align with the body by entering the following statement into the top text box for IE5+ and NN6+: document.getElementById “myTable” .align = “right”  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   background  Compatibility  Example  Treat the background property of a table like you do the src property of an IMG  element object. If you precache an image, you can assign the src property of the precached image object to the background property of the table for quick image changing. Such an assignment statement looks like the following: document.all.myTable.background = imgArray[“myTableAlternate”].src  TABLE.background   4855-7 ch11.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 383  Chapter 11 ✦ Table and List Objects  Chapter 27   383  bgColor  Example  border  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to assign a color to the  table. After looking at the table to see its initial state, enter the following IE5+ NN6+ statement into the top text box: document.getElementById “myTable” .bgColor = “lightgreen”  When you look at the table again, you see that only some of the cells turned to green. This is because colors also are assigned to table elements nested inside the outermost table element, and the color specification closest to the actual element wins the contest.

While the table in The Evaluator already has a CAPTION element, the following statements replace it with an entirely new one. Enter each of the following statements into the top text box, starting with the one that saves a long reference into a variable for multiple uses at the end: t = document.getElementById “myTable”  a = document.createElement “CAPTION”  b = document.createTextNode “A Brand New Caption”  a.appendChild b  t.replaceChild a, t.caption   A view of the table shows that the new caption has replaced the old one because a table can have only one CAPTION element.  cellPadding cellSpacing  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to adjust the  cellPadding and cellSpacing properties of the demonstrator table.

Enter each of the following statements into the top text box  W3C DOM syntax shown here : document.getElementById “myTable” .rows[1].rowIndex document.getElementById “myTable” .rows[1].sectionRowIndex  The result of the first statement is 1 because the second row is the second row of the entire table.

The process entails modifying the insertTableRow   function so that it uses a do...while construction to keep adding cells to match the number of data slots.

Enter the fol- lowing statement into the top text box: document.getElementById “myTable” .rows[1].cells[0].colSpan = 3  Now that the first cell of the second row occupies the space of three columns, the browser has no choice but to shift the two other defined cells for that row out beyond the original boundary of the table. Experiment with the rowSpan property the same way.

Any script branching that relies on knowing details about the browser version or other aspects  of the environment running the browser calls upon the navigator object. Properties of the navigator object  also named the clientInformation object in IE4+ , reveal browser brand and version information, as well as operating system and, in some cases, encryption powers of the browser. Using signed scripts with NN4+, you can even script modifica- tion to browser preferences.  Avoid using navigator object properties for browser  version branching when more sophisticated techniques — notably object detection as described in Chapter 14 of the JavaScript Bible — are less dependent upon future quirks in object model developments. But version detection is perfect when you know that a special workaround is needed for some glitch in a specific version or class of browser. For example, NN4 Windows can exhibit some strange behavior when attempting to print a page whose content relies on script execution. Provided you have a code workaround for the problem, you can divert script execution for just that version of NN in just the Windows version.  Examples in this chapter also touch upon the screen  object and the IE Windows userProfile object. The screen object is useful in determining the size of a new window, but there is little need to script the userProfile object.   4855-7 ch12.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 398  398 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ Listing 28-1 provides numerous functions that examine navigator object  properties.

This is not intended in any way to be an all-inclusive browser-sniffing routine; instead, I offer samples of how to extract information from the key navigator properties to determine various browser conditions.  All functions in Listing 28-1 return a Boolean value inline with the pseudo-  question presented in the function’s name. For example, the isWindows   function returns true if the browser is any type of Windows browser; otherwise, it returns false.

To run this script without signing the scripts, turn on codebase principals as directed in Chapter 46 of the JavaScript Bible.  The listing file on the CD-ROM does not employ signed scripts.   One function reads all the preferences and sets the form control values accord- ingly. Another function sets a preference when you click its checkbox. Because of the interaction among three of the cookie settings, it is easier to have the script rerun the showPreferences   function after each setting rather than you trying to manually control the properties of the three checkboxes. Rerunning that function also helps verify that you set the preference.

Although cross-browser developers must concern themselves with the incompatibilities of as many as three distinct event models  NN4, IE4+, and W3C DOM used in NN6 , scripts increasingly rely on information conveyed by the event object to know where the event came from.  The importance of event object properties is clear when you  see how modern DOMs bind events to objects. Although the “old-fashioned” event handler attribute inside an element tag still works, the prescribed ways to bind events to elements sim- ply assign a function reference to an event type belonging to the event. The significance of this approach is that event han- dlers no longer receive custom parameters, such as references to the element that used to be passed via the this operator. It becomes the job of the function to inspect the event object property that contains a reference to the target of the event. Fortunately for scripters, the event object model  regard- less of which ones you need to support  endows each event object with a list of valuable properties that enhance what event handler functions can do. In addition to character key and mouse button data, you can uncover the coordinates of a mouse event, the condition of modifier keys, and even a refer- ence to the object from which the cursor has just rolled  or where it went after leaving the bounds of the current object .  The code examples in this chapter are grouped by the event object model family. This means that the examples are written to work only within the associated DOM. For cross-browser handling of event objects, see the rest of the discussion in Chapter 29 of the JavaScript Bible. But use the examples here to fully understand the meaning of each event object’s properties and  in NN6  methods. Where possible, the listings that demon- strate parallel properties in multiple object models look and behave the same to the user; the differences are in the code. As an exercise for the inquisitive, you could write a single-page version that combines syntax from multiple event objects mod- els. Listings 29-17 and 29-22 would be good places to start.   4855-7 ch13.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 410  410 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ No fewer than four pairs of coordinate value properties arrive with the IE4+  event object. Listing 29-14 helps you understand what each pair of values rep- resent with respect to regular body elements as well as positioned elements. Follow the suggested steps to experience the meaning of the properties in a variety of contexts.  ✦ Load Listing 29-16 to see keyboard character data for all three keyboard  events. Again, follow the suggested steps to understand important differences among keyboard event types and also different kinds of keys  characters ver- sus non-characters .  ✦ Listing 29-17 demonstrates how to derive a reference to the element that  receives the event in the IE4+ event model.  ✦ NN6 keyboard events get a workout in Listing 29-18, particularly the way the  character and key codes reveal important details for different keyboard event types.  ✦ All four pairs of event coordinate properties for NN6 are reported when you  run Listing 29-19 and click on different elements.  ✦ The important concepts associated with the NN6 event object’s  currentTarget and eventPhase properties are demonstrated in Listing 29-20. Be prepared to spend time with the page and the source code to under- stand how events propagate through the element hierarchy.  ✦ Listing 29-23 uses the NN6 event.timeStamp property to calculate the  instantaneous typing speed within a text field.

To run this script without signing the scripts, turn on codebase principals, as directed in Chapter 46 of the JavaScript Bible.  To experiment with this listing, load the page and drag any desktop icons that represent files, applications, or folders to the window. Select multiple items and drag them all at once. Because the onDragDrop event handler evaluates to return false, the files are not loaded into the window. If you want merely to look at the   NN4  eventObject.data   4855-7 ch13.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 411  Chapter 13 ✦ Event Objects  Chapter 29   411  URL and allow only some to process, you would generate an if...else construc- tion to return true or false to the event handler as needed. A value of return true allows the normal processing of the DragDrop event to take place after your event handler function has completed its processing.

Part of the page contains a three-field readout of the layer-, page-, and screen-level properties. Two clickable objects are provided so that you can see the differences between an object not in any layer and an object residing within a layer. The object not confined by a layer has its layer and page coordinates the same in the event object properties.  Additional readouts display the event object coordinates for resizing and moving  a window. If you maximize the window under Windows, the Navigator browser’s top-left corner is actually out of sight, four pixels up and to the left. That’s why the screenX and screenY values are both -4.

Click the dot above the “i” on the “Click Here” button label. The target ele- ment is the button  INPUT  element, whose offsetParent is a table cell  element. The offsetY value is very low because you are near the top of the element’s own coordinate space. The client coordinates  and x and y , how- ever, are relative to the viewable area in the window. If your browser window is maximized in Windows, the screenX and clientX values will be the same; the difference between screenY and clientY is the height of all the window chrome above the content region. With the window not scrolled at all, the client coordinates are the same with and without scrolling taken into account.  2. Jot down the various coordinate values and then scroll the page down slightly   clicking the scrollbar fires an event  and click the dot on the button again. The clientY value shrinks because the page has moved upward relative to the viewable area, making the measure between the top of the area smaller with respect to the button. The Windows version does the right thing with the offset properties, by continuing to return values relative to the element’s own coordinate space; the Mac, unfortunately, subtracts the scrolled amount from the offset properties.  3. Click the large image. The client properties perform as expected for both Windows and Mac, as do the screen properties. For Windows, the x and y properties correctly return the event coordinates relative to the IMG ele- ment’s offsetParent, which is the DIV element that surrounds it. Note, how- ever, that the browser “sees” the DIV as starting 10 pixels to the left of the image. In IE5.5 Windows, you can click within those ten transparent pixels to the left of the image to click the DIV element. This padding is inserted auto- matically and impacts the coordinates of the x and y properties. A more reli- able measure of the event inside the image is the offset properties. The same is true in the Macintosh version, as long as the page isn’t scrolled, in which case the scroll, just as in Step 2, affects the values above.  4. Click the top HR element under the heading. It may take a couple of tries to  actually hit the element  you’ve made it when the HR element shows up in the srcElement box . This is to reinforce the way the client properties provide coordinates within the element itself  again, accept on the Mac when the page is scrolled . Clicking at the very left end of the rule, you eventually find the 0,0 coordinate.   IE  event.clientX   4855-7 ch13.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 416  416 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Finally, if you are a Windows user, here are two examples to try to see some of  the unexpected behavior of coordinate properties.  1. With the page not scrolled, click anywhere along the right side of the page, away from any text so that the BODY element is srcElement. Because the BODY element theoretically fills the entire content region of the browser win- dow, all coordinate pairs except for the screen coordinates should be the same. But offset properties are two pixels less than all the others. By and large, this difference won’t matter in your scripts, but you should be aware of this potential discrepancy if precise positioning is important. For inexplicable reasons, the offset properties are measured in a space that is inset two pixels from the left and top of the window. This is not the case in the Macintosh ver- sion, where all value pairs are the same from the BODY perspective.   2. Click the text of the H1 or P elements  just above and below the long horizon- tal rule at the top of the page . In theory, the offset properties should be rela- tive to the rectangles occupied by these elements  they’re block elements, after all . But instead, they’re measured in the same space as the client prop- erties  plus the two pixels . This unexpected behavior doesn’t have anything to do with the cursor being a text cursor, because if you click inside any of the text box elements, their offset properties are properly relative to their own rectangles. This problem does not afflict the Macintosh version.  You can see further examples of important event coordinate properties in action  in the discussion of dragging elements around the IE page in Chapter 31 of the JavaScript Bible.  fromElement toElement  Compatibility  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Listing 29-15 provides an example of how the fromElement and toElement  properties can reveal the life of the cursor action before and after it rolls into an element. When you roll the cursor to the center box  a table cell , its onMouseOver event handler displays the text from the table cell from which the cursor arrived. In Figure 13-1, for example, the user has just rolled the cursor into the center box from the West box. If the cursor comes in from one of the corners  not easy to do , a dif- ferent message is displayed.

Roll the mouse away from the center box and look for departure information in the status bar.         North       West   Roll   East       South             IE  event.fromElement   4855-7 ch13.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 418  418 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Figure 13-1: onMouseOver event object knows whence the pointer  came.  This is a good example to experiment with in the browser, because it also reveals  a potential limitation. The element registered as the toElement or fromElement must fire a mouse event to register itself with the browser. If not, the next element in the sequence that registers itself is the one acknowledged by these properties. For example, if you roll the mouse into the center box and then extremely quickly roll the cursor to the bottom of the page, you may bypass the South box entirely. The text that appears in the statusbar is actually the inner text of the BODY ele- ment, which is the element that caught the first mouse event to register itself as the toElement for the center table cell.

Enter a lowercase letter “a”. Notice how the onKeyPress event handler shows  the code to be 97, which is the Unicode  and ASCII  value for the first of the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. But the other two events record just the key’s code: 65.  2. Type an uppercase “A” via the Shift key. If you watch closely, you see that the Shift key, itself, generates the code 16 for the onKeyDown and onKeyUp events.   IE  event.keyCode   4855-7 ch13.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 420  420 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  But the character key then shows the value 65 for all three events, because the ASCII value of the uppercase letter happens to match the keyboard key code for that letter.  3. Press and release the Down Arrow key  be sure the cursor still flashes in the TEXTAREA, because that’s where the keyboard events are being monitored . As a non-character key, it does not fire an onKeyPress event. But it does fire the other events, and assigns 40 as the code for this key.  4. Poke around with other non-character keys. Some may produce dialog boxes  or menus, but their key codes are recorded nonetheless. Note that not all keys on a Macintosh keyboard register with IE Mac.

Moreover, many of the other examples in Chapter 15 of the JavaScript Bible can substitute the returnValue property way of canceling the default action if the scripts were to be run exclusively on IE4+.

The idea is that the onMouseDown and onMouseUp events will bub- ble up from whatever their targets are, and the event handler functions will find out which element is the target and modify the color style of that element.  An extra flair is added to the script in that each function also checks the  className property of the target element. If the className is bold — a class name shared by three SPAN elements in the paragraph — the style sheet rule for that class is modified so that all items share the same color  see Figure 13-2 . Your scripts can do even more in the way of filtering objects that arrive at the functions to perform special operations on certain objects or groups of objects.

You can view coordinate values for all four measuring systems, as well as some calculated value. Two clickable objects are provided so that you can see the differences between an object not in any layer and an object residing within a layer  although anything you see is clickable, including text nodes .

But, as you will see, these calculated values are the same as the more conve- nient page coordinates. The other calculated field shows the coordinates relative to the rectangular space of the target element. Notice in the code that if the nodeType of the target indicates a text node, that node’s parent node  an element  is used for the calculation.

Similar to the code in Listing 29-7, this example is made simpler because it lets the event object’s proper- ties do more of the work to reveal the identity of each element that processes the event. Event listeners assigned for various propagation modes are assigned to a variety of nodes in the document. After you click the button, each listener in the propagation chain fires in sequence. The alert dialog shows which node is process- ing the event. And, as in Listing 29-7, the eventPhase property is used to help dis- play the propagation mode in force at the time the event is processed by each node.

For example, if you click to the right  of the button, you will be clicking the FORM element. Event propagation and pro- cessing adjusts accordingly. Similarly, if you click the header text, the only event lis- teners that see the event are in the document and BODY levels.

NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Listing 29-21 provides an example of how the relatedTarget property can  reveal the life of the cursor action before and after it rolls into an element. When you roll the cursor to the center box  a table cell , its onMouseOver event handler displays the text from the table cell from which the cursor arrived  the nodeValue of the text node inside the table cell . If the cursor comes in from one of the corners  not easy to do , a different message is displayed.  The two functions that report the results employ a bit of filtering to make sure  that they process the event object only if the event occurs on an element and if the relatedTarget element is anything other than a nested text node of the central table cell element. Because nodes respond to events in NN6, this extra filtering prevents processing whenever the cursor makes the transition from the central TD element to its nested text node.

As described in  Chapter 30 of the JavaScript Bible, object models that support scriptable style sheets define both the STYLE element object  representing the element created with a   tag pair  and the more abstract styleSheet object. The latter may be created by virtue of a STYLE element or perhaps imported from an external style sheet definition file.  Use the styleSheet object to gain access to the details of  the rules defined for a given style sheet. Methods of the styleSheet object  different syntax for IE4+ and W3C object models  allow dynamic creation or deletion of rules within a style sheet. Properties of the styleSheet object  again, dif- ferent syntax  return arrays of objects representing the style rules contained by the style sheet. The rule objects them- selves have properties allowing reading and writing of rule selectors and even individual style attributes within that rule  since a single rule can list multiple style attributes .  Examples Highlights  ✦ Compare examples for the styleSheet.cssRules and  styleSheet.rules properties to see how different browsers provide access to arrays of rule objects.  ✦ You can observe in The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the  JavaScript Bible  how the styleSheet.disabled prop- erty can switch a style sheet on and off dynamically.  ✦ Compare the styleSheet object method pairs for  inserting and deleting rules to an existing style sheet. The walk-through examples let you follow the same steps for both the IE4+ and NN6 syntaxes.  ✦ The final example in this chapter demonstrates how  scripts can modify a single attribute of a style sheet rule.   4855-7 ch14.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 436  436 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  The syntax in the demonstration is for NN6 and IE5 Mac, but referencing the cssRules property provides the same access for the IE4+ object model.  styleSheet Object  Properties  cssRules  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  Compatibility   cid:3   IE5    cid:3    IE5.5    cid:3    Example  Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to look at the cssRules  property in NN6+ or IE5+ Mac.

The method returns no value, so the Results box correctly reports undefined after evaluating the deleteRule   example statement. At the same time, the method has genuinely removed the rule from the styleSheet object  as proven by inspecting the length property of the document.styleSheets[0].cssRules array . But the browser does not refresh the page display to reflect the removal of the rule.   styleSheetObject.deleteRule     4855-7 ch14.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 440  440 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  cssRule and rule Objects  Properties  selectorText  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Use The Evaluator  Chapter 13 in the JavaScript Bible  to examine the  selectorText property of rules in the first styleSheet object of the page.

Only Navigator 4 has its own set of dedicated positionable objects: the LAYER and ILAYER element objects. In the IE4+ and W3C DOMs, virtually any renderable element is positionable, although it is common practice to restrict such activity to SPAN and DIV elements. Because properties of the SPAN, DIV, and other HTML element objects are covered in detail in other chapters, Chapter 31 provides the details of the NN4 layer object.   Examples shown here support NN4 layer object details, but the rest of the discussion and code listings in JavaScript Bible Chapter 31 go to great lengths to recreate the same behaviors in both the IE4+ and W3C  NN6  object models. This will help those scripters who developed extensively for NN4’s Dynamic HTML make the transition to NN6 and its support for Dynamic HTML  which is not much different from that in the IE4+ object model . Obviously, all examples shown below require NN4.  Examples Highlights  ✦ Clipping of layer rectangles is not an easy concept to  grasp at first  in any object model . Listing 31-2 provides a workbench to explore the various properties associ- ated with the clipping rectangle. Listing 31-5 demon- strates the relationship between moving a layer and adjusting its clipping rectangle.  ✦ Listing 31-6 is an extensive demonstration of a variety of  layer coordinate system properties.  ✦ Most layer object properties are handled in later object  models through style sheet property manipulation. Listing 31-8 shows the NN4 layer way of handling a layer’s visibility, while Listing 31-9 demonstrates adjust- ing the stacking order of layers.   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 442  442 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  ✦ Scripts for dragging a layer  with the help of the layer object’s move methods  appear in Listing 31-11. Another type of dragging — dragging a corner to resize a layer — takes center stage in Listing 31-12a.

The page is almost in the form of a laboratory quiz that enables you to query yourself about the values of these prop- erties for two swappable layers.  Listing 31-1: A Layer Quiz        function checkAbove oneLayer  {  document.forms[0].errors.value = “” document.forms[0].output.value = oneLayer.above.name  } function checkBelow oneLayer  {  document.forms[0].errors.value = “” document.forms[0].output.value = oneLayer.below.name  } function swapLayers   {  if  document.yeller.above  {  document.yeller.moveAbove document.greeny   document.greeny.moveAbove document.yeller   } else {  }  }  document.layerObject.above   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 443  Chapter 15 ✦ The NN4 Layer Object  Chapter 31   443  function onerror msg  {  document.forms[0].output.value = “” document.forms[0].errors.value = msg return true  }        Layer Ordering      Results:   <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Who’s ABOVE the Yellow layer?” onClick=”checkAbove document.yeller ”>  <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Who’s BELOW the Yellow layer?” onClick=”checkBelow document.yeller ”>  <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Who’s ABOVE the Green layer?” onClick=”checkAbove document.greeny ”>  <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Who’s BELOW the Green layer?” onClick=”checkBelow document.greeny ”>     If there are any errors caused by missing   properties, they will appear below:          This is just a yellow layer.       This is just a green layer.         The page contains two layers: one colored yellow and the other light green.  Legends on four buttons ask you to guess whether one layer is above or below the other. For example, if you click the button labeled “Who’s ABOVE the Yellow layer?” and the green layer is above it, the name of that green layer appears in the Results field. But if layers are oriented such that the returned value is null, the error mes- sage  indicating that the nonexistent object doesn’t have a name property  appears in the error field at the bottom. Another button enables you to swap the order of the layers so you can try your hand at predicting the results based on your knowl- edge of layers and the above and below properties. Positioned objects in IE4+ and NN6 have no comparable properties to the four described in this section.  document.layerObject.above   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 444  444 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  background  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  A simple example  Listing 31-2  defines one layer that features five buttons to  change the background image of a second layer. I put the buttons in a layer because I want to make sure the buttons and background layer rectangles align themselves along their top edges on all platforms.  As the second layer loads, I merely assign a gray background color to it and write some reverse  white  text. Most of the images are of the small variety that repeat in the layer. One is a large photograph to demonstrate how images are clipped to the layer’s rectangle. Along the way, I hope you also heed the lesson of readability demonstrated by the difficulty of reading text on a wild-looking back- ground. For an example compatible with IE5+ and NN6+, see Listing 31-13.

The page presents a kind of palette of eight colors, each one created as a small layer  see Figure 15-1 . Another, larger layer’s bgColor property changes as you roll the mouse over any color in the palette.  Figure 15-1: Drag the mouse across the palette to change the  layer’s background color.  To save HTML lines to create those eight color palette layers, I use a script to establish an array of colors and then document.write   the   tags with appropriate attribute settings so the layers all line up in a contiguous row. By pre- defining a number of variable values for the size of the color layers, I can make all of them larger or smaller with the change of only a few script characters.  The document object handles the job of capturing the mouseOver events. I turn  on the document’s captureEvents   method such that it traps all mouseOver  document.layerObject.bgColor   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 446  446 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  events and hands them to the setColor   function. The setColor   function reads the target object’s bgColor and sets the larger layer’s bgColor property to the same. If this page had other objects that could receive mouseOver events for other purposes, I would use routeEvents   to let those events pass on to their intended targets. For the purposes of this example, however, the events need to go no further. Listing 31-14 in the JavaScript Bible shows the same functionality work- ing in IE5+ and NN6+.  Listing 31-3: Layer Background Colors        function setColor e  {  document.display.bgColor = e.target.bgColor  } document.captureEvents Event.MOUSEOVER  document.onmouseover = setColor        Layer Background Colors      var oneLayer var colorTop = 100 var colorLeft = 20 var colorWidth = 40 var colorHeight = 40 var colorPalette = new Array “aquamarine”,”coral”,”forestgreen”,”goldenrod”,”red”,  “magenta”,”navy”,”teal”   for  var i = 0; i < colorPalette.length; i++  {  oneLayer = “<LAYER NAME=swatch” + i + “ TOP=” + colorTop oneLayer += “ LEFT=” +   colorWidth * i  + colorLeft  oneLayer += “ WIDTH=” + colorWidth + “ HEIGHT=” + colorHeight oneLayer += “ BGCOLOR=” + colorPalette[i] + “> \n” document.write oneLayer   }        Some reversed text to test against background colors.           document.layerObject.bgColor   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 447  Chapter 15 ✦ The NN4 Layer Object  Chapter 31   447  clip  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  Because of the edge movement behavior of adjustments to layerObject.clip properties, Listing 31-4 enables you to experiment with adjustments to each of the six properties. The document loads one layer that you can adjust by entering alter- native values into six text fields — one per property. Figure 15-2 shows the page.  Figure 15-2: Experiment with layer.clip properties.  As you enter values, all properties are updated to show their current values  via the showValues   function . Pay particular attention to the apparent motion of the edge and the effect the change has on at least one other property. For example, a change to the layerObject.clip.left value also affects the layerObject.clip. width property value.

After the document loads, the onLoad event handler initializes two global variables that represent the starting height and width of the layer as deter- mined by the clip.height and clip.width properties. Because the   tag does not specify any CLIP attributes, the layerObject.clip region is ensured of being the same as the layer’s dimensions at load time.  I preserve the initial values for a somewhat advanced set of functions that act in  response to the Reveal Original Layer button. The goal of this button is to tem- porarily shrink the clipping area to nothing and then expand the clip rectangle gradually from the very center of the layer. The effect is analogous to a zoom-out visual effect.  The clip region shrinks to practically nothing by setting all four edges to the  same point midway along the height and width of the layer. The script then uses setInterval   to control the animation in setClip  . To make the zoom even on both axes, I first make sure that the initial size of the layer is an even ratio: twice as wide as it is tall. Each time through the setClip   function, the clip.left and clip.right values are adjusted in their respective directions by two pixels and clip.top and clip.bottom are adjusted by one pixel.  To make sure the animation stops when the layer is at its original size, I check  whether the clip.top and clip.left values are their original zero values. If they are, I set a Boolean variable for each side. When both variables indicate that the clip rectangle is its original size, the script cancels the setInterval   action. Listing 31-15 in the JavaScript Bible demonstrates how to adjust clipping in IE5+ and NN6+ syntax.  left top  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  To enable you to experiment with manually setting layerObject.top and  layerObject.left properties, Listing 31-5 is a modified version of the layer.clip example  Listing 31-4 . The current example again has the one modifiable layer, but it has only four text fields in which you can enter values. Two fields are for the layerObject.left and layerObject.top properties; the other two are for the layerObject.clip.left and layerObject.clip.top properties. I present both sets of values here to help reinforce the lack of connection between layer and clip location properties in the same layer object. You can find the corresponding syntax for IE5+ and NN6+ in Listing 31-16 of the JavaScript Bible.  document.layerObject.left   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 451  Chapter 15 ✦ The NN4 Layer Object  Chapter 31   451  Listing 31-5: Comparison of Layer and Clip Location  Properties       Layer vs. Clip    function setClip field  {  var clipVal = parseInt field.value  document.display.clip[field.name] = clipVal showValues    } function setLayer field  {  var layerVal = parseInt field.value  document.display[field.name] = layerVal showValues    } function showValues   {  var form = document.layers[0].document.forms[0] form.elements[0].value = document.display.left form.elements[1].value = document.display.top form.elements[2].value = document.display.clip.left form.elements[3].value = document.display.clip.top  }        Layer vs. Clip Location Properties    Enter new layer and clipping values to adjust the layer.            layer.left:        layer.top:        layer.clip.left:        layer.clip.top:                             Continued  document.layerObject.left   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 452  452 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 31-5  continued        ARTICLE I    Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.          pageX pageY  Example  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Listing 31-6 defines one outer layer and one nested inner layer of different colors   see Figure 15-3 . The inner layer contains some text content; the outer layer is sized initially to present a colorful border by being below the inner layer and 10 pix- els wider and taller.  Two sets of fields display  and enable you to change  the layerObject.pageX, layerObject.pageY, layerObject.left, and layerObject.top properties for each of the nested layers. Each set of fields is color-coded to its corresponding layer.  When you change any value, all values are recalculated and displayed in the  other fields. For example, the initial pageX position for the outer layer is 200 pixels; for the inner layer, the pageX value is 205 pixels  accounting for the 5-pixel “border” around the inner layer . If you change the outer layer’s pageX value to 220, the outer layer moves to the right by 20 pixels, taking the inner layer along for the ride. The layer.pageX value for the inner layer after the move is 225 pixels.  The outer layer values for the pairs of values are always the same no matter what. But for the inner layer, the page values are significantly different from the layer.left and layer.top values because these latter values are measured rela- tive to their containing layer — the outer layer. If you move the outer layer, the inner layer values for layerObject.left and layerObject.top don’t change one iota.

Listing 31-7 presents a workspace for you to see how changing the src property of outer and inner layers affects the scenery.  When you first load the document, one outer layer contains one inner layer  each  with a different background color . Control buttons on the page enable you to set the layerObject.src property of each layer independently. Changes to the inner layer content affect only that layer. Long content forces the inner layer to expand its depth, but the inner layer’s view is automatically clipped by its parent layer.  Changing the outer layer content, however, removes the inner layer completely.  Code in the following listing shows one way to examine for the presence of a particular layer before attempting to load new content in it. If the inner layer doesn’t exist, the script creates a new layer on the fly to replace the original inner layer.  document.layerObject.src   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 456  456 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 31-7: Setting Nested Layer Source Content       Layer Source    function loadOuter doc  {  document.outerDisplay.src = doc  } function loadInner doc  {  var nested = document.outerDisplay.document.layers if  nested.length > 0  {     inner layer exists, so load content or restore if  doc  {  nested[0].src = doc  } else {  restoreInner nested[0]      prompt user about restoring inner layer if  confirm “The inner layer has been removed by loading an “ + “outer document.

The key difference is that the scripts use the layerObject.resizeTo   method to set the layers to the height and width established by the   tags that create the layers in the first place. This method, however, sets the clipping rectangle of the layer — not the layer’s size. Therefore, if you use the script to restore the layers, loading the longer text file into either layer does not force the layer to expand to display all the content; the clip- ping region governs the view.  visibility  NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   document.layerObject.visibility   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 458  458 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Example  Use the page in Listing 31-8 to see how the layerObject.visibility property  settings affect a pair of nested layers.

Listing 31-9 offers a way to see the results of changing the layerObject.zIndex properties of three overlapping sibling layers. Figure 15-4 shows the beginning organi- zation of layers after the page loads.  Figure 15-4: A place to play with zIndex property settings  The sequence of the   tags in the document governs the original stacking order. Because the attribute is not set in the HTML, the initial values appear as zero for all three layers. But, as the page reveals, the layerObject.above and layerObject.below properties are automatically established. When a layer has no other layer object above it, the page shows  none . Also, if the layer below the bottom of the stack is the main window, a strange inner layer name is assigned  something like _js_layer_21 .  To experiment with this page, first make sure you understand the  layerObject.above and layerObject.below readings for the default order of  the layers. Then, assign different orders to the layers with value sequences such as  document.layerObject.zIndex   4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 460  460 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  3-2-1, 1-3-2, 2-2-2, and so on. Each time you enter one new value, check the actual layers to see if their stacking order changed and how that affected the other prop- erties of all layers. Listing 31-20 in the JavaScript Bible shows how to achieve the same action with IE5+ and NN6+ syntax.

It is a simple script that enables you to click and drag a layer around the screen. The script employs the coordinate values of the mouseMove event; after compensating for the offset within the layer at which the click occurs, the script moves the layer to track the mouse action.  I want to present this example for an additional reason: to explain an important  user interface difference between Windows and Macintosh versions of NN4. In Windows versions, you can click and hold the mouse button down on an object and let the object receive all the mouseMove events as you drag the cursor around the screen. On the Macintosh, however, NN4 tries to compensate for the lack of a sec- ond mouse button by popping up a context-sensitive menu at the cursor position when the user holds the mouse button down for more than just a click. To prevent the pop-up menu from appearing, the engage   method invoked by the onMouseDown event handler ends with return false.  Notice in the following listing how the layer captures a number of mouse events.  Each one plays an important role in creating a mode that is essentially like a mouseStillDown event  which doesn’t exist in NN4’s event model . The mouseDown event sets a Boolean flag  engaged  indicating that the user clicked down in the  document.layerObject.moveBy     4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 464  464 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  layer. At the same time, the script records how far away from the layer’s top-left corner the mouseDown event occurred. This offset information is needed so that any setting of the layer’s location takes this offset into account  otherwise, the top-left corner of the layer would jump to the cursor position and be dragged from there .  During the drag  mouseDown events firing with each mouse movement , the dragIt   function checks whether the drag mode is engaged. If so, the layer is moved to the page location calculated by subtracting the original downstroke offset from the mouseMove event location on the page. When the user releases the mouse button, the mouseUp event turns off the drag mode Boolean value. Listing 31-21 in the JavaScript Bible shows a version of this example for IE5+ and NN6.  Listing 31-11: Dragging a Layer       Layer Dragging    var engaged = false var offsetX = 0 var offsetY = 0 function dragIt e  {  if  engaged  {  }  } function engage e  {  engaged = true offsetX = e.pageX - document.myLayer.left offsetY = e.pageY - document.myLayer.top return false  } function release   { engaged = false  document.myLayer.moveTo e.pageX - offsetX, e.pageY - offsetY   }        Dragging a Layer         Drag me around the window.        document.myLayer.captureEvents Event.MOUSEDOWN  Event.MOUSEUP  Event.MOUSEMOVE  document.myLayer.onMouseDown = engage document.myLayer.onMouseUp = release document.myLayer.onMouseMove = dragIt        document.layerObject.moveBy     4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 465  Chapter 15 ✦ The NN4 Layer Object  Chapter 31   465  resizeBy deltaX,deltaY  resizeTo width,height   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3   Example  It is important to understand the ramifications of content flow when these two  methods resize a layer. Listing 31-12a  and the companion document Listing 31-12b  shows you how to set the lower-right corner of a layer to be dragged by a user for resizing the layer  much like grabbing the resize corner of a document window . Three radio buttons enable you to choose whether and when the content should be redrawn to the layer — never, after resizing, or during resizing.  Event capture is very much like that in Listing 31-11 for layer dragging. The pri-  mary difference is that drag mode is engaged only when the mouse event takes place in the region of the lower-right corner. A different kind of offset value is saved here because, for resizing, the script needs to know the mouse event offset from the right and bottom edges of the layer.  Condition statements in the resizeIt   and release   functions verify  whether a specific radio button is checked to determine when  or if  the content should be redrawn. I designed this page with the knowledge that its content might be redrawn. Therefore, I built the content of the layer as a separate HTML docu- ment that loads in the   tag.  Redrawing the content requires reloading the document into the layer. I use the  layerObject.load   method because I want to send the current layerObject.clip.width as a parameter for the width of the clip region to accommodate the content as it loads.  An important point to know about reloading content into a layer is that all prop-  erty settings for the layer’s event capture are erased when the document loads. Overcoming this behavior requires setting the layer’s onLoad event handler to set the layer’s event capture mechanism. If the layer event capturing is specified as part of the statements at the end of the document, the layer ignores some important events needed for the dynamic resizing after the document reloads the first time. As you experiment with the different ways to resize and redraw, you see that  redrawing during resizing is a slow process because of the repetitive loading  from cache  needed each time. On slower client machines, it is easy for the cursor to outrun the layer region, causing the layer to not get mouseOver events at all. It may not be the best-looking solution, but I prefer to redraw after resizing the layer.  Listing 31-22 in the JavaScript Bible shows a version designed for the IE5+ and  NN6 object models. Because content automatically reflows in those browsers, you do not have to load the content of the positioned element from an external  document.  document.layerObject.resizeBy     4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 466  466 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 31-12a: Resizing a Layer       Layer Resizing    var engaged = false var offsetX = 0 var offsetY = 0 function resizeIt e  {  if  engaged  {  document.myLayer.resizeTo e.pageX + offsetX, e.pageY + offsetY  if  document.forms[0].redraw[2].checked  {  document.myLayer.load “lst31-12b.htm”, document.myLayer.clip.width   }  } function engage e  {  }  }  } function release   {  } engaged = false  } function grabEvents   {  if  e.pageX >  document.myLayer.clip.right - 10  &&  e.pageY >  document.myLayer.clip.bottom - 10   { engaged = true offsetX = document.myLayer.clip.right - e.pageX offsetY = document.myLayer.clip.bottom - e.pageY  if  engaged && document.forms[0].redraw[1].checked  {  document.myLayer.load “lst31-12b.htm”, document.myLayer.clip.width   document.myLayer.captureEvents Event.MOUSEDOWN  Event.MOUSEUP   Event.MOUSEMOVE  }        Resizing a Layer      Redraw layer content:   Never  After resize  During resize   <LAYER NAME=”myLayer” SRC=”lst31-12b.htm” BGCOLOR=”lightblue” TOP=120 LEFT=100 WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=190 onLoad=”grabEvents  ”>      document.layerObject.resizeBy     4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 467  Chapter 15 ✦ The NN4 Layer Object  Chapter 31   467  document.myLayer.onMouseDown = engage document.myLayer.onMouseUp = release document.myLayer.onMouseMove = resizeIt        Listing 31-12b: Content for the Resizable Layer    Resize me by dragging the lower-right corner.     if  navigator.userAgent.indexOf “Mac”  != -1  {  document.write “ Mac users: Ctrl-Click me first; then Click to stop       dragging. ”   }          ✦  ✦  ✦  document.layerObject.resizeBy     4855-7 ch15.F  6 26 01  8:36 AM  Page 468   4855-7 ch16.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 469  1616C H A P T E R  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  In This Chapter  Parsing text at the character level  Performing search- and-replace operations with regular expressions  Converting between character codes and text  Setting number format and precision  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  String and Number Objects  Chapters 34 and 35  Knowing how to manipulate strings of text characters is a  vital programming skill. You may not have to do it all  the time, but you should be fully aware of the possibilities for this manipulation that are built into whatever programming language you use. In JavaScript  as in any object-based or object-oriented language , strings are objects that have numerous properties and methods to assist in assembling, tearing apart, extracting, and copying chunks of strings.   Any characters that users enter into text boxes become parts of string objects. In IE4+ and NN6, text inside HTML element tags can be treated as strings. In IE4+, you can even work with the HTML tags as strings. Therefore, of all the core language objects to implant in your scripting consciousness, the string object is it  arrays, whose examples come in the next chapter of this book, rank Number Two on the list .  Numbers are much less frequently thought of as objects  because they tend to be used as-is for calculations. JavaScript 1.5 in recent browsers, however, endows the number object with practical methods, especially one that  finally  offers built-in control over the number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal point for floating-point numbers.  When examples in this chapter encourage you to enter a sequence of expressions in The Evaluator, be sure to follow through with every step. But also make sure you understand the results of each expression in order to visualize the partic- ular method operates.   4855-7 ch16.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 470  470 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Examples Highlights  ✦ Study the code and operation of Listing 34-2 to see how to use JavaScript to  convert characters to character codes and vice versa.

Moreover, because  one of the demonstrations relies on the automatic capture of selected text on the page, the scripts include code to accommodate the different handling of selection events and capture of the selected text in Navigator and Internet Explorer 4.  After you load the page, select part of the body text anywhere on the page. If you  start the selection with the lowercase letter “a,” the character code displays as 97. If you select no text, the result is NaN.  Try entering numeric values in the three fields at the bottom of the page. Values below 32 are ASCII control characters that most fonts represent as hollow squares. But try all other values to see what you get. Notice that the script passes all three values as a group to the String.fromCharCode   method, and the result is a com- bined string. Thus, Figure 16-1 shows what happens when you enter the uppercase ASCII values for a three-letter animal name.  stringObject.charCodeAt     4855-7 ch16.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 472  472 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  Listing 34-2: Character Conversions       Character Codes    var isNav =  navigator.appName == “Netscape”  var isNav4 =  isNav && parseInt navigator.appVersion == 4   function showCharCode   {  var theText = document.getSelection    var theText = document.selection.createRange  .text  if  isNav  {  } else {  } if  theText  {  } else {  }  } function showString form  {  form.result.value =  document.forms[0].charCodeDisplay.value = theText.charCodeAt                document.forms[0].charCodeDisplay.value = “ “  String.fromCharCode form.entry1.value,form.entry2.value,form.entry3.value  } if  isNav4  {  document.captureEvents Event.MOUSEUP   } document.onmouseup = showCharCode        Capturing Character Codes    Select any of this text, and see the character code of the first character.

Two fields occur for data entry: the first is for the long string to be examined by the method; the second is for a regular expres- sion. Some default values are provided in case you’re not yet familiar with the syn- tax of regular expressions  see Chapter 38 of the JavaScript Bible . A check box lets you specify whether the search through the string for matches should be case- sensitive. After you click the “Execute match   ” button, the script creates a regular expression object out of your input, performs the string.match   method on the big string, and reports two kinds of results to the page. The primary result is a string version of the array returned by the method; the other is a count of items returned.  stringObject.match     4855-7 ch16.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 475  Chapter 16 ✦ String and Number Objects  Chapters 34 and 35   475  Listing 34-3: Regular Expression Match Workshop       Regular Expression Match    function doMatch form  {  var str = form.entry.value var delim =  form.caseSens.checked  ? “ g” : “ gi” var regexp = eval “ ” + form.regexp.value + delim  var resultArray = str.match regexp  if  resultArray  {  form.result.value = resultArray.toString   form.count.value = resultArray.length  } else {  }  form.result.value = “ ” form.count.value = “”  }        String Match with Regular Expressions      Enter a main string:<INPUT TYPE=”text” NAME=”entry” SIZE=60  VALUE=”Many a maN and womAN have meant to visit GerMAny.”>   Enter a regular expression to match:<INPUT TYPE=”text” NAME=”regexp” SIZE=25  VALUE=”\wa\w”>   Case-sensitive       Result:   Count:          The default value for the main string has unusual capitalization intentionally. The capitalization lets you see more clearly where some of the matches come from. For example, the default regular expression looks for any three-character string that has the letter “a” in the middle. Six string segments match that expression. With the help of capitalization, you can see where each of the four strings containing “man” are extracted from the main string. The following table lists some other regular expressions to try with the default main string.  stringObject.match     4855-7 ch16.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 476  476 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  RegExp  man man\b \bman me*an .a.  \sa\s z  Description  Both case-sensitive and not  Where “man” is at the end of a word  Where “man” is at the start of a word  Where zero or more “e” letters occur between “m” and “a”  Where “a” is surrounded by any one character  including space   Where “a” is surrounded by a space on both sides  Where a “z” occurs  none in the default string   In the scripts for Listing 34-3, if the string.match   method returns null, you  are informed politely, and the count field is emptied.  string.replace regExpression, replaceString   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  The page in Listing 34-4 lets you practice with the string.replace   and  string.search   methods and regular expressions in a friendly environment. The source text is a five-line excerpt from Hamlet. You can enter the regular expression to search for, and the replacement text as well. Note that the script completes the job of creating the regular expression object, so that you can focus on the other special characters used to define the matching string. All replacement activities act globally, because the g parameter is automatically appended to any expression you enter.  Default values in the fields replace the contraction ‘tis with “it is” after you click the “Execute replace   ” button  see Figure 16-2 . Notice that the backslash charac- ter in front of the apostrophe of ‘tis  in the string assembled in mainString  makes the apostophe a non-word boundary, and thus allows the \B’t regular expression to find a match there. As described in the section on the string.search   method, the button connected to that method returns the offset character number of the matching string  or -1 if no match occurs .  stringObject.replace     4855-7 ch16.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 477  Chapter 16 ✦ String and Number Objects  Chapters 34 and 35   477  Figure 16-2: Using the default replacement regular expression  You could modify the listing so that it actually replaces text in the HTML para- graph for IE4+ and NN6.

Once the data is inside an array, your scripts can then per- form quick and easy lookups, based on for loops through numerically indexed arrays, or via instant searching with the help of string indexes  à la Java hash tables .  As the examples in this chapter demonstrate, the  JavaScript array object features numerous methods to facili- tate managing the data inside an array. It also helps that JavaScript is loose enough to allow arrays to grow or shrink as their data requires.  Perhaps the two most important features of JavaScript arrays to have in your hip pocket are converting arrays to delimited string objects and sorting. Conversion to strings is important when you wish to transport data from an array to another venue that passes only strings, such as passing data to another page via the URL search string. At the receiving end, a script converts the search string to an array through the inverse operation provided by the string.split   method.  JavaScript’s array sorting feature is remarkably powerful and  flexible. Even if the array consists of objects, you can sort the array based on values assigned to properties of those objects.  Examples Highlights  ✦ Convert an array into a delimited string via the code  shown in Listing 37-7.  ✦ To flip the order of an array without resorting to sorting,  see Example 37-8 for the array.reverse   method.  ✦ Listing 37-9 demonstrates a few important aspects of the  array.sort   method. In addition to the traditional alphabetical sorting, one of the sorting functions oper- ates on the length property of the string object stored in each entry of the array. Powerful stuff with very little code.   4855-7 ch17.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 488  488 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  ✦ Walk through the steps for the array.splice   method to observe how  JavaScript in NN4+ and IE5.5+ can replace entries inside an array. One exam- ple replaces three items with one, indicating that you are not bound to main- taining the same array length.  Array Object Methods array.concat array2   NN2  NN3  NN4  NN6  IE3 J1  IE3 J2  IE4  IE5  IE5.5  Compatibility   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   Example  Listing 37-6 is a bit complex, but it demonstrates both how arrays can be joined with the array.concat   method and how values and objects in the source arrays do or do not propagate based on their data type. The page is shown in Figure 17-1.  Figure 17-1: Object references remain “alive” in a concatenated array.  After you load the page, you see readouts of three arrays. The first array consists of all string values; the second array has two string values and a reference to a form  array.concat     4855-7 ch17.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 489  Chapter 17 ✦ The Array Object  Chapter 37   489  object on the page  a textbox named “original” in the HTML . In the initialization routine of this page, not only are the two source arrays created, but they are joined with the array.concat   method, and the result is shown in the third box. To show the contents of these arrays in columns, I use the array.join   method, which brings the elements of an array together as a string delimited in this case by a return character — giving us an instant column of data.  Two series of fields and buttons let you experiment with the way values and  object references are linked across concatenated arrays. In the first group, if you enter a new value to be assigned to arrayThree[0], the new value replaces the string value in the combined array. Because regular values do not maintain a link back to the original array, only the entry in the combined array is changed. A call to showArrays   proves that only the third array is affected by the change.  More complex is the object relationship for this demonstration. A reference to the  first text box of the second grouping has been assigned to the third entry of arrayTwo. After concatenation, the same reference is now in the last entry of the combined array. If you enter a new value for a property of the object in the last slot of arrayThree, the change goes all the way back to the original object — the first text box in the lower grouping. Thus, the text of the original field changes in response to the change of arrayThree[5]. And because all references to that object yield the same result, the reference in arrayTwo[2] points to the same text object, yielding the same new answer. The display of the array contents doesn’t change, because both arrays still contain a reference to the same object  and the VALUE attribute showing in the   tag of the column listings refers to the default value of the tag, not to its cur- rent algorithmically retrievable value shown in the last two fields of the page .

Begin by creating an array with a sequence of numbers: a = new Array 1,2,3,4,5   Next, remove the center three items, and replace them with one string item: a.splice 1, 3, “two three four”   The Results box shows a string version of the three-item array returned by the  method. To view the current contents of the array, enter a into the top text box.  To put the original numbers back into the array, swap the string item with three  numeric items: a.splice 1, 1, 2, 3, 4  The method returns the single string, and the a array now has five items in it again.  ✦  ✦  ✦  array.splice     4855-7 ch17.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 496     A P P E N D I X  ✦  ✦  ✦  ✦  4855-7 app.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 497  What’s on the CD-ROM The accompanying Windows–Macintosh CD-ROM contains  a complete set of HTML document listings and an elec-  tronic version of this book, plus additional listings and the full text of the JavaScript Bible, Gold Edition. You also receive Adobe Acrobat Reader software to view and search the elec- tronic versions of the books.  System Requirements  To derive the most benefit from the example listings, you  should have both Netscape Navigator 6  or later  and Internet Explorer 5  or later  installed on your computer. While many scripts run in both browsers, several scripts demonstrate fea- tures that are available on only one browser or the other. To write scripts, you can use a simple text editor, word proces- sor, or dedicated HTML editor.  To use the Adobe Acrobat Reader, you need the following: ✦ For Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0  with  SP3 or later , you should be using a 486 or Pentium com- puter with 16MB of RAM and 10MB of hard disk space.  ✦ Macintosh users require a PowerPC, System 7.1,2 or  later, at least 8MB of RAM, and 8MB of disk space.  Disc Contents  Platform-specific software is located in the appropriate  Windows and Macintosh directories on the CD-ROM. The con- tents include the following items. JavaScript listings for Windows and Macintosh text editors  Almost all example listings from this book and the  JavaScript Bible, Gold Edition are on the CD-ROM in the form of complete HTML files, which you can load into a browser to see the language item in operation  a few others are plain text   4855-7 app.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 498  498 JavaScript Examples Bible: The Essential Companion to JavaScript Bible  files, which you can view in your browser or text editor . A directory called Listings contains the example files, with nested folders named for each chapter of the JavaScript Bible. Each HTML file’s name is keyed to the Listing number in the book. For example, the file for Listing 15-1 is named lst15-01.htm. Note that the first part of each listing number is keyed to a JavaScript Bible chapter number. Thus, Listing 15-1 demonstrates a term discussed in Chapter 15 of the JavaScript Bible  both editions , although the printed listing and discussion about the listing appears in Chapter 1 of this book because Chapter 1 contains examples for JavaScript Bible Chapter 15.  For your convenience, an index.html file in the Listings folder provides a front-  end table of contents to the HTML files for the book’s program listings. Open that file from your browser whenever you want to access the program listing files. If you intend to access that index page frequently, you can bookmark it in your browser s . Using the index file to access the listing files can be very important in some cases, because several individual files must be opened within their associated framesets to work properly. Accessing the files through the index.html file assures that you open the frameset. The index.html file also shows browser compatibility ratings for all the listings. This saves you time from opening listings that are not intended to run on your browser. To examine and modify the HTML source files, open them from your favorite text editor program  for Windows editors, be sure to specify the .htm file extension in the Open File dialog box .  You can open all example files directly from the CD-ROM, but if you copy them to your hard drive, access is faster and you will be able to experiment with modifying the files more readily. Copy the folder named Listings from the CD-ROM to any loca- tion on your hard drive. Electronic versions of the books  These are complete, searchable versions of both this book and the JavaScript Bible, Gold Edition, provided in Adobe Acrobat .pdf format. The Acrobat text for this book is in the folder named JSExamples PDF, while the JavaScript Bible text is in the JSBGold PDF folder.  Adobe Acrobat Reader  The Adobe Acrobat Reader is a helpful program that enables you to view the entire contents of both this book and the JavaScript Bible, Gold Edition, which are in .pdf for- mat on the CD-ROM. To install and run Adobe Acrobat Reader, follow these steps: For Windows  1. Start Windows Explorer or Windows NT Explorer and then open the Acrobat  folder on the CD-ROM.  2. In the Acrobat folder, double-click the rs405eng.exe icon and follow the instructions presented on-screen for installing Adobe Acrobat Reader.  For Macintosh  1. Open the Acrobat folder on the CD-ROM. 2. In the Acrobat folder, double-click the Adobe Acrobat Installer icon and follow  the instructions presented on-screen for installing Adobe Acrobat Reader.  ✦  ✦  ✦   4855-7 Index.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 499  Index  A above property, 442–443 accessKey property  compatibility, 3 controlling, 3–4 example, 3–4  action property, 336 activeElement property, 224–225 addBehavior   method  compatibility, 50 example, 50–52 invoking, for each paragraph object, 51 using, 52–53  addEventListener   method  compatibility, 53 example, 53–55  addReadRequest   method, 407 addRule   method, 438–439 Adobe Acrobat Reader, 498 alert   method, 153 alert dialog box, displaying, 153 align property  HR element object, 269–272 IFRAME element object, 198 IMG element object, 318–319 TABLE element object, 382 testing, 318–319  aLink property, 257–258 alinkColor property, 225–227 all property, 5 alt property, 319 anchors  document with, 206–207 names, 207 reading number of, 228 anchors property, 227–228 appCodeName property, 398–401 appendChild   method  compatibility, 55 example, 55–57 use of, 1  appendData   method, 294–296 applets property, 229 applyElement   method  compatibility, 57 example, 57–58 using, 57–58  appMinorVersion property, 402 appName property, 398–401 appVersion property, 398–401 AREA element object  coords property, 331 modifying, on the fly, 332–333 shape property, 331 areas property, 331–334 array object  concat   method, 488–490 examples highlights, 487–488 join   method, 491–492 methods, 488–495 reverse   method, 492–493 sort   method, 493–495 splice   method, 495  arrays, concatenation, 489–490 attachEvent   method  compatibility, 58 example, 58–59  attributes property, 5 availLeft availTop properties, 407 B back   method, 219–221 background property  BODY element object, 258 NN4 layer object, 444–445 TABLE element object, 382  behavior property, 273–275 behaviors  adding, 50–53 turning off, 53 turning on, 51  behaviorUrns property, 6 below property, 442–443 bgColor property  BODY element object, 257–258 document object, 225–227 MARQUEE element object, 275 NN4 layer object, 445–446 TABLE element object, 383  bgProperties property, 258–259 blur   method  compatibility, 59 example, 59–60 text input object, 363   4855-7 Index.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 500  500 Index ✦ B–C  BODY element object  aLink property, 257–258 background property, 258 bgColor property, 257–258 bgProperties property, 258–259 bottomMargin topMargin properties, 259 createTextRange   method, 261–262 doScroll   method, 262 event handlers, 262–263 leftMargin rightMargin properties, 259 link property, 257–258 methods, 261–262 noWrap property, 259 onClick event handler, 81 onMouseDown event handler, 63, 115–117 onScroll event handler, 262–263 onUnload event handler, 377 properties, 257–261 scroll property, 260 scrollLeft scrollTop properties, 260–261 text property, 257–258 vLink property, 257–258  body property, 229 border property  FRAMESET element object, 194 IMG element object, 319 TABLE element object, 383  borderColor property  FRAME element object, 190 FRAMESET element object, 194 TABLE element object, 383–384  borderColorDark borderColorLight properties,  383–384  bottomMargin topMargin properties, 259 bottom top properties, 315–316 bound data  filtering, 18–20 sorting, 18–20  boundingHeight boundingWidth properties, 297–299 boundingLeft boundingRight properties, 297–299 browsers  functions to examine, 399–401 reading and writing preferences, 405–406  BUTTON element object click   method, 345 event handlers, 346 form property, 344–345 methods, 345 name property, 345 onClick event handler, 346 properties, 344–345 value property, 345  C canHaveChildren property  compatibility, 6 example, 6–7 reading, 6–7  canHaveHTML property, 8 caption property, 384 captureEvents   method  document object, 243 window object, 154–155  Cascading Style Sheets  CSS , 265 CD-ROM  Adobe Acrobat Reader, 498 contents, 497–498 electronic versions of books, 498 JavaScript listings for text editors, 497–498 system requirements, 497 cellIndex property, 392–393 cellPadding property, 384–385 cells property  TABLE element object, 385 TR element object, 391  cellSpacing property, 384–385 CGI submission action, adjusting, 349 character conversions, 472–473 characterSet property, 230 charCode property, 423–424 charset property, 229–230 checkbox input object  checked property, 347 defaultChecked property, 348 event handlers, 349–352 onClick event handler, 349–352 properties, 347–349 value property, 348–349  checked property  as a conditional, 347 checkbox input object, 347 radio input object, 352–353  child nodes  collecting, 9–10 hierarchy, inspecting, 8  childNodes property  compatibility, 8 example, 8–10 importance of, 1 children property compatibility, 10 example, 10–11  className property compatibility, 11 example, 11–12   4855-7 Index.F  6 26 01  8:37 AM  Page 501  Index ✦ C  501  clientInformation object.

Some Macintosh program files require  MacOS 8.6 or later, but program listing text files can be opened with any MacOS ver- sion. For Windows, access the software with My Computer or Windows Explorer. Macintosh users can access files by using the Finder.  You can open all of the example file listings directly from the CD-ROM, but access will be faster — and you will be able to experiment with modifying the files more readily — if you copy the listings to your hard drive. Copy the folder named Listings from the CD-ROM to any location on your hard drive.  To open the listing scripts on this CD-ROM, you should have a copy of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5  or later , Netscape Navigator 6  or later , or both browsers installed on your computer.  To run the listing scripts from your browser, open the file named index.html in the Listings folder. This page provides a table of contents consisting of direct links to the listings, showing which browsers are compatible with each listing.   Access the Adobe Acrobat  PDF  files for the book’s contents from the CD-ROM. Be sure to install the index files into your copy of Acrobat to take advantage of full-text search.  For more details on installing and running the CD-ROM contents, see the Appendix.
